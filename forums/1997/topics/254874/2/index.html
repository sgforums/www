But it does not matter that there are millions of spermatozoa in the testis, only one can fertilize an egg. What are chances that a mutation that confers a survival advantage is present in that particlar spermatozoa?<br><br>The human female releases only one egg each month, and once pregnant, is rendered anovulatory until the cessation of lactation. In a life time, how many offspring can she bear? Not many. If she indeed gives birth to a child who carries a 'good' mutation, what are the chances that she can give birth another child with this survival advantage? Not likely....given that in her reproductive life she is unlikely to bear more than 20 children.<br><br>The female is the limiting factor. The male can impregnante numerous females almost throughout his life after puberty. The number of offspring possible is limited by the finite number of eggs his mate possesses.<br><br>Unlike spermatozoa which are produced continuously through life, the eggs in a female are fixed at birth. If you get pregnant at 40, your eggs are actually 40 years old and that's why pregnancy is less likely with age. It is also true that these eggs acquire mutations with increasing maternal age and that most of these mutations are deleterious...accounting for a higher miscarriage rate with increasing age of the mother.<br><br>If we add to that the cultural norms that limit a man to only one mate and the effect of late marriages and a dropping fertility rate, I think further evolution of man is going to be rather slow.<br><br>There is another issue. For evolution to work, you need genetic variation accorded by mutation etc, but you also need pressure for natural selection. The white moths in England almost disappeared in the Industrial Revolution because all the buildings were black with soot, making it easy for the the white moths to be spotted and eaten by the birds. That's a selection pressure. If a white moth acquires a mutation that turns it darker and given the right selection pressure, it is more likely to survive and passed on its genes. Its white brothers diminish in number and become extinct if the selection pressure is strong enough. This sort of incremental changes build up over long periods of time and perhaps the changes may become big enough to constitute a new species...even genus maybe? That takes longer if the selection pressure is weak and if the reproduction rate is low.<br><br>In human society, we artifically reduce the selection pressure. We bring heating to the house, so those with thin fat layers survive. We use arrows to shoot deer, so even the congenital dwarf is not worse off than the fastest man. The 'weaker' genes get transmitted as well. This is right and to be expected in a humane, civilized society but without this selection pressure, why would there be further evolution? There may be increased diversity, but without natural selection, there's no evolution, is there?<br><br>Darwin thought that adaptation to a changing environment will lead to natural selection and therefore persistence of successful adaptive traits. I believe that happens. But not for man...cos' instead of adapting to a changing environment, we have been adapting our environment to suit us. I would have thought it will be other species that are under tremendous selection pressure imposed by us. Evolution, if it occurs, is going to happen in other species much faster than it will in humans.</div>

Since we have achieve the ability to manipulate our surroundings, we therefore has move beyond the point to evolve physically. I envision a day where the majority of humankind will have psychic powers or great mental capacity.<br><br>Perhaps Man's greatest ability is the power to actually cause evolution on other beings. (quite Godlike eh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) Examples are dogs while descended from wolves but evolved to the point where they are so different in appearance and temperament. Another more recent example would be the Ragdoll cat (info mainly for Starblue) which has been selectively bred for the docile and non-aggresive nature. The Ragdoll would probably have died out if let to their own devices since it is not equipped to survive in the natural world.<br><br>But I don't believe Man is in anyway slowing down in our evolutionary path.

Man merely ACCELERATE evolution. in evolution, there is something called the selection coefficient. say if a bacterium has gene A, it can produce 11 individuals while a bacterium without it can only produce 10 individuals. then gene A is said to have a selection coefficient of 0.1. the higher the coefficient, the faster it will be selected for/against.<br><br>since in artificial selection (where humans decide that the fattest pig or the cow producing the most milk gets to breed) humans alter selection coefficient such that a trait becomes 1-0 (if got trait, reproduce; if no trait, dun get to reproduce at all), evolution is skewed heavily in favor of the trait with coefficient of 1.<br><br>so yah....<br><br>as for the "humans are turning to evolve mentally rather than physically", that is one whole issue for debate and discussion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So Sayeth The Great One  </div></blockquote></div>
