            <div class='col-md body'>wow, too many pages to go through, so here are my thoughts.<br><br>Perhaps, the parents wanted to buy the boy a good watch so that it'll last him. So IMO, a $200-300 watch is not extremely expensive.. provided the boy don't have a watch now. Its different if he already has a few branded/expensive watches already. I also had an expensive watch given to me when I was about 18.. and it lasted me until now.. and I only have 1 watch...</div>
