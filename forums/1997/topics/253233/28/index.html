(we sms each other sometimes see?)<br><br>see, the problem with getting to know a person is, he will no longer be "perfect" in your eyes. his flaws and shortcomings become more and more conspicuous. and crushes, in my opinion, does not tolerate that. true love, of cos, is in an entirely different league. but crushes, hell no.<br><br>as it is, i no longer held a crush for him. but i so look forward to a friendship with him.</div>

But its at least 19 to 21 % in alchohol level. Because some are fortified or fermented with brandy.<br><br>Many ppl want Sweet Sweet red wine without the soury after tase. BUt unfortunately, sweet comes with a slightly more acidic finish. Unless u go for the 1000 dollar ones that has been there for 15 yrs or more now thats a whole new level.If you are talking Fruity sweet , then maybe the shiraz with longer taste but depends what year and by who.GSM's are good too. So its not just a Sweet Red Wine. Most ppl when they want Sweet.. they mean sweet sweet. But in real wine terms , sweet can be fruity , tangy , can be sweet in the pallete but have a longer oaky smokey taste..<br><br>Only the hella cheapo Sweet Wine.. are those added with sugar n has no characteristics whatsoever.</div>
