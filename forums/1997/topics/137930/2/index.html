Tai jian dan le!He's trying to say that he wants to remain good friends with you, but also wants you to know that he treats you as a friend and not anything MORE (i.e. romance). Since you've no such intention either, I think it should be ok for you...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If he's a special fren, wat harm is there to call him. Not calling u does not mean he's still upset with u wrt the watever-incident-which-u-didnt-specify. Maybe he doesnt need to confide in u or maybe he's juz not too comfortable to confide in u.<br><br>If he's THE special guy, i dun see why ladies cant take the 1st step. I know girls like guys to be the one taking the initiative, but guys do have their issues. Some are shy. Some are plain unaware of ur attention n affection. Or some guys, like me, juz couldnt give a damn.<br><br>Anyway, a one-sided r/s isnt gonna work out. Is either u try harder to catch his attention or u juz have to move onto another guy.<br><br>Hey, good luck in handling ur issues..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
