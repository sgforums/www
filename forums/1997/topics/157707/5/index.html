To me.. i think that this 'Probation' may be a ruse.. to make us stay on.. behave like good little doggies in hopes of being mod. Dangling the carrot and inciting an internal struggle between elects in seizing power from each other. Probation will mean the survival of the fittest!To play us like such is is a fate worse  than death itself. While in the real world..we are being hurt.. abused..USED by the female species, giving us false hope in relationhips and a pretense that we may be in love.. to suffer this emotionally, psychologically in reality.. we have to suffer this similar fate VIRTUALLY!?l  PEOPLE !!! IS THIS WHAT U WANT ? Chose me.. n stand behind me and i will bring your problems.. your pain n sorrows to the council! I will liberate your minds.. and exact punishment to those that very well deserve it. Some may say.. why have the evil doers always get away with what they do.. why are the mods unresonable.. or why arent the sinners punished! Chose me~~ n thier days are numbered!
