            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by renorenal:</div><div class="quote_body">Question<br><br>If let's say one day Starblue's Heaven's rating is on a declining route, what will you as a moderator do to help it raise its bar again. Or another way to put it, will you run away and hide or will you keep on staying and pushing to the last? </div></blockquote>First off, we have to justify and pin-point the scope of this forum, is the main purpose of this forum to achieve the status of being with the cream, or it can just have ratings at a moderate level. I will not deny the fact that having a HEAVILY declining rating is not very favorable, but i will also not push the fact that having activity ratings at the TOP of absolute significance, as i believe the<br>utmost importance of the forum is to provide as much as the moderators can do for the people that are actually interested in coming to this forum.<br><br>However, if there is a serious decline in the activity to the point that <strong>the moderators feel there is a need to revive the forum and review our ideology</strong>, i myself, as a moderator, will address the issue by executing the plans that we have come up with when reviewing the ideology behind the forum.<br><br>Basically, i believe that the reason why people leave certain forums are because of how the forum is being run, which is why the moderators are the core to the welfare of forums. Notice that, as Starblue is famous and likeable, many people come here in addition to her well management of the forums. If i were going to create coffeeortea's heaven, i'll probably be the only one posting there, other than people like that fifty cent troll.. or some bout au revoir.. loganathan, or someone posting random stuff basically just to spam.<br><br>Another reason to why there is a decline in forum activity is because of the Events and topics that are being posted. What i mean by events are stickies like, "today in history" or something similar that is interesting and either on a daily basis, or at least active enough to keep people coming back for more. As for topics, you should know =). I still feel the need to stress the importance of the moderator, as they are the ones who will lock threads that are not constructive, spam, or posing a threat/offensive/biased/(insert something here) to the people who visit the forum.<br><br>I definitely will stay, as i have never believed in running away. the only way i feel that we should abandon this forum is if we want to shut it down. Sounds stupid? Therefore, in any situation i believe that as long as there is a will, there is a way. Hope shall prevail.</div>

LMAO.<br><br>find it kinda fun. Much as i would like to be one now i cant be a good mod even if i want to though, i dont really have the time and dedication. chances are, i will be sifting through 50 newest topics, and go to topics that catch my eye within that 15 mins i am in Sgforums. i will however, show interest if there is still space for a Mod when i have the time and dedication to do so ^^</div>

The thing aint gonna budge.. so u gotta take it down with an 8 gauge elephant shotgun.
