Because as you have said, this place is for people who are bored and want to crap and spam, but there has to be some ways to moderate them so as to prevent total chaos.</div>

I came here often just that I seldom post my topics as I'm busying serving in the NS and sometimes, just lacking in some topics. If the chief moderator doesn't understand this, please clarify with me before this interview with all these redundant questions.<br><br>Secondly, I've confessed about my vulgarities and tried hard to make ammendments and repentence. If you can't accept somebody who is willing to change, then I don't see the purpose of working together with someone who is unforgiving.<br><br>Please do not hold it too seriously against me for whatever reason. And also, if I were to be the mod, I'll still do my very best to maintain the forum just as I have maintained my previous forum from some other web sites this year. I may sound defensive here, because truly, you do not understand me.</div>

Because it's mine and it belongs also to my fellow mods. I cannot, as part of the team be discouraged and let them down this way. I will fight side by side with them through it all. As said, I'm a man of my words, my word is my bond. As a man, I'll not run away like a child, but stay firm and hold out this forum to its very end.<br><br>I've learned one thing in my previous jonb as moderator that, somtimes, it's not the ratings that matter first. It's the people being willing to contribute to the interaction in the forum and their strong mind of getting rid of trolls and harressing behaviours in the forum, that will make the forum a better place to be in. Thus, this will give rise to the amount of people logging in and eventually, the rise of its rating.<br><br>Ratings should not be the first priority of this purpose. The main purpose is to create a far better and more enjoyable place to be in, because this is the place for the excruciatingly bored. Bored people cannot stand constant flamings, therefore, trolls and flamers must be abolished.</div>
