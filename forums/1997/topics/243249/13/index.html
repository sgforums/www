If you use a citation programme like Endnote (which I use) you can list it in any style you like. For publication, most journals will dictate the output style. In fact Endnote has loaded the citation styles of most scientific journals in its database, so you only have to select the journal to which you are submitting the paper and the software will do the rest.</div>

Ask not what your company can do for u , but what U can do for ur company. mmm... wait.. sounds familiar.. LOL!<br><br>I understand your situation in client. Pay peanuts n u get monkeys. But how much is the justifiable amount ? In your case , you know , because u are in control of your working environment and in a 1 to 1 basis to ur client. But she is under a company o.
