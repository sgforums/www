              <p>My relatives never really invited my family to any of my cousins' weddings since we moved to the southern part. So now I am wondering why I need to invite them and get myself into debt while doing so.</p>

              <p>For your situation, better to hold a dinner in KL and one in Sg.  Since your pax is in-between (not big not small), use restaurants for both venues.</p>
              <p>I think this is the most cost effective method, rather than shipping your Malaysian relatives over for one night's dinner.</p>
              <p>You do not want to hold a dinner for Malaysian relatives in Sg because the travel arrangements, logistics, accomodation, leisure program and hosting etc. work that you will be obliged to do will kill you!  Even worse if you have a large party.  So just hold it over there where things are still cheaper than in Sg.</p>
              <p>Not to mention if your parents are the controlling sort (and i recall they are), they will make lots of funny requests.  If I were you, I'd just compromise on a budget, let them arrange the KL dinner themselves, and just show up on that day.</p>
              <p>Over in KL you only need a gown (or two) and MUA then turn up at the restaurant.</p>
              <p>To save some money on outfits, at the studio, have a good idea what the overall plan will be before you negotiate a package.   They can rent you the same gown(s) for Sg and KL use, engage MUA for both dinners, etc.  Keep in mind these additions when bargaining.</p>
              <p>To save even more, go the DIY route - friends who are good at makeup can help with it during one of the dinners.  DIY your own corsages, ang pow box, floral arrangements for bridal car, even hand bouquets if you are crafty enough. Save on videographer if a friend has a camcorder.</p>
              <p>As for ang pow being enough to cover dinner cost, it simply boils down to how wealthy your guests and relatives are, vs how extravagant your dinner is.  If you have many rich friends and relatives, there is good chance of breaking even.  That's reality for you!</p>
              <p>Even though it is supposed to be YOUR day, let's face it, marriage is also about family, and you have to accomodate others not only your wishes.  Give and take on some matters so that both your new beginnings in a new family is a happy one - this is small price to pay now for a smooth, long journey.</p>

              <p>Thanks so much for the detailed advice.</p>
              <p>Yes, my parents are the picky sort. You don't really know what they are thinking actually. It is like, they might say ok to something then kick up a fuss later when everything has been planned. I will talk to them tonight and see what I can come up with.</p>
              <p>Dinner probably won't be extravagant...if can settle everything around 20k then I happy liaoz...I will see if the bridal boutique can lend me the gowns for a longer duration of time so that I can use it for both events. But dunno whether the MUA wants to travel all the way down to KL or not...</p>
