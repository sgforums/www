              <p>So ROM is over, hence the next step is to start looking towards the wedding banquet or the "Actual Day" as it is normally called. We have tentatively set it to be held sometime next year around September. So far I have done a bit of looking around and some of you here might be able to help me a bit so here it goes:</p>
              <p>a) The venue for the banquet.</p>
              <p>Due to financial constraint, we have decided to host around 20 tables in Singapore and maybe another 10 tables for my relatives in KL. So for the tables in Singapore, we have a budget of around 400 to 500 per table and prefer it to be located somewhere which is easily accessible by our guests. So far my snooping around has given me one choice which is River City Restaurant in Excelsior Hotel. Would like to know if anyone has held their banquet there before? Or any suggestion for an alternative venue?</p>
              <p>b) The bridal studio</p>
              <p>Most probably engaging some studios in Malaysia to do it for us as it is cheaper compared to the Singapore counterparts. Any suggestion as to which bridal studio which is not too expensive yet good at what they are doing?</p>
              <p>c) Photography on Actual Day</p>
              <p>Any idea of which photographer would be able to take pictures on the Actual Day from the moment I leave my house (in JB) till the wedding dinner? How much is the charges? If not convenient to note it here, you can PM me <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Thanks for your help!</p>

              <p>For me I support your idea, but when it comes to wedding dinner, all couples only have this once to enjoy in their lifetime, so it is not stupid to have it, afterall its a once in a lifetime experience, unless u are like my classmate the loser who have no gf and bought a pack of condoms in his bag and say its for standby...</p>

              <p>Yea my grandma is already very old...definitely not convenient for her to travel around...</p>
              <p>I find it very hard to satisfy everyone...I want to have it in both places, but I have the cost to consider...because it is not just about having the dinner there. Need to think about the transportation there (for me, hubby, my parents and his parents) and also the accomodation for at least 2 nights, plus the make-up and photography. But if I stubbornly want to do it just in Singapore, they might find me inconsiderate...sigh.</p>
