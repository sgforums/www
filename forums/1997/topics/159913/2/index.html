There was a Chinese test with MCQ answers...a guy in front was throwing dice and writing down his answers (he accepted figures of 1-4, 5-6 means to re-throw). The teacher saw what he was doing but didn't say anything. After a while, he closed his eyes and slept. About 15 minutes before the end, the teacher warned us that we had 15 mins more.
