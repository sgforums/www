            <div class='col-md body'>The English language often got the better of my German grandfather, a pastor. During one service, he announced that two members of his flock were getting married.<br>"You are all invited to the wedding," he told the congregation. "And also to the parish hall afterward for the conception."<br><br>____________________________________________________________<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sunshine Magazine </span>reported that the date of the church picnic in Clarkston, Michigan, was firm: Thursday afternoon. But there was a caveat. "If it rains in the afternoon, the picnic will be held in the morning."<br><br>____________________________________________________________<br><br>"Ow!" I yelled. My hand had been stuck with a piece of wood from a wicker laundry basket. "I got a splinter under my fingernail," I called to my husband in the next room. Ever the wise guy, he yelled back, "What were you doing, scratching your head?"<br><br>____________________________________________________________<br><br>You can't become a dentist without practicing on real teeth. So in dental school, we used actual human skulls. After going through a stock of them, we placed an order for more with our supplier in India. Knowing the urgency, he confirmed the order by replying, "Will execute immediately."<br></div>
