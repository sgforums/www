These are all due to signs of muscle tension. It is best to relax when you know these signs are coming. I've mentioned about the breathing method earlier on.<br><br>You may also consider a warm bath or go for a gentle massage. If at work, try taking a break or going for a walk. If you lead a stressful life, try to make time for regular relaxation breaks, such as yoga or swimming. This is to prevent the build-up of tension.<br><br>Time management techniques and careful planning can also help you to avoid stressful situations. Don't be so tied up with your schedules of your daily routine life and you will find your tension headache relieved much faster...<br><br>These have been explained earlier on...</div>

Using a heating pad or hot water bottle may also be effective over the site of pain.<br><br>You may also try walking or exercising regularly (pelvic rocking exercise - which strengthens the abdominal and back muscles) and follow a diet rich in complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, but low in salt, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine.<br><br>Other proven methods include relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.
