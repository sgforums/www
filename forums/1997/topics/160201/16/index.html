These are produced by the body and found in the uterine lining (also present in gastric mucosa).<br><br>When the lining (the endometrial wall) starts to shed with menstruation, they follow suit and get released. They then cause the uterus (muscular layers responding to prostaglandins) to contract forcefully, which is the reason for much of the cramping itself.<br><br>The prostaglandins also cause vasodilatation. The blood vessels expand, so the blood gets pooled up and remain stationary instead of circulating. This leads to pelvic congestion (blood pooling in the pelvis) and this itself causes discomfort and heaviness.<br><br>It may also cause a decline in the blood pressure and therefore, <strong>the reason you feel cold, clammy and lightheaded is because of diversion of the blood. </strong><br><br>In some women, it also causes contraction and spasm of the smooth muscle of the gastro-intestinal tract. This leads to nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</div>

When tissues are damaged, white blood cells flood to the site to try to minimize tissue destruction. Prostaglandins are produced as a result.<br><br>Blood clots form when a blood vessel is damaged. A type of prostaglandin called thromboxane stimulates constriction and clotting of platelets. Conversely, PGI2, is produced to have the opposite effect on the walls of blood vessels where clots should not be forming.<br><br><strong>Certain prostaglandins are involved with the induction of labor and other reproductive processes. PGE2 causes uterine contractions and has been used to induce labor. </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Prostaglandins are involved in several other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract (inhibit acid synthesis and increase secretion of protective mucus), increase blood flow in kidneys, and leukotriens promote constriction of bronchi associated with asthma. </span><br><br>The one highlighted in italic form explains why NSAIDs causes gastritis...</div>
