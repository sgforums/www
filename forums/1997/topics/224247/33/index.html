Actually i do believe about the heat.. just that how fast it collapsed .. and the manner it collapsed.

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, if the WTC attacks had been a government conspiracy as well, they would have easily loaded the cargo holds of the aircraft with high explosives to further guarantee that the buildings would collapse. As it is, the buildings actually had a fair chance of standing up - it was only because that there was enough combustible fuel to melt the steel reinforcements that the buildings collapsed.<br><br>Believe it or not, the WTC was actually designed to be able to take the impact of a crashing jumbo jet. However, the architects and engineers didn't really consider the impact that burning jet fuel can have.<br><br>Steel reinforcement being able to take up to 200 deg Celsius? I don't think so. As far as I can tell, steel melts at temperatures between 1500 - 2000 degrees, depending on the alloy composition. And it doesn't even need to melt in this case - all that is required is for the steel to weaken (steel starts to lose its strength at around 700 deg, if I recall correctly). And in addition, as I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a stretch to see that high temperatures of over 2000 deg can be reached in the immediate vicinity of the crash.<br><br>And also, it would have been more likely for them to want to INCREASE collateral damage had it been a government conspiracy. This would then further increase world sympathy towards them and make the justification for the War on Terror far easier. And it's not like there was no collateral damage at all - 7 World Trade Center collapsed a little while later from the seismic shock of the collapse of the Twin Towers.<br><br>Besides, to assume that the US government would want to strike the economic heart of America and potentially bring the American economy down on its knees just to justify a war on terrorists doesn't make sense. For the US to want to go after the terrorists, they would have to have the resources to do so - and resources can only come with a strong economy.<br><br>It's just like how it makes no sense that Roosevelt allowed the Pearl Harbor attack to occur in 1941 to justify a war with the Japs. It just doesn't add up that he would want to risk America's greatest weapon against the Japanese - the US Pacific Fleet - in order to go after them.</div>
