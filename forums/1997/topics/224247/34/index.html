But some say she was a middle man for the russians during our purchase of 2 submarines. Facts from the opposition party said that money or middle-man money was given but transferred back to our Deputy P.M. Anyways, she was blown up with Grenades n C-4. Military grade C-4 which can only be aquired through the military.. and the suspects were Bukit Aman's own Special task force , and also the personal bodyguards of our Deputy. And of course lots of paper trail leading to the events. I am gonna see how its gonna end up. Confirm the politcal analyst whats his name again.. gonna take the hit.. n after a few years.. come out again.. but a millionaire.. ! Malaysia BOLEH!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fudgester:</div><div class="quote_body">By the way, if the WTC attacks had been a government conspiracy as well, they would have easily loaded the cargo holds of the aircraft with high explosives to further guarantee that the buildings would collapse. As it is, the buildings actually had a fair chance of standing up - it was only because that there was enough combustible fuel to melt the steel reinforcements that the buildings collapsed.<br><br>Believe it or not, the WTC was actually designed to be able to take the impact of a crashing jumbo jet. However, the architects and engineers didn't really consider the impact that burning jet fuel can have.<br><br>Steel reinforcement being able to take up to 200 deg Celsius? I don't think so. As far as I can tell, steel melts at temperatures between 1500 - 2000 degrees, depending on the alloy composition. And it doesn't even need to melt in this case - all that is required is for the steel to weaken (steel starts to lose its strength at around 700 deg, if I recall correctly). And in addition, as I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a stretch to see that high temperatures of over 2000 deg can be reached in the immediate vicinity of the crash.<br><br>And also, it would have been more likely for them to want to INCREASE collateral damage had it been a government conspiracy. This would then further increase world sympathy towards them and make the justification for the War on Terror far easier. And it's not like there was no collateral damage at all - 7 World Trade Center collapsed a little while later from the seismic shock of the collapse of the Twin Towers.<br><br>Besides, to assume that the US government would want to strike the economic heart of America and potentially bring the American economy down on its knees just to justify a war on terrorists doesn't make sense. For the US to want to go after the terrorists, they would have to have the resources to do so - and resources can only come with a strong economy.<br><br>It's just like how it makes no sense that Roosevelt allowed the Pearl Harbor attack to occur in 1941 to justify a war with the Japs. It just doesn't add up that he would want to risk America's greatest weapon against the Japanese - the US Pacific Fleet - in order to go after them.</div></blockquote>lets see... Twin Towers housed the FBI , CIA , NSA  and IRS.. which has about 4000 cases to be reviewed. mmm...<br><br>I agree with the technicalities and structural anaylisis of how the WTC fell , but still there are some areas like how could they not have designed it to withstand jetfuel from a boeing ? If u design a structure to withstand a jumbo jet ramming into it.. dun u factor in factors like FUEL.. the most probable thing that will cause fire which will cause structural weakening on the building ? HENCE..designing it more fireproof.. More reinforced... But nope. he he.. unless they kopi on the materials like over here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The data lost.. was LOST forever.. that was what the IRS said. It was moved there that day to be reviewed n re-sorted.<br><br>tacoma Narrows bridge was like build during the 1940's , and by then technology and through that incident would have had the engineers be more aware of situations like this. Like all engineering, design engineers try to think of any posibilities.. except when a meteor crashes unto the building. Even if steel build at 1970 they should know the melting point of the steels. Then they should've doubled it. But in the end of the day.. its all about $$$...<br><br>so when it comes to WTC.. 11/9  its all about the $$$. lots of money lost/ or saved during that attack on the building too.<br><br>we are told to expect any contingency possible,, but normally we bypass them n skip them due to financial reasons. true or not.. u tell me.~ Its all about..  the $$.<br><br></div>
