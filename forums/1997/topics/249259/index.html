I just wanna say this.<br><br>I know several people that work through their poly, uni years to pay for their own fees and expenditure. I know how hard it was, I had seen it, as well as seen several going through it. I myself am lucky not to have gone through it, although I do work for my own pocket money.<br><br>What I can tell u is these people who gone through all this are very responsible, very streetwise, and are tough chicks and guys (Couldn't think of a word to replace guy). They know how about planning, about how to care for themselves.<br><br>Of the handful of 5-6 friends I can recall who work through their schooling years, all of them, in their career, are now some senior people or on the career path towards some senior position.<br><br>I strongly believe they got to where they are due to their experiences and strong character forged during their student working years.<br><br>I believe you can be one of them too. BUT, u may be caught in a fork path now judging from ur 1st post. Blaming ur family, looking down on urself and general self pity will lead u down a spiral path down down down into quicksand. This is one way u would not wish to go to. It's good to know how u fair, how ur family fair when compared to others. This is realism. However, u'll have to get out of it and let you experiences, streetwise-ness, people handling, and strong character shine.<br><br>Else nothing can save u.<br><br>$0.02<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something to ponder, what if an individual had a good life initially, relatively wealthy family and all, then suffered a huge financial crisis, had to work and study at the same time, and then circumstances improved dramatically back to pre-crisis days, then he or she suddenly feels that maybe they deserve to live a good life after 7-8 years of trying to get by..<br><br>Ponder that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

As a person who is having her higher education to think this way is even harder to comprehend. You gotta get a grip, remember that life is not always fair. Take difficulties as a teacher giving you a lesson in life. Why compare with others? you are your own master, you have the power to choose light or darkness. Consider yourself lucky that you still have the freedom and means to do so, that's your good health and fountain of smart.<br><br>So what if people have bigger house, more money, bigger car or high paying jobs, that doesn't mean their life is as challenging or fulfilling as yours. Seems like you're suffering from low self-esteem. It's time to focus on your strengths and not your weaknesses. I can give you my sympathy, but it won't get you anywhere.<br><br>Work on your self esteem, if not even if you got your degree, you will still feel inferior to others. Hope in times to come, you can look back with sweetness and not anger.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
