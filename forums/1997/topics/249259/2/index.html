As a person who is having her higher education to think this way is even harder to comprehend. You gotta get a grip, remember that life is not always fair.

Consider yourself lucky that you still have the freedom and means to do so, that's your good health and fountain of smart.<br><br>So what if people have bigger house, more money, bigger car or high paying jobs, that doesn't mean their life is as challenging or fulfilling as yours. Seems like you're suffering from low self-esteem. It's time to focus on your strengths and not your weaknesses. I can give you my sympathy, but it won't get you anywhere.<br><br>Work on your self esteem, if not even if you got your degree, you will still feel inferior to others.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi SB,<br><br>I can't say that I can totally empathise with your situation, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that my experience comes close. Back during the time period Sec 3 - JC2, my family was having serious financial difficulties. Simply put, my dad quit his regular job to go into some business which didn't do all that well.<br><br>You should have seen how stick-thin I was at that time. Where I'm 61kg now, I was a much lighter 46kg (in Sec 4) and 53kg (in JC2), and my height hasn't changed by much. I often had to make the choice between buying food and buying lecture notes. Guess which one I bought.<br><br>And on top of that, my dad could actually accuse my mom of intentionally forbidding me from eating. And he would constantly jeer at me and look down on me for being 'slow and stupid'. Never mind that I was slogging through school while he was lazing in front of the TV half the time.<br><br>And yeah.... I don't think I really want to go into how he would bully me every I <span style="font-style: italic;">got</span> bullied... lots of bad memories. According to his twisted point of view, I got bullied because I was weak - and he was not proud of having such a weakling for a son.<br><br>In the end, it affected me very badly - physically and psychologically. I had at times considered giving up and quitting school. But what stopped me from doing that was the notion that if I did that, he would win. And I had to have faith that things would get better.<br><br>And luckily for me, things did get better. He finally woke up his bloody ideas and found a regular job. And he started to go easy on me - though at times, he would go back to his old self and try to put me down. And I entered the army - where I actually ate much better than at home. I gained weight during BMT in fact.<br><br>I won't lie and say that things are perfect for me now - I've had to take out 100% loans from Mendaki and DBS to finance my tuition fees, and I've had to give tuition to my cousins for my pocket money. But on the bright side of things, it is still far preferable to the past.<br><br>About your dad's loans.... what I can say is this. If there's one thing that I've learnt from this current semester, it would be this:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Do NOT let irresponsible people make you feel responsible for their actions.</strong></span><br><br>It's high time for you to put your foot down and make it clear to him that his debts are his responsibilities and not yours. Go and get the rest of your family and present this unified stand to him. The only debts that you should clear are your study loans, which (as I can understand), are pretty substantial already.<br><br>As a final word, remember that even parents can be wrong, and it would be up to you to help them see the error of their mistakes. On my part, the only truly slow and stupid thing I ever did in my life was to actually believe my dad when he said that I was slow and stupid. It just took me a long time to realise that.<br><br>So now perhaps it's time to get your dad to realise that.<br><br>God bless and good luck.</div>

Must remember that your friends might have the riches but you have the resilience. You have the chance to learn and know how tough you're. Your friends don't even understand what the word surviving means. Take away their supports they might panic like a frighten chichen. I am not afraid to say that for what you had gone through, you have more inner strength than them. This are something money cannot buy.<br><br>Learn to accept your situation mah, as no matter how you rant, you know that things will not change right? Must well focus on how to make things better for yourself. If your friend felt uncomfortable coming to your house, it just show that what kind of person they are, ignorant freak or princess snobbish. True friend will accept who you 're even if you live in a cave.<br><br>Take heart that you're not the only one who is paying through your own education. I am sure in your mind you hope to have a better life and future right? then something gotta give, that is to sacrifice first, the fruit you taste next time will be much sweeter.<br><br>In the meantime, try to get supports from friends in campus, outside campus, church memebers or anywhere else you can think of. Talk and share your problems with them, you feel much better. Fyi, even rich people also worry about money.<br><br>.....As for your family, i can understand, i myself grew up in a house of misery. Many times i moved out, but realised that the problems were still with me. Running away from problems is not the anwser. The only way is to deal with it directly. It seems like your dad is very stubbon, soft approach won't do him any good. The more you try to reason or discuss with him he will feel more needed and thought you all are panderig to him. Take away this privilege, it's time to crack your whip!! Do the hard way, ignore him totally, put him in cold storage, let him do whatever he want until he got into deep trouble and come begging for help. Maybe can get someone from church to counsel him.<br><br>remember that your dad's problem is also your problem as long as he is alive.</div>
