Some dreams will require sacrifices. Some dreams will require process steps to achieve it bit by bit in order to reach ur primary goal or objective. If u have the will power.. u will do it. Along the way u will recieve alot of hardship from aroud u or perhaps even within you too. To achieve greatness is never easy. The balance in gaining n losing is the way of life. So also becareful what u dream for..sometimes, certain dreams can never suit a person.. its like running against the wall. SO hopefully by experience n as time goes by.. u will grow wise in your decisions.</div>
