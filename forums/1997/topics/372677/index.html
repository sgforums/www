              <p>1. How to fight aging</p>
              <p><br>Did you know that just walking for 30 minutes, 3 or 4 times a<br>week is enough to combat aging?</p>
              <p><br>According to researchers at the University of California, one of<br>the principle causes of deterioration of the human organism’s physical<br>faculties is its diminished ability to metabolize glucose. And they<br>showed that even leisurely exercise, like taking a walk, plays an<br>important role in keeping glucose metabolism functioning smoothly.</p>
              <p><br>Do you spend the whole day sitting at your desk or in front of a<br>computer screen? Why not get up occasionally and do a few minutes<br>of physical exercise? Don’t worry about what other people think.</p>
              <p><br>In some Japanese companies, it is even become a collective<br>habit. Every twenty minutes a bell sounds, and everybody gets up to<br>do some stretching exercises, after which they sit down again as if<br>nothing had happened. Japanese managers are convinced that their<br>employees are more productive when they are relaxed.</p>

              <p>2. Are you anxious?</p>
              <p><br>Is worrying one of your characteristics? Well, stop! It is okay to<br>worry, but at the right time.</p>
              <p><br>Psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania tell patients who<br>suffer from anxiety to regularly do a daily twenty minute “worry<br>session,” always at the same time and in the same place. Collect your<br>head full of worries during the day (don’t suppress them!) and then<br>pour them out during your daily worry session.</p>
              <p><br>Exaggerate your worries to the point of absurdity - knit your<br>brows, make faces, let the sweat flow, shake and cower as much as<br>you like. In other words, make a caricature of the part of yourself that<br>is always worried, and in so doing exorcise it.</p>
              <p><br>Eliminating worry will help prevent numerous psychosomatic<br>illnesses, which result from living in a state of permanent anxiety.</p>

              <p>4. How to avoid cancer</p>
              <p><br>caused by smoking<br>If you smoke, you can greatly reduce the risk of contracting<br>cancer by drinking carrot juice. This according to the German Doctor<br>Hans Nieper, founder of Eumatabolic Medicine, a new alternative<br>mode of treatment which has become very popular in Germany. The<br>carotene found especially in carrots prevents and can even cure<br>cancer.</p>
              <p><br>Dr. Nieper states, “If you smoke 60 cigarettes a day but drink 4<br>glasses of carrot juice, you will still be less prone to contract cancer<br>than someone who doesn’t smoke but who doesn’t drink carrot juice.”<br>Of course, if you don’t smoke and do drink carrot juice all the better!</p>

              <p>5. Avoid eye problems</p>
              <p><br>caused by T.V. and monitors</p>
              <p><br>The eye was not made to be constantly focused on close objects.<br>If your work requires that you stare at a computer screen all day long<br>or if you watch a lot of television, stop from time to time to do a few<br>eye exercises.</p>
              <p><br>For example, roll your eyes in large circles in both directions;<br>look over to each side as far as possible and then go from up to<br>down; or scan an imaginary text on the wall from left to right; or look<br>out the window as far as you can following the horizon then return to<br>a point right in front of you and begin again.</p>
              <p><br>In this way, you will avoid long term eye problems, you will<br>enlarge your inner space, and relax both your eyes and your mind.</p>

              <p>6. How to beat asthma</p>
              <p><br>Asthma partially obstructs the bronchial tubes, making breathing<br>difficult. The cause of asthma is still not known. But if you are an<br>asthma sufferer, you can, through natural means, considerably reduce<br>the number of asthma attacks you get.</p>
              <p><br>A placebo study has shown that asthmatics who consume 1 gram<br>of vitamin C per day had 4 times fewer attacks. When they stopped<br>taking vitamin C, the attacks resumed with the same frequency as<br>before (Trop. and Geog. Med., Vol. 32, Mo. 2, 1980).<br>As for magnesium, it also works wonders! Dr. Zack H. Haddad<br>of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southern California<br>conducted a study on thirty children suffering from asthma associated<br>with allergies.</p>
              <p><br>Twenty of them drank a daily amount of mineral water rich in<br>magnesium, while the others received no magnesium supplement.<br>After three months, the first group had a higher level of magnesium in<br>their blood, and they were able to breathe more easily.<br>So taking vitamin C and magnesium is an excellent way to<br>prevent asthma attacks.</p>
              <p><br>But what can you do to breathe more easily during an attack?<br>Simply drink 2 or 3 cups of strong coffee. By activating blood<br>circulation, it eases respiratory blockage.</p>
              <p>In addition, the American Lung Association recommends the<br>following exercise:</p>
              <p><br>l. While standing, contract all your muscles. Keep them<br>contracted for a few seconds.</p>
              <p><br>2. Release the muscles, like letting the air out of a balloon. Relax<br>all your muscles completely until you feel like a limp cloth.</p>
              <p><br>3. Let yourself fall to the floor, and stretch out. Close your eyes<br>and relax your face and your feet.</p>
              <p><br>4. Imagine that you are floating on water. Concentrate on the<br>effect the earth’s gravity has on your muscles and on the pleasant<br>feeling of being completely relaxed.</p>
              <p><br>5. Breathe gently and quietly, as if you were about to fall asleep.</p>
              <p><br>6. Open your eyes.</p>
              <p><br>Practising this exercise when you feel an attack coming on, or<br>once it is already started, will help you overcome your<br>asthma condition.</p>

              <p>7. Losing weight:</p>
              <p>The<br>Pakistani method</p>
              <p><br>Pakistani women have an amazing trick they use to stay slim: they<br>keep a string permanently tied around their forearms. According to<br>Dr. Drupas, a gentle but constant pressure on the nerves in the<br>forearm stimulates certain glands, particularly those involved in<br>weight control (thyroid, suprarenals).</p>
              <p><br>Why don’t you try it? Find two ordinary rubber bands and place<br>them around your right forearm, one third of the way up between your<br>wrist and elbow.</p>
              <p><br>The rubber bands should exert noticeable pressure without cutting<br>off blood circulation and should not slip or slide when you move<br>your arm. This is not a tourniquet!</p>
              <p><br>For best results, you have to wear the rubber bands constantly,<br>even at night when you sleep. It is also recommended not to wear any<br>other jewelry on the right arm.</p>

              <p>8. What to do when you<br>get something in your eye</p>
              <p><br>Got some dust in your eye? Or some other irritant like an eyelash or<br>cigarette ash? You can use the following technique to help others as well<br>as yourself.</p>
              <p><br>Before doing anything, make sure you don’t do what you absolutely<br>shouldn’t: rub or press the eye, lift the eyelid, or remove contact lenses<br>without washing your hands.</p>
              <p><br>How to proceed?<br>· Examine your eye. Is it red? Swollen? Is it tearing? What do you<br>feel? Does it itch? Burn? Is your vision blurred?</p>
              <p><br>· Let nature do its work - it is usually effective. Tears and natural eye<br>movements will usually get rid of the irritation.</p>
              <p><br>· Try rinsing your eye with some warm water, or with drops. You<br>can pull on the skin around the eyes, but don’t touch the eyelid.</p>
              <p><br>· If this doesn’t work, wash your hands, and then lift both the upper<br>and lower eyelids to locate the irritant. Is it on the inside of one of the<br>eyelids, or is it stuck to the eyeball itself? Pour some sterilized, warm<br>water on your eye to flush the irritant out.</p>
              <p><br>· If you can’t locate the irritant or if the discomfort persists after you<br>have removed the particle, you would better consult a doctor.</p>

              <p>9. A few tricks for<br>treating insect bites</p>
              <p><br>You don’t have to sit back and just passively put up with insects,<br>especially those that like to bite (mosquitoes, wasps etc.). Eat<br>asparagus and your sweat will develop an odor that repels insects. Or<br>apply lemon oil to your skin.</p>
              <p><br>If you are bitten, there are natural substances to soothe the<br>irritation. Aloe vera has extraordinary powers of soothing skin<br>disorders. It is available in forms for both internal and external<br>application in most health and beauty stores.</p>
              <p><br>If you have one of these amazing plants growing at home, cut the<br>tip off one of the leaves (the leaf will heal itself). Apply the pulp and<br>juice to the itching or swollen area.</p>
              <p><br>Lightly boiled cabbage or leek makes an excellent analgesic<br>poultice. Of course, if you are hiking in the woods, you might have a<br>little trouble finding cabbage! Plantain also works well. Cut it and rub<br>it to get to the juice then apply it to the affected area.</p>

              <p>10. How to get rid of<br>liver spots</p>
              <p><br>If you have liver spots, it is up to you to get rid of them.<br>May be you took too much sun, without using the proper<br>precautions like sunscreen, gradual exposure, etc. If you continue<br>ignoring your skin in this way, you might end up looking like a lizard!<br>Liver spots can also result from a thyroid deficiency. The thyroid<br>gland must therefore be stimulated through a variety of means. For<br>example, brown seaweed tablets: take one a day every morning, for<br>fifteen days a month.</p>
              <p><br>Or apply a cream composed of 1 teaspoon oxygenated water and<br>4 1/2 tablespoons lanovaseline every morning and night.<br>Aloe vera (see previous chapter) is very effective in treating skin<br>disorders. Daily application of aloe vera over a period of time can<br>eliminate liver spots completely.</p>
              <p><br>Also take a look at your nutrition: the real problem might lie in<br>what you do or don’t eat, like a diet too high in fat.</p>

              <p>11. Treat diarrhea<br>without medication</p>
              <p><br>If you have ever been to a tropical country, you have probably<br>experienced diarrhea: frequent and uncontrolled evacuation of liquid<br>stool caused by bacteria in local water, milk or food.<br>Diarrhea can also be caused at home by excesses in diet (a diet<br>that is too rich) or an allergic reaction to certain foods or medication<br>or even by stress.</p>
              <p><br>To treat diarrhea, avoid all solid food on the first day. Drink<br>liquids like water, apple juice, meat or vegetable boullion and tea.<br>These will compensate for your loss of water - dehydration being one<br>of the main dangers of diarrhea - and will give your intestines a<br>period of rest.</p>
              <p><br>If you have stomach cramps, rub your hands together for about a<br>minute. Then place both palms on your abdominal region. The heat<br>will soothe the pain.</p>
              <p><br>On the second day, eat small quantities of solid food. Among the<br>least irritating are cooked cereals (especially rice), biscuits and soft<br>boiled eggs.</p>
              <p><br>You can also try charcoal. It comes in tablet or capsule form (you<br>can also get it off burnt toast!)</p>
              <p><br>Chinese medicine has always considered ginger one of the best<br>remedies for diarrhea. Dilute a tablespoon in hot water and<br>add honey.</p>

              <p>12. Use seaweed to<br>stimulate your immune<br>system</p>
              <p><br>Japanese seaweed possesses remarkable immunizing properties,<br>especially in fighting cancer. Japanese researchers at the University of<br>Kitasato have discovered 6 kinds of seaweed which inhibit the<br>growth of colon cancer cells in rats, notably two types of Laminaria.<br>Laminaria extract has proven 70% to 84% effective in suppressing<br>intestinal tumors.</p>
              <p><br>Wakame, another Japanese seaweed, is now familiar to many<br>Westerners, thanks to the arrival in the west of Japanese macrobiotic<br>cooking, which uses it a lot.</p>
              <p><br>Pharmacologists at the University of Hawaii injected rats with an<br>extract of this substance. They found that the seaweed helped prevent<br>and cure cancer. The researchers claim that Wakame fights cancer by<br>activating and strengthening the immune system. It can be found in<br>most health food stores.</p>

              <p>13. How to prevent motion<br>sickness - naturally</p>
              <p><br>Did you know that half a teaspoon of ground ginger is more<br>effective than chemical medication in suppressing motion or sea<br>sickness? And unlike most medication, it will not make you drowsy.<br>Ginger has been used in the Orient for centuries to prevent sea<br>sickness.</p>
              <p><br>Researchers asked subjects who were especially susceptible to<br>motion sickness to sit in a reclining chair that spun around at high<br>speed. All the subjects who ingested a well known medication or<br>who took a placebo experienced violent nausea and/or vomiting.<br>On the other hand, six of the twelve subjects who took ginger<br>twenty minutes before the test experienced no discomfort. They<br>consumed only 840 milligrams of ground ginger, which is the<br>equivalent of half a teaspoon.</p>
              <p><br>The Japanese have a very curious method of treating all kinds of<br>motion sickness. They use an adhesive plaster to fasten an<br>“umeboshi” (a very salty fermented plum, available in most health<br>food stores in the West) to their navel. The idea may seem a little<br>strange, but what have you got to lose!</p>

              <p>15. How to prevent<br>Flatulence (Aerophagy)</p>
              <p><br>Aerophagy results simply from “eating” air. The condition is not<br>dramatically serious, but it does bloat the stomach and can prove<br>embarrassing (stomach gurgles, etc.)</p>
              <p><br>How to prevent it? Above all chew your food properly and savor<br>it fully. Swallowing too much is a direct cause of aerophagy. So don’t<br>swallow needlessly.</p>
              <p><br>Don’t drink a lot when you eat. Avoid tobacco and alcohol,<br>cabbage, radishes, doughy bread, strong spices and bubbly drinks.<br>Don’t eat food that is too hot or too cold.</p>
              <p><br>And pay attention to the kinds of food you eat together: make a<br>note of any combination that seems to provoke an attack and avoid it<br>in future.</p>

              <p>16. How to put an end to<br>heartburn</p>
              <p><br>Heartburn usually results from excess acidity in the stomach, or<br>from improper functioning of your digestive system.<br>At the point where the esophagus and stomach join, a special<br>muscle opens and closes the esophagus. When we swallow food this<br>muscle relaxes to let the food pass into the stomach after which it<br>closes again.</p>
              <p><br>But it can happen that the muscle malfunctions. The contents of<br>the stomach then rise back up the esophagus, irritating the area. And<br>this results in the infamous feeling of heartburn.</p>
              <p><br>How to stop it? Avoid acidic foods (lemons, etc.), alcohol, fat<br>or fried food, food that is overcooked, coffee, juice, tomato base<br>products and chocolate. But don’t deprive yourself too much. Rather,<br>observe which foods bring on heartburn and avoid them. Also, don’t<br>go to sleep right after eating (you should eat supper around 7 o’clock)<br>and don’t smoke, especially after meals.</p>

              <p>17. A miracle remedy</p>
              <p><br>If we offered you a miracle remedy that prevents cardiac disease,<br>certain types of cancer, diabetes, obesity, tooth decay and varicose<br>veins, would you buy it? Certainly you would.<br>There is such a product. But it is not a recent discovery and you<br>won’t find it in a pharmacy but at the grocery store. We are talking<br>about fiber.</p>
              <p><br>A study conducted in Holland on 871 men, over a period of ten<br>years, showed that subjects who had a low fiber diet were three<br>times more susceptible to mortal disease - causes notwithstanding -<br>than those who ate a lot of fiber (Future Youth).</p>
              <p><br>This said, it cannot be confirmed at present that fiber prevents<br>the above mentioned diseases in all cases. But there is conclusive<br>proof that they occur more frequently in populations with low fiber<br>diets which is precisely the case in the west.</p>
              <p><br>According to The Lancet (the British Medical Journal) a diet<br>which contains at least 37 grams of fiber per day (the equivalent of<br>one cup of bran, one apple, one potato and a half cup of cooked<br>spinach) can effectively protect the organism against chronic illnesses<br>common to western society.</p>
              <p><br>So fiber is useful in combatting many disorders<br>besides constipation.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>LOW FIBER FOODS:<br>Notably white bread (since fiber is removed in white flour),<br>beef, pork, chicken, milk, butter, cheese, sugar, processed meats,<br>desserts, fish, seafood and noodles.</p>
              <p><br>GOOD SOURCES OF FIBER:<br>· Fruits: especially apples and prunes.</p>
              <p><br>· Vegetables: potatoes with their peel, spinach, artichokes,<br>cabbage, peas.</p>
              <p><br>· Whole grains: barley, whole wheat (you should eat whole<br>wheat bread because of the bran it contains), oats, corn.</p>
              <p><br>· Nuts: peanuts and almonds.</p>
              <p><br>· Dried fruit: apricots, plums, figs, dates.</p>
              <p><br>· Legumes: soy beans, lima beans, lentils, chick peas.</p>
              <p><br>Note that there are numerous types of fiber, and that you should<br>alternate between them. For example, the fiber contained in apples<br>and the fiber in cereals are both essential, since they don’t have the<br>same digestive function.</p>

              <p>18. Reducing your<br>cholesterol</p>
              <p><br>To reduce cholesterol:</p>
              <p><br>· First cut down on saturated fats. To do this:</p>
              <p><br>· Eat lean meat. Select lean cuts and ask your butcher to cut off<br>the fat.</p>
              <p><br>· Drink skim milk instead of whole milk.</p>
              <p><br>Do the same for all dairy products. Note that vegetarians have a<br>much lower cholesterol level (almost twice as low as average) which<br>is perfectly understandable, since cholesterol is only found in<br>products derived from animals.</p>
              <p><br>· Alcohol - in moderation. Not more than two glasses a day.</p>
              <p><br>However, it does appear that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol<br>raises the number of HDL lipids (the good ones!), which break down<br>cholesterol. (Moderation = two 4 oz. glasses of wine or two 12 oz.<br>beers.)</p>
              <p><br>· Do regular exercise, for example walking.</p>
              <p><br>· Take Vitamin E. It reduces the risk of coronary disease.</p>
              <p><br>· Calcium brewer’s yeast, Vitamin C and Vitamin B-6 also<br>combat the accumulation of cholesterol. And don’t forget lecithin,<br>which helps fight excess cholesterol, arteriosclerosis, hypertension<br>and angina (as well as psoriasis, anxiety and diabetes - and reduces<br>the likelihood of contracting cancer). Losing weight is a good way to<br>raise your HDL level.</p>
              <p><br>· Use poly-unsaturated, non-hydrogenated, cold pressed oil: corn<br>oil, sunflower seed oil, soy, flax etc. A mono-unsaturated oil like<br>olive oil can even raise your HDL level.</p>
              <p><br>· Daily consumption of fish would be ideal for preventing<br>cardio-vascular problems, as demonstrated conclusively in a number<br>of studies on fish-eating populations (Eskimos for example). Ideally,<br>you would eat fish twice a day. And as strange as this sounds, you<br>should select the fattest kinds: mackerel, sardines, herring, salmon etc.<br>As for the oil in the fish, it is used to treat arterial disorders. Its<br>effects can be felt in about six weeks. Fish oil contains two<br>poly-unsaturated fatty acids which are very beneficial for the arteries.</p>

              <p><br>There is a plant for each type of digestion problem.</p>
              <p><br>· AIGREMOINE is useful when the stomach problem is<br>accompanied by enteritis, diarrhea and/or chronic liver infection. It<br>helps tone a lazy digestive system. And it also helps regularize acidity<br>and soothe ulcers by improving metabolism.</p>
              <p><br>3 or 4 cups a day. 3 1/2 to 4 tablespoons per quart of water.</p>
              <p><br>· ANGELICA is a digestive, an aperitif, a stimulant, a tonic. It<br>decongests and soothes stomach pains and swelling.</p>
              <p><br>Prepare an infusion (tea) preferably using the fresh plant: 3 1/2<br>tablespoons of roots per quart of water. If your stomach is very<br>swollen, prepare and drink 3 cups per day made of 5 tablespoons of<br>seeds per quart of water.</p>
              <p><br>· ANISE is a soothing digestive. It aids digestion and the<br>elimination of intestinal gas, it soothes stomach cramps, aerophagy,<br>dyspepsia (contractions of the digestive organs, dizziness and a heavy<br>feeling after eating).</p>
              <p><br>2 or 3 cups per day, after meals: 2 tablespoons of seeds per quart<br>of water.</p>
              <p><br>· CAMOMILE: a digestive, sedative, anti-inflammation agent<br>and tonic. It helps painful or difficult digestion, stomach cramps,<br>gastro-intestinal spasms, loss of appetite, and it helps expulsion of gas<br>(carminative). Particularly recommended for persons who suffer from<br>stomach cramps (and/or who are irritable, temperamental, angry etc.)<br>One cup of infusion, a half hour before meals, or one hour after.</p>
              <p><br>To prepare the infusion, add 5 1/2 tablespoons to a quart of boiling<br>water and let stand for five minutes.</p>
              <p><br>· CHERVIL: digestive, depurative and diuretic. It also acts as a<br>stimulant. For difficult digestion, drink 2 or 3 cups per day. Prepare<br>an infusion with one teaspoon of dried leaves per cup of water, and<br>let stand for 10 minutes.</p>
              <p><br>· SAGE: The ancients had a saying - “Why die when your garden<br>is full of sage!” It is a digestive, diuretic, antispasmodic and helps<br>combat hypoglycemia.</p>
              <p><br>It stimulates the appetite, fortifies the stomach and aids digestion,<br>especially when digestion is difficult. It is also a general tonic. 2 or 3<br>cups of infusion per day. 1 1/2 tablespoons of dried leaves per quart<br>of water. (Practical Guide No. 6, Vol. II).</p>

              <p><br>A person with a cold is extremely contagious: he or she fills the<br>air with fine particles of saliva or mucous which transport the virus<br>microbe.
