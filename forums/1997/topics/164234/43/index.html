They'll probably decide to come back for more, since both like nothing better than a good fight and cannot stand to drop the issue without having the last word, but it will be a tempestuous union. (Source: AquarianAge Romance )<br><br>Like a lightning storm, dramatic and intense and difficult to come up with an encore. (Source: AquarianAge Romance )<br><br>Temper tantrums are quite likely to erupt into major wars with this combination. Remember only one party can win and neither one will accept defeat. Passionate but problems. ( Source: Love Test )<br><br>This is a passionate match between equals. He will understand your need for excitement, especially in the romance department. However, intense passions can fizzle out when the newness of the relationship wears off. (In other words, the chemistry between you will start strong but fizzle quickly.) You will also have control issues with another Aries, because you both want to be in control all the time. That will lead to inevitable battles over who gets their way, and that can be the end of the relationship. Because of the major sparks youÂ’ll make, this is a very good match for a short-term fling, but not for lasting love. (Source: Jellybean's Astro-Soulmate Guide )<br><br>Can you say intense? When you and your Aries boy are together, patience is not in your vocabulary, but passion is.   This is a potential match made in heaven, just as long as you both remember to play nice and give each other plenty of respect when you disagree. ( Source: FUNgirl - Astrology )<br><br>Both like to dominate, especially the woman. There will be fierce competition to be number one. Both need outside interests to diffuse tempers and ego clashes. Pairing would need a lot of control and work. Both partners need outside interests to help lessen the conflict. If both can control their need to rule the roost then perhaps there is a chance for these two but it will be difficult. (Source: Astrology Fun )<br></div>
