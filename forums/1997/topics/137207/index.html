            <div class='col-md body'>These Things I Wish for You<br><br>We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse.<br><br>For my grandchildren, IÂ’d know better.<br><br>IÂ’d really like for them to know about hand-me-down clothes and home-made ice cream and leftover meatloaf. I really would.<br><br>My cherished grandson, I hope you learn humility by surviving failure and that you learn to be honest even when no one is looking.<br><br>I hope you learn to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash the car -- and I hope nobody gives you a brand-new car when you are sixteen.<br><br>It will be good if at least one time you can see a baby calf born, and you have a good friend to be with you if you ever have to put your old dog to sleep.<br><br>I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.<br><br>I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it is all right to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because heÂ’s scared, I hope youÂ’ll let him.<br><br>And when you want to see a Disney movie and your kid brother wants to tag along, I hope you take him.<br><br>I hope you have to walk uphill with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely.<br><br>If you want a slingshot, I hope your father teaches you how to make one instead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books, and when you learn to use computers, you also learn how to add and subtract in your head.<br><br>I hope you get razzed by friends when you have your first crush on a girl, and that when you talk back to your mother you learn what Ivory soap tastes like.<br><br>May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on the stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.<br><br>I hope you get sick when someone blows smoke in your face. I donÂ’t care if you try beer once, but I hope you wonÂ’t like it. And if a friend offers you a joint or any drugs, I hope you are smart enough to realize that person is not your friend.<br><br>I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your grandpa or go fishing with your uncle.<br><br>I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through a neighborÂ’s window, and that she hugs you and kisses you when you give her a plaster of paris mold of your hand.<br><br>These things I wish for you -- tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness.<br><br>By Lee Pitts<br>from Chicken Soup for the Golden Soul<br></div>
