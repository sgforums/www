But still I felt a bit of pain and regret when he started talking to me again recently, because it made me realize that I haven't truly forgiven him, or maybe I haven't really forgiven myself for being so stupid as to fall for someone who does not even care abt me...</div></blockquote>Honey, it's time to move on.<br><br>Above all things, you need to forgive urself. Everyday we are growing. And if you're not, you're dead. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I forgive you</strong></span>. And I truly understand ur feelings.<br><br>According to what you've mentioned abt u being unable to forgive him for hurting u last time, I must say that forgiveness is not just a feeling. IT IS A CHOICE. Be final abt it.<br><br>I love you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reminds me of once I was sitting in a restaurant with a bf.. when... an ex walked past with his girlfriend. He didn't see me.<br><br>and in that split second, even though he didn't see me, I was transported to a scene in my memory of walking with him, down the same road. The conversation we were having, his smile when he was listening to me jabber on.. .. so clear still in my mind. Did I love him still then?<br><br>You can't erase a love that's been engraved inside your heart, can you? Not without diminishing your heart or scarring it irrevocably. The deeper the love, the longer the journey, the more permanent the memories. And when you give your heart to someone else again, it's with all of that wholesale, take it or leave it. It is unfair that the hurt you suffered at someone else's hands needs the tenderness of another to heal. It is even more unfair that all that love from someone else cannot just make the memories from a previous love disappear. Good thing is, as you create more memories, you CAN forget where those snippets of the past and let it lay buried, until ... like u say, fate suddenly flings them out of some cobwebby cabinet and you got to confront it.<br><br>It's a great time to take a last look and do some housekeeping. Let the tears roll, the smiles come then pack them away after a last viewing, contented that what you have NOW is because you have left that all behind.<br></div>
