            <div class='col-md body'>I choose to abort because if we decide to keep the baby, the mother whom is already prone to postpartum depression or psychosis or postpartum blues after pregnancy would develop these disorders eagerly and the mother may develop intentions to kill the baby for the psychotic fear of not being able to bring up the child. They would be so depressed to an extent that they might even consider to take their own lives...<br><br>In other words, I put my mind on both the baby and the mother.</div>
