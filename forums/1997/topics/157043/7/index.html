But I somehow always got the feeling it was possible. I read this thread and about rainee and emperorÂ’s inspirational r/s and started believing it more.<br><br>Online chatting is a powerful tool indeed. It is a good way to converse. And throughout history, letter writing had been a normal way to converseÂ…so why not chatting online. It is basically an interactive letter pad. And people throughout the ages have met, fell in love and live happily ever after starting by just writing letters to each other. They were what people call it pen-pals back then. So actually I guess, it this really possible after all having an online r/s. So you donÂ’t have to feel uncomfortable about being in an online r/s.<br><br>You meet on the netÂ…you slowly gather about all the things he likes and dislikes and you realize he is the kind of person for you. You feel a kind of affinity for him. Behind your mind you think to yourselfÂ…could he be the one. Everybody wants someone to loveÂ…so you start feeling glad that you have someone pouring his feelings for you. And I suppose something in you starts to stir (the hormone and blah blah blah stuff) and presto you are infatuated.<br><br>But the frightening thing isÂ…IS he telling the truth!!! This is when online chatting can work in favor of the guy. I must say it is very very easy to hide the truth online. Heck, it is even easy for a guy to hide the truth face to face. It all boils down to the honesty of the guy. Is he an honest guy? Does he have the integrity. Is he  only trying to play with you? DonÂ’t know exactly what constitutes sweet talk and mushy talk to youÂ…but then again it all boils down to the guys intentions. He is probably trying to win you overÂ…which is in that case normal for a guy to do. But what does he want to gain from thatÂ…To get to know youÂ…to try and ask you out on a dateÂ…again that is normal for a guy to do. BUT what does he want from a date with you??? That you better be careful lor.<br><br>My conclusionÂ…geezÂ…I donÂ’t have a conclusion.<br></div></blockquote>true true..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>anyway sweet-talking on MSN n sweet-talking on the phone are two completely different story altogether.. is he sweet-talking u on the phone too?</div>
