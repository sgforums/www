Makes u focused, think.. and wonder.     But i would maybe suggest that take more time to evaluate him. All your life experiences can be put to test lo.. see what U personally think deep inside ah. I mean there are instances of real nice guys out there, u can enver know unwil u actually meet the person n look him in the eye and go ' hmmm..... hey..he is just as nice as he is in messages!' he he   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But there are also those that maybe sweet talking u on the phone while stroking another chick beside him.. he he.. i know.. yes.. he he.. in fact , i know a close friend of mine that sweet talks to girls.. n the girl sms me telling me is he really as nice as he is n not knowing that i am beside the dude n his gf.. ha ha ha!! anyways.. =X  but dun let my personaly experience affect r judgement la ya.. i am sure u are pretty experienced ..  or u can always just start praying for WISDOM!

            <div class='col-md body'>Starblue, actually I do not know what is right and wrong about an online relationship. But I somehow always got the feeling it was possible. I read this thread and about rainee and emperorÂ’s inspirational r/s and started believing it more.<br><br>Online chatting is a powerful tool indeed. It is a good way to converse. And throughout history, letter writing had been a normal way to converseÂ…so why not chatting online. It is basically an interactive letter pad. And people throughout the ages have met, fell in love and live happily ever after starting by just writing letters to each other. They were what people call it pen-pals back then. So actually I guess, it this really possible after all having an online r/s. So you donÂ’t have to feel uncomfortable about being in an online r/s.<br><br>You meet on the netÂ…you slowly gather about all the things he likes and dislikes and you realize he is the kind of person for you. You feel a kind of affinity for him. Behind your mind you think to yourselfÂ…could he be the one. Everybody wants someone to loveÂ…so you start feeling glad that you have someone pouring his feelings for you. And I suppose something in you starts to stir (the hormone and blah blah blah stuff) and presto you are infatuated.<br><br>But the frightening thing isÂ…IS he telling the truth!!! This is when online chatting can work in favor of the guy. I must say it is very very easy to hide the truth online. Heck, it is even easy for a guy to hide the truth face to face. It all boils down to the honesty of the guy. Is he an honest guy? Does he have the integrity. Is he  only trying to play with you? DonÂ’t know exactly what constitutes sweet talk and mushy talk to youÂ…but then again it all boils down to the guys intentions. He is probably trying to win you overÂ…which is in that case normal for a guy to do. But what does he want to gain from thatÂ…To get to know youÂ…to try and ask you out on a dateÂ…again that is normal for a guy to do. BUT what does he want from a date with you??? That you better be careful lor.<br><br>My conclusionÂ…geezÂ…I donÂ’t have a conclusion.<br></div>
