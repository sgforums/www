LOL, ok im rubbish, whatever, but anyways my only memorable experiences are...<br><br>first time i took a plane alone by myself was when i was in pri 2, which is.. 8 years old. was on the way to america to visit my relatives, i was a UM ( unaccompanied minor ) and had special care from the air stewardesses =). they were really nice, and i didnt know they had special stuff like kids meal, toys and stuff until i was actually a UM on the plane without my parents.<br><br>2nd most memorable time was the time when i was on the way to america again, but this time with my uncle. i was a playful Shit, and when we were transitting at tokyo narita airport, i wandered off and actually lost my uncle. however, i managed to find my way to the gate where we were supposed to be, as i had my boarding pass with me, that was when i was 10 years old. it was really scary though, as i had to take a skytrain back to the terminal, and being 10 years old was not very helpful at all.  it all started when i went pass the revolving metal doors that when u go in, and cannot come out. i pushed in abit, and before i realised what i got myself into, it was too late, i was stuck, and had to go to the other terminal, to take a skytrain back to the departure halls and  get myself back to the gates really quick as it was time to board. scariest time of my life, as i was going back to the gates, i was thinking about how to earn money and get jobs in tokyo to pay for my next air ticket back to Singapore, LOL.<br><br>subsequent enjoyable flights were with my friends when we were going to Thailand (Phuket, Phi Phi island, Chiang mai, Koh samui), Bali, Australia (Cairns, Port Douglas). when you're with your friends, anything is Shitloadsa fun.<br><br>There were also a few flights recently, especially last November/December, and this March/April, where i came to america, and went back to singapore several times due to some problems i had to deal with. basically, the 20 odd hour flights were extremely cool to me as i had a chance to watch all the movies that i missed on the big screens, talk about watching 10+ movies in a row =). Prior to my flight too, i decided that i should spend time with my family and friends, and neglect sleep as i could get that on the airplane, but it turned out that i couldnt do so on the plane as the in flight entertainment was just too cool to resist. &lt;3 SIA Krisworld entertainment.<br><br>well basically thats about it. enjoy</div>
