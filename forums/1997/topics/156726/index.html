            <div class='col-md body'>i go hospital to cheer ppl up. Sumtime its sad to see sum patients lying there on the bed, waitin there..looking out the window...expecting their relatives to come and see them, to care for them, but they never came. And also kids in the cancer ward.. so young, yet cursed with the disease. I always bring soft toys, candy enough for the entire children ward.. cost a few hundreds. To see the kid smile in the face of terminal illness gives a great feeling.<br><br>If u think about it, there are many things in the world that can make people sad. Is what you choose to deal with what you are able to see that matters.</div>
