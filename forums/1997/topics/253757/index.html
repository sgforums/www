            <div class='col-md body'>i've always thought that she would be a life-long friend of mine. one who'd be there to pass me the wedding band i need to place on my man's ring finger. one who'd be there to god-mother my children. one who'd sit by my side as we knit little socks for our gradnchildren while discussing who has grown the most white hairs in the past year.<br><br>but, apparently, she's proving to be a score-keeping acquaintance over the past 3 years. keeping score here means, that she is remembering the social exchanges that occur between us. she does something nice for me, she expects the same, if not a bit more to be done to her. it's as though i was a mere investment to her, knowing for sure that i will reciprocate dearly if she but puts in a little effort in the friendship.<br><br>i thought that perhaps i was wrong to think that of her. and i felt extremely guilty when that thought first occurred to me. i've repeatedly suppressed that sentiment, willing, instead, to believe that if i continued to treat her truly, she would eventually treat me truly as well.<br><br>alas, things were not to be. after we grad from JC and went to separate Uni, we've gone on for months without any form of contact. it was as if she didnt need me anymore. and i slowly learnt to cope without her. the few social exchanges we had were not enjoyable, always leaving me feeling as if i have once again been made use of. i began to lose faith in this friendship, but somewhere deep inside, i never wanted to lose it. she was, afterall, a friend i held dear to my heart.<br><br>one month ago, just before the study break, she suddenly msned me out of the blue (after like 3 months of no contact), and ask me when my exams end and whether i wanna go out after the exams. i was elated, thinking maybe i'm not losing her friendship afterall. so i happily told her i wanna go sing someday.<br><br>one week after her exams ended and i didnt hear anything from her (she said she will tell me when she free to go out, cos she's doing summer school). and then, when her birthday came, she smsed me if i wanna go out.<br><br>that's all well and good. we always treat each other to something for our birthdays, mostly dinner (and at some place quite expensive for me, but she wun tolerate anything less. but since it's only once a year for her bday, i always went with it.)<br><br>this time, i suggested Klunch, cos i wanted to sing. then she confirmed who's going to pay for this (she wun ask this if we were going out without any occasion), and then asked if i will be treating her to lunch as well (she didnt know klunch also got include lunch).<br><br>so i told her also got include lunch. and she went:<br><br>har.... liddat a bit loogy leh.<br><br>/bitter smile<br><br>what was i supposed to think?<br><br>so long she never hear from me, and the first time she initiated a social exchange, it was for her birthday treat. am i a mere tool to be exploited to her?<br><br>with a very heavy heart, i ask myself:<br><br>do i still want this friend?</div>
