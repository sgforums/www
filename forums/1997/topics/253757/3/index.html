(you realise that that last sentence can mean a lot, or precisely nothing at all). i wonder if that cocopox i had this morning could be counted towards a healthy induction of endorphins in my system. i supposed not, for i have had but 10 miserable "poxes" (i also wonder what possessed me to eat ONLY 10. perhaps in my keen desperation to do something totally unexpected by society, i was prompted to be creatively insane in the most mundane of chores.)<br><br>alas, i have done nothing but blabbed to you what i had initially intended to refrain from blabbing --- utter bullshit written in tedious prose, a product, i believe, of the devil's workshop.<br><br>but i assure you that i am as intact-minded as the next individual (unless, of cos, you picked my dad). and i will engage you in more light-hearted converse when the sun rises in my world again. until then, i wish you well.<br></div></blockquote>......</div>
