              <p>ISSIT ? I got a vanadium something steel knife. Suppose to have anti-splash design.quite sharp..  but i have yet to use it on anyone. lol. Maybe try it on a wild boar when i go back. hahaha</p>
              <p>ooo..  i dun have any RIFs. Only a double barrel shotgun and an 8 -gauge gun which can be used to do seismic also.</p>
              <p>So.. does that mean u can take me down before i even raise my hands up ? Where u now ?</p>
              <p>And no.. i dun frequent Military Nuts. Its too technical in there. And i am outdated after i did not have time keep up to date more then a decade ago. lol</p>

              <p>Ooo really? I only have a SOG Seal Pup, SOG NW Ranger, SOG Pentagon Elite II, CRKT Crawford Kasper Combat Folder and a S&amp;W Tactical something. However I play nice when doing CQC skirmishing and use my Boker Applegate Fairbairn trainer. Actually stabbing your opponents is frowned upon.</p>
              <p>Come visit me where we skirmish(near London) and theres a good chance I can take you down yes. Many areas are pitch black. Ask the enemy team who got ambushed from behind by me last week. It was a shock to be "killed" from behind on full auto. Of course I think that one guy who got "killed" by a thrown knife from behind him probably had an even bigger shock, altho I'm sure his buddy who had the barrel of my G36 stabbed into his kidneys and me yelling "BANG" into his ear must have come close to the same level of shock too. Don't get me wrong btw, I don't want to light his buddy up at point blank only as a matter of courtesy. We both know he was "killed" no need to give him some unnecessary and painful welts.</p>
              <p>Actually, military nuts might be too technical these days, but why care? Just stick to what we already know. Seems the weapon systems of the 80s and 90s have suddenly moved forward so quickly. I sometimes feel like I'm still stuck in the era of FN FALs.</p>

              <p>Come visit. I'll bring you along for a skirmish. I'll even lend u a spare RIF as long as you don't promise to break it. And I have no problem with eye jabbing and crotch grabbing. I don't have anything down there that hurts in case u forgot. I myself have no qualms about kicking people in the crotch in an actual fight, and im not kidding lol. As for eyes, well everyone will be wearing goggles (i got spares too) so only thing that will hurt is yr finger :)</p>
              <p>Lol I'm not part time SF. It's milsim and skirmishing. A bit like paintballing, but with RIFs instead of weird paintball guns, and gear that's used by actual military units or repro gear.</p>
              <p>I'm actually not properly trained in CQC. Never been trained before. It's all instinctive for me. =) But if you do visit London drop me a PM and if u're near enough I'll bring u for a taste of combat skirmishing =)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well you don't want to get hit by something doing 700 feet per sec (fps) at less than 100ft. Trust me on that. Actually its a bit inaccurate to say muzzle velocity is restricted. Its more about the energy of the projectile fired. Because the weight of the projectiles we fire varies from 0.12g to around 0.5g, muzzle velocity is dependent on the weight of the projectile but the energy is consistant. A lighter projectile will be fired with a higher initial muzzle velocity, but have shorter range due to lower momentum, while a heavier projectile fires with an initially lower muzzle velocity but flys further due to a higher momentum. But both will fire with the same energy, and the energy limit in UK is 1 joule.</p></div>
