              <hr>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone feels despondent at times and
                  you are no exception. You are feeling so depressed because it seems
                  that everything that could go wrong has gone wrong and you don't quite
                  know which way to turn. So like the proverbial ostrich you are trying
                  to bury your head in the sand. But that won't work - you have to face
                  reality.</p>
              <p>You are willing to try anything once. You 'need to be needed' and
                  what is perhaps more important you 'need to need.' You can only feel
                  close to a person or persons when you feel you can trust them, but this
                  trust needs to be proven to you.</p>
              <p>The way things are, you feel that you are stuck in a rut and there
                  is not much you can do about it. You feel frustrated and inhibited but
                  if you can find a way to let yourself go, you may find that things
                  aren't quite so bad as perhaps you thought they were. One consolation
                  is that since you are an extremely emotional individual, with the right
                  person you may be able to release some of that frustration and tension
                  with some mutual tender loving care.</p>
              <p>The stress and tension that you are experiencing at this time is
                  perhaps due to your inability to achieve security and appreciation from
                  those closest to you. This is resulting in considerable pressures. You
                  find the situation as it stands most frustrating. You are the sort of
                  person that would like to experience all and everything very intensely
                  but unfortunately you are not receiving the warmth and understanding
                  that you feel you are entitled to. Matters are not going too well. You
                  seek a sympathetic ear but it is not forthcoming. This situation is
                  extremely nerve-racking - and what is more humiliating is that no-one
                  seems to care and you are powerless to do anything about it.</p>
              <p>Perhaps in the distant past your trust and belief in your fellow man
                  was misplaced and you can now no longer accept anything as it appears
                  to be. You are untrusting and you insist that before you commit
                  yourself to anything, you examine the pro's and con's with critical
                  discrimination. The situation has now progressed to one where you are
                  apt to disagree yet not make any form of constructive criticism to
                  every suggestion that may be put to you. As a result you are in limbo.
                  There is a saying that goes 'The past does not equal tomorrow'. Think
                  about it - and let go.</p>

              <p>You are so adamant at this time, you are not willing to concede to
              anything. You are dictatorial with your own ideas and the way you are
              feeling and there is little that anyone can do to make you change your
              mind, or to be able to persuade you to make concessions or to accept
              any compromise.</p>
              <p>Most people are conditioned by their environment and you are no
              exception. You are an extremely emotional person - so much so that 'the
              wrong word' can lead you to tears. You feel other people's pain. You
              feel the need of sympathetic relationships and a pleasant work
              environment in order to develop and grow. You are an impulsive, loving
              individual with a great deal of inherent feeling.</p>
              <p>The situation at this time is one of considerable distress. You feel
              trapped and you are looking for some way out. You can find solace in
              the arms of someone who cares so long as there is no long-term
              emotional involvement.</p>
              <p>Your willpower and stamina are in danger of being overwhelmed by
              excessive stress. Your resilience and tenacity have become weakened.
              You are feeling overtaxed, worn out and getting nowhere: but you
              continue to stand your ground. You feel that this unfavourable
              situation is an encumbrance which you could well do without and you
              find yourself unable to make the necessary decisions at this particular
              moment in time to change anything.</p>
              <p>The tensions induced by trying to cope with conditions which are
              beyond your capabilities, or your reserves of strength, have led to
              considerable anxiety and a sense of personal inadequacy. Your inability
              to take control of the situation causes you to over-react in stubborn
              defiance blaming everyone but yourself for your own failures.</p>

              <p>You have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious relationships. Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. It has often been said that 'True love is just around the corner' and - if you haven't found it as yet - you possibly soon will.</p>
              <p>The way things are at this time is causing you considerable stress and anxiety. Your friends and acquaintances consider you to be - to say the least - difficult and unapproachable. Now it is because of this that you need to find some sort of solution. By doing nothing and waiting for matters to right themselves will only make things worse, but don't rush into making hasty decisions - make haste slowly.</p>
              <p>You wear your heart on your sleeve and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all - heart and soul - to all those that show you a little affection; but take care - it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment.</p>
              <p>You are experiencing considerable stress which is essentially the result of on going rejection and hostility. You are in the unpleasant position where offers of trust, affection and understanding are being withheld and you are being treaded with a degrading lack of consideration. You feel that you are being denied the appreciation that you deserve, which is essential to your well-being and self-esteem, but you have to face up to the situation because as matters stand at this time there is little that you can do about it - you feel that you are getting nowhere and the continuous struggle is a lonely one: all difficulties and no encouragement. Whatever you try to say or do is met with continuous hostility and no matter how much you protest you are consistently misunderstood. You need to escape from the situation but you are so perplexed that you cannot find the strength of mind to make the necessary decision.</p>
              <p>You are inclined to be too trusting and you feel that you need to be on your guard against the possibility that your endeavours and actions may be misunderstood. Too often you have been taken advantage of and you have been mentally abused. Now you are seeking a relationship which can provide peace of mind, where you can be yourself and not have the need to put on a false front.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dunno true anot</p>

              <p>Enough is enough - you feel frustrated and rejected. You are
              fighting back and the going is tough. It would be just wonderful if you
              could be left in peace.</p>
              <p>You like the better things in life. You are sensuous and emotional.
              You are a follower of the Arts and you seek an environment that will
              give you the fulfilment to the senses that you need.</p>
              <p>You need a friend - a close friend - and you are willing to become
              emotionally involved with the right person, but you are very demanding
              and particular in your choice of partners. You are constantly looking
              for reassurance and it is perhaps because of this that you tend to be
              somewhat argumentative, but you try to hold back - careful to avoid
              open conflict - since this might reduce your prospects of realising
              your hopes of establishing a warm caring relationship.</p>
              <p>You are feeling helpless. The fact that you are unable to control
              events that are going on around you is subjecting you to considerable
              stress. This can, if not relieved, cause muscle spasms or hypertension.
              It would seem that you are, for whatever the reason, being subjected to
              intolerable pressures. The complete environment would appear to be
              hostile. It would also seem that you are being driven against your
              will. You feel - and perhaps quite rightly so - that unreasonable
              demands are made of you but more to the point you feel as if you are
              powerless to control the situation or protect yourself in any way. At
              this time you feel utterly helpless.</p>
              <p>The tensions induced by trying to cope with conditions which are
              beyond your capabilities, or your reserves of strength, have led to
              considerable anxiety and a sense of personal inadequacy. Your inability
              to take control of the situation causes you to over-react in stubborn
              defiance blaming everyone but yourself for your own failures. <br><br><br><br>Okay, this describes me more in the relationship part, but however, i dont get muscle spasms or whatever. -_-V</p>

              <p>At this time you are feeling 'uptight' and you are urgently in need of rest and relaxation; but perhaps even more than that you need to overcome that feeling that you have been 'hard done by' and treated with a complete lack of consideration. Maybe you have, but whatever may have been the cause of your inherent anxiety, you regard the situation as intolerable. Your are, however, sufficiently competent to turn that situation around - you have overcome similar problems in the past, and really this one isn't too different.</p>
              <p>You are experiencing considerable difficulty trying to achieve your goals. As a consequence of this you are becoming more and more irritable. Your friends and acquaintances are finding it increasingly more difficult to appease or to reason with you. You are the cause of your own problems. Don't be so impulsive. It is your vacillation that can lead to problems and uncertainties. Ease up a little.</p>
              <p>You are a dreamer and you seek perfection in any relationship that you may establish. Some of your ideas and standards are over the top so it may be a good idea to review your perception of life and accept people for what they are - not for what you would like them to be.</p>
              <p>You are experiencing considerable stress which is essentially the result of on going rejection and hostility. You are in the unpleasant position where offers of trust, affection and understanding are being withheld and you are being treaded with a degrading lack of consideration. You feel that you are being denied the appreciation that you deserve, which is essential to your well-being and self-esteem, but you have to face up to the situation because as matters stand at this time there is little that you can do about it - you feel that you are getting nowhere and the continuous struggle is a lonely one: all difficulties and no encouragement. Whatever you try to say or do is met with continuous hostility and no matter how much you protest you are consistently misunderstood. You need to escape from the situation but you are so perplexed that you cannot find the strength of mind to make the necessary decision.</p>
              <p>You are inclined to be too trusting and you feel that you need to be on your guard against the possibility that your endeavours and actions may be misunderstood. Too often you have been taken advantage of and you have been mentally abused. Now you are seeking a relationship which can provide peace of mind, where you can be yourself and not have the need to put on a false front.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wah very accurate if you really choose what colours that comes to your mind...</p>

              <p>You are trying to establish yourself and make an impact despite the fact that everything around you seems to be against you - putting up barriers, but don't be unduly concerned: you have the right ideas and come what may, they will soon be manifested and appreciated.</p>
              <p>You are feeling very vulnerable at this time. Nothing seems to be going in the right direction - business wise, private-life wise, everything. You need some emotional security and an environment which could possibly provide fewer problems, but the way you are feeling you can't be bothered even to make the effort.</p>
              <p>You are a demanding egocentric and therefore quick to take offence. This attitude makes people feel somewhat inadequate when in your company and so it is no wonder that at times you feel alone and unwanted.</p>
              <p>You are feeling trapped by the situation as it stands at this time and what is more, you feel powerless to remedy it. You are stressful, angry and disgruntled. You feel that everything that you try to do to change the situation is thwarted and your hopes and aspirations all seem to be receding into the ever distant future. You have reached the state where you now doubt whether your dreams will ever be achieved and this is not only causing mental stress but heartache. You need to get away from it all - you need to have time to think, to recuperate, to be able to make your own decisions.</p>
              <p>You are trying to build up your own position and you resist all external influences. You insist that you are your own person and you will not tolerate any outside interference. Decisive and proud, you are true managerial material.</p>
