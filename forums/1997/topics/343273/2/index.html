              <p>Okok.. I post mine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are in a state of constant expectation and want interesting and
              exciting things to happen to you. But in fact, you are a 'Walter Mitty'
              at times - a dreamer - over-imaginative and often given to fantasy or
              day-dreaming. There is nothing wrong in 'dreaming' - how boring life
              would be if one just followed the doctrines of everyday life - but one
              must not continue leading a life of continuous fantasy. You need to
              face reality in spite of all its possible shortcomings.</p>
              <p>Always anxious to accept the role of the leader, as indeed you often
              work well with people - but try to stay out of the limelight. You'd
              like a life of ease with no one to rock the boat and someone who
              understands you is so important in your life.</p>
              <p>The present situation, not of your making, is forcing you to
              compromise. You will have to hold back and forgo some of your hopes,
              dreams and aspirations.</p>
              <p>As of late, you have been experiencing untold stress and this is a
              result of continuous frustration. You haven't been taking care of all
              your physical needs and it's beginning to show. It would seem that you
              have a need to find someone to whom you can really relate - someone
              perhaps whose standards are as high as your own. You want to be
              different - to be individualistic - to stand out from the common herd.
              Your inherent control of your sensual instincts is restricting your
              ability to give yourself to open up freely but this being on your own,
              being lonely, often makes you feel the need to give up some of your
              strict standards to surrender to the general flow - to be like everyone
              else; a part of the herd. Deep down you regard such instincts as
              weaknesses to be overcome. You would like to be loved or admired for
              yourself alone. You demand recognition and tender loving care.</p>
              <p>You are putting on a show - a facade. You are a master of
              demonstrating considerable charm in the hope that this can or will lead
              to better things. Deep down you are fearful that this may not work and
              that you may have to employ other strategies in order to realise all
              your ambitions.</p>

You don't need any more battles. You just would like to be able to shout 'stop' and experience a little peace and calm - even if it be only for a little while.

              <p>Name: Yuki<br> Date: 1/7/2009<br> Colorgenics Number: 17203465</p>
              <hr>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At this time you are feeling 'uptight'
              and you are urgently in need of rest and relaxation; but perhaps even
              more than that you need to overcome that feeling that you have been
              'hard done by' and treated with a complete lack of consideration. Maybe
              you have, but whatever may have been the cause of your inherent
              anxiety, you regard the situation as intolerable. Your are, however,
              sufficiently competent to turn that situation around - you have
              overcome similar problems in the past, and really this one isn't too
              different.</p>
              <p>You are a fighter and always on the defensive. You always need to be
              sure that your position is safe and established. When you finally make
              a decision you will pursue it to the bitter end in spite of all
              opposition.</p>
              <p>Your confidence has been shattered. There are so many things that
              you would like to do with your life, so many dreams to be fulfilled -
              and you know that your hopes and dreams are not just figments of your
              imagination, they are real and you are looking for reassurance from
              someone. Basically your fears are such that you may be prevented in
              attaining your hopes and dreams. Even now you would like to broaden
              your fields of endeavour but in order to develop your 'inner- self' you
              need peace and solace. You are distressed by the fear that you may be
              prevented from attaining your goals. What you really need at this
              particular moment in time is quiet reassurance from someone close to
              you to restore your confidence.</p>
              <p>For whatever the reason, you find it extremely difficult to sustain
              relationships - that is to sustain them in the manner that you would
              wish. You are a very gentle sort of person, full of feeling,
              sensitivity and susceptible to love and affection, looking and longing
              for a partner with whom you can enjoy 'All things bright and beautiful'
              - someone with whom you can seek out the more esoteric things of life.
              But up to now this person has only existed in your imagination. You are
              very choosy, appreciative, refined and extremely artistic in
              temperament and it is your hope to seek others who will allow you to
              form and express your own taste and judgement and who at the same time
              may assist you in your intellectual or artistic growth.</p>
              <p>You are inclined to be too trusting and you feel that you need to be
              on your guard against the possibility that your endeavours and actions
              may be misunderstood. Too often you have been taken advantage of and
              you have been mentally abused. Now you are seeking a relationship which
              can provide peace of mind, where you can be yourself and not have the
              need to put on a false front.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quite accurate ah</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Your mind is never at rest.You are
              continually striving to influence all those about you. You have some
              excellent ideas but you persist in trying to persuade others just how
              great your ideas really are. Maybe you are trying too hard. Take it
              easy - remember, 'Everything comes to those who wait'.</p>
              <p>Being a somewhat gentle, emotional and sensitive person, you are at
              this time experiencing a considerable amount of tension. What you
              really need is someone who can be close to you and to listen to what
              you have to say.</p>
              <p>The present situation, not of your making, is forcing you to
              compromise. You will have to hold back and forgo some of your hopes,
              dreams and aspirations.</p>
              <p>Whatever has caused the situation, you just don't seem to be able to
              sustain or maintain relationships as you would wish to. What you really
              seek is to be able to develop a relationship with someone with whom you
              can truly share: Love, Serenity, Peace and Quiet. But you are a very
              demanding person and it is your nature that leads to disquiet and
              discord: you are like the tide, flotsam and jetsam... One minute you
              experience 'highs' and a few moments later 'lows'. This obviously will
              introduce discord into any relationship and with this demanding
              attitude - the ideal state you desire is unable to develop. Despite the
              urge to gratify your natural desires, you impose a considerable
              self-restraint on your instincts in the belief that this demonstrates
              your superiority and raises you above the common herd. You are
              extremely critical of everything that is presently going on around you
              and you find it difficult to listen to or to take advice from anyone.
              You enjoy the original, the ingenious and the subtle.</p>
              <p>You feel that you need to move on. You feel that you are not
              appreciated or valued for what you are and that the time is 'now'.
              Failure to do so will not afford you the conditions to prove your worth.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You have always longed for tenderness,
              love and a sensitivity of feeling into which you would like to blend.
              You are a very gentle warm person and responsive to 'All things bright
              and beautiful'. This personifies a caring person, a person who 'needs'
              and indeed 'needs to be needed'.</p>
              <p>The way things are at this time is causing you considerable stress
              and anxiety. Your friends and acquaintances consider you to be - to say
              the least - difficult and unapproachable. Now it is because of this
              that you need to find some sort of solution. By doing nothing and
              waiting for matters to right themselves will only make things worse,
              but don't rush into making hasty decisions - make haste slowly.</p>
              <p>You are not an argumentative sort of person and 'rather than fight -
              you'd switch' (an old cigarette ad cliche). But when you try to assert
              yourself - as sometimes you may try to do - you meet with so much
              resistance and effrontery that manifests itself so obviously that you
              become hurt, indignant and resentful. So in order to have peace and
              quiet you tend to become inhibited. You keep it all to yourself but
              deep down, you 'feel' and 'hurt' a lot.</p>
              <p>As of late, you have been experiencing untold stress and this is a
              result of continuous frustration. You haven't been taking care of all
              your physical needs and it's beginning to show. It would seem that you
              have a need to find someone to whom you can really relate - someone
              perhaps whose standards are as high as your own. You want to be
              different - to be individualistic - to stand out from the common herd.
              Your inherent control of your sensual instincts is restricting your
              ability to give yourself to open up freely but this being on your own,
              being lonely, often makes you feel the need to give up some of your
              strict standards to surrender to the general flow - to be like everyone
              else; a part of the herd. Deep down you regard such instincts as
              weaknesses to be overcome. You would like to be loved or admired for
              yourself alone. You demand recognition and tender loving care.</p>
              <p>You have so many ideas that you would like to revitalise but you
              need to realise a stable and peaceful condition to do so. Once you can
              free yourself from all the aggravation and tension around you, you will
              make strides that may amaze you. You will not be prevented from
              achieving all the things you so desire.</p>

              <p>You are trying to establish yourself
              and make an impact despite the fact that everything around you seems to
              be against you - putting up barriers, but don't be unduly concerned:
              you have the right ideas and come what may, they will soon be
              manifested and appreciated.</p>
              <p>Always anxious to accept the role of the leader, as indeed you often
              work well with people - but try to stay out of the limelight. You'd
              like a life of ease with no one to rock the boat and someone who
              understands you is so important in your life.</p>
              <p>Matters are not progressing as well as you would have hoped and you
              are having to make concessions - but you still believe that your goals
              are realistic it's just that people can't seem to see your point of
              view. You know what you want but you'll only accept suggestions under
              duress.</p>
              <p>Whatever has caused the situation, you just don't seem to be able to
              sustain or maintain relationships as you would wish to. What you really

              You enjoy the original, the ingenious and the subtle.</p>
              <p>You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the
              only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to
              achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you
              abide by them.</p>
