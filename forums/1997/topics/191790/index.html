(any idea how much will the rental be like, with or without bathroom?) i dun really watch tv, so not an issue there. i suppose utilities will be included in the rental unless excessive usage is there. (but can someone confirm that for me?)<br><br>i need a bed, a working table with a comfy single's sofa or chair. a bookshelf. cupboard for clothes and other personal stuff. simple life, really. but i need to know what i will be facing if i really am living alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>..... If you think moving out is the best option for you right now, dun worry too much just move ahead. You never know what self-discovery you will make when living alone. I got female friends in their early twenties who move out and stay alone by renting a room. Most of them got problems with the family members. Either with parents or siblings.<br><br>For life style changes, just live within your means. Buy what you need and not what you want.  Self-discipline is important, you got to cook, wash laundry, iron, clean your own room and etc all by yourself. You might feel lonely at times or miss your family. Well can visit them every weekends. It is a good test of your state of independent.<br><br>If things don't work out can still go back to your family.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My grandma is renting her 3-room flat to someone for 800 monthly. The occupants are responsible for the utilities payment. She does that since she's staying with my uncle.<br><br>For a single room, I am not quite sure about details and all that. I suppose utilities are covered in the monthly rent for that. Maybe yes, maybe no, you have to ask around.<br><br>As said, the important things are location, how the family staying there is like, TV, cooking area/food etc.<br><br>But my opinion is this, it might be better to really find a friend and then renting an entire flat together, rather than staying together with someone you dun know and having to watch yourself all the time. You might think of just hiding in your room and not coming out but there are situations where you can't do that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you are serious about the idea, it's best to find a housing agent of sorts and ask him to help you find suitable places. It saves you a lot of trouble. Of course, you can save the commission and all that by really going through Classified and stuff.

You are a girl, my advice would be that you take extra care and precaution especially when you are seeking accommodation outside. In short, personal safety should rank priority over price. Below are my thoughts in question form which are non-exhaustive on living alone:<br><br>1. Are you an independent person?<br>2. Can you cook?<br>3. Do you know how to wash laundry?<br>4. Are you streetsmart?<br>5. Are you afraid of the dark?<br>6. Will you feel comfortable living with stranger?<br>7. Are you scard of ghost?<br>8. Are you scard of thunder storm and lightning?<br>9. Have you got prior camping experience?<br>10. Are you able to manage your finance?<br>11. Have you been to the market before?<br>12. What happen if you fall sick outside?<br><br>In my humble opinion, I strongly do not recommend you to move out since you are still a student with no financial means to cope and support yourself with the hefty amount of rental and utility fees. Most importantly, if your decision on moving out is to make an 'escape' for unknown reason, you should know better than me that it will not solve any cause nor erdicate the root of the problem eventually. However, if it is for a short term breather for peace and tranquility, then I would advise you to seek lodging with your trustworthy gal friends instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

You are a girl, my advice would be that you take extra care and precaution especially when you are seeking accommodation outside. In short, personal safety should rank priority over price. Below are my thoughts in question form which are non-exhaustive on living alone:<br><br>1. Are you an independent person?<br>2. Can you cook?<br>3. Do you know how to wash laundry?<br>4. Are you streetsmart?<br>5. Are you afraid of the dark?<br>6. Will you feel comfortable living with stranger?<br>7. Are you scard of ghost?<br>8. Are you scard of thunder storm and lightning?<br>9. Have you got prior camping experience?<br>10. Are you able to manage your finance?<br>11. Have you been to the market before?<br>12. What happen if you fall sick outside?<br><br>In my humble opinion, I strongly do not recommend you to move out since you are still a student with no financial means to cope and support yourself with the hefty amount of rental and utility fees. Most importantly, if your decision on moving out is to make an 'escape' for unknown reason, you should know better than me that it will not solve any cause nor erdicate the root of the problem eventually. However, if it is for a short term breather for peace and tranquility, then I would advise you to seek lodging with your trustworthy gal friends instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>to answer the questions first:<br><br>1) pretty much.<br>2) will not starve myself<br>3) yes<br>4) i'm working on it<br>5) nope<br>6) never did before so dunno. but i guess can get used to it.<br>7) nope<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> erm... does this matter, really?<br>9) same as above<br>10) yes (i can certainly save)<br>11) yes<br>12) take care of myself as always loh.<br><br>alright, so based on that is it alright for me to move out?<br><br>and oh, just to clarify. i am not thinking of moving out immediately. in fact, i plan to do so only after i graduate (both from uni and moe training). so that will be in 3 years' time. i told my mum already, so she got 3 years to get used to that idea.<br><br>and i plan to start living very independently (as in doing all the chores, cooking regularly etc) when i am in moe training, to prepare myself for a life without my mum to do those things for me.<br><br>also, i gave myself this 3 years to see if anything could change in the family, and i will only move out if things remain the same, or gets worse. in that way, i know i didnt rush into this, and i cannot be accused of being rash and infilial or wadever stuff.<br><br>i appreciate all the opinions you guys have given so far. at least nw i have an idea of what to expect.
