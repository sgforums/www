            <div class='col-md body'>Arrgh my boss throwing tantrum again...one of my colleagues must have made a mistake at work and to make the matter worse, he/she didn't fill in the log in and log out book...so I have no way of tracing who works during that time. So suay he asked me who was working during that shift(and I happened to work before that person but it was about 4 days ago and I have been working for a few days in a row) but I can't remember who is it...then he decided to blame me...wtf? I am not the one making the mistake leh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
