But today I had to work 2 hours when he was still around because I was subbing for one of my colleagues who was away. Anyway, he kept making me the butt of his jokes and to make the matters worse, two of my other colleagues who happened to be there joined in and added oil to flames.<br><br>I really hate these type of people...I mean if they are not involved they should just shut up right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
