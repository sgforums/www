            <div class='col-md body'>I got this e-mail from one of my friends. Really meaningful and I hope I can share this with you all.<br><br>By Avalon De Witt<br><br>Ahhh... love! It's what we all seek. Even those who already have it are<br>continually seeking ways to keep it. But what is love, really? How can we<br>know that what we're feeling is not infatuation? What's the difference?<br><br>If you are currently in a relationship or if you hope to be in one, this is<br><br>a very important question. Distinguishing this difference can be very<br>challenging since we can't see love, we can't weigh or measure it to see<br>how<br>great or small it is. And if you are highly psychic, making the distinction<br><br>can be even more challenging because you may naturally feel as though you<br>"know" the person. But if we want to have happy, healthy relationships, we<br>need to identify our feelings accurately.<br><br>Infatuation is like a drug, or a form of madness. You are taken over by a<br>whirlwind, you are consumed by thoughts of the other person and nothing<br>else<br>matters. Your life suddenly revolves around this person and you want to<br>spend every waking moment with him or her. You are in a dream, dizzy with<br>bliss. True love, on the other hand, is more a sense of friendship and<br>respect.<br><br>The surest way to distinguish love from infatuation is to give your<br>relationship the test of time. But while you are waiting for time to tell,<br>there are things you can watch for. Here are 10 questions that can help you<br><br>evaluate your feelings:</div>
          </div>

          <div id='div-gpt-ad-1528181032761-2' style='height:250px; width:300px;'><script>googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1528181032761-2');});</script></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1. Can you be open and honest with your partner without fear of rejection?<br>Are you able to be yourself? Or do you hide your weaknesses and try only to<br><br>show your strengths? When you truly love another, you don't concern<br>yourself<br>with impressing your beloved. Rather, you are more interested in serving<br>your lover and you know that is easier to do when you are honest.<br><br>2. Can you accept the ways in which your partner is different from you?<br>Infatuation is self-centered, thinking primarily of how the other person<br>makes you feel. With infatuation, you see the other person through<br>"rose-colored glasses." But real love is rooted in reality and acknowledges<br><br>the imperfections of another without judgment. It has a deep respect for<br>the<br>other's individuality. When you truly love another, you want to know what<br>makes that person tick, why they do what they do, why they think what they<br>think. With love, faults and weaknesses of the other person are recognized<br>and accepted.<br><br>3. Are you able and willing to discuss your differences with your partner?<br>If you are your own person with your own thoughts, you will experience<br>differences. Can you communicate about your disagreements lovingly? Can you<br><br>"fight fair?" Love can step out of its comfort zone in order to address the<br><br>differences in a relationship without harming it. Some of us have been<br>taught that if you love someone you'll never disagree, never be angry or<br>argue. Real love encompasses all the emotions. The opposite of love is not<br>hate. It is indifference. And it's possible to be angry with, and even hate<br><br>someone that you love. A healthy love relationship will allow you to<br>express<br>anger.<br><br>4. Do you care about the other person's, dreams goals and plans? Do you<br>desire his or her success? To love is to be actively involved with a<br>person's spiritual purpose. It is the choice to give support, nurturing and<br><br>encouragement to your beloved's spiritual growth and attainment. Real love<br>seeks what is best for others and makes us want to encourage them to grow.<br>It considers the other person's happiness and well-being. With true love,<br>your partner's well-being is just as important to you as your own and you<br>take actions to nurture that sense of well-being.<br><br>5. Can you see yourself going through the mundane motions of life and<br>growing old with your partner? Infatuation is attraction, admiration,<br>adoration... and is mainly based on physical, or chemical connection, while<br><br>real love is based on spiritual connection - a common spiritual<br>understanding and shared purpose. It wouldn't matter if your lover lost a<br>leg, gained 300 lbs. or got burned in a fire. With true love, you are<br>attracted to much more than just the physical. You are attracted to the<br>soul<br>of the person. You want to see into your beloved's heart as much as you<br>want<br>to touch him or her physically.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>6. Do you feel good about yourself without your partner's validation?<br>Infatuation depends on others for validation. When you truly love someone,<br>you have a genuine sense of security, confidence, self-reliance and<br>self-respect. Life is complete with or without your beloved. You're aware<br>that you and your partner have different gifts. You approve of yourself<br>just<br>as much as you approve of your partner. You take responsibility for your<br>own<br>life and you allow your partner to take responsibility for his or her own<br>life. You can feel complete without your partner.<br><br>7. Are you able to give as well as receive? True love makes giving of<br>yourself to the other person as easy and as fulfilling as getting something<br><br>back. The relationship is much more than what you are getting out of it.<br>The<br>give and take are shared. Infatuation is want, need, but real love is<br>abundant and fulfilling. When we are fulfilled, we find it easy to give. We<br><br>can give even as we are receiving, by utilizing what the other has to offer<br><br>for our own spiritual growth. This is a most powerful form of giving for it<br><br>gives meaning to the other person's gifts.<br><br>8. Do you have a life of your own? With real love, you don't live for the<br>other person completely. You still have your own direction in life. You're<br>not afraid to "take your space" or to give some to your partner. You allow<br>enough space to let the winds of heaven dance between you. Other<br>relationships, activities and interests continue to be important to you.<br>You<br>see the goodness in all people, not just your partner. Time and space can't<br><br>separate you. It's impossible to feel unfulfilled when you are truly in<br>love<br>because you can always feel your beloved's presence, therein lies the<br>fulfillment.<br><br>9. How would you feel if your love was unrequited? Could you love the other<br><br>person enough to respect his or her choices, even if those choices exclude<br>you? Real love needs nothing in order to live. It is not dependent on being<br><br>loved in return. With true love, you are more focused on the "now moments"<br>of the relationship than on the future or outcome of it. Whether or not<br>your<br>love is returned is of no consequence when you truly love another. You may<br>feel sad if your beloved doesn't love you back, but it won't stop you from<br>loving.<br><br>10. Does your love endure? If love is true, the relationship will remain<br>strong under the strains of life. The relationship is more than just joy<br>and<br>happiness. You can cry together, suffer together and even be angry<br>together.<br>But whatever your experience, the love will always remain. It is eternal.<br>Infatuation will either develop into true love or it will die.<br><br>If after reading this you've discovered that you are infatuated and not<br>really in love, take heart! Real love doesn't try to force a relationship<br>to<br>grow. It respects its natural pace. But you can greatly increase your<br>relationship's chances of moving to the next level by learning what people<br>in true love do and following that example.</div>
