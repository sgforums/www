            <div class='col-md body'>We should look beyond this student-teacher issue. I find Singaporeans in general are a petty lot. Before blogging became cover story material, I'm sure every local blogger has been flamed at least once and I suspect most of these flamers are local and not even bloggers in the first place.<br><br>I agree that blogging is a healthy outlet for expression. We should encourage it and not censor it. For those very few bloggers who have gone overboard (like inciting extremism, terrorism, racism, etc) they should be counselled. If not for blogging, we wouldn't know that there's racism in the current generation!<br><br>I think it's the Singaporean mentality to live in this ideal facade where any bad things are swept under the carpet. As they say, if you don't talk about the problem, there is no problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my point of the view with regards to the teachers complaining about students' blogs:<br><br>I do agree that teachers might be a bit petty for complaining about such stuff. But think about what will happen if the teacher continues to have an "ignorance is bless" idea. The students will keep blogging about how this teacher is so bad and so stupid etc etc, and it might result in the other students of the class, even though they might be neutral towards the teacher, to join the student and join forces against the teacher. You know how peer pressure and group mentality is like.<br><br>In the end, it might result in the whole class going against the teacher, even though one student have valid complaints about the teacher. What'll happen to the teacher and the class that he/she is continuing to teach? Can the teacher still be able to properly teach a class that has gone against him/her?<br><br>Teachers' job are getting harder. Let's not allow events that will make their job even harder to happen..... *sighz*<br><br>P.S: There is a high chance I might be a teacher in future. I must say that the current student culture is really different from when I was a student at that particular level. I do wonder whether I have the ability to handle these "wild monkeys" in the event I do become a teacher..... *sighz*<br><br>P.P.S: starblue, any opinion?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought teachers very busy one? Forum keeps complain teachers got alot to do lah.. so teach less learn more.. have people to help in CCA, outsource school duties etc.<br><br>Now they so free? read papers! they type their own name in the search engines! How lame! So free eh?? Why so consious about what others think of them? If it's not blogged, it'll be spread through canteen chat etc anyways!<br><br>So teachers should just get back to marking their assignments!<br><br>Note: I reckon only a small percentage of teachers actually care about such stuff.. most don care , or so they seem.<br><br>I think teachers should have blogs and provide their students their links.. so the students know the teachers will be reading them!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The recent reports abt schools acting swifting to discipline students who blog about their teachers with profanities has been well covered.<br><br>The thing abt blogs is that people tend to reveal their aggressive nature. Anger is usually the first thing they sprout. Biased impressions of people are next and that merely adds fuel to the fire. In a school where one teacher may be ostricised because of over-exaggerated rumours, rumour mills will start going and stories become more far-fetched.<br><br>The result is when they hit the blogs, the stories and comments become outright fantasy.<br><br>People have been given the right and freedom to express themselves. But they also have to be responsible and mature about it. Stay objective and focus more on mistakes by teachers and how they can better address them.<br><br>No student is going to be penalised for that.</div>
