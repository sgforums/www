From what I know, defamation suits only cover people who twisted facts, not because they publish their opinions.<br><br>Not only this, isnt this akin to using a butcher knife to slaying a chicken?<br><br>On top of that, I question the teachers' wanting to search for the latest rumours on them and punishing those responsible for it. This is like some sort of losers who cannot present an ethical image to their students, and being egoistic by trying to quash rumours thru heavy punishment.<br><br>Sheesh...<br><br></div>

There'll also be a downside on the parents' side as well. Their kids will not mature. Their generation is going to suffer. Their generation will lose out.<br><br>So, PARENTS.. listen up! Do u want ur kids to further expand ur legacy? Or do u want to leave a generation of legacies? Choice is yours.<br><br>And if your future generation doesn't become successful, don't blame many of the teachers who worked hard. Blame urselves for not bringing them up well.<br><br>Sometimes, I really wonder what parents define success as.<br><br>Let me explain to u infants then.<br><br><strong>SUCCESS IS NOT WHAT U BECOME IN THE END.
