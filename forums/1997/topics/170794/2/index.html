A new year meaning a new dawn.. the ending of this year.A new life and opportunity to this changing world.<br><br>I look back at this time and i have to be grateful to my close brothers. This year has been an eventful year. I believe there is a God, and i believe its this God that has watched over me like my close brothers. I thank him for the money opportunities , surviving a shotgun attack at my older god bro, falling in a steep slope at site , slashed at while collecting an overdue payment n busted by the po po's at the wrong time n wrong place. Looking at the negative moments it makes me wiser , experienced and strive towards a better understanding of the human nature.<br><br>Resolutions:<br>I admit to not being a very nice person. I know i wa a S.O.B , i hope that next year i will better myself, be more understanding and try to cut down on any unhealthy acitivities. Try not to let money blind me. The Past is History , The Present is a Gift and the Future is a Mystery. I wish that all you guys's resolutions will come true , if not , at least half! Or its like making empty promises to urself and to those around.N I HOPE DAMN RATS DIE THE MOST HORRIBLE DEATHS IMAGINABLE!<br><br>WISH Starblue Heaven a happy new year..  in the mean time, i have 3 more days to party La Vida Loca.. n induldge myself in the forbidden pleasures.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> May Your New Years be great!<br><br>ps&gt; i wanna go Sentosa Rave Party..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  he he... until next year!<br><br>peace!</div>
