            <div class='col-md body'>ok fine, so coolmyth said sth that u dun like to hear, so why keep pushing the matter? just let it rest. It is not even worth pursuing. Sometimes I wonder why people like to create trouble when it is so much better to just keep peace.<br><br>You have made your point known, stellazio. And you have abused this thread enuff. I am not standing by anyone's side here, but everyone who is here can see that this thread is not serving its real purpose anymore, other than for you to keep arguing with coolmyth. I would like to ask both of you to stop arguing with each other anymore. Because to argue on the Net and win will get you nothing, gedit? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>v <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> v</div>

And pests are annoying. They do not exactly harm, but they get into your hair and you feel like picking them up and flinging them out.<br><br>You want to know why I call you a PEST? First of all, someone less of a pest wud just stop replying and not get into a petty argument about one little small matter. You not only argued, but you have created so many posts that they can fill up until a few pages of this thread. If this is not the definition of being a pest, I seriously do not know what is it.<br><br>Secondly, someone more sensible would have just stopped after my frequent reminder to not 'pollute' this thread here. If you dun like the way we do things here, you can just dun step in here anymore. Simple and easy.<br><br>But of cos you wun, because if you do, you wouldn't have earned yourself the reputation of being a Pest in Starblue's Heaven.<br><br>Just my opinion. I am not siding with anyone here. I have asked also asked coolmyth to stop replying to you.</div>

And this thread is not meant to be a place for people to have a frenly banter. Want to banter, go to the crapbox. Easy and simple. I will be able to handle him better over there, because as a mod, I am struggling to keep people from going out of the point too much.<br><br>So I hope he will answer your question in the crapbox thread, or you can just edit it and post it in the crapbox.
