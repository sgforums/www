            <div class='col-md body'>kids nowadays... i cant blame em parents. Its not about not trusting you.. its more like so many shiet happening around them that it will affect thier judgement and they get paranoid. U gotta put urself in thier shoes. But it can get furstrating when they intrude on your privacy.. especially stuffs like this. Its pretty much the same as your mum opening your bank statement even though u are self sufficient and a working person..now THAT sucks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think ur parents could be receiving some lousy advice from neighbours or relatives or friends...<br><br>cuz normally how would they know about passwords and school accounts and grades online etc...must be some people "tiao po li chian"....dun "san pah" aunties, etc...<br><br>all the more you should communicate more with your parents. AND TRY not to FLARE up when chatting with your parents.<br><br>Next time, observe who is the person who flare up first, if its your parents, then you tell them they should not, if its you, then you should tone down and control yourself.<br><br>my 20cents worth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
