I know they love me a lot, but the trust and understanding element is just now there.<br><br>Like for how many times I have told them not to call early in the morning at my place, because I would prolly be sleeping. Still they always chose to call at 7am. Never mind, I will forgive them on this one since they might have forgotten how to do the time conversion and everything. But it is fact that I have told them a lot of times about how to do it but they will still forget and call me at 7am anyway. So I have since learnt how to deal with that and shut up about this issue.<br><br>The conversation will usually start slow and smooth. My mom would be dishing out all sorts of advices, asking me how I am doing, bla bla bla. That is just the calm before the storm. Before long, they would start to ask about how I am doing in school and when I told them my results, they would not believe me. This morning, what they asked of me is just simply ridiculous. They asked me to give them all the passwords that I am using so that they can log into my school account and check my grades for me. No matter what I told them, they insisted and a big verbal fight ensues.<br><br>I am really tired of all this lack of trust and understanding.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>must u always listen to yr parent...just say ki si and end the conversation....unowadays u cant 100% listen to ur parents..</div>
