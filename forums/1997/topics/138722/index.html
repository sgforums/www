            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Starblue, I dreamt about you.</strong><br><br>A dreamÂ…I am sure it was only a dream. I felt you sitting beside me. Something that will never happen to a nobody like me. You were sited on my left, my favorite side. I wanted to put my left arms around you but hesitated. Your warmth was assuring. It was sensuousÂ…sensuously calm and reassuring. Out of all the seats available you had decided to choose that seat on that favorite side of mine. I felt special.<br><br>Ravendinho had eyes on you all semester. And there he was seated at the Â‘only outstanding students can seat hereÂ’ portion of the hall. Instead you choose to sit down beside me and that felt good. I felt my heart racing. I could swear just moments ago it was beating in time to that song being played. But since you sat down and I started feeling your warm body beside me it started beating faster. Twice as fast I estimated.<br><br>Are we able to use or nose in our dreams? Was I really just dreaming. I am sure it was a dreamÂ…for I know something so wonderful could not possibly be happening to me.  If it was a dream then I am probably the only person in the world to be able to use the olfactory senses during a dream. Because when you were seated beside me in my dream, I could smell your body. You were wearing that perfume, that same perfume you had being using all semester. Boy how I had fantasized about you all semester each time you passed by. How many times had I fantasized you with nothing on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  but just that perfume. Was I about to realize this impossible fantasy?<br><br>Why did you choose to seat beside me? Were you just trying to make Ravendinho jealous? If you were it worked. Ravendinho stood up and walked towards us. I canÂ’t possibly die in a dream could I. Ravendinho and I were both in the school rugby team. As Ravendinho walked toward us, he had that Maori ceremonial Hakka look in his eyes and I knew immediately he meant business.<br><br>This dream had turned into a nightmare. With a heart beating trice as fast now, I stood upÂ…(Please continue <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br></div>
