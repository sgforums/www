            <div class='col-md body'>Jus a lil something i thought to share w u guys. (got it via email)<br><br>I was looking for a rental apartment and I spotted an Executive<br>&gt;Condominium in The Straits Time Classifieds.  It was in Blk38, #10-44, The<br><br>&gt;Floravale, located at Westwood Ave, at Jurong West extension, near Jalan<br>&gt;Bahar, it was near to my work place and and the price was attractive!  The<br>&gt;agent who advertised turned out to be the owner himself (I found out later<br><br>&gt;that it was so because no other agent would want to help him market the<br>&gt;unit after showing their first prospective tenants) .So I arranged a<br>&gt;viewing with the agent cum owner and rented it on spot because I was then<br>&gt;desperately in need of a place to stay.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When I reached the apartment, I saw a BIG Cross on the main door, I'm a<br>&gt;catholic so I didn't take it to heart.  I viewed the apartment, I found<br>&gt;that it was renovated nicely and I was told by the owner that the he and<br>&gt;his wife had only stayed for a short while and moved out because it was<br>&gt;far away from their work place.  The owner looked nice enough, a gentle<br>&gt;speaking man, I was in urgent need of a place to stay and it didn't take<br>&gt;me long to put a deposit-  I was thinking, I'm just renting a placve, not<br>&gt;buying and the price was extremely cheap and I could have the whole 3<br>&gt;bedroom aparment for myself at an incredible rent, no need to be fussy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;As the owner had bought the EC from HDB direct, they can't sell the EC<br>&gt;yet(5 yrs rule) so they could only rent the place out for now. I came to<br>&gt;know from neighbours later that more that 5 families had come and gone<br>&gt;during these time. The neighbours also told me the actual reason the<br>&gt;owners left was because the family had problems. lots of financial<br>&gt;problem.  The husband owed the loan shark lots of money, even the security<br><br>&gt;guards had to be instructed to stop debt collectors from coming to the<br>&gt;house.  The family was breaking up.  The husband was seeing another woman<br>&gt;and he wanted a divorce.  The wife refused and hence they quarreled<br>everyday.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;So please check with the surrounding neighbours before you rent or<br>&gt;purchase a flat which now I learn. Ok! now I will listed all the<br>&gt;incidences happened during my two months there.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1) One night after watching TV alone, I think it was about 2.00am and I<br>&gt;was walking back from the living room past the dining room to the bedroom<br>&gt;to sleep, I heard a boy's voice(very clearly) calling my name once and<br>&gt;instinctly I turn my head to my left where the voice came from. My whole<br>&gt;body went cold when there was nothing there at all! I rent the whole place<br>&gt;for my own and there could be no one else in the house!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2) It was in the afternoon, I was washing her hair in the bedroom toilet.<br>&gt;As I was sitting on the edge of the bath tub bending forward holding the<br>&gt;shower above my head washing my hair, suddenly, I felt that someone gave<br>&gt;me a hard push above my head. I was unable to see that time cos my eyes<br>&gt;were covered with shampoo, but I could discern a black shadow in the form<br>&gt;of a 'human(?)' in front of me.  Again, there could be no other person in<br>&gt;the house!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;3) (This one is real spooky) It was when I met a neighbour next door.  I<br>&gt;was instructed not to talk with the neighbours cos the owner had rented<br>&gt;out the whole unit illegally, so this was the first time I had talked to<br>&gt;my neighbour.  Then, during our conversation, they mentioned, "Where is<br>&gt;your son?" I told them that I am single and I stay alone but they insisted<br>&gt;that they saw themself, when I left the main door open while I was in the<br>&gt;hall watching TV on the sofa, there was a boy playing next to me and he<br>&gt;was about 3 yrs old!!. Both husband &amp; wife saw that!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;5) There was one evening at about 11.00pm. I was having my bath then when<br>&gt;I turn to face the wall behind me, I got a shock! There was a black figure<br>&gt;like a human child on the wall! I was shaking like a leave and naturally<br>&gt;used the hot shower spray and spray to that direction.
