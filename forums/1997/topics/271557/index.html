"Pins and needles" happens to be the most accurate description of the effect. And if you had bothered to read my posting carefully, pressure on a nerve point may also cause similar effects.

This enables us to see colors.<br><br>But for tetrachromatic, they have 4 photopigment cones.<br><br><blockquote>A recent paper by Kimberly Jameson, Susan Highnote and Linda Wasserman of the University of California, San Diego, concerning females who may have tetrachromacy shows amazing results. <span style="font-style: italic;">Up to 50 per cent of women are tetrachromatic</span> and can use their extra pigments in "contextually rich viewing circumstances". For example, when looking at a rainbow, tetrachromat females can segment it into, on average, 10 different colours, whereas their trichromat brothers and sisters can see only seven, much as Isaac Newton's red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Consequently, for those special tetrachromat women, this island that they inhabit may be seen in emerald, jade, verdant, olive, lime, bottle and 34 other shades of green.

In clinical medicine, pins and needles or 'pain shooting up' the arm or legs may indicate a disease condition affecting the nerves. E.g. if you get a slipped disc that pinches on a nerve root taht supplies the leg, you get shooting pain down the leg. Some diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy complain of pins and needles, possibly because it is the small sensory nerves that are primarily damaged in diabetes.<br><br>The pins and needles you get when you sleep in an awkward position is because the blood supply is compromised (not completely cut off). Actually you get the sensation AFTER blood supply has been restored. Most likely that relates to the build-up of metabolites during the period of relative hypoxia. The return of blood supply to the region stimulates the nerves, possibly because the high lactic acid and other metabolites in the vasa nervorum.<br><br>There is a rich vascular plexus in the skin with communicating channels. It is harder to compromise blood supply to the skin just because your arm is hanging over the edge of your bed. On the other hand, a major blood vessel in the arm. e.g your brachial artery may well be compressed with your arm in the position. The blood supply is reduced, but not cut off (or you would have lost your arm in the morning). The buildup of metabolites distal to the obstruction causes your pins and needles.<br><br>Actually, as with all forms of pain, paraesthesia is a warning sign that something is not right. If you ignore it and the inciting cause persists eg. disk prolapse and diabetes, eventually the pins and needle sensation will stop when those nerves are completely dead.<br><br>2) most humans are trichromatic in their vision. that is due to the 3 kinda of cones we have. i hear that some primate species are dichromatic, having only have 2 kinds of cones (opsin proteins being coded for in the X chromosome). hence, some female monkeys with heterzygosity for those opsin genes are actually trichromatic. what about humans? are there human females who are tetrachromatic?<br><br>I am not aware of such a gender difference but sorry, it's not my field.<br><br>3) there is a recent new health product in the market, transdermal glucosamine. does that really work? can u actually get the glucosamine to be absorbed right down to your bones, much less for bone strengthening?<br><br>Really? Transdermal glucosmine? I do not know of the product and so I cannot really comment. But I would be very skeptical that an ionic compound can penetrate the lipid membranes of the keratinocytes, unless they have somehow conjugated the glucosamine to a lipid molecule. Even so, I have never been particularly convinced of the usefulness of such nutrient supplements. Ask the supplier for scientific publications and then we'll see.</div>

Quite different from nerve pain, often described as shooting pain or pins and needles. Nothing to worry about and probably related to posture. Incidentally, migraine is also vascular...the blood vessels constrict for soem reason and then dilate, causing the throbbing pain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4) why does salt cause our food to taste much better, when if taken alone causes anyone to frown? is there a science as to how the "taste" of salt in registered in our tastebuds?<br><br>No, I do not why. I think one of the regular forumners is into nutritional science....she can probably answer this question better.<br><br>5) some people now use sweeteners instead of sugar for their coffees and tea. once, i added a few of those Equal "pills" into my tea. the first sip of the tea and i thought, oh sht, i might have added too much. but subsequent sips didnt taste all that sweet afterall. it was as if i hadnt even added any sweetener at all. wad is going on?<br><br>Really? Equal contains aspartame, I think, and that is many times sweeter than sugar weight for weight. At one time there was some concern about health risks (not proven) and I wonder if they have lowered the concentration. I can tell the difference between the sweetness with ordinary sugar and that of aspartame. Perhaps your sense of taste is better developed than most and so you are able to distinguish the sweetness of aspartame as being a different flavour rather than recognizing it as sweet. This is not my field and perhaps we can hear from a nutritionist.<br><br>Incidentally, the BBC had a programme talking about those who are fussy eaters tend to have more prominent taste buds and so are better able to distinguish between flavours compared to most others. Maybe you are one of them.<br><br>6) when different people sneeze, they sound different. there's the very loud ones. there's the "hold nose and a small nasal snort comes out" kind. there are people who "abort" a sneeze only to utter "achoo" a sec later. how do we all sneeze differently?<br><br>A sneeze is a forceful expulsion of air from the lungs initiated by nerve endings in the nasal mucosa. An irritant in the trachea results in a cough. Actually the two are quite similar: forced contraction of the diaphragm and chest wall to expel air in a bid to remove the irritant. Although the sneeze response is mostly involuntary, the way the air is directed will result in different sounds. Some people direct air out completely through the nose and mouth, others consciously try to hold it down. Try it: next time you sneeze, try to modify the sound by directing it differently.<br><br>7) what exactly are moles? (i dunno if i've asked this already, but i still dun quite understand). how do they begin? how do they disappear? why are some persistent.<br><br>ok...I know a bit more about this. Moles are localised skin pigmentation due to local proliferation of melanocytes. Quite a number of conditions are called 'moles'. In general, they are a response to sunlight and there are strong genetic and racial influences.<br><br>A uniform increase in the number of melanocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction in a linear fashion produces a lentiges or ephilis. That is a flat patch of skin pigmentation. What is commonly recognized as a 'mole' is a melanocytic nevus. That is a nest or nests of melanocytes. They usually start at the dermal-epidermal junction as a 'junctional nevus' and then drop into the dermis as they mature. If the nests are completely located in the dermis, they are called an 'intradermal nevus' (and are often raised as a nodule). If it is located in both locations, it is a compound nevus.<br><br>Melanocytic nevus can persist or with time, they may mature and be replaced by fat (lipomatous metaplasia). Sometimes an inflammatory reaction occurs against the mole, destroying the melanocytes and producing a halo nevus as the edge of the mole loses its pigmentation due to lymphocytic attack. very rarely, some cases can turn malignant and become a melanoma. I do not know why some moles regress and others persist.<br><br></div>
