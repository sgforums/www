For males, the voicebox will enlarge and hence the adam's apple. The pitch will drop with the enlargment. Females will also have male hormones but in lesser quantity however their voices will remain high pitch unless they are genetically born with larger voiceboxes. As people age, phelgm builds up in the respiratory tract and cause air-flow to be reduced and hence a lower tone.[b]</blockquote></div>

Your pupils do dilate when you shut your eyes for a long period so that your pupils have time to adjust. If the environment then becomes too bright and the light penetrates through your eyelids, the dilated pupils may allow too much to light to enter. On the other hand, if you close your eyes to a slit and allow some light in so that your pupils do not dilate as much, your pupils are accomodated to handle more light and so you might find it less uncomfortable. Wear a eye mask to sleep...I do.<br><br>On the other hand, if you mean that if you squint your eyes to see through the slits of your eyelids, you can deal with bright lights better. it may be that when you try to see through the slits of your eyes, you are also raising the facial muscles up to block the light into your eyes. Try look at the ceiling light with your eyes shut and again by screwing up your face as if you are trying to see through the slits of your eyes but don't allow any light in. You will find that it appears darker.<br><br>2. You are talking about post-partum alopecia effluvium. The sudden withdrawal of estrogens after the pregnancy send the hair follicles into the anagen phase. But that's nothing to worry about...the hair is shed because new hair follicles are growing up underneath...there is no permanent loss. The quacks out there can make a fast buck by selling herbs and things to bring the hair back, confident in the knowledge that it will grow back...in fact, new hair is the cause of the shedding in the first place.<br><br>3. The shape and the size of the larynx (voice box) changes with age and gender difference. They affect the frequency of the voice. Transexuals may undergo laryngoplasty to re-shape the larynx in order to feminize their voices.<br><br>4. Yes and no. Some antibiotics eg. fluoroquinolones, tetracycline have been known to cause photosensitivity. Similarly, there have been rare reports of oral contraceptive induced photodermatoses. However, for most people, that is a rare adverse effect. But why do you want to tan yourself? Excessive sunlight damages collagen and ages your skin.<br><br>5. In the perimenopausal age group, the hormonal cycles may be irregular and there may be more frequent anovulatory cycles (i.e failure to release an egg during a cycle). In the absence of ovum release, there is a lack of progesterone release to luteinize the thickened endometrial lining built up during the pre-ovulatory phase. Delayed ovulation and anovulation therefore result in an abnormally thickened endometrium which will eventually break down with more blood loss than usual.<br><br>6. If you lose alot of blood at each period, wouldn't be surprised that you feel tired and lethargic. My sis used to have severe menstrual cramps and after each period she has to sleep more to get over the pain and anguish (and the insomnia) of each painful cycle. Check your blood haemoglobin.</div>

              <p><br>Haha...sorry..have been busy with the students. Things should get better in July when I finish teaching my module. Whilst I am here, will try to answer some of your earlier questions..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) women have 2 ovaries. do they alternate in ovulation every month? one month this ovary ovulates, the next month the other ovary, and so on?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No, quite random although statistically ovulation occurs with fairly equal frequencies on both sides (<span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";     '><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=Search&amp;Term=%22Ecochard%20R%22%5BAuthor%5D&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstract"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; "><span style="color: #888888;">Ecochard R</span></span></a><span style="color: #888888;">, </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=Search&amp;Term=%22Gougeon%20A%22%5BAuthor%5D&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstract"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; "><span style="color: #888888;">Gougeon A</span></span></a><span style="color: #888888;">.</span></span><span style="color: #888888;"><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";      '> Side of ovulation and cycle characteristics in normally fertile women.</span><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";     '> <a><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; ">Hum Reprod.</span></a></span> 2000 Apr;15(4):752-5.)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>2) how to gauge if a menstrual flow is heavy or light? i mean... we don't go around comparing the amount with other ladies, do we? <img title="Embarassed" src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The anount does vary between individuals. You can gauge a change in flow by the number of pads used, degree of soak and the presence of blood clots. A lot of blood clots indicates heavy flow.</p>
              <p> <br><br>3) why dun pesticides not harm humans? or do they, in large quantities?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They do harm humans, depending on the type and amounts. Organophosphate pesticides/insecticides are often used in suicide attempts in the developing world (and occasionally in Singapore). They block the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the neuromuscular junction. Quite commonly used in poisoning cases in agricultural societies and was originally developed as a chemical weapon.<br><br>4) how do hair removal creams work in removing hair? do they.... digest the follicles, or what?<br>The most common alkaline ones contain calcium thioglycolates which break down the disulphide bonds in keratin and so act directly on the hair shafts. They do not penetrate into the follicles deep within the skin that much. Some newer depilatory agents like Vaniqa(TM) are supposed to act on the follicles to slow down hair growth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be careful with depilatory creams...some people are sensitive to the high pH and some get a contact eczema.</p>

              <p>whether or not OM is a real doctor is of no consequence to me. i dun care if he is a real doctor, or if he googled his answers, re-edited them, added in pseudo-sciency stuff in his explanations, as long as they sound credible, they add to my pool of known facts. whether or not, and when, i validate his claims is up to me.</p>
