Day after day starblue sat at the window gazing at the distance, watching the birds flying freely and lamenting her fate. This day, however, she found one of the birds land on her window, watching her. It was a bird so black, all colors seemed to swirl within its ebony feathers as the sun shoned on it.<br><br>"what manner of beast art thou? oh winged creature?" starblue asked.<br><br>"nevermore." said the bird, unblinking, perched still on the window, Its liquid eyes glittering.<br><br>starblue lamented, "I am lonely, and trapped is my spirit in this prison. my heart desires freedom, and love, could you help me, oh winged friend?"<br><br>the bird looked at her curiously, then nodded and flew off. spreading her words to the lands.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Krobeen the farm boy stared forlornly at the sunset, like he did every other day. The last rays of the sun bathed everything in a beautiful orange hue.  He dreamed of a life of adventure, and grandeur. How he wished to be like the heroes in the tales he heard from his father when he was young, of valiant knights battling evil to save damsels in distress.<br><br>"If only I could go around killing beasts and taking their treasure, such as "stone of jordan" or "windforce bow", now that would be epic" thought Krobeen. but as he looked down at his tattered shirt and mud covered bare feet, he sighed as he returned to his farm house to tend to the chickens.<br><br>as he turned, he caught sight of a black silhouette against the setting sun, now barely still above the horizon. It was a crow, Krobeen thought, and as a farmer he hated crows, so he took up his pitch fork and chased after it. shouting "damn crow!!! I'm gonna kill meself a damn crow!!" the bird, startled, dashed past the boy and landed on a haystack. Krobeen swung his pitchfork at the bird but accidentally hit the oil lamp, the lamp dropped onto the haystack, and the bird agily dodged it and flew up.<br><br>"Oh Shit, what have I done?" Korbeen muttered as flames spread through the hay, igniting everything in its path. soon the entire farmhouse was alight. wood crackled and the ceiling toppled in flames. Krobeen shook his head helplessly as he realized that his home has been destroyed. soon the fire spread to hte crops and the crops caught fire as well.<br><br>"I will get you for this crow, I am going to dedicate my life to killing you!!!" Krobeen shook his fist at the bird. the bird simply flew away.<br><br>Krobeen chased after it.<br><br>He had nothing to lose.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reaching to the ground, krobeen picked up a black feather, so black that when the sunlight shone on it, he could see a swirl of colors.<br><br>"It is near, I've tracked it down." Krobeen whispered to himself. Blinded in his rage, he had failed to realize that the only reason he has managed to find the bird was because the bird was purposely being conpicuous, and not due to any of Krobeen's investigative abilities. Therefore, Krobeen congratulated himself on his keen senses and swore once more to kill the bird.<br><br>In a short distance away, he caught sight of the bird again, flying towards some kind of a tower. Its nest must be in the tower, Krobeen thought, thinking himself smart.  Off he went towards the tower, sliding down some rocks then climbing a short slope. There it stood before him, a dark and gloomy pillar of stone, as if its mocking him, daring him to come test his mettle.<br><br>"hmm.." Krobeen pondered his next step. SHould he scale the outer walls? just then, he caught sight of a beautiful face throught the window on the top level of the tower. It was a face so fair, many men would have risked life and limb to kiss it. Krobeen stood there stunned, mesmerised by the beauty, until a sweet and sultry voice broke his paralysis.<br><br>"Ah, so the ebony friend has led my rescuer here!! what be thy name? oh most valiant of men?"<br><br>"umm...huh? oh I..err....I am Krobeen" Krobeen stuttered, and he shifted his weight to one leg, then the other, suddenly nervous that the beauty decided to speak to him, and totally forgotten of the bird. "and....what is your name, fair maiden?" Krobeen managed to say.<br><br>"My name is starblue, and I have been trapped here by an evil queen!! how my soul long for freedom!! save me, brave Krobeen!" pleaded starblue.<br><br>remembering the tales that his father told him, Krobeen suddenly realized that he was in a grand adventure, and he was being given the chance to save the damsel in distress. Collecting his wits, Krobeen said in the most confident tone he could muster, and shouted "drop down your hair, fair maiden, and I will climb up atop it" recalling a tale about a girl dropping down her hair to let the hero climb up.<br><br>And so starblue threw her hair down, it was black and shiny, as black as the obsidian bird's feathers. When one looked upon her hair, it was as if one looked into the night time sky, like black silk adorned with glittering stars. Krobeen started to climb up the hair, his heart racing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>His muscles corded and flexing, Krobeen finally managed to reach the window. "How may I be of service, my lady?" Krobeen said with a bow, the best he could do since he was only a farmer.<br><br>"Thank you, valiant hero, but as you were climbing, another gentlemen has already reached here." starblue said.<br><br>"what? how?" Krobeen replied, surprised at the turn of events, how was that possible? how could someone possibly have gone up the tower while he was climbing?<br><br>"its simple, my uneducated farmer friend, I took the lift." replied a voice, as the speaker stepped out of the shadows. Krobeen cursed under his breathe that he had not been able to notice the person standing in the shadows, as he considered his senses keen, after all, hadn't Krobeen tracked a bird all the way here? A lift? what in the abyss was a lift?? the farm boy wondered.<br><br>"and with your unjustified pride in your abilities and poor senses, its a miracle you have made it this far." the person mocked, grinning. his face was still covered in shadows, leaving only his mouth visible. Furious, Krobeen screamed "step out of the shadows and face me!!"<br><br>In a practiced step, the man moved forward, graceful as a cat and yet eerie like a wraith. Krobeen could make out his features now, the man wore a perpetual frown and a scowl, seemingly angry, or maybe thoughtful. and the glitter in his eyes showed that he was a cunning and formidable opponent. His hair was long and messy and was black like starblue's, the only difference being that while starblue's hair shone like the night sky, this man's obsidian hair spoke of death, sorrow and darkness. the man had a goatee, giving his a sly look in addition to the grin he now wore, which was getting on Krobeen's nerves.<br><br>TO Krobeen's surprise and anger, the hated black bird flew in and landed on the man's shoulder.<br><br>"ah, the winged friend." said starblue with a chuckle.<br><br>Krobeen glared at the bird, then at the man and looked like he was going to explode with rage. his fists clencched and his knuckles became white due to the lack of bloodflow. he gritted his teeth so hard his jaw muscles bunched up.<br><br>The man looked at the fuming Krobeen with an amused expression. "you know my black feathered friend, boy?" He mocked with a laugh.<br><br>"Damn crow!! it destoryed everything that I own, of course I know it!! I will know it even if it was burnt to ash!!" Krobeen said, almost going berserk and on the verge of leaping at the man.<br><br>The man smiled calmly and replied "you are such an uneducated peasant, my friend. its not a crow, its a raven."<br><br>"whatever it is, I am going to get you for my loss!!" Krobeen screamed, and drew his rusty sword, charging at the man.<br><br>starblue screamed with shock, but in his berserk state Krobeen did not hear it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the bird leapt from the man's shoulders as he deftly jumped backwards from  Krobeen's powerful initial charge. Furious, Krobeen swung his sword wildly at the bird but missed.<br><br>"what are you doing? Krobeen?" starblue asked, frightened.<br><br>"raven battle!!!!!" Krobeen replied, trying to stab at the bird.<br><br>"rofl n00b" the man taunted.<br><br>Krobeen had no idea what that meant, but he knew it to be a taunt, and changed his target from the darting bird to him, and thrust his sword at the man.<br><br>In a movement too fast for Krobeen to follow, two swords appeared in the man's hands. the man followed along the thrust with his left sword, then twisting his sword to sweep Krobeen's attack far, then going in with his own thrust with his right sword.<br><br>Krobeen leapt back, narrowing escaping the fate of being impaled on the sword. But in actual fact, the man did not even use any effort in that thrust.<br><br>panting, the farm boy asked defiantly, "who are you?"<br><br>"I'm the.raven." the man replied with a grin.<br><br>"You are a raven??!" Krobeen asked, not surprised, since the man kept a raven himself.<br><br>"OMG n00b, not "a raven", I'm the.raven, foo!" the.raven snickered.<br><br>"stop this!!" starblue exclaimed desperately.<br><br>"raven battle!!!" Krobeen screamed and charged at the.raven again.<br><br>sighing, the.raven met his charge with a flurry of attacks, forcing Krobeen backwards to a wall before he could even say "teh suxorz"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the.raven ducked under Krobeen's wild swing. to Krobeen's credit, he managed to deftly deliver a kick to the.raven, or tried to, as the.raven leapt over his leg and falling in a roll, coming back to his feet with perfect balance right in front of Krobeen. Krobeen swung his sword desperately at his skilled opponent but the.raven deflected his clumsy attack with his left sword and his right sword reached forward to point at Krobeen's throat. Krobeen gasped as he knew his doom.<br><br>"you move you die." the.raven said as a matter of fact.<br><br>the other raven cawed in delight at the exciting show.<br><br>starblue was stunned beyond words, her rescue had turned into this.<br><br>"So you are the antagonist, huh?" Krobeen uttered, knowing he was about to die soon.<br><br>"wtf?" the.raven asked, not moving his sword an inch.<br><br>"In tales of adventure, you have the protagonist, and there is always the an antagonist, who likes to Fuck things up." Krobeen said, thinking them his last words, he closed his eyes.<br><br>"dude wtf, you attacked me first, n00b." the.raven stated, and thrust his sword in, its sharp edge piercing Krobeen's skin and letting out a drop of blood. but the.raven stopped there and said "why did u attack me? farmer? who paid you to do this?"<br><br>"what I told you was the truth" Krobeen gasped as his the wound on his throat stung. "my home was destroyed by that raven!"<br><br>"OMG n00b." the.raven said, releasing Krobeen but not before kneeing him in his groin, dropping Krobeen to the ground in pain. "You dont know who you are Fucking with." the.raven said with a sneer, and tossed a bag onto the floor beside the groaning Krobeen. "in this bag theres 100 gold pieces, it should be more than enough to compensate for your loss, now leave me to my business." he said coldly as he turned to look at starblue, his eyes full of evil.<br><br>starblue shivered at that gaze and was paralysed with shock.<br><br>Krobeen thought of the glory of the heroes in the tales triumphing over evil, of the weak overcoming the strong, and looked at the helpless starblue. she was so beautiful, Krobeen decided to help her, and die if necessary. He crawled up.<br><br>the raven landed on the.raven's shoulder, and the.raven said coldly, "you do not know who you really are, do you starblue?"<br><br>starblue shook her head, "I only remember living in an ordinary home until one day soldiers came and razed my home, and they captured me and brought me here. I was told the queen ordered this."<br><br>the.raven laughed, "rofl n00b, you dont know the truth behind the grand scheme of things. let me tell you what truly is going on."<br><br>-to be continued-<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"raven battle!!!!" lolz wtf was I smoking man...<br><br>the story continued:<br><br>intrigued, starblue listened to the.raven's account of her past. It turned out that starblue was the daughter of king Gregory IV, ruler of the kingdom of blueth, his Queen died after giving birth to starblue and he became distressed and lost all hope of life. To add insult to the disaster, starblue was abducted as a baby by agents of a powerful secret society known only as the black knives.<br><br>"I think you watch too much X files, sir" starblue said, unbelieving of the existence of such secret societies. they were only myths to scare children, or so she thought.<br><br>Ignoring that sarcastic remark, the.raven continued his story. the black knives sent the distressed king a note, asking him to do as they asked or else starblue would be killed. the shocked king could only comply as starblue was his only child. The black knives wanted the king to pretend that the daughter of the leader of the black knives, Rainee, to be his daughter.<br><br>"Queen Rainee of this kingdom? the one that ordered my capture?" starblue asked, surprised and intrigued even more.<br><br>Krobeen stood there, dumbfounded as to what is happening, though he knew the.raven was up to something and he must protect starblue from him. but...what could he do? the farm boy wondered.<br><br>"yes." the.raven replied to starblue. King Gregory sadly complied with the request, and rainee was sent to him and he had to pretend she was the princess. the story of how a young princess suddenly appearing in the court was covered up by agents of the black knives spies in the court.  years passed and the young rainee grew up to be a beautiful mature women, lying behind that beauty however, is a mind full of deceit and evil, for she was really brought up by the black knife agents in the court, and by her powerful evil father prior. king Gregory himself paid little attention to her, as he fell into a great depression after his daughter's loss and was extremely lethargic. high ranking court officials who were black knife agents practically ran the kingdom.<br><br>surprised but not understanding the meaning behind that, starblue put up a curious expression, urging the.raven to continue. Krobeen similarly had an incredulous look, but that was because he did not understand a single thing the.raven was saying, it all sounds so sophisticated for a farm boy who lead a simple life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"the black knives are powerful beyond your imagination." the.raven said grimly, to starblue as well as to Krobeen. "they have agents all over the world, their purpose is to rule the whole world."<br><br>"whoa." Krobeen said subconciously, hearing what he said, he quickly reminded himself not to make anymore sounds to attract the dangerous the.raven.<br><br>"and how did Rainee become the queen of kingdom Redeth?" starblue asked, refering to the kingdom they were currently in.<br><br>"It was an ingenious plan, the entire thing" the.raven said. the agents in the court of Blueth let rainee marry the young king of Redeth and become the Queen of Redeth. After which she would influence the politics of Redeth to the black knives purpose, since Redeth is a much more powerful kingdom than blueth and the black knives have yet been able to infiltrate their court. However, the beautiful Rainee had no trouble making the young king of Redeth interested in her and marrying her.<br><br>starblue looked thoughtful for a moment, then said, "but what happened to me?"<br><br>the.raven explained that starblue was given to an ordinary family in Redeth to be raised up, with the old king of Blueth in his weak condition, they really had nothing to fear from him, and they had no use for her anyways. However, for reasons unknown the secret of the plot was leaked out, and Queen Rainee ordered the capture of starblue and locked her up. her home was not "razed" at all, the black knifes were ever subtle in their dealings, she was simply taken in secret. and her foster parents eliminated in secret.<br><br>upon hearing that, starblue sobbed. though not understanding at all of the situation, Krobeen felt sad for starblue too, he suddenly felt a primal emotion, that as a man he needed to protect the maiden.<br><br>"and back to my story." the.raven continued, "I am here to kill you, starblue. "<br><br>"you are a black knife?" starblue said, suddenly coming to a realization. "that is why you know so much about them and their plot! but why wait till now to kill me?"<br><br>"used to be." the.raven said, "the black knives did not kill you because they still have plans for you, though I do not know what, as I operate on my own now. I oppose the black knives now, you see, I betrayed them, they tried to kill me but I have been able to evade them till now. and I want to thwart their plans as much as po..... "<br><br>Krobeen dived at the.raven.<br><br>the.raven survived the black knife assasins because he was ever wary of his surroundings, he dodged Krobeen and drew his swords out again. slashing a deep gash on Krobeen's side.<br><br>"Run!! starble, Run!!!" Krobeen screamed. "take the lift, or something!!"<br><br>"fool!" the.raven sneered, "the lift requires a key to operate, and I have the key."<br><br>touched by Krobeen's bravery, starblue mustered her own courage, and picked up a broken stone brick laying on the ground, and tossed it at the.raven<br><br>the.raven easily dodged the missile. However, that had distracted him.<br><br>starblue tossed another one.<br><br>the.raven dodged again, and Krobeen made use of the opportunity to grab at the key chain hanging on the.raveb's belt, and tugged it loose.<br><br>"wtf u.." the.raven kicked Krobeen in the face, laying him low. but Krobeen had tossed the key to starblue, who raced to the lift.<br><br>a throwing dagger whisled towards starblue......but hit the closing lift door.<br><br>"damn!!" the.raven exclaimed, as he punched the closed door, but to no avail. moments later, starblue could be seen running from the tower, free at last.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Krobeen smiled weakly, he was a hero. he only hoped that starblue would remember him, or maybe tell the tale of his valiant act of rescue to people and let the tale be passed down through the generations, like the tales he heard from his father.<br><br>"smart move, n00b." the.raven said angrily, his perpetual frown turning even more pronounced. His eyes glared at Krobeen like a hunting cat would stare at its prey. "we are trapped in this tower.<br><br>"finish me off, villain." Krobeen said defiantly, "I die a hero. "<br><br>the.raven laughed. "OMFG n00b." the.raven said, "I have not survived black knife assasins only to die in a prison because of a n00b." to Krobeen's surprise, the.raven knelt beside him and took out a box. he opened the box, which seemed to contain medical equipment, and patched up Krobeen's sword wounds.<br><br>not knowing what to make of it, Krobeen waited, thinking this some kind of  game. like how a cat would play with a mouse before killing it.<br><br>the.raven took out a bottle of bluish liquid, and gave it to Krobeen. "drink this, its a potion of healing. we would need to work together to escape this place." the.raven said. "and dont think I am doing this out of sympathy, I should torture you to death for going against me, but i am a practical person, that is how I survive."<br><br>nothing to lose, Krobeen thought, and he gulped down the potion. immediately, he felt a gentle warmth spreading throughout his body, and his wound closed and was no longer pouring out blood.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A short while later, Krobeen felt drowsy. He drifted off to sleep. His dreams were vague, and mainly revolved around soem form of coronation ceremony. All he remembered was Starblue curtseying to him in such a way that he could see her down-blouse. Around him, people were shouting "Long live the Prince of Half-bloods" but he did not understand what the words meant.<br><br>All of a sudden, Krobeen woke up. The tower was enveloped in a bright light. Krobeen looked around and saw a phoenix hovering above him. It was carrying a tattered hat in its beak. It flew over to Krobeen and dropped the hat in his lap.<br><br>Krobeen was dumbfounded. He put his hand into the had and found something hard. He pulled at it and found a spear. The phoenix flew over to the sleeping Raven and motioned towards the man's chest with its beak. Hesitantly, Krobeen inched towards the Raven, afraid that he would wake up anytime. The phoenix landed on the Raven's chest and pooped. Instinctively, krobeen plunged the spear into the spot where the phoenix had pooped. There was a loud cry as the former Black Knife assassin gave up the ghost.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Krobeen went through the Raven's pouch. He found an ancient transcript written in runic characters. The boy was not very literate, and could not make head or tail what the writing was about. As he tried to study the transcript in greater detail, the phoenix grabbed the parchment from his hands and flew off into the night.<br><br>Krobeen was shocked beyond words. Who sent the phoenix? Why did the phoenix help him kill the Raven and what was so interesting about the transcript the Raven possessed?<br><br>Drowsyness overtook him again and he fell asleep. The next thing he knew, there was a sound of a motor car in his ears. He woke up and looked out of the window. To his amazement, he saw an ancient-looking Cadillac sedan hovering outside. A middle-aged man with red hair was driving it. THe driver manoeuvred the car closer and opened the door. "Get in, boy," he barked. "We don't have much time to lose."<br><br>Krobeen climbed out of the window and into the car. As he closed the door, the driver said, "Thank goodness you are safe. Nobody knows what that assassin could have done to you."<br><br>"Who are you?" Krobeen asked.<br><br>"I can't reveal my name," the driver replied. "For I work for an organisation that is opposed to the Black Knives and their regime. Many of our men have been arrested and tortured to insanity."<br><br>"Who sent the phoenix?" Krobeen enquired.<br><br>"Our cell group leader sent the phoenix. He had some warning that you were in danger," the driver said.<br><br>"Does this have anything to do with Starblue?" Krobeen probed further.<br><br>"Our organisation has been watching the tower for ages. The moment we detected Starblue's escape, the movement's head sent a group of escorts down to take her to a safe house," the driver explained. "She'll be fine."<br><br>The car flew over the blackened barn where Krobeen had been working at the day before. "I used to work there. But it's gone now," Krobeen said. "The Raven's pet was giving me a hard time, and I accidentally set it on fire."<br><br>"It was a trap," the driver said. "The Raven used his pet to draw you into close-quarter combat. You will soon find out why."<br><br>"Where are you taking me to?" Krobeen wondered aloud.<br><br>"We are heading back to our cell group headquarters," the driver replied. "The people have prepared a big breakfast waiting for you."<br><br>Krobeen realised that he was hungry, and nodded his head unconsciously at the thought of food.<br><br>"The Raven's transcript is of great interest to us," the driver continued. "It could shed light on the future of the land. Ah, we are almost there."<br><br>The Cadillac began to descend, and Krobeen noticed that they were surrounded by badlands. There was not a single dwelling in sight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Cadillac landed in front of a telephone booth in the middle of the badlands. Krobeen was surprised by the sight. He followed the driver into the telephone booth. The driver closed the door and pressed the numbers 62442 on the dial. Immediately, Krobeen felt the ground give way beneath his feet, and the pair descended into the depths of the earth.<br><br>After a few minutes, they came to a halt and a door opened in front of them. A woman wearing crimson robes greeted them. "Ah, Fabrice. There you are," she exclaimed. "Is the boy safe?"<br><br>"Take him to the dining hall. He needs a good breakfast," Fabrice ordered.<br><br>"Right away," the woman complied.<br><br>Krobeen followed the woman down a dark passageway lit only by a single gas lamp. At the end of the passageway was a door leading to the opulent dining hall. A generous spread of eggs, bacon and toast was laid out for him.<br><br>"Help yourself, boy. Please feel at home," the woman said. "By the way, what is your name?"<br><br>"Krobeen," the farm boy replied.<br><br>The woman was somewhat taken aback. She opened her mouth as if to say something, but decided to shut up for now.<br><br>Krobeen helped himself to some bacon and toast. "If you want some coffee, you can get it from the percolator at the side," the woman pointed to the coffee maker.<br><br>As Krobeen sat munching on bacon and toast, an elderly man entered the dining hall. "Holy $hit!" he exclaimed. "Aren't you the one who is..."<br><br>"Quiet, dear," the woman cut him off. "He needs a bite now. We'll explain everything to him when he's done."<br><br>"Right, Orelia," the old man said. He glanced at Krobeen's direction and studied his face. He paid special attention to the boy's hair and eyes. He saw the distinctive features of his fallen comrades in the decades-old civil war.</div>
