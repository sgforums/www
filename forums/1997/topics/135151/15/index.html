            <div class='col-md body'>Jack knew a bit about Puddlemere. The football league was dominated by Puddlemere clubs United and Athletic. Their rivalry was fierce and intense. He also knew that United's president was distantly related to King Gregory IV. Jack was a supporter of Athletic and loved wearing their green-and-white hooped jersey around. His uncle had been Athletic's goalkeeper two decades ago and later became its sporting director. He was still with the club till this day.<br><br>One day, Joe Albuquerque called the members of the Order to a meeting.<br><br>"I've just received information that Rainee's agents may seek to sabotage the derby between United and Athletic and claim it was a terrorist act that we did," he addressed those present. "I will need everyone who can fight to go with me to the Puddlemere Oval. Krobeen, you are MacLaggan's heir so you have to fight for us. I understand that you have not finished your training yet, but the spirit of your valiant ancestor will protect you."<br><br>"That's not fair!" exclaimed Jack, Rachel and Yan-xin in unison. "Krobeen is our junior in class, so why is he allowed to fight?"<br><br>"Because he is the heir to the noble Half-blood Prince," Harvey replied. "It is his duty to fight. Kids like you have no obligation, so it's best you remain at the base. You can help Orelia in the kitchen if you want."<br><br>The threesome would not back down, especially Jack, the Athletic supporter. "I've not been to a derby for ages," he protested. "I just have to go down to the Oval to cheer my team on."<br><br>Fabrice stepped in to defuse the situation. "I'll talk to your folks regarding this matter," he said. "If they're agreeable, you can come along. If not, forget about it."<br><br>So the matter was settled. The derby was not due to take place until two weeks' time. Athletic were second behind United on goal difference in the league tables. For the last 12 years, the league title had alternated between these two clubs. Chudley were the last non-Puddlemere team to win the league. The previous season, Tutshill had won the title, but were stripped of it after a match-fixing scandal was uncovered by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Quibbler</span>, a trashy tabloid magazine. United were subsequently crowned champions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The derby day came. Surprisingly, the parents of Jack, Rachel and Yan-xin gave their consent. Krobeen wondered how on earth did Fabrice convince the three youths' parents to let their children go for this operation. He soon found out.<br><br>"If anyone asks why those kids are with you, say they are there to watch the game," Harvey told Krobeen first thing in the morning. "Fabrice had a hard time talking their parents into this whole thing."<br><br>Krobeen was much older than the trio, but started his tutelage of the Book of Shadows late in life. He was considered a junior in their eyes. But he certainly had seen more than they did during his life as a farm boy.<br><br>Joe Albuquerque, Fabrice and another Order member named Julius would be in charge of the whole operation. Harvey would keep an eye on the base camp due to his age and rheumatism. Albuquerque's men would form part of the task force, along with people from the rest of the cell groups.<br><br>Before departing, all were to assemble in the dining hall. They would travel to the safe house using Floo powder. "Take a pinch of Floo powder, throw it onto the hearth, and say '14, Lovegood Way'," Albuquerque instructed Krobeen and his companions. "Make sure you get the pronunciation right."<br><br>Krobeen had the honour of going first. He stepped into fhe fireplace, and felt his head spinning. A split second later, he was in an unfamiliar-looking kitchen. A familiar figure was bent over the oven. The smell of brownies wafted into his nose.<br><br>The figure turned around, and gave a shout of joy. "Krobeen!" she gasped.<br><br>"Starblue!" Krobeen burst out simultaneously.<br><br>They embraced one another, and then Starblue started licking him. Krobeen, taken aback, could do nothing to resist her advances.<br><br>"My, are we having an orgy here?" Jack's voice interrupted. Rachel and Yan-xin followed close behind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Krobeen introduced Starblue to his new friends and they soon began chatting earnestly. He soon found out that Starblue was taking culinary lessons from none other than McGonagall herself. The rest of the adults arrived, and reported directly to the leader's suite, where a meeting was due to take place.<br><br>"i heard your relative is United president," Krobeen mentioned casually.<br><br>"You mean Stargreen?" Starblue replied. "He's my mother's cousin. Struck it rich in the milling industry. Later bought over United since he had so much cash to burn. Managed to convince half the world's best players to join him."<br><br>"Ah, but he can never match Athletic," Jack broke in. "They may not be cash-rich, but they certainly have highly-skilled players. My uncle is the sporting director, and he told me so."<br><br>"Who are you placing your money on?" Rachel tried to divert their attention.<br><br>"I predict a draw," Yan-xin said. "It always happens whenever a derby is played. I remember matches involving Holyhead Rovers and Holyhead Dons always ended in stalemate."<br><br>Just then, Fabrice appeared at the top of the stairs. "Krobeen, McGonagall wants to see you," he called.<br><br>Krobeen complied, and went up to McGonagall's suite. He finally came face to face with the person he heard so much about. She was old, but elegant. A scarlet shawl was draped over her nice shoulders. Fawkes was perched on a stand in a corner of the room. A stern expression was written all over her face.<br><br>"I heard that you brought some kids over," she began. "Is that true."<br><br>"Er, they wanted to watch the big game," Krobeen replied.<br><br>"The game's been called off," McGonagall shot back. "The president of one of the clubs said he received threats to his life. Someone sent him a Howler and threatened to kill him if the match proceeded. Obviously those kids are here to fight when they should be at home polishing up their skills in Wicca."<br><br>"Called off?" Krobeen could not believe his ears.<br><br>"Someone must have let slip that there would be a counter attack," McGonagall continued. "Whoever received the information decided to take it out on Starblue's family members. Even if we managed to rescue her when she was little, I wouldn't place her in Stargreen's care, because it would make her an easy target."<br><br>Just then, the double doors burst open and in rushed Starblue with a flustered expression. "Professor, there's been an attack on the Football Association!" she panted. "Just heard it on the radio."<br><br>"This calls for some action," Albuquerque said grimly. "Tell those kids to stay behind. Sorry to disappoint them. There is no game for them to watch, but some dangerous $hit to mop up."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"I'll handle this," McGonagall said curtly. "In the mean time, here's a portkey for you all to use. Time is not on our side."<br><br>Albuquerque and the others took hold of the portkey, and at the count of three, they were transported to the Football Association building. The once-opulent structure looked as if it had been the victim of an atomic bomb blast.<br><br>The Order members saw the FA's chief executive been shackled and brought towards a cage by some Black Knives. Before they could make any move, they came face to face with the Black Knives' Chief of Staff, Lord Nelstar.<br><br>"Hahaha, I've been expecting you," he sneered.<br><br>"We have a mission to complete," Albuquerque retorted. "And you are in the way of our success."<br><br>Nelstar drew his sword. "Kill me if you dare," he taunted the Order members.<br><br>Before Albuquerque's group could respond, another group of Order members came running in their direction. "Cell group Charlie reporting," its leader announced. "This is Sadie O'Brien."<br><br>Nelstar took one look at the two cell groups assembled before him and gave a start. He took out a whistle and blew three times. Immediately, several Black Knife assassins appeared from nowhere. "Let the fight begin," he declared.<br><br>Immediately, a massive free-for-all broke out. The scene was like a war zone, with a mess of enemy combatants at each other's throats. The Black Knife fighters were no match for the Order of the Phoenix, and Nelstar had to admit defeat.<br><br>He tried to run away, but was speared in the back by Krobeen. Nelstar turned around and came face to face with his attacker. "Krobeen... I have had... the pleasure of meeting your father..." he gasped. Those were Nelstar's last words, and he fell to the ground dead almost immediately.<br><br>"The cage! Get the cage!" shouted Albuquerque. Everybody turned in the direction of the cage containing the CEO of the FA. It was locked. O'Brien removed her hairpin, slipped it into the lock and turned it. There was a click, and the poor man was free.<br><br>With the CEO of the FA free at last, they returned to the safe house using the same portkey. Upon return, they found McGonagall waiting anxiously for them.<br><br>"Thank goodness he is safe," she sighed. "The CEO of the FA was theone who sought my advice two weeks ago regarding troublemakers at the United-Athletic derby. Someone tipped him off that the Black Knives would be trying to sabotage the game."<br><br>"Well, someone from the FA must have told the Black Knives that the CEO was in contact with you," O'Brien said. "The place was swarming with Black Knife assassins when I got there."<br><br>"I guessed as much, so I sent you down to reinforce Albuquerque's group," McGonagall said. "So you folks took Nelstar down, didn't you? He was one of their best commanders."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Nelstar said he had the honour of meeting my father," Krobeen broke in. "What did he mean?"<br><br>"Harvey knows the full story," replied Fabrice. "He'll tell you more. Right now, we need a hot shower and some grub."<br><br>"I got the three kids to help Starblue prepare dinner," McGonagall said. "It will be ready very soon. Right now, I need to talk to the CEO of the FA. He needs to be taken into our protection as soon as possible."<br><br>The rest of the Order members left McGonagall to speak to the CEO of the FA in private and went about their own business. In a short while, they assembled in the dining hall for dinner.<br><br>Soon, it was time for each cell group to return to their respective bases. They assembled in front of the kitchen fireplace to prepare for the trip home. O'Brien's group departed first, followed by Albuquerque's group. Krobeen followed Julius into the fireplace.<br><br>He emerged at Cell group Delta's dining hall and saw Harvey waiting excitedly for them. "Heard there's been some unpleasant goings on at the Football Association," he said. "Was anyone badly hurt?"<br><br>"What did Nelstar mean when he said he had the pleasure of meeting my father?" Krobeen asked the old man.<br><br>"Well, Nelstar was the one who dealt the fatal blow to your father," Harvey replied. "I saw everything unfold in front of me."<br><br>"Someone from within the Football Association may have passed information to the Black Knives," Albuquerque said. "The CEO was in contact with us. The Black Knives struck at the FA. If Rainee had got him, he certainly would have been executed."<br><br>"Where is he now?" Harvey asked.<br><br>"He's safe with McGonagall," replied Albuquerque. "She's taken him under the protection of the Order."</div>
