            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NEW STORY<br><br>TITLE: NECK TWISTER</strong><br><br>This happened in Genting Highlands 4 years back when my cousin decided to take his parents, his wife and his two kids up to GH to have fun at the theme park and at the casino...<br><br>They had so much fun travelling up to that place, and when they reach there, they booked a room in one of the hotels, and quickly, the kids rushed into one of the rooms and reserved their own beds screaming, yelling and jumping up and down the beds like never before...<br><br>They threw the blankets and started a pillow fight between each other...<br><br>It was approaching evening soon, and after a quick dinner and a nice long stroll, they decided to pull in for the night. The two kids shared the room with their parents, while my cousin's parents slept at the other room next door.<br><br>Halfway through the night, one of the kid (the youngest) started to have a stiff neck, and found that he couldn't turn his head to both directions... he started to freak out and walked out from the bed like a zombie, since he could only see in one direction... he started to shout and scream and cried out loud waking up his parents and brother...<br><br>My cousin brother was shocked to see his son's condition and called for his parents to come over. There was physically nothing wrong with him during the whole trip today, but he was unable to move his head now... His brother was fine and he already started to freak out when suddenly he also gave out a loud cry... The grandmother asked him why are you crying? Is everything okay with you?<br><br>He pointed and shivered as his fingers directed towards the right of his grandmother... he said, ah ma! there is a lady with long hair standing behind you....<br><br>At that point in time... all rushed out from the room, still in their night gown and prowled all the way with their luggage into the lobby and related the whole incident to the manager...<br><br>Of course, the manager denied the fact that it was real...<br><br>The truth behind it was that this lady had attempted suicide after her boyfriend had allegedly dumped her for another girl during their vacation in the resort itself... She was found hanged in the room about 5 years back...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's one on the highway at night... husband and wife driving along the highway and the wife was with her baby at the back of the car...<br><br>After 2 hours of driving, the car suddenly came to a halt and the husband went down to check while the wife waited...<br><br>20 minutes pass by and there was still no sign of her husband. Suddenly she heard a sound coming from the roof of the car. Thumping sound, as if someone was being thrown on top of the roof again and again. She freaked out and decided to get out of the car. She dare not screamed, yet she dare not even open the door.<br><br>10 minutes pass by, a police-car came by and started slowing down. As the car appeared closer to the stationary car, the policeman then sped up the car and drove to about 100 m away from them. One of the police came out from the car and shouted to the lady to come out of her car and run towards them without looking back...<br><br>The lady obeyed, although she was still trembling with fear, she did not look back and kept on running towards the policeman. She reached the cop car and decided to turn back when to her horror she saw her husband's body decapitated. The pontianaks were banging his head on top of the roof of the car and sucking the blood from the detached neck...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: BUNGALOW IN PG HILL<br><br>There's another one in Penang Hill, there are loads of Bungalows there, the famous known is Brother's Bungalow...<br><br>I don dare to step in there... but my friends went there for a vacation, he came back mentally disturbed and never recovered.<br><br>Like mumof said, don't go find them, or you will regret it.<br><br>According to the history, a lot of Westerners hid in the bungalows in the hill during the Japanese occupation. When the Japanese invaded Penang, they took over the bungalows and convert them for their military usage. They massacred the brothers (parishioners), and hung them... That was years ago...<br><br>Nowadays, when you go there and stay overnight, there are rules you must follow, the bungalow keeper will tell you upon entering. Never use the toilet at night, must wait until break of day, coz that was the time the brothers were murdered... Never relocate the bibles in the cupboard or u will see it back on its original place the next day. Never relocate the beds in the room and never make a noise at night, or you will hear something disturbing (my friend acted hero and thinks it doesn't exist, pity)...<br><br>Many other bungalows are constructed in Penang Hill, there are many other haunted ones... some you may hear the swing creaking at night, some you may hear objects flying and some of the campers fall ill one by one, severely ill until they got down from the hill, the will then get better...<br><br>I personally stayed in one of these bungalows before, and I tell you, I dare not make a single noise at night... not even snored... can't sleep at all..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see dead people, they are always around, not knowing that they are dead...<br><br>Sixth Sense<br><br>My father experienced once the house-spirit in Chinese (Hokkien ppl call chu-sin). White figure, 10 feet tall and penetrates through the wall. It has a strong smell, incense burning kind of smell, but was way too strong. My dad smelled it first and figured that there was something wrong, since they dun have incense there. Just that he was about to ask his friend, he saw the spirit walked across the place where both of them were working. My dad was at one end and his friend another end. The spirit walked in between. My father and his friend kept quiet and went pale, they sweat buckets and vowed never to return to that place anymore...<br><br>WARNING: The Chinese believed that you should not shout or scream all the time, or whack the floor and make all sorts of irritating noise, coz he will appear, but this encounter is rare, under the grade 4 classification of spirits. There are spirits everywhere, you respect them, they will respect you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: CINDAI<br><br>Have you guys heard of the song sang by Siti Nurhaliza called Cindai?<br><br>This one is written in one of the ghost stories...<br><br>There was this group of young students who went camping in the beach near Terengganu. During the night, one of them decided to put on the radio and the song Cindai was one, so one of the student was outside listening to it, while the rest was in the chalet playing cards.<br><br>The guy listening outside was dancing and humming to the rhythm when he suddenly heard a voice, a lady's voice singing from the back of the radio. He thought that it was his friend so he called out to her rudely for singing lousily...<br><br>The radio suddenly went static halfway and when he turned around to fix the radio, it was totally spoilt, and there was no way to get it fixed... static can only be heard... then he turned it off... as he was going back into the chalet, the song was heard again, but this time, since the radio was off, he was spooked. He turned around and he could see a yellow apparition dancing and singing... Just an apparition, he was freaked out, fell down on the staircase and collapsed at the doorway. He turned pale, white and all his limbs were as cold as ice. His face became blue and his eyes were engorged...<br><br>The friends could not see the apparition as they did not cursed it, but their friend did and he was in a coma for 5 months when they brought him back. He never dared to talk nonsense in the beach or jungle again...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: I NEVER BELIEVE!!<br><br>There was this group of 3 friends who were very close to each other, Rama, Muthu and Natasha (not their real names).<br><br>Natasha was Muthu's girlfriend.<br><br>One day the three decided to go for a retreat in a small chalet at a beach in Malaysia. According to the well-known history of that place, a girl killed herself there 20 years ago.<br><br>The story went like this. A couple who were deeply in love planned to get married but was rejected by their parents for status difference in the society. They were saddened and while standing on a roof-top of the current place, the girl came up with an idea that both of them could jump off the roof and be together forever. The guy was shocked when he heard what his girlfriend just said but nevertheless with anxiousness stood with his girlfriend at the ledge. The girl held his hands and jumped off the roof, but the guy pulled out at the very final minute by letting his girl's hands free. She screamed horribly as she falls, and it was thought that from then on, she must have placed a curse over that place...<br><br>Hence, when the three friends arrived at the place, Natasha and Muthu decided to get two chalet, one for themselves and one for Rama. Rama agreed and went into his room.<br><br>They met at the lobby, all the three friends and Muthu related to Rama (who didn't know) about the story behind the place and told him to behave himself. Rama, with courage shouted out, I tak percaya ada hantu kat sini, you semua memang hilang akal sekiranya kamu percaya bahawa benda sepertini memang wujud (I don't believe in ghost, you all must have lost your minds in believeing something that never exist in the first place). He then went around the place spitting and shouting and cursing the girl for being stupid to jump off the ledge... He laughed and laughed so loudly that his voices could be heard everywhere...<br><br>That night, as Rama were preparing to sleep, he saw a figure out his window 100m away, white and slightly lit up with a yellowish light. He thought it was the reflection of the moon or something and went 'bah, barang bodoh' (stupid stuffs)... so he went to sleep. 30 minutes into his sleep, he began to hear disturbing voices and he woke up again and the apparition he saw earlier got closer to about 50m and he could see that the figure is now brilliant white and appeared as a figure of a young girl. "It was walking" and it got nearer and nearer until at 10m, the figure looked up at him.<br><br>Rama went pale and shook in fear and could not do anything. There was no eyes and nose on the face and the hair was disshevelled. The figure took several more steps closer to him and yell at him!<br><br>SEKARANG PERCAYA TAK!!!! (Now, do you believe??!!)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: GIRL, WHAT GIRL?<br><br>Right, this sighting occurred there by one of my father's schoolmate when they were young.<br><br>He was a new tourist guide in his 20s and he still is right now (60+ y/o) and he has got a lot of haunted stories to tell and all of them were real.<br><br>He was taking a group of 15 tourists up the hill, but as those from Penang would know, there is a break at 84m up the hill. Most of the tourist decided to stay behind and rest, coz it was very tiring. He and another of his partner decided to continue the climb up to 100m as it has always been their trend since young to complete the climb whenever they go there.<br><br>Both of them were busily hiking up when they saw a white lady sitting near a rock. She was dressed in white blouse and was seen weeping. She was looking towards the other side of the hill and when the two friends approached her, they could sense that their hairs were standing on end for no apparent reason. They could smell a sweet sickly scent coming from the figure. As they approached the girl they tapped her on the shoulder and asked whether she needed any help.<br><br>The lady kept on crying miserably and wept on and on and did not replied them. They thought that she needed some time so they stood around talking to her and calming her down. 15 minutes into talking to her, 4 other hikers came along and saw the both of them. They approached them and asked them what had happened. The two buddies pointed to the girl and spoke in Hokkien "Chi le cabo mm chai co ha mi su, hau ka buay teng" (Donno what happened to her, but she seemed to have been crying for a long time)...<br><br>The hikers asked the two friends this question that freaked the heck out of them, enough to make them vow not to climb the hill again...<br><br>The question was simply, "Girl? What girl?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: HANDS AND AXES...<br><br>Deep in the reserve forest of Pahang, about 50 years ago during the Japanese occupation, life was tough for Mr A as he could not work to earn enough money after the impose of curfew throughout the country. He had to sneak out at night to the jungle at times to avoid the Japanese soldiers who believed that he is giving out information of military positions of the Japanese base to the enemy.<br><br>Sneaky as he was, he was finally caught by one of the soldiers. In an attempt to run off from the soldier, he tripped and fell off from a tree root. The Japanese soldier cut off his right hand with his bayonet and stab him on his leg. He managed to fend off by throwing his personal axe towards the Japanese's head.<br><br>As it was dark, he could not police a search for his hand as there were more soldiers lurking nearby. He grabbed a first aid kit from the soldier and quickly wrapped his hand with a bandage. He ran deeper towards the jungle but never did survived long enough for the severe shock he suffered from the blood loss. However, his body was never seen, not up till today when the forest has declined in its area and now preserved as a forest reserve.<br><br>Students who carry out their research or study in that jungle would often encounter Mr A. He would appear as a normal person, explained one of the students. He would appear to be looking for something that is missing, and at the same time holding up his right arm still wrapped with the bandage. Some of the students did mention that they were not afraid of him as he appeared normal until he pop the question to them in Hokkien...<br><br>Ah ba, ah ba... lu oo kua tio wa eh chiu boh? (Have you seen my hand?)<br><br>Once he complete the question, he would disappear in thin air.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: BASKETBALL<br><br>A security guard relate this to the authorities, but he was shunned...<br><br>Mr J was a new security guard for a school who takes the night shift. On his first day of work, trying to adapt to the environment alone was tiring. He was about to walk back to his bunker after going round the school for the last time, when he heard some noise at the courtyard where the basketball court was located.<br><br>It sounded as though someone was playing basketball at 1 am. This must be crazy, he thought to himself. He armed himself with his flashlight and walked towards the court, where to his amazement, he saw a clear headless figure playing basketball with his head, bouncing it up and down. He stood there in shock and peed in his pants as the figure slowly turned and looked at him since he was flashing it with his torch.<br><br>He ran stiff and soon gave out a loud cry. The figure disappeared... The next morning, he quit and told the headmaster about the incident. Though the headmaster shunned him, he was told by one of his friends (another security guard who introduced him to work there) that one of the student was decapitated during the occupation.<br><br>This school still stands, and is 80 years old as of this year. Location: North in Penang...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Classification of Story :: Severely disturbing, not for the faint hearted...<br><br>There is one school in Penang, known as Peng Hwa (in Hokkien) where about 5 years ago, five willy students decided to check the place out at night. They have heard that the school field was haunted and they could see visions at night, so they decided to go there at 12 am midnight.<br><br>The main entrance was shut, so they decided to get in through one of the sidewalls which was low enough to get over. As they got over, they make their way towards the school field. There was a sign where they never did saw before in the morning, they did not freak out, but read the sign which was imprinted in Chinese and it said:- LOOK DOWN, NEVER LOOK UP!!!! Or you will suffer the consequences.<br><br>They decided to defy the sign and walked across the field by looking up. Nothing happened, except they felt something soft on the ground, unnaturally soft where they have never thread before. They started to get scared because they defied the rule. Nevertheless, they made it across the field and when they reach the end, they were happy that nothing happened.<br><br>Suddenly they smelt something terrible!! Horrible!! They freaked out, but it smelt like sh.it... They were looking at each other and noticed that they have stepped on sh.it throughout the whole field. And that's why the sign is there for!! LOOK DOWN!! DON't look UP or suffer the consequences!! =)<br><br>Hahaha... some light joke to cheer u up!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GENTING HIGHLANDS : PAHANG : VILLAGE<br><br>As all of you probably would have known, GH is the only place which houses the only casino in Malaysia. There has been a lot of encounters within the nearby villages. Nowadays, two hotels have been constructed for increasing influx of tourists, and it so happens that the villages are no longer occupied these days, for reasons logically known and explained above...<br><br>My aunt (true story) loves to gamble, and would go up there once or twice every week to gamble. She always wins and was said to have a very good luck (in Chinese, there is a particular word which I don't know)... The very last time she went up there to gamble, about 2 years back, she started off the evening by winning, but then started to lose all her current savings she would keep with her whenever she go gamble.<br><br>Tired and depressed from the loss, she ventured outside and walked around until she came to the place near the village, where she heard her name being called...<br><br>RULE #1 : Never turn back when you hear someone call you, unfamiliar voices especially<br><br>RULE #2: When you lose, you are more prone to the dark and you will often hear such things...<br><br>My aunt turned around not knowing what was going on and thought that it was her friend who was there with her at that time. What she saw made her trip to GH the final, and as she relate the incident to me, she was still in a state of shock and fear. She trembled and was icy cold as she was admitted to the ICU for life support.<br><br>As she was recovering, she said that there was a young lady, beautiful who was dressed in red looking at her at first with kind eyes. My aunt, still in a sad mood that time, ignored her and turned away. The lady called out to her again and as she was about to shoo her off, the lady's eyes turned red with anger and told her that she has been neglected since she was born, and now when she is dead, she deserve a little respect and wanted company. My aunt thought that the lady was drunk and shouted at the lady in Hokkien to shoo her off.<br><br>The lady in red then took off her scarf and blouse and levitated. Her face at first which was flushed turned snowy pale and her hair which was not seen at first, was disshevelled. Her guts was seen hanging from her neck and blood was dripping out towards the very end of her gut. The figure sped towards my aunt. She was stiff and shocked at that time, that my aunt did not know what to do but to scream her lungs out She then fainted and woke up in the ICU... She was fortunate to only have a broken hip from that fall. She never wanted to go there again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: WHEN YOU GO TO TOILET!!<br><br>This happened recently in a place called Tanjong Mambok. I am not sure where this place is, but I am sure it is in Malaysia<br><br>In one of the villages, there was a house where this incident happened. In that house, there were 7 people. Mr H owns the house and is married to a beautiful wife who is recently pregnant. They have 3 kids and the other two members of the family who lived in with them are Mr H's parents.<br><br>One night, one of the children wanted to go to the toilet, and it was already 1 am. Since this kid is closer to his mother, he waked her mother up to take him to the toilet. The toilet setting in the kampongs are located several meters away from the house. She then lit a candle and took her child by the arm and accompanied him towards the toilet.<br><br>As he was doing his business in the toilet, his mother waited patiently under a tree while humming a small tune. It did not take her long enough when she began to hear an accompaniment who is humming along with her. At first, she thought that it was her son, so she called out to him. He answered as usual, but the humming sound kept on coming. She looked around her and could find nothing. Senses came to her to look up tree when she saw a head floating upwards humming the tune. It had sharp teeth and blood dripping out from the mouth. The eyes were nearly popping out and was red with anger. It was about to attack the lady when she freaked out and yelled...<br><br>She screamed for her son and her husband, who then came to her aid but they did not see anything. Her father in law who is a well known bomoh, took her back into the house, and blessed her, telling the family that she has seen a spirit which attacks after pregnant women. Those not pregnant can never see the spirit.<br><br>The lady's shock caused her a miscarriage.</div>
