            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: AN ADDITIONAL FLOOR?<br><br>This happened to me and several of my friends when we were still in university. Lau (guy) and Mei (girl) had came over to my apartment to have a group discussion and study. I stayed on a high rise tower and it's about 30 stories high. The whole flat (as you may call it) has only 29 floors for occupants and the 30th floor is only accessible through staircases on the 29th floor, hence to say the lift accesses only the 29 floors.<br><br>I stayed on the 20th floor that time. The place was breezy and windy and we don't have to turn on any cooling devices as it is already cold. Lau stayed on the same block as I am, but he is on the 22nd floor whereas Mei stayed on a different block. We continued our discussion until about 1.30 am and finally decided to call it a night. Both of us, Lau and me got ourselves ready to accompany Mei to her block.<br><br>The three of us stood there waiting for the lift to reach our floor. At this hour, no one staying in that area would use the lift. However, the elevator seemed to pass by us after reaching the 20th floor and kept moving straight up. We thought maybe someone was waiting for the elevator as well, so we patiently waited for our turns.<br><br>The elevator went from 20... to 27... 28... 29... and we were already curiously thinking who would have stayed on the 29th floor since the last 2 floors, 28 and 29 is empty. At that time, the elevator which was not programmed to reach the 30th floor miraculously displayed the number 30 on the screenboard. Mei started to freak out and screamed, she broke into tears and at the top of her voice she kept shouting HANTU HANTU!!! (Ghost Ghost!!!). Evil as it may seem, no one came out to see what happened (ignorant neighbors). Mei went hysterical and we couldn't control her.<br><br>Lau and me lost our sense of control as well and we started crying. We freaked out because out of my 4 years staying there, we never had seen the lift reached the 30th floor, lest it was impossible. The lift then came down to the 20th floor and the door flung open. Mei had at that time fainted and collapsed. We carried her into the lift (an idiotic move, but we have no choice) and got her back to her block. Nothing happened in the lift. But we pleaded to Mei's room-mates to let us stay for the night at her place.<br><br>The room-mate was not happy about it, thinking that we are making up stories (that time Mei had already regained consciousness), and we had to brave ourselves to get back to our place. I told Lau that he could put up at my place for the night. So we hit the UP button and the same elevator out of the three flung its door open. We decided to wait, but the other 2 were stationary for a long while. We had no choice but to use the only elevator and got to our floor and rushed to my apartment. As I struggled with the keys, we swore we could have heard laughters and shrieks from above. I decided to forget about the keys and knock on the grill as hard as possible and call out to my seniors who were staying with me.<br><br>They unlocked the door for us and we rushed into the apartment, flushed with fear and icy cold with the thoughts of death.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: AMERICAN HIGHWAY - THE WHITE MAN (an Urban Legend)<br><br>I was driving up towards Prescott, Arizona, my girlfriend, Becky, dozing off in the seat next to me. Rolling the window partially down, in the hope that the cool air would keep me alert, I wearily kept driving my Chevy down this narrow highway road, with nothing but a thick forested area on the passenger side of me, and mostly open meadowland, with a few clumps of trees here and there, along the driver's side of the road. I had wanted to leave first thing in the morning on Friday, but Becky was called into work at the last minute, so we ended up leaving at close to eight o'clock that night. Knowing we had to head back before early Monday, I didn't want to wait until the next day to go and end up losing a good chunk of a Saturday to boot.<br><br>So here I was, it had to be close to at least ten pm by then. Driving by the light of my dim headlights, with a close to full moon overhead (full enough to see the open expanses of the passing meadow areas, anyway) I noticed some smoke or steam coming up from the sides of my car hood. This, in and of itself, was not unusual as the car was close to fifteen years old, dented up a bit, with dimmer than usual lights and hoses that seemed to know the most inopportune time to break. Add to that, a radiator that overheated during the summer months or when in use for long periods of time. This being early October, I hadn't given the radiator much thought - it hadn't bothered to act up since August, and as the saying goes 'out of sight, out of mind'. But something sure was putting off plumes under the hood, so I nudged Becky and explained in short that I had to pull over.<br><br>As I slowed down a bit, Becky rolled down her window and peered out along the edges of the dark wall of pine trees. "Up there," she exclaimed, pointing forward, "about twenty feet or so there's a dirt shoulder of some kind." Slowing to a crawl, feeling safe at the moment as another car hadn't passed us for a number of miles now, I quickly saw the flat, dirt indent, about the length and width of two cars, just to the right of the road. The dirt area, much like that whole side of the road, was lined by a knotted mass of trees, giving it the look of a half circle cut down the middle by the road. I pulled over, and turned the car off - leaving the keys hanging from the ignition. With the headlights on, I got out of the car and walked to the front of it, popping the hood. I had grabbed a flashlight out of the glove box, and so proceeded to inspect the damage.<br><br>Sure enough, the radiator had overheated. I bent down a little, to peek between the crack of the hood's bottom edge and the top of the car front, to look at Becky through the front windshield. I was going to call out, to ask her to grab the gallon bottle of water I kept behind the front seat (there since August, at least) so, once it cooled a bit, I could add water to the radiator.<br><br>Expecting to see her dozing off, or looking toward me, I was surprised to see her staring wide-eyed, mouth agape, out at the direction of the driver's side window. She was as white as a ghost. "What are you doing?" I demanded to know. She kept staring out at the meadow fields, only raising her arm slightly to point in the direction she was looking. "What?" I said, walking back towards the driver's door. As I did, I looked out into the moonlit meadow. I saw a short line of trees in the distant background, a small pine about 20-25 ft out, directly in line with the back end of the car, and, running about ten feet from that point forward, in a line almost parallel with the road, was a short brick wall, about three feet or so high. A sparse forested area began, about forty feet or so from the wall's edges, in either direction of the small meadow. "So?" I said, "Probably part of an old house, or a fence. What's the big deal about the wall?" As I got into the car, and shut the door to wait for the innards to cool, she replied - slowly, quietly - "It isn't the brick wall. It's what I saw looking at us OVER the top of the wall." I turned to her, "What? Quit screwing around." "Stuff you!" she said, "If I..." Then she stopped talking, and her gaze drifted past me, to the wall.<br><br>I turned to look. I saw a small translucent-white stocky humanoid form, just shy of three feet tall, its tiny round eyes from this distance appearing as black as night, standing in front of the wall. It slowly took a step or two towards us, its short chubby arms at its side. I screamed, and tried to turn on the flashlight. I knew the batteries were low, and sometimes had to jiggle it and turn the cap slightly to get it to work, so in my excitement I twisted the cap, the batteries flew out and I just about dirtied by pants. As the batteries were now rolling under the seat and across the floor of the car, I decided to forget that. I looked up, saw the hood was still up, and froze.<br><br>"He's going back," Becky then said. I looked out over the moonlit field again, just in time to see this....thing... scamper around the side of the wall, out of view. As Becky quickly rolled up her car window, I said I was going to shut the hood - to hell with the water, if the radiator didn't burn out we'd stop down the road and add water. "Give me the bottle. I'll dump some in the reservoir and shut the hood, you just start the car." Becky replied. As she got out and went to the front, I turned the key. The engine groaned, trying to turn over. I looked from the steering wheel, to Becky pouring some water into the reservoir, to the wall, and back again. As Becky slammed the hood shut, I looked towards the wall - to see the small, white head of the ghostly entity peering over the top of it.<br><br>"Get in the car!" I yelled, as the entity's tiny hands gripped the top of the wall, and it hoisted itself clean over - landing on its feet, running. Running towards us. Becky jumped in the passenger side, locking her door. She no longer had the bottle, which couldn't have been more than half empty now, but, under the circumstances, I didn't ask and I didn't care. I turned the key, still it wouldn't catch. "Oh, god!" Becky murmured. I didn't want to look. I turned the key again, still just that tired groan. Becky leaned over, reaching past me, hitting my door lock with one hand while rolling the window up with the other (it was one of those older, manual window knob rollup jobs). "Hurry!" she said, frightened, as she sat back up. With one more turn of the key, the car finally started, and as I punched the accelerator, I looked toward the field. That little thing was only a few feet from the edge of the road - the edge on the OTHER side of the road, thankfully, but close enough that I could see its eyes were, indeed, dark, empty holes, its mouth was open now, in a wide leering grin, and I could have sworn it had small pointed teeth but it all happened so fast. Its skin, or surface, seemed to be rolling, as the entire entity ran at my car.<br><br>As we headed down the road, I turned my rear view mirror in such a way I could see "it" - quite a bit back now, turning away from us, walking alongside the road in the opposite direction. I watched the road ahead. Then, Becky screamed. She had been half turned, looking back at the entity too. Now, she was bent straight over, her head buried in her hands. I turned my rear view mirror to and fro, but only saw the road - "it" was gone.<br><br>We drove another twenty minutes or so with the car smoking a small portion of the way. The car overheated again as we entered the outskirts of town, only then would Becky let me stop. As we parked and waited at the first gas station we hit, I asked what had happened. "I was watching it, it stopped at the edge of the road." she answered. "I know," I said, "I saw it walking away." "Yeah," she answered "it was walking away. But as it walked away, its head turned all the way around, still grinning, and it watched us drive away." Needless to say, when we headed back we left at 10.00 am, to be sure we'd get back LONG before nightfall.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: A NEW GUARD<br><br>Three girls, in a camp in a school decided to explore around at night since they've never been to this place before. Their home town was in Johor, and having to travel out of state for the first time, they would not have let this chance pass by in Malacca.<br><br>The school was huge, and they'd thought that they could have some adventure and fun by exploring the place. The clock struck 12 midnight and the three eager and gleefully girls got their flashlights and started from their dormitory and walked across a small patch of field to reach the main building. They walked around the main building coming to a small storing hall. Finding that it was not lock, they decided to go in and have some fun. They took up 1 hour to just explore one of its halls, and finding nothing there, they decided to get out from the room. They can't make it back to the entrance so they simply found a door to get out. They were lucky that one of the many doors were unlocked.<br><br>Getting out from the room, they found themselves facing with a river. Thinking that they would walk around the hall's balcony which hopefully would lead them back to the small patch of field, they started venturing deeper and deeper. However, the further they go around, the more new things they see. They eventually found out that they were lost. One of the girls started crying non stop, and the other two tried to coax her.<br><br>Just then a guard walked by and asked them what happened. He was wearing his normal uniform and was smartly dressed carrying a flashlight. Finding out that they were lost, he kindly gave them directions to get back. His directions were very useful indeed and they soon found themselves back to their original position. They went back to their dorms and slept.<br><br>The next morning while preparing to go back, the three decided to thank the security guard, and so they went to the security booth and tried to find the guard who helped them. The guard on duty told them that he is the only guard there who has been working for 17 years, and he has no idea what they were talking about.<br><br>The three started freaking out, until the guard told them that he had a partner about 15 years back in the same school. He was trying to save a girl who was drowning in the river they saw. The girl did not make it when he helped her reach ashore. No one was there to witness his rescue, and the girl was naked when he helped her up. Thinking that this must be a rape case, he prepared himself to report to the police. As he was about to take off, several students and a teacher who had just finished P.E. saw the both of them and misunderstand him. They took him into the authorities and threaten to sue him.<br><br>He was wrongly accused and was sent to jail and was given the death sentence.<br><br>Nowadays, his soul still roams around the school and was known to help students who are loss, for he really loved children a lot.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: THE BEER BOTTLE<br><br>Ken and 3 other friends used to stay in this small double storey house which is quite closeby to their college when they were studying. This house belonged to an old man who apparently passed away because of health problems related to his abusive drinking. It was also told that despite his health problems which is the sole cause, it played secondary to the claimed suicidal act. In short, he killed himself by hanging onto a rope tied to a ceiling fan in the kitchen.<br><br>One day after a tired day from college, Ken was taking his meal in the kitchen, and after he had done with it, he decided to go up and take a nap. Awhile into his sleep, he heard a loud bang followed by a chain of bangings on the drawers and cupboards in the kitchen. As he went down to investigate, he found all the drawers and cupboards in the kitchen flunged open and even the refrigerator was left open, but nothing was stolen. He double checked the front and the back door, all were locked, and there was no possible method for a robber to enter, unless he were to break the windows.<br><br>Days passed and this often happens once or twice in a week, but however no one got hurt and Ken and his friends soon got used to it, until they found the ultimate solution.<br><br>Years passed by and they graduated from the college, left for something better. Several weeks after they left, they returned to get back some of the stuffs they had left behind. The house is now occupied by 5 girls and one of them approached Ken and asked him about the incident of knocking on the drawers and cupboard. They were freaked out and did not know what to do. Ken smiled at her and told her, just leave a beer can or a bottle of rum in the cupboard near the refrigerator, and you will be fine...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: THE EERIE LIGHT<br><br>Fatt and Huang are two best friends who rented a place to stay while they were studying theology. They were very religious people and are eager to listen to God's call...<br><br>One evening, when returning back from a seminar, they noticed something strange. Inside their house, directly opposite from their entrance to the house, shone a green eerie light they have never seen before in their house. They were sure that there were no green light installed in their house before. Staying there for more than a year, and confident about their surroundings, they shook in fear and got more nervous. Spite all that, the place was dark and the switch to the lights were near the green light. There was nothing much they could do but to walk towards the light.<br><br>Both knelt down in prayer as they thought that it was the existence of evil spirits. They prayed and prayed for half an hour, hoping that the light would disappear, but the light just kept right on shining. It did not flickered, it did not get dimmer or any brighter, it was just there. Both became weak on their legs and hands and started to jitter. What on earth could the green light be and what did it want from them? How did it get in in the first place and what will it do to them? Their prayers were still not answered and they finally decided to approach the light.<br><br>Being the courageous of the two, Fatt decided to slowly check it out by crawling on his knees. Both of them crept towards the light, and Huang was still praying the Lord's prayer as they get nearer and nearer. There was a door leading to the source of the light. Opening the door, they sighed a big relief, as they saw a green translucent wrapper paper wrapped against the yellow bulb. It must have been due to the wind where the window was opened...<br><br>Both of them sat there and started laughing at each other...<br><br>BUSTED!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some information...<br><br>HANTU POCHONG<br><br>A Malay ghost that is seen wrapped up in its Â‘kain kapanÂ’ (burial robes). When a Malay dies he is wrapped up in three layers of white sheet, the end being tied in a knot. It is usually reported in villages wandering and hopping around as though in search of something. Its body is completely wrapped by the kain kapan and its face cannot be seen. The pochong usually doesnÂ’t bother anyone around it, so if you ever stumble across one, donÂ’t give it reason to do otherwise. DonÂ’t disturb it or try to block its path.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>NEW TOPIC</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>BUSTED</strong></span><br><br>It was 11.45pm on a Monday night as I prepare to make my way back to my house... It was dark per usual and to go back home, I need to walk across a graveyard, then turning right into a small dark alley (which I am always afraid of even though I have been using that lane for almost 20 years). After the alley ends, the road will fork into two, and I usually will use the right one to get back to my house...<br><br>As I was walking across the graveyard, I noticed eerie sounds and a cry of a wolf nearby, it could be a dog for goodness sake... I was always paranoid when I walk by the old and abandoned graveyard which was locked for decades.<br><br>I always try to ignore the noise by chanting my prayers and it will usually calm me down. As I approach the dark alley, I took out my small torch light to shine my way through as there were no street lamps that night, since it was under maintenance...<br><br>As I shone the light ahead, I got a shock of my life when I saw a middle aged man standing with his head hunched below his shoulders... he was petrified by my light but slowly approached me in a staggering manner... I had never seen him all my life, but I tried to be brave... As he walked towards me, I can sense a chill down my spine. He kept walking and walking and I could have sworn I smell a stench that was so horrible. I nearly vomited but what scares the freak outta me is that this guy kept walking towards where I was standing as though I wasn't there... As I was to avoid him, he vanished into thin air, together with the smell...<br><br>I freaked out, with my eyeballs engorged, I ran all the way through the dark alley to the forked road... As I reached that road, I took the left lane without noticing anything... I was almost out of breath when I reached the end of the left lane only noticing that I have done the mistake of taking the wrong road...<br><br>As I turned back... I almost pissed my pants as I saw the same guy again... he grabbed hold of my collar and with his least most strength lift me off the ground and spoke horribly to me...<br><br>I could see that his eyes were red with anger, and as though there were blood coming out from his eye sockets... His nose were crooked and his mouth is definitely out of this world, stinks like sh.it... I could sense a presence of his aura and every strand of hair in my body stood up in attention...<br><br>He lifted me even higher and with his loudest most voice, he said...<br><br>Oi! Still not sleeping ar, read what read? Nothing here lar, so late liau... Go back and sleep lar! Nandao!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
