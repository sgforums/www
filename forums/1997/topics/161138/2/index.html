            <div class='col-md body'>SARAWAK<br><br>There were 2 good friends in KL who grew up and studied together from young. Their names (not their real names) were Mary and Jane. They were so close that it was almost near impossible to split them apart. Apart from telling each other's problems and happiness, they were often seen wandering around in complexes, food courts and sundry shops. They were wonderful examples of the meaning of friendship.<br><br>Then came a time when Jane has to leave for Sarawak because her father's job demands him to migrate there to continue his supervision as a manager there. Mary was saddened with the news but promised Jane that she would call her every night. Jane said that since it will be quite far away and it might take a lot of time, effort and money (Mary's family was not very well-off) Jane decided that she be the one to call her. Mary agreed.<br><br>It was not long, about 1 week when Jane moved in to her new place when she decided to give Mary a call. There was no one at the other end of the line, so she tried again. It was almost night-time when she decided to give it another try before she goes to bed. A cold soft voice replied with sadness and tears in her heart. It was Mary... she was sad yet happy to have heard from Jane again. Jane reluctantly wanted to talk very long because she was tired but told Mary that everything is going on well, that the place she is staying in was wonderful and the sceneries were exceptionally beautiful. She described how the people there were and which school she will be attending the following week.<br><br>Mary listened with eagerness, but replied with one word sentences. Finally Jane decided to hang up on Mary because she was tired, she said goodbye without waiting for Mary to reply. As she was sleeping, she felt a sharp sudden jolt of electricity spearing down her spine and a warmness covers her over her body. This was impossible as the room was set to the lowermost temperature (air conditioned). She did not bothered until she felt a cool breeze on her right ear.<br><br>She almost freaked out, but decided to pretend to sleep and closed her eyes even tighter. The trauma then resolved and she woke up the next morning refreshed.<br><br>That morning, she received a phone call from KL, it was Mary's brother who informed her that Mary has recently passed away and that they were unable to reach her as they didn't have her phone number until recently when they found it on her diary. Jane was shocked and broke into tears and said that it was impossible... she just talked to her yesterday through phone. I called her, said Jane... at midnight...<br><br>Mary's brother, Thomas replied, that is impossible, she passed away 3 days ago. We didn't hear any phone ringing yesterday night...<br><br>Jane hung up the phone... she had two feelings in her... one is that she was depressed over her friend's death and guilty as she should have called her earlier... She flew back to KL to attend her best friend's funeral and apologized to her while saying a prayer for her.<br><br>Her friend never visited her again after that...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: HIGHWAY PERIL: PLEASE DON'T STOP YOUR CAR UNNECESSARILY!<br><br>This happened along the KL-Seremban Highway about several months back in a place called Nilai. A father and his two daughters were travelling back at about 9pm from a mall after they purchased their stuffs. They were in Tiroi the whole day visiting a relative and they come from a place called Cheras.<br><br>While on the way home, they happened to use the KL-Seremban Highway to get back to Cheras. This trip would take them about 20-25 minutes and since it was already late and dark (the highway is poorly lit), the father decided to take it slow and drove slowly at the speed of 60 km/h.<br><br>It was not long when one of his daughters spotted a well-dressed lady in yellow crossing the highway road under a fly-over. She looked quite distressed from a distance and was seen to be carrying a baby. She looked ill and the daughters took pity on her and decided to ask their dad to give her a ride. Their father then pulled over near the other side of the divider seeing that the roads were not busy at that time and they were the only car around. The two daughters were a little afraid at first, but they carried their guts and stepped out of the vehicle and approach the young lady.<br><br>From a distance, they could only see a figure, but as they got closer, one of the daughters tapped her on the shoulder. The lady turned around and on her arms cradled a baby who was already dead with blood oozing out from the head. It appeared that the baby was shot. The daughter screamed her lungs out and the lady started to bleed from her eyes and her back, which suppossedly must have originated from the head. The lady got irritated and started to scratch the daughter's face...<br><br>The father stepped down of the vehicle to come to her aid. She stood there stunned and shocked while the other daughter fainted almost immediately after seeing the dead baby.<br><br>The lady happened to be a victim of rape in the highway and the baby was not even born yet. She was raped and beaten before the alleged person decided to kill her. The rape incident happened several years back near Nilai, and it was in the Malaysian papers. Just that, the accused escaped from the charges.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOCATION: Genting Highlands Resort<br><br>Many people incurred gambling debts and committed suicide here.<br><br>Some visitors leaving the hotel lobby admitted to seeing a man in red shirt and jeans jumping off from the rooftop, just to disappear before he hits the ground. This action repeatedly occurs several times before it really disappears in thin air.<br><br>Certain rooms are not available for rent no matter how full the hotel was. They were closed down, however the route towards the area are still accessible, a place where most gamblers who have had a bad day would unintentionally wander there.<br><br>Those who have witnessed the incident reported that i t was filled with old Chinese ghost wards. They would subsequently fall sick for a few days afterwards. Most came up with fever and extreme fatigue. No common medications used for these symptoms were capable of treating them back. However, it was self-limiting.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOCATION: KUALA KANGSAR COLLEGE<br><br>This academic institution is said to be a former site of a Japanese occupation camp during WW2. Students who stays there in the hostel sometimes found themselves awakened by something that stares down directly at them. They will remain paralyzed for a few minutes (not sleeping paralysis) and will be treated to a vision of the figure, with red eyes, sharp teeth, ragged clothes, strange sick smell and a monotonous facial expression.<br><br>A marching platoon can be heard coming from the field, together with the sounds of chains. A tree on campus which is right beside a lamp-post where the light shines down on it casts a shadow of a man hanging from the tree. Cries could be heard from the school basement, sound of a knife plunging onto a wooden table and bottles rolling on the floor repeatedly.<br><br>A vision of a Japanese officer with his uniform still on would lead a squad of British soldiers in the hallway for execution. The group would march across the hallway and after taking a turn towards the execution chamber, the column will disintegrate in thin air. This is where the sounds of chain and cries would come from.<br><br>These are typical urban legends where these schools were once colonial sites where executions are carried out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: HOTEL ROOM HAUNTED<br><br>This one occurred several years back whereby I heard from my uncle. He as most of you recalled from the previous posting works as a tourist guide. One day, when taking a group of tourist to the Genting Resort, he decided, out of reluctance to book the old hotel which was primely noted to be haunted.<br><br>The tourists, after being told about the story wanted to experience for themselves as they never believed in the supernatural. They thought that it was just based on superstition, the believe of the Malaysians.<br><br>Henceforth, came the first night, I shall relate the story on one couple who experienced the phenomenon. They were sleeping (a guy and a girl of course) in a small room (the old hotels) occupied with a one-man fitting bathroom.<br><br>After a whole day of gambling and outdoor theme park activities, they retired to bed, both of them really tired. The girl immediately fell asleep while the guy decided to read a book he bought earlier from the Genting Souvenir and Book Shop. While reading halfway, he fell asleep leaving his bedside lamp on.<br><br>About 3 am, the girl was awokened by a harsh voice calling out to her. She opened her eyes and freaked out because this voice was not of his husbands. It was deep and coarse. The voice then stopped and she could hear someone vomiting severely with fluids hitting onto the floor as though this man was drunk. The vomiting action continued and with each gasp and throw, the girl had goosebumps. She decided to pretend to fall asleep and felt a pressure over her chest. The pressure became harder and harder on her, and she was nearly out of breath.<br><br>The voice came back again and ask her to leave the next day for this was his room. And he was angry particularly for she was sleeping on her bed. The pressure became deeper and deeper and nearly choking her to death, she pleaded and cried out verses and scriptures from the Bible. The figure was reluctant to let go and instead push her towards the other side and she fell with a thump, hitting her head on the wall. As she opened her eyes, she could see a silhouette of a dark man, with no eyes and unshaved beard. The right chin was pierced with shards of beer bottles and his nostrils were stuffed with cigarette butts. His mouth was filled with black spots and there was a slash mark on the upper region of his neck. There were more glass shards on his chest piercing through his body. The figure had no fingers and one of his arm was cut off. She promised the ghost that she would leave immediately and would not make a fuss out of it anymore.<br><br>The ghost disappeared and she woke her husband up and they both left the place hurriedly.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE CEMETERIAL ENCOUNTER - SINGAPORE, contributed by a photographer, I shall relate this story in my own words, since I don't have the real copy with me.<br><br>Alright this happen about 2 years back when 2 students decided to hand-in their project on carvings in the eleventh hour. They only have one day left when they finally decided to sit down and do their project. Above all, they have one week to complete during their break but decided to hack it and save it by going shopping and hanging out.<br><br>This 2 girls by the fake name of Yolanda and Genie decided to go to a cemetery, since that place offers the best carvings on the tombstones and also the statues. It would be a marvellous idea, according to Genie, for they can capture wonderful engravements and designs on the burial ground. They went there at about 9 pm when the cemeterial guards are off-duty (somewhat a silly time to do so, however, like many of you, they did not believe in the supernatural). Henceforth, when arriving they get their camera ready and moved through the place to survey for the most beautiful carving. There were some, but it was located deep inside the burial ground as these tombstones were the earliest of the rest since it was constructed in honor of the British Soldiers who died during their service against the Japanese occupation.<br><br>Yolanda and Genie came upon an especially much older tombstone and looked at it in awe. There was a beautiful carving on the stone and a statue of Virgin Mary located towards the front of the carving. While Genie was setting up her tripod and settling the camera on it, Yolanda was admiring the carvings. As she was about to touch it, she noticed the statue tipped towards the left (as in move by itself). She freaked out, rubber her eyes and looked again, and indeed it was a little bit towards the left now. She decided to keep quiet and did not want to frighten Genie, so proceeded to take pictures of the tombstone.<br><br>They went around the burial site and took more pictures for about 1 and a half hours, and decided to call it a night when Genie noted that her camera lens cover was missing. She must have left it in the first tombstone area since she recalled not closing her camera lens after that. Both of them ran towards the site and yes, it was there right in front of the statue, but they noticed that the statue had disappeared. Where could it have gone? Replacing the statue was a hole.<br><br>They search frantically for it around the stone with their flashlight but they were not able to came up with any findings. Yolanda came up with the conclusion that probably Mary must have sunk inside the hole. Genie grabbed Yolanda's hand and took flight, leaving behind her water bottle. They did not dare to even turn back.<br><br>Both did not discuss about the issues anymore, and decided to put it back on their minds.<br><br>FIVE days later, Yolanda decided to go back to explore again in broad daylight. She brought three friends, this time Genie not included and they reached the place at about 9am, where there were several other people around cleaning their relative's tombstone. Yolanda went straight to the burial ground and found to her amazement that the statue was back as it was again, together with Genie's water bottle right in front of the statue.<br><br>Could this have been a case of thievery, it would not have been returned...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PENANG: PLAYING WITH DOGS: AYER ITAM<br><br>This one is peculiar yet interesting. One of my childhood friends would walk to school every single day, and he would notice this in his neighborhood's house almost every day at about 7 am.<br><br>This was his first morning when he saw the incident. While walking down the street that leads to the school, he heard a dog barking several times followed by a whining sound. He walked towards the sound of where it came from thinking that there was a dog abuse case happening.<br><br>As he reached the place, he saw a terrier (small sized dog) prancing and pouncing towards something in mid air, yet falling down again backwards instead of forwards (since there was nothing towards the direction he was jumping at). The dog did this several time, without barking, yet it started to wag its tail. The dog's eyes was especially shining at that time. My friend knew the owner of the dog and would often play with it, but never noticed the eye was so shining before.<br><br>My friend was tickled at the dog's behavior at first, but when the dog did his last jump, it never came down. The dog was floating in mid air in a cuddled position as though someone was carrying it. My friend was spooked and nearly pissed his pants. He gave out a loud cry calling out his neighbor's name... The dog was then thrown vigorously onto the floor surprised probably from the scream.<br><br>The neighbor already knew that this will happen after my friend explained what happened. The dog was very close to the neighbor's father (who is also fond of it) who just passed away several days ago. According to the Chinese belief, the dead will visit the house on the 7th day after their death.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE CURSED MIRROR<br><br>This story was told quite commonly throughout Malaysia, but I don't know how many of you have heard about this...<br><br>There was this well off lady who stayed in a now abandoned house a long while ago (name of location shall not be disclosed). She was married to a rich husband and was staying in this bungalow. Life was good and they did not have any kids because they did not planned to.<br><br>However, out of mistake, one night the lady discovered that she was pregnant after missing her period for 3 weeks. She decided to test herself with the test kit and it was positive. Much to her dismay and to her husband's they agreed to abort it, since they have no likings or interests in bringing up a children.<br><br>The procedure was carried out. Thinking that this was over, they were both smiles as they had the problem settled. One week later, the lady's husband suffered a heart attack and passed away quietly in his sleep while hospitalized in an ICU.<br><br>Sad as she was, she remained single after her husband's death. Often she would look into her mirror day and night, staring into the blanks because she was really depressed. It was not until one night when she decided never again to look into the mirror.<br><br>As she was sitting down for the night after a simple dinner, she brushed her hair by looking in the dressing table's mirror. A flickering of light happened in the glass and stunned by the occurrence, she dropped her brush on the floor. Thinking that she must have been tired, she smiled and bent down to collect the brush. As she got up again, what she saw in the reflection of the mirror shocked the living guts out of her.<br><br>A long haired lady, much to her resemblance, but with black and bruised eyes was staring at her with a depressed expression. There were fluids trickling out from her nose and it was creamy yellowish in color. The eyes were distorted and it looks as if it was about to pop out anytime. The reflection's head was filled with plenty of bruises and part of the scalp could be seen peeling outwards. The reflection was wearing the same night gown as the lady and before she could scream or do anything, the reflection put her own hands onto her face and gently squeeze it. The whole skin of the face melted and peeled off. What was left was a yellowish slough filled with reddish and bloody base. The mouth was still intact and the whole skin of the body began to peel open. Flesh by flesh, her skin was torn apart. There was no blood, but as each flesh tears apart, the attaching structures could be seen to come off together.<br><br>The reflection asked the lady... Why did you take me out? Why!!<br><br>The lady gave a loud scream, fainted and never recovered from her illness. She passed away 3 days later from severe cerebral hypoxia and status epilepticus.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Contributed by Lamckay:<br>TOPIC: THE GRAVE EXPLORATION<br><br>I convinced my friends to visit a grave yard one night. I have been to the grave yard a couple of times before, alone and with friends. It is truly a weird sight to behold. To get there, you have to drive about a mile up a gravel road, park your car in a small ditch, hop over a fence, walk about five minutes through a corn field until you are greeted by a large white cross. You don't see any graves at first, only rusted metal markers. I don't know if they are graves or not, but it's pretty creepy. Farther back are the graves. Graves of the insane and mentally ill.<br><br>Equipped with flash lights, we trudged through the corn field into the grave yard. My friends clung to each other as we entered the clearing. The tall white cross loomed out in front of us. "If some thing happens, our best bet is to go under that cross," I teased my friends. We laughed together and split up to explore. The MHI grave yard has three main grave areas. Each area has about 20 graves. I made my way to the farthest area. The graves there were the oldest. Some were broken, some were sunken far into the ground, all were covered with green moss. I carefully avoid tripping on the sunken graves and tried to make out the lettering in the starless night. I couldn't. But I knew from experience none of the graves here had names, only numbers and dates of death. No one has been buried here for more then 100 years.<br><br>I felt the yellowing graves and tried to imagine why the people underneath me were placed in a mental health institute, when I felt a cold breath on my back. I stood still. I heard my friends laughing towards the corn field. Minutes passed and I dismissed the breath as a cold piece of wind. I went back to my thoughts.<br><br>There it was again, an icy breath on the back of my neck. This time it wasn't just cold, it also smelt like decay. A rotten stench filled my nose. I didn't stop to think about what had happened this time. I took of running to the cross. Underneath the cross, I stopped for breath. Finally regaining confidence, I looked up for my friends. I saw one. "Bill," I said gratefully, "I'm so glad your here." I walked towards Bill and the smell of decaying flesh hit me again. I tried to take Bill's hand but my arm flew though his hand. It wasn't Bill. The object smiled at me, his teeth black like tar, his hair ruffled in the wind. He was transparent. I saw through him. He asked me, "Is this cross going to protect you?"<br><br>I never found out. I ran away from that smelly man, through the corn field, and into my car where I waited for my friends with the radio turned all the way up. When they came back, I told them what happened. They think I'm full of crap.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JAPANESE OCCUPATION COLLECTION<br>TOPIC: SQUEAKING CHILD<br><br>My uncle used to work in a school administration office when he was about 25 prior to venturing into the fields of tourism industry. This happened in the 80s when the computers were not much popularized yet in every home. The only computers available for office work is of course in the school.<br><br>My uncle would go there at 8pm and complete his office job up to about 11pm before retiring back to his house for the day. Nothing much happened throughout his one year work there but towards the very end of his working days for the school, he finally came across the supernatural.<br><br>He was up one night in the school preparing exam papers for the following day submitted in late by the teachers. While typing, with his table lamp on he could hear from the next room, a sound of a kid screaming in excitement. It was not that loud, yet it was quite soft... But it was audible. My uncle did not know what fear is. He went to check out the noise coming from the next door, thinking that someone might have gone inside the room. He could not find anything at all, but kept hearing the voices throughout his night there. He was disturbed but nevertheless, he kept on with his work, until he saw a white orb flashing outside of his room door. He was of course surprised to see the orb, but kept quiet and resumed his work, until he finished his job.<br><br>Without much fear, he talked to the orb, plainly telling it the purpose of him staying up late in his mother tongue. The orb seemed to have understood it and fled off towards the main gate of the school and back towards the cemetery (the school opposite the cemetery horror story as promised).<br><br>He put this report to the security guard taking care of the school outside who also reportedly said that he has been seeing these orbs lately, but dismissed them and ignored them, hence it did not really disturb him except for turning on and off the corridor lights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: STOWAWAY<br><br>There is this group of 5 friends who decided to go up a once common holiday location in Malaysia (I forgotten specifically where this happened). They did not believed in the spirits when they were told that it was the main reason the resort up there had to close down. There were less and less tourist up there as the days went by and finally they had to shut down.<br><br>Villagers there often hear dogs staying up late at night, howling and barking, and they would see orbs or flames floating nearby the jungle. There was a strong spirited sense in the whole holiday resort and almost everyone who went up there would either at times witness a black hole in their hotel room which never existed, or could never see their reflection in the mirror. Some would get diarrhea or piss out blood during their stay but automatically resolve without treatment when they get down from the hill.<br><br>These group of 5 friends wanted to explore like most eager teenagers and drove a Pajero Jeep up at about 9am. The trip from their house to the hill would then take about 4-5 hours judging from the road condition that they have to take. When approaching the hill, they rested in a nearby R&amp;R and the uncle there warned the group about going up there. The group members laughed inside their hearts and took him as a fool. Now there is one particular member in the group whose courage wasn't that great, so when the uncle offered help by passing them his telephone number when problem arises, he accepted it. The others didn't really bother about it.<br><br>As they make their way up the hill, they could sense their jeep getting slower and slower. The slope of the hill wasn't that great, it was just about a 25 degrees slope. Up and up they went until they reach halfway (now about 4 pm) their car came to a sudden halt. The engine died out. The driver got down and checked his car. There wasn't anything wrong. The battery was new, the radiator was good, all the oil towards the necessary compartment of the different systems of the car were well-functioning. But what could have happened? He just sent it for an overhaul 2 days prior to travelling up the hill.<br><br>After a wild check, the driver heard some unsound noises that irritated his nerves. It was uncomforting and the rest was able to hear it as well. It was a noise of a shriek followed by laughter in high pitch. It continued over and over again. Seeing that it will get dark soon, the member who has the telephone number called the uncle. He arrived about an hour later, and his facial expression was not good. He looked very disturbed, but nevertheless he and his mechanic got the car done by hot-wiring the car and took all of them done without a doubt. They were able to see the uncle mumbling out unintelligeble words throughout the time when the mechanic was getting the car fixed.<br><br>As they got down to the base of the hill, they were told that there were altogether 6 spirits holding up the car under them and another one that is floating nearby, surrounding the car and making a circle repeatedly. Had they stayed on, they would have been possessed by the spirits. The driver and 2 other passengers was able to sense the eerie feeling and they had goosebumps and stomach irritation when they were up there. Although they were not able to see the spirits, feeling their presence was meekly enough to scare the living guts out of them.<br><br>This place was especially haunted as there were hidden graveyards along the way up the resort. These graves were constructed for unknown soldiers who resist against the Japanese during the World War 2. Some unfortunate tourist would hear their name being called, and would venture into the deep and were never found again. Some would appear again 2 weeks later, with bruises and lacerations all over their body, as though someone attempted to skin him alive.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ORANG BUNIAN (description from Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Bunian)<br><br>Orang Bunian are a species in Malay legends, similar to elves.<br><br>They are said to exist in large communities, mimicking human social structures, with families and clans. Orang Bunian are said to inhabit the deep forests, far from human contact, but they are also known to live near human communities, and are even said to share the same houses as human families. Some hauntings are attributed to orang bunian.<br><br>Orang bunian possess great supernatural powers, and have been known to befriend and assist humans, in particular pawangs or bomohs(malay shamans). Orang bunian are known to abduct human children, and are often blamed for leading people astray in the deep forest.<br><br>As orang bunian are very similar to human beings(except for the fact that they are usually 'ghaib' or 'halimunan', i.e. invisible and have supernatural powers) it is not unknown for them to intermarry with humans. Once a human being has gone to live with the orang bunian, he or she cannot return to the normal world, as orang bunian live far longer than human beings. Stories are recounted of men who married orang bunian, but pining for their families they left behind, decided to leave the orang bunian. Upon their return to human society, they found that everyone they once knew has died, and that many years have passed- similar to the tale of Rip Van Winkle.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SOME Malaysian BELIEFS (Special Thanks to TheTropics for the source)<br><br>Toyol<br>This is a spirit which is kept in a jar with a fetus and some special liquid to preserve it. The toyol is kept by people to do their bidding, but the price for keeping it is you have to feed it your own blood everyday. Some toyols have special 'needs' as well. If the spirit is that of a child, you'd usually have to provide it with a couple of toys to play with. If money goes missing and white ants (or termites) are found where the money should have been, the toyol has just done its bidding for their master.<br><br>Pontianak<br>This is perhaps the most frightening of all ghosts and ghouls of South East Asia. It is said that the pontianak is the spirit of a woman who died of childbirth. Sometimes she can look very beautiful, but most of the time she has razor teeth and stalks the night in search for men or pregnant women (it is said she could not bear the thought of other women being able to enjoy motherhood)to suck blood from (sometimes eat the flesh of babies ripped out from their mothers). There are many stories of the pontianak, but perhaps the scariest is the one which happened on the Malaysian highway.<br><br>Kum Kum<br>The Kum Kum is an old witch who attacks young virgins in her attempt to regain her youth and beauty. According to legend, she got her name as she cannot say the whole Malay greeting and can only say these 2 syllables.<br><br>Hantu Tetek<br>Loosely translated from Malay, Hantu Tetek means 'Ghost Breast'. This ghost is female and has huge Breasts, which she is said to use to suffocate her victims.<br><br>Bomoh<br>This is neither ghost nor ghoul, but a man practised in the arts of magic. He is often the man locals will turn to with a 'difficult' problem to solve and he will do it, often for a small fee.<br><br>Jiang-Shi<br>Jiang-shi is the Chinese vampire. Does the same thing as Dracula and sucks blood, but they can only hop around with their arms outstretched. They don't talk at all &amp; you can escape them by throwing a handful of glutinous rice. The grains will hit the Jiang-shi like little firecrackers, giving you time to make your get-away.<br><br></div>

She related this to my mother and a few friends when they visited her in her apartment.<br><br>It so happened that (this story happened 7 years ago) when they moved in to the new apartment, her husband had fallen ill, terminally ill for the next coming few months and was not able to work and walk around.<br><br>Her housing appliances were always haywire, her banknotes always displaced and her books were always disappearing, only to reappear on the same place days after frantically searching for it.<br><br>It was not until 2 months into her stay in the apartment did she began to feel the heavy presence in her room which was disturbing her. She could not fall asleep like she could previously and had this feeling of being monitored closely and watched. She judiciously claimed that the person watching her is on the wall above her clock, which was directly opposite to her bed.<br><br>At night when she was sleeping, she will almost always be awakened by a swirling noise in the water. She would wake up and see this black spot on the wall which grows bigger and bigger and would then spin in circular motion. She could hear disturbing voices of evil spirits and devils chanting in her ears. At times she would even feel her feet burning and though this may be quite a few encounters, she actually see her feet on fire. At this occassion, she began to scream, but her neighbors and her husband did not respond. They were so sound asleep as though the evil spirit might have cast a spell on them.<br><br>She would be pressured both from the visions and from the anxiety. Her heart would weaken with every episode and she would not be able to sleep and concentrate the next morning. This would go on for several weeks, until towards the final day before the devil was exorcised from the house, she came to the devil face to face. She was threatened with her life and she could feel her soul being taken out from her body (feeling of a rollercoaster making a sharp descent). She fought hard and remembered the Bible verses and the Lord's prayer she was taught in church. She recited it several times, but with each time the pressure got harder and the noises got louder and much more irritating. She could sense more evil spirits surrounding her and making her go crazy. She would sweat buckets and her arms and legs would be paralyzed (no, not sleeping paralysis). She would be in a sitting position but she just can't move her arms and legs. It was as if she was being held down.<br><br>She cried out loud that very final night and shouted out the prayer she was taught several times. The Devil at first went against her by slapping her and pulling her forwards, but towards the end, they decided to leave her alone.<br><br>Daybreak, she called up the priest from the church she was attending, and her house was then blessed. There were still occassions when her electrical appliances still would auto-shut and on... however, she moved out the very following year.</div>

Seeing much horror movies, the guy freaked out and prayed that he would reach ground floor as soon as possible.<br><br>Halfway through the lights of the lift went out, it was about 11.20pm around that time. The guy freaked out and tried to calm himself. He dare not turn around to look at the girl and suddenly he started smelling things. A sharp, yet an odd fouling smell came from behind the girl. It smells as though there is a body in the lift at an advance stage of decomposition...<br><br>He prayed and prayed and as the lift descended to the 10th floor, the lights came back on. He thanked his prayers and waited impatiently for it to reach ground floor. As the lift door opened up, the guy got out and curiously turned around to see the girl who was just walking out. The security guard greeted them and to the guy's relief, the girl was a human after knowing her name from the security guard.<br><br>He asked her, aren't you afraid at all at that time when the lights went out? And did you smell that horrific smell? I thought there was a ghost.<br><br>The lady shyly replied, no I wasn't afraid... the guard told me that there will be an electric disturbance at about this time, but its only for a few seconds. And sorry about the smell, I actually farted.... I had garlic for dinner...<br><br>The guy stared at her momentarily and the lady replied, WHAT!! Beautiful girls like me don't fart?<br><br>BUSTED!!!</div>
