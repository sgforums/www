It is this free-moving of the animals that make them unique in their own ways, and it saddens me greatly whenever I walk past a pet shop and see a bird trapped within the cage, struggling for its freedom. It is hence my firm belief that animals and birds should never be kept in cages.<br><br>As mentioned, it is the natural instinct of animals to roam around freely, without restrictions. By locking them up in a cage, we are depriving them of that freedom, perhaps even going against Nature in the process of doing so. Birds should be flying around freely, back to the sky where they belong, and not be kept in a cage for our selfish pleasure. If humans have the freedom to do what they want, like caging the animals, then all the more animals should have the freedom to decide where, and how they live; it is their life after all.

Who are we to talk about “freedom”, if we are contradicting ourselves in our actions?<br><br>While some may be mesmerized by the animal performances during a circus show, to me, the animal performances is actually a form of animal cruelty. Keeping the animals in cages, keeping them away from where they should be is certainly not a welcomed idea. Being caged often means a worse life for the animals. A perfect example would be the circus animals. Circus animals are often kept in cramped, unhealthy conditions, that they are transported in cages, which are too small for them and that they are cruelly treated by their trainers. Any circus animals are kept in small cages, not having any room to move around. In the wild, elephants might walk up to twenty miles every day but in a circus, they are chained up and not allowed to walk until they go into the ring to perform. They spend almost their entire day barely able to move, let alone being able to perform natural behaviors such as socializing. This creates stress and frustration and lead to abnormal behaviors such as rocking, swaying and nodding. It is clear for all to see why caging the animals is a form of cruelty.<br><br>Furthermore, more often than not, caged animals are unable to survive on their own once released. Over time, these animals get used to the comfort of their cage and tames gradually. They lose their basic instinct for survival in the wild and eventually end up in a state where they are unable to fend for themselves if released back to where they belong. Many may think, “I will take care of it till its death!” Noble thought, which unfortunately does not materialize often. There are definitely irresponsible pet owners out there who simply abandon their pet when they are sick of it. When that happens, these helpless animals are left to fend for themselves, with practically no knowledge on surviving in the wild. Some will survive, some get injured, some die. Indirectly, those who caged the animals become a ‘murderer’, and the ‘weapon of murder’ is none other than the cage.<br><br>While the desire to keep the animals in cages as pets may be great, greater should be the awareness of what will be the consequences of doing so. Unless you love cruelty, take joy in depriving the animals of their freedom, or enjoy having a part to play in their death, I strongly encourage that animals and birds should never, ever be kept in cages. Are you going to sacrifice the animals, just for your pleasure in keeping them, or for entertainment?<br><br></span><br><br>crappy essay</div>

They spend almost their entire day barely able to move, let alone being able to perform natural behaviors such as socializing. This creates stress and frustration and lead to abnormal behaviors such as rocking, swaying and nodding. It is clear for all to see why caging the animals is a form of cruelty.<br><br>Furthermore, more often than not, caged animals are unable to survive on their own once released. Over time, these animals get used to the comfort of their cage and tames gradually. They lose their basic instinct for survival in the wild and eventually end up in a state where they are unable to fend for themselves if released back to where they belong. Many may think, “I will take care of it till its death!” Noble thought, which unfortunately does not materialize often. There are definitely irresponsible pet owners out there who simply abandon their pet when they are sick of it. When that happens, these helpless animals are left to fend for themselves, with practically no knowledge on surviving in the wild. Some will survive, some get injured, some die. Indirectly, those who caged the animals become a ‘murderer’, and the ‘weapon of murder’ is none other than the cage.<br><br>While the desire to keep the animals in cages as pets may be great, greater should be the awareness of what will be the consequences of doing so. Unless you love cruelty, take joy in depriving the animals of their freedom, or enjoy having a part to play in their death, I strongly encourage that animals and birds should never, ever be kept in cages. Are you going to sacrifice the animals, just for your pleasure in keeping them, or for entertainment?<br><br></span><br><br>crappy essay</div></blockquote>just some comments, you may want to use this to improvethe essay but feel free to disagree.<br><br>firstly your first paragraph, which looks like an intro is actually a condensed from of the 2nd paragraph. or rather the 2nd paragraph is a long winded version of the first.<br><br>the comfort in para 4 conflicts with tthe cruelty in para 3, you might want to qualify that you are talkign abotu pets or soemthing.<br><br>first sentence is a statement thats sweeping but has no basis</div>
