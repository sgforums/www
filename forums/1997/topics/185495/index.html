            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is true that as you grow older, your understanding of what love is changes<br><br>I think about the way I viewed love and relationship in my teens, and compare it to NOW, I would agree that it was certainly extremely immature - what I thought was love then, and my expectations in a relationship.<br><br>However, the unfortunate requisite of the change is the need to experience folly. Many people learn through personal stupidity, and need to run through the necessary gamut of rejection, loss, hurt, betrayal - before they understand what it means to love.<br><br>And I guess as parents, it is natural to want to protect their children from this pain, even if they know deep down inside, its necessary.<br><br>You can only know as much of Love as you have experienced it.</div>
