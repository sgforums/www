            <div class='col-md body'>if you look at a person, your purpose would probably convey something that means, hi there. And you can do this by looking to his eyes and smiling. If you look all over his body, instead of achieving this you probably will cause anxiety and embarrasement because you make him feel out of place or weird.<br><br>If you want to convey pity, instead look at him in the face and smile, it will tell him u respect him as a dignified individual. Never underestimate the power of a smile. Theres no need to purposely avoid him or his gaze by looking all over the place. It would seem forced, unnatural and purposely an attempt to avoid him. Its the most neutral approach but i don't think youd feel good after doing that.</div>
