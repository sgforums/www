For example. one type known as extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of MALT (mucosa associated lymphoid tissue) type is common in the stomach and is usually due to a bacteria known as Helicobacter pylori. Another type which is very aggressive, known as Burkitt lymphoma, is due to the EBV virus, and is endemic in parts of Africa but we do see it in our population as well.

For that reason, it was used to induce an abortion in India but really you need heaps of it to work (if it does). As it may induce uterine contraction, it may help to expel mestrual blood during a period. The data on papain is very old...I only know of a paper in 1960 and I have never advocated papaya as a means of regulating menses.<br><br>I do not know about green tea or water melon in this context.

This disease has to be treated very quickly with strong chemotherapy but a cure is possible, although not everyone can withstand the strong drugs that have to be used. Various forms of large B-cell lymphoma are also rather aggressive.<br><br>With aggressive lymphomas, the treatment may be as likely to kill the patient as the cancer so the doctor has to consider the health and youth of the patient, the aggressiveness of the cancer and the patient's own desire to decide on the treatment. It is therefore important to type or classify the lymphoma accurately, so that the oncologists can predict its prognosis and use the most appropriate therapy.<br><br>A little lump in the throat was likely an enlarged lymph node. Bruises all over the body can be due to low platelet count, which may occur because the cancer has replaced the bone marrow. Swelling of the face and breathing problems when lying down may occur with a large mediastinal tumour such as primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma more common in females and located in the chest cavity but to know the type, you need to look at the histology. We can keep on speculating but there are quite a number of possibilities so you will have to ask the doctor as to what is the histological diagnosis.<br><br>Many people do not realize that with cancers it is not the GP, surgeon or oncologist you see who makes the diagnosis. It is made by a pathologist, who works behind the scene to provide consultation to various medical doctors. Lymphoma diagnosis is more difficult than other cancers, requiring advanced techniques using immunohistochemistry and increasingly, techniques in molecular genetics. For example, in this case, one must confirm or exclude Burkitt lymphoma, a very aggressive tumour, by its immunophenotype and whether there is a translocation of a gene, known as c-myc.<br></div>

The body tries to regenerate and compete with the loss initially, but over time, the body is itself exhausted over such potential.
