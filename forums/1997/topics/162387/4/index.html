Sensory VS. taste - a particular person experiences a bitter taste in his mouth (taste) while he shapes hamburger patties in his hands (sensory)<br><br>2. Auditory VS visual: while playing the C# note on the piano (auditory) the person sees a tint of blue (visual); other notes would make her see other colours. therefore if she listens to music, yes, she will see many different colours going on and off<br><br>3. Visual VS colour: while looking at black printed numbers (visual), this person can see them in colour. E.g. while presented a black 7, the person sees a red colour.<br><br>these are some of the examples of synesthesia. it is not a medical condition, as the person's well-being is normal, and can carry on with day-to-day functions. i have not encountered them before, but got these from journals and psychologists who made studies on them.<br><br>some call Synethesia: pple who can blend senses together.<br><br>reasons why they happen are still a mystery, though some studies have been made. E.g. of some of the reasons (not proven though):<br><br>1. through learning and conditioning: associating colour with visual stimuli, till it becomes a non-thinking situation (happens naturally)<br><br>2.somatosensory cortex (in e brain) that are v close to each other can affect one another. hence a so called false activation of other senses.<br><br>3. just like how the olfactor bulb (sense of smell) can triger of memories, e.g this stranger who is using a particular scent passes u, u regconize it and immediately reminds u of ur bf/gf. this analogy is used to explain pple with syntaesthesia - pple w other methods of triggering different senses.<br><br></div></blockquote>strange that you're learning it as a psychological condition. but i guess that's the way this condition is treated for the time being. i'm reading about it from the cognitive neuroscience view. medically, people with this condition have been dismissed as attention seeking or having psychological disorders or just plain crazy. however, for the neuroscience view, there does seem to be proof that it is a physiological condition. for one, it is a familial and not too rare (occurs in 1 out of 200) and the strange thing is that it occurs 7 times more often in artistically inclined people.<br><br>now that to me is very interesting...and since there are some artistically inclined people here...i wonder...do you guys actually have that mixed senses thing? or even see color when you're looking at days, months and the like?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Any recent history of playing in the football field or jungle trekking? It sure will be itchy as all the anti-inflammatory chemicals will be there, but do resist from scratching as it often will delay healing process, because of pressure to the granulation tissues (healing tissue)...<br><br>Keep the wound dry, wear new socks, walk around more for improved circulation for faster healing...<br><br>Yellow pus is Staphylococcus aureus infection, a famous skin commensal. May I suggest using the appropriate antiseptic cream if the ulcer or breach is not too large and cover it with a clean bandage, change it often and try not to wet your wound during bathing...<br><br>Remember that superficial skin infection can progress to impetigo and then sepsis.</div>

The sensation comes with stress and tension from work and you will feel that there is this lump or some ppl may describe it as a tightness around the neck and finds it hard... it is as though one is being smothered to death...<br><br>Breathing then becomes uncomfortable and so is appetite at times... Most ppl affected have Type A personality, meaning that they are panicky, easily irritated and wants to get things done in the fastest and their own way... They are usually ppl who are easily agitated and cannot relax easily...<br><br>Scopes can be done to rule out any potential carcinoma of the esophagus or any benign polyps in there, but there is usually no medical diagnosis to this...<br><br>You have to learn how to relax yourself and up to a point even towards changing your personality...<br><br>I shall refer you to <span style="color: blue;"><strong>alfagal, my liaison psychologist</strong></span> for further consultation...<br><br>NB: This is purely a psychological phenomenon, as your muscles (pharyngus) tightens up during stress... Note that there are plenty of muscles surrounding the throat, some may not present like you do, some will often present as a headache towards their stress whereas others may present with gut symptoms...</div>

It is a diagnosis of exclusion and should not be entertained until all other potential causes have been investigated, including therapeutic trials of adequate intensity and duration. Since Reno has ruled you out of a series of bad cough, you could b a patient of Habitual cough<br><br>its is a syndrome of persistent, habitual throat clearing that may respond to biofeedback (something that triggers off ur cough reflex to rid the phlegm).<br><br>some suggestions:<br>1. take note of ur bodily patterns when u are about to cough. then from there explore to control e cough.  e.g. taking a deep breath before the cough starts, then do it everytime till e cough disappears.<br><br>2. since its habitual, habits = learnt. you can unlearn it. if u have e habitual throat clearing thingy that triggers off ur cough, then learn to control, and stop it. one way to do stop it is to keep clearing ur throat (consious effort) till you are tired, so tat next time, when u wanna clear your throat, you wld b reminded of the tiredness, you will stop clearing it, and hence e cough.<br><br>same goes for your cough, cough consiously till you are tired.<br><br>3. due to stressors. are u going thru some sort of stress? then pls indentify it, and learn to reduce stress.<br>-thru muscle-relaxation techiniques (squeeze ur muscles and letting it go), deep breathing, listen to music, get enough rest, excercise.<br><br>4. drinking: if u think u are drinking too much, it wouldnt hurt if u stop or reduce drinking for a start to stop your cough..<br><br>5. smoking can trigger of coughs too as it irritates ur throat...<br><br>my 5cents worth</div>

Most ppl affected have Type A personality, meaning that they are panicky, easily irritated and wants to get things done in the fastest and their own way...
