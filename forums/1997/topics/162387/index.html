Full explanation on the cough mechanism can be sought out from the Dengue Fever thread in Starblue's Heavens...<br><br></div>

In addition to it, impractical hygiene such as bathing a lot of times can be quite impossible... hence due to our busy nature, we often neglect our own personal responsibility in cleaning ourselves...<br><br>Other than that, there may be other causes, such as using the incompatible shampoo which is not suitable to you individually, over-sensitive skin or infected acne (which for your knowledge, can be grown anywhere, and not just the face, but also the chest, nape of the neck, the back of the head, the groin area and even the armpit and elsewhere).<br><br>Other more severe causes for burning scalp and itchy scalp can be related to the one cause I told you earlier in your question of your back. Malassezia furfur or also known as Pityriasis orbiculares are the infective fungal agent which causes what Chinese calls it the "pe tio".<br><br>On sweating particularly, it will irritate it and trigger it to be more itchy and pain (hence giving rise to a burning sensation).<br><br>This condition is called pytiriasis versicolor (PV) and its causative agent also causes vitiligo...</div>

The severe form is Cystic Fibrosis (in this case, thick sputum is actually produced, and the Reproductive and Gastrointestinal systems are affected as well) which is rampant in the Western Countries, but not in the Asian Countries...<br><br>In this condition, it is wise to get your chest investigated to seek out the underlying cause for it.<br><br>As for food, fat content in dairy products can thicken mucus. Hence, it is wise to reduce eating food with such high fat contents.<br><br>Drinking plenty of water helps to thin the mucus so that it moves more easily. It helps to reduce the amount of caffeine and alcohol in your daily fluid intake as well...<br><br>If these do not help much, you may consider a mucolytic agent from the pharmacy...</div>
