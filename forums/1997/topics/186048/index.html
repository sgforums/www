            <div class='col-md body'>..... He was driving home one evening on a two-lane country road. Ever since the Levi's factory closed, he'd been unemployed, but he'd never quit looking. Now with winter raging, the chill had finally hit home.<br><br>It was a lonely road. He could go down this road blind and tell you what was on either side, and with his headlights not working, that came in handy. It was getting dark and the snow flurries had started.<br><br>He almost didn't see the old lady stranded on the side of the road. He could see she needed help. So he pulled his sputtering old car up in front of her Mercedes and got out. Even with the smile on his face, she was worried. No one had stopped to help for the last hours. Was he going to hurt her? He didn't look safe--he looked poor and hungry. He could see that she was frightened and cold. He knew how she felt. He said,"I'm here to help you, ma'am. Why don't you wait in my car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Joe."<br><br>Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an older lady, that was bad enough. Joe skinned his knuckles a time or two setting up the jack. His bare hands were so cold he didn't feel it. Soon the tire was changed. as he put the jack away in the trunk, she came back to her car, warmed and calmed. She told Joe that she was from St. Louis and was on her way home. She thanked him and asked how much she owed him, Joe just smiled as he closed the trunk.<br><br>Any amount would have been all right with her. She had already imagined all the awful things that could have happened had he not stopped. Joe never thought twice about the money. This was not a job to him. This was helping someone in need and God knows there were plenty who had given him a hand in the past. He had lived his whole life that way and it never occured to him to act any other way. He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance that they needed, and Joe added, "and think of me."<br><br>A few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to eat and take the chill off before making the last part of her trip. It was a dingy looking place. Outside were two old gas pumps. Neither the cash register or the telephone rang very often.<br><br>The waitress brought her a clean towel to wipe the snow from her head and face. She had a sweet smile even after being on her feet all day. And she was eight months pregnant, but she never let the strain change her attitude. The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger. Then she remembered Joe.<br><br>After the lady finished her meal, and the waitress went to get her change from the hundred dollar bill, she slipped right out the door. When the waitress returned to the table she noticed something written on the napkin. It said,"You don't owe me a thing. I've been there too. Someone once helped me out the way I'm helping you. If you want to pay me back, here's what you do. Don't let the chain of love end with you."<br><br>Well, that night when the waitress got home from work and climbed into bed, she thought about the money and what the lady had written. How could she have know how much she and her husband needed it? With the baby due next month, it was going to be hard. She knew how worried her husband was, and as he lay sleeping next to her, she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low, "Everything's gonna be all right. I love you, Joe."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>man... i bet the Korean MTV or Japanese drama got something similiar to this...<br><br>how about i give u a heart warming story.. here goes...<br><br>Shawn.. who so loves his girlfriend Sara.. , one day decided to go mountain climbing to get the feel of excitement.. to do the one last thing that they will ever do together before they get married... the one last thing that they thought will be the greatest risk n excitement one could ever have. Mountain climbing. Mount Everest.. to test thier limits.. thier will , thier mental harship that they will face but nothing so hard as to climbing the tallest mountain in the world..<br><br>While 500 metres away from the top , below Shawn , Sara tangles on the carefully placed hangers unto the mountain..while straps unto them..pulling herself up towards Shawn.. an avalance..  Shawn looking down to her..knowing the invetible screams for her to hurry up.. but because of the steep hill n the slopes , the avalance swept them off the ridges... falling.. they screamed for each other... hoping that somehow..they will survive the fall..<br><br>Waking up , Shawn finds himself on the edge of a cliff... Sara dangling unconsciencly below him... while trying to pull her up.. he feels a sharp pain on his left leg...a boulder has crushed his leg..landing on his ankle.. blood oozing out of his already weak body. Unable to move.. he was unable to pull Sara up from the cliff... watching her unconscience body.. dangling.. as the ropes are beginning to give up due to the weight.. n the only way to save her was to pull her up.. n without the boulder crushing his leg, immobalising him.. His love for her so strong.. that he decided to do what no living man could do. Reaching from his pocket , he took out a spoon..the only object he could find.. sharp enough... n he started chipping away at his wounded leg.. stabbling the joints..bearing on the pain , only his thoughts of his love..Sara, preventing himself from fainting from the sheer pain.... chipping away ...finally breaking apart his ankle from the rock.. he pulled her up.. bleeding profusely..  he used the last ounce of his energy.. dragging her up...biting down on the pain.. n loss of blood..<br><br>Sara , waking up in the safe surroudings of the hospital asked franctically about the fate of Shawn. The doctors , shaking thier head , told of his ultimate sacrifice in pulling her body up with a dislodged leg.. n was unable to save him due to the large amount of blood..he lost.. n they told him rescuers found his lifeless body , written on the snow with his blood drenched hands.. ' Sara... i always told u i would give my life to u..even to the last moments.... i love u , n please live on.. happy and maybe next time , in another life.. we will see each other again..' Rescuers could not believe how in such a situation one could even write such a long message..with blood... only proves that with love , even on the verge of death.. one is able to express thier last moments n feelings to the one they truly love..<br><br>Moral of the story.. he shouldve' just cut the rope man...damn... that gotta hurt..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his way through school, found he had only one thin dime left, and he was hungry. He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly, and then asked, "How much do I owe you?"<br><br>"You don't owe me anything," she replied. "Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness."<br><br>He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and quit.<br><br>Years later that young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.<br><br>Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to the case.<br><br>After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, and then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. She feared to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked, and something caught her attention on the side as she read these words...<br><br>"Paid in full with one glass of milk. (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly." Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: "Thank You, GOD, that your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands."<br><br></div>

Reaching from his pocket , he took out a spoon..the only object he could find.. sharp enough... n he started chipping away at his wounded leg.. stabbling the joints..bearing on the pain , only his thoughts of his love..Sara, preventing himself from fainting from the sheer pain.... chipping away ...finally breaking apart his ankle from the rock.. he pulled her up.. bleeding profusely..  he used the last ounce of his energy.. dragging her up...biting down on the pain.. n loss of blood..<br><br>Sara , waking up in the safe surroudings of the hospital asked franctically about the fate of Shawn. The doctors , shaking thier head , told of his ultimate sacrifice in pulling her body up with a dislodged leg.. n was unable to save him due to the large amount of blood..he lost.. n they told him rescuers found his lifeless body , written on the snow with his blood drenched hands.. ' Sara... i always told u i would give my life to u..even to the last moments.... i love u , n please live on.. happy and maybe next time , in another life.. we will see each other again..' Rescuers could not believe how in such a situation one could even write such a long message..with blood... only proves that with love , even on the verge of death.. one is able to express thier last moments n feelings to the one they truly love..<br><br>Moral of the story.. he shouldve' just cut the rope man...damn... that gotta hurt..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>.....Selfless love  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">   My respect to Shawn *one minute silence*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

He had stopped to buy some flowers when he saw an old lady standing on her front porch. Thinking to himself, "Wouldn't it be nice if i gave her the flowers?" though aware that she might think him mad, he decided to risk it. The woman was so gratified that tears filled her eyes. She explained that nobody had given her flowers for years .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
