But if you do vigorous exercise without adequate warmup you can damage the muscle fibres...analogious to microscopic tearing of muscle fibres forced to hypercontact without adequate stretching ...damage to cells lead to leakage of muscle enzymes like creatinine kinase (rise after vigrous exercise) and stimulate release of various cytokines which stimulate the nerve endings and giving you sensation of pain. Obviously the buildup may take some time, so the aches can come later in the day or the next day...<br><br>Cytokines and inflammatory mediators do have a half life and degrade with time...damaged muscles can also repair..and symptoms will resolve with time.<br><br>What is salonpas and yoko yoko?</div>

Reminds me of the time more than 20 years ago when I met this very good and tall player at a tournament...he kept smashing whenever he could and I had to drop short all the time to prevent him. He thrashed me anyway...but later I found out he was the Selangor state player and had thrashed our national youth champion as well...<br><br></div>

But if you do vigorous exercise without adequate warmup you can damage the muscle fibres...analogious to microscopic tearing of muscle fibres forced to hypercontact without adequate stretching ...damage to cells lead to leakage of muscle enzymes like creatinine kinase (rise after vigrous exercise) and stimulate release of various cytokines which stimulate the nerve endings and giving you sensation of pain. Obviously the buildup may take some time, so the aches can come later in the day or the next day...<br><br>Cytokines and inflammatory mediators do have a half life and degrade with time...damaged muscles can also repair..and symptoms will resolve with time.<br><br>What is salonpas and yoko yoko?</div></blockquote>i dun quite agree with the lactic acid explanation... i tot the aches triggered by lactic acid build-up is immediate to after the vigorous exercise and is quickly dissipated after you've repaid your oxygen debt? so i dun think that explains the continued and delayed muscle aches we experience after hard exercise.<br><br>and if that's the case, then damaged and cytokine-releasing cells are the explanation. in which case, are u saying that muscle aches are a result of damage from exercise? and while we're at cytokines, arent those the buggers which trigger apoptosis?? are our cells dying as we ache, literally?? o.O</div>
