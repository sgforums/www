Muscle contraction is an enzymatic, biochemical process and as you know, enzymes work at an optimal temperature. Also, the contractile properties of muscle is relatewd to the degree of stretch...did you do those experiments measuring the degree contraction in a leg muscle from a frog at different extents of muscle stretch?<br><br>Cytokines play a variety of roles..they do trigger apoptosis but they are also very important for inflammation and cancer. Apoptosis can be triggered by various mechanisms and there are two major pathways...intrinsic via bcl2-bax and calicum release or extrinsic by interaction of fas (CD95) and fas-ligand in the TNF receptor pathway.<br><br>No t all your cells will die as tyou ache...they are damaged and the cytokines release cause you to ache, telling you there is some injury.

Of course it takes time to reset your cycles and so to be effective, a day or two before your trip you take the pill in Singapore in the day as it is bedtime in your destination, so that when you get there, your cycles reset already.<br><br>Problem is that you may feel sleepy in the day in Singapore as a result...so I usually used it when I am already in the plane or on arrival.
