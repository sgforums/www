We had a 5000-word term paper to write, and she hadn't even started on her portion with just two weeks to go to the deadline. And prior to that, I had helped her quite a bit by sending her my reference materials and my first draft when she claimed that she didn't know what to write.<br><br>When I finally confronted her, she confessed that she had been spending hours on MSN every day instead of doing her project.<br><br>That was when I totally lost my cool. At that point in time another good friend of mine had just committed suicide, and suffice to say that I was already so badly affected by it that I had to undertake professional counselling.<br><br>But even so, I forced myself to do my part of the project, knowing that it wouldn't be fair to my partner if I didn't. And what was this she was telling me? That she didn't do her part because she was lazy? And I was supposed to accept that lousy excuse?!?!<br><br>I raised my voice at her and soundly rebuked her. If it weren't for the fact that she was a girl, I would have hurled all sorts of foul language at her. I gave her one week to finish her part and threatened to report her to the lecturer if she didn't meet my deadline.<br><br>At that point I could see that she was near to tears. But I couldn't soften up - I can't let her drag my grades down. She could only say 'I'll try' when I asked her to promise to me to finish it on time. At this juncture I threatened to go to the lecturer's office immediately and report her misdeeds.<br><br>In the end she gave me a full promise. For one whole week she skipped all her lessons to labour on the paper. In the end, she was able to give me her portion - and I didn't have to carry out the threat.<br><br>It really, really sickened me to have to treat a woman that way - but I had no choice. If she wants to do badly for her studies, then that's her problem, but i draw the line at letting her drag me down with her.</div>
