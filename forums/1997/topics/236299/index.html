            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone with similar experiences?<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Just suddenly remembered something that happened years ago. There was once I was among some promoters doing a road show. There were a few booths there all selling their own stuff. One of the guys from my booth was pretty interested in one of the girls from the booth next to us.<br><br>The roadshow was for about half a week, so for the first 2 days, the guys from our booth would sometimes gather in a group and talk. It was slightly obvious we were looking and talking about the group. And everyime, my friend would be in the centre of us. So after a while, I guess the girl and her friends knew something was going on. We kind of could see they were talking about our group as well.<br><br>My friend was already shy enough to begin with, and when it became obvious she knew, he become even more reluctant to ask to know her. So I decided to go on his behalf and went to ask the girl's friend.<br><br>"My friend over there," I pointed at my friend. "Wants to know your friend over there," I point to the girl. "Can or not?"<br><br>Her reply totally stunned me,"Tell him to ask her himself then, you leh? You not going to ask anyone? You try lah."<br><br>Turns out she wanted me to ask her. Maybe all the while she was talking to her friends about me, I don't know. But of the group I just had to choose to approach her to help MY friend ask about HER friend.<br><br>After the conversation above, I went back and told my friend. "You have to ask yourself."<br><br>Another guy said,"She just said that? But you talked so long."<br><br>"Must ask yourself."<br><br>My friend finally asked after much coercing and persuasion by the whole lot of us. And the answer was a no. After days of pondering, wondering, staring, persuading, it all ended with a simple shake of the head and a few short words (summarised as "No").<br><br>Mine however didn't end. After my friend had been given the "No", I happened to be standing next to the girl I spoke to. The rest of the girls were huddled together talking about my friend.<br><br>She simply asked me,"So when's your turn to ask?"<br><br>I just stared at her a while and said,"Not yet."<br><br>For the rest of the time the roadshow was on, I didn't say anything to her. And we would occasionally glance in each other's direction and like, she stare at me, I stare at her. I wasn't shunning her or anything, and I didn't dislike her anything. But I just didn't know how to respond to her.<br><br>I must admit though, I had just been hurt not too long before this, so I guess I wasn't in the mindframe of trying to know a girl.<br><br>But to honest, I think rarely have I ever been more stunned than those few times.<br><br>On the very last day of the roadshow, we were standing near each other. Not next to but within earshot of each other. Both of us weren't standing next to anyone us and I heard her say,"Last day already, but still waiting."<br><br>She said this without looking at me but I guess she was waiting for a response from me. But I stayed silent, and I never saw her again after the roadshow ended.</div>

She wasn't ugly or anything and in fact, I think her looks was really ok to me. Just wasn't ready I guess.<br><br>She seemed really ok, and had the kind of hair I liked at that time. Maybe just wasn't the time.<br><br>It wasn't her, it was me.</div>
