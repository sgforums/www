            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These<br>cancer cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have<br>multiplied to a few billion. When doctors tell cancer patients that there<br>are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means<br>the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not<br>reached the detectable size.<br><br>2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in<br>a person's lifetime.<br><br>3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer<br>cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumors.<br><br>4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has<br>multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic,<br>environmental, food and lifestyle factors.<br><br>5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies,<br>changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.<br><br>6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing<br>cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone<br>marrow, gastro-intestinal tract etc and can cause organ damage, like<br>liver, kidneys, heart, lungs &amp; etc.<br><br>7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns,<br>scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.<br><br>8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will<br>often reduce tumor size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and<br>radiation do not result in more tumor destruction.<br><br>9. When the body has too much toxic burden from<br>chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or<br>destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and<br>complications.<br><br>10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to<br>mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also<br>cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.<br><br>11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer<br>cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.<br><br>CANCER CELLS FEED ON:<br><br>a) Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off<br>sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Sugar<br>substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal Spoonful &amp; etc, are made with Aspartame<br>and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would be Manuka honey or<br>molasses but only in very small amounts. Table salt has a chemical added<br>to make it white in color. Better alternative is Bragg's amino or sea<br>salt.<br><br>b) Milk causes the body to produce mucus,<br>especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By<br>cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened Soya milk cancer cells<br>are being starved.<br><br>c) Cancer cells thrive in an acid<br>environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and it is best to eat fish and a<br>little chicken rather than beef or pork. Meat also contains livestock<br>antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites, which are all harmful,<br>especially to people with cancer.<br><br>d) A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and<br>juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruits help put the body<br>into an alkaline environment. About 20% can be from cooked food including<br>beans. Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily<br>absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish<br>and enhance growth of healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building<br>healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables<br>including bean sprouts) and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day.<br>Enzymes are destroyed at temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).<br><br>e) Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which<br>have high caffeine. Green tea is a better alternative and has<br>cancer-fighting properties. Water-best to drink purified water, or<br>filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap water. Distilled<br>water is acidic, avoid it.<br><br>12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of<br>digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become<br>putrefied and leads to more toxic buildup.<br><br>13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By<br>refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the<br>protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to<br>destroy the cancer cells.<br><br>14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6,<br>Flor-ssence, Essiac, anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to<br>enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other<br>supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed<br>cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or<br>unneeded cells.<br><br>15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A<br>proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor.<br>Anger, unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and<br>acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn<br>to relax and enjoy life.<br><br>16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment.<br>Exercising daily and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the<br>cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy<br>cancer cells.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer<br>cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumors. </blockquote>this is inaccurate. a cell has to accumulate 4-6 minimum relevant mutations in order to become cancerous. usually, once a cell acquires the first mutation, its innate cell cycle checkpoints will be activated to prevent it from multiplying, and other processes then might lead to the cell's destruction.  however, once a cell becomes trully cancerous, the immune system can, at best, only slow down the rate of multiplication of the tumour cells.<br><br><blockquote>4.

If the biopsy is negative for tumour after treatment, it means the pathologist cannot detect it by looking down the microscope. Special investigations can be done to improve the accuracy of detection, eg. detecting abnormal cancer-associated proteins in cells that 'look' normal by immunohistochemistry/western blot or protein chip technology; detecting genetic changes in cancer cells that appear normal by fluorescence insitu hybridisation (FISH) and using PCR to detect minute amounts of cancer associated genetic changes. These additional tests are obviously more expensive and may not be routinely performed or available in many hospitals.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person's lifetime.</strong></blockquote>Not sure what this is talking about. Mutations occur in cells very commonly, some of which may cause cancers. It is a wonder that it does not occur more frequently.

The immune system has lots of checks and balances. For example, too much immunological reaction is bad...it leads to autoimmune diseases like SLE when the body's immune system attacks itself. A type of lymphoid cell known as regulatory T cells regulate and suppress the immune system to prevent the immunological reaction from going overboard.

            <div class='col-md body'>my father has liver cancer , he is in his 60s and just retired few months ago  from in public service as a SBS driver few months ago.<br><br>he has tumor which is 12cm big and the specialist at NCSS has already told us there is no more options for him for western medicine , in short , he is dying.<br>He has no responded from chemotherapy and his body is too fragile for radiation or more chemo. The tumor is too big and close to the liver for surgery and the chances he will die on surgery bed if he goes for it is extremely high.<br><br>There is no more options but to pray and use TCM as in ..dragging effort...<br><br>But this morning i heard my parents started arguing abt his meals...my mum been very stressed and tired over taking care of his daily needs..becoz of his sickness he has become very picky and perhaps very moody over his pain n suffering..<br><br>And for the first time in my life i seen my father cry...and i went over n console him...he says he feel helpless , a 'fei ren" and cant even do anything without anyone help...and he feels my mum doesnt understand him...its not him being picky abt the food n stuffs , but his sickness makes him smell and taste good-food become like crap...<br><br>sigh..my father is now nothing but skin and bones , ravaged by the gradual failure of his body systems .. and it really pains me and our family to see him like this and nothing we can do about it to ease his pain.<br><br>fyi : my father is not a smoker nor a alcoholic drinker in his entire life.<br><br>But that doesnt mean we should all go ahead and start smoking n drinking , its still means we have to live our lifes the best way we know how.<br><br>Its not how long you really live that matters , but how much you really lived?<br><br>U can live up to 120 and still not lived at all.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to hear that...presume he is Hepatitis B carrier? If he is, the rest of your family should be screened for it as well.<br><br>Liver cancer tends to be undetectable until it has grown pretty large. If the tumour has not spread, liver transplant is done in some places, although it is unlikely in Singapore given the shortage of organs available.<br><br>Since it is not surgically treatable and not responsive to chemotherapy (quite typical of liver cancer), some form of palliation may be possible. I was involved in the initial research studies to use biosilicon for treatment of advanced liver cancer. A phase II trial was being conducted in SGH. You can ask your father's oncologist about the possibility of entering him into the trial if the study is still open.<br>(http://www.psivida.com/news/download/ASX/pSivida%20ASX%20Release_PhaseIIb.pdf<br>http://www.pharmaceutical-business-review.com/article_news.asp?guid=1E2505ED-4D29-4781-8403-CB78720E3052)<br><br>Otherwise, your dad will need good palliative care and perhaps hospice care in time to come. Even though a cure is not possible, doctors can provide good pain relief and a fairly good quality of life in his last days. You can contact the hospice care hotline for further information:<br><br>http://www.lienfoundation.org/press/Sep4_SHCLien_hospice_release_final.pdf<br><br></div>
