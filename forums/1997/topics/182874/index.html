            <div class='col-md body'>Dark Humor<br><br>There are some things some people don't even talk about. But you somehow manage to make jokes about them. Your humor type is dark and you never met a topic that was too sacred. It's not that you're twisted (well, maybe a little); you just believe that laughter is the universal healer. There's always room to lighten the mood.<br><br>From broken hearts to broken limbs to death itself, you are willing to go where few others dare to venture. Whether you're watching Evil Dead 2 for the 58th time or whipping out another one of your morgue jokes, it's always refreshing for others to catch a glimpse through your cracked lens.<br>__________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Not true. In fact, my jokes are cold.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wit<br><br>You put the pun in punch line and you're probably always listening for the next play on words because you have a witty sense of humor. With your finger on the pulse of what's happening, your mind never stops thinking of the next clever line.<br><br>You're an entertainer at heart and you try to keep your material as fresh as possible. There's nothing better than a little observational humor (unless someone else thinks of it first). The only problem with telling a good story is that it inevitably reminds another person of a dull one. Thank you folks, you've been great, good night.<br><br>How come tt doesn't happens when i tell jokes to my classmates ??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sarcasm<br><br>Oh yeah, you're really funny. (Actually you are, but you're so sarcastic that it's hard to tell when you're joking.) You mean what you say, but almost never say exactly what you mean. In fact you usually say the exact opposite. For instance, if your friend is wearing an ugly watch, you might tell them, "I wanted a watch like that once, but I got the wrong Happy Meal." Yep, there's a slight edge to your humor, but all you are really doing is telling it like it is, only like it's not.<br><br>Whether you're roasting a friend or playing social critic, your deadpan delivery and dry cynicism go a long way to expressing your true feelings...and making people laugh along the way.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Goofy Humor<br>You have your standards: They may be low, but at least you have them. Sure, subtle wit makes some people grin and say, "Now that's funny." But you know the Three Stooges makes people howl with laughter. It's the physical stuff, the poop jokes and funny voices, that get you going because you have a goofy sense of humor. You have no problem making a fool of yourself as long as your moves to "fake" a fall break the ice and make people feel comfortable.<br><br>Wit, sarcasm, and satire can get lost in the translation, but a whoopee cushion is universal. Yes, it may be lowbrow Â— heck, it may even be nobrow, but getting laughs is what matters to you. From ye old court jesters to the kids of South Park, you and your goofy sense of humor are in good company.</div>
