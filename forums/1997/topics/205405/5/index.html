            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rainee:</div><div class="quote_body">Erm, what if you are together with a guy who is sumhow like, blatantly lying to you? Everyone knows that he is two-timing a girl for instance, although of course he hides it from his gf by telling her lies after lies. And maybe one day, the girl's best friend saw the bf with another girl behaving intimately sumwhere and told the girl about it, but still she decided not to pay caution to that and decided to continue to trust him. That's a bit naive isn't it? At least she should check it out and see if what her friend saying is true?<br><br>There can be some red flags in a r/s that one has to watch for. Like if you are with a man who keeps refusing to give you his phone number or refuses to let you visit him or call him at home, do you continue to trust him wholeheartedly and throw aside any doubts or will you go to find out the reason behind his reluctance?<br><br>And about the blog, I dun see anything wrong with having a blog while I am in a r/s. Similarly my dear has a blog as well, and I go there often to read his entries. He does the same for mine. It is just another way of communication between us. There are things that I will tell him directly, but there will be times when one of us is busy and the other has sth that he/she would like to talk about, so why not write it in the blog first? Then at least when I am free, I can go there and take a look, and know what he is thinking about at the time I was busy. At that time I will bring up the issues written in that particular entry in the blog and see if he would like to continue to talk about it.</div></blockquote>.....yeah the trust was clearly been corrupted in the first two stories. Need to scan with spyware  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Back to the blog, i think it is good idea from the way you explained. It served it's purposes. Instead of telling you his problem at the wrong time when you yourself is facing difficulties and stress, will be better to write in a blog. I guessed a blog is still better than your partner telling his problem to his close friends. At least in a blog you still can find out his problem and concious about it, rather than he told his friend and you will be kept in the dark. One disadvantage about blog is that a sense of mystery is lost?<br><br>Here's a side question, was talking to a friend few days ago. He told me when a girl made a mistake(some misunderstanding) and say sorry, the guy will most likely say no problem and forget it. But if it's the guy who made a mistake and say sorry, the girl will need to take a few days to forgive. He told me there is a reason behind this, if the girl forgive the guy very fast, that means she only treat him as normal friend( not to hurt or offend him). BUT if it is the guy who she is interested in(vice versa), she would expect him to put in more effort before she forgive him(don't reply his msg or e-mail for a few days), show that he is sincere in pursuing her. I find the explaination very logical. Perhaps can get a girl's point of view on this? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

So  i guess such a loooooooong time together will surely .. 'dampen' the 'passion' for each other. THen again maybe it doesnt ? Thats why the process of dating n a long relationship slowly builds up understanding each other so as u are married knowingly knowing u want and can be married to each other.. till death do us part. But of course ammout of attention given is not really an accurate assessment of straying i agree in that. My friend married with wife n a kid still goes Karaoke , GRO's but still loves the wife. I dont see anything wrong with that btw..~<br><br></div>
