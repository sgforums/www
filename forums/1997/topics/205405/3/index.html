Well..if you don't give your relationship the priority, how are you to know that this guy is truly meant for you? In relationship stage both party are still getting to know each other and anything can happened. Of cos by giving your r/s the priority doesn't mean you have to give up other aspects of your life. When you got into a r/s with a guy, i am sure you are looking for the prospect of marrige, spending the rest of your life with him.<br><br>When you are looking at your potential partner wouldn't you want the best for him? Or you are saying all your friends come first then follow by him. Put it in his shoes, one day he said to you"My friends' needs come first then follow by you, they are more important than you, but i still love you" Do you feel good hearing this words?<br><br>You mentioned on the other post about not truly strifing to probe your partner if he/she was in trouble, why not? As a partner i think it is alright to show concern when the other party is in trouble right? For example your boyfriend lost his handphone and was very upset about it becos it contained alot of important informations. As his girlfriend, you mean you don't try to offer some help, or at least show some words of concern?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Hmmm.. very trusting indeed. Does your trust extend to revealing of information like, must your boyfriend inform you that he got an extra handphone(for work purposes) but wouldn't want you to know the number. Or he subscribed to other internet accounts or e-mail accounts without wanting you to know. Will you probe into it or have full trust that all these are innocence? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
