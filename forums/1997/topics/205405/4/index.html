Everyone knows that he is two-timing a girl for instance, although of course he hides it from his gf by telling her lies after lies. And maybe one day, the girl's best friend saw the bf with another girl behaving intimately sumwhere and told the girl about it, but still she decided not to pay caution to that and decided to continue to trust him. That's a bit naive isn't it? At least she should check it out and see if what her friend saying is true?<br><br>There can be some red flags in a r/s that one has to watch for. Like if you are with a man who keeps refusing to give you his phone number or refuses to let you visit him or call him at home, do you continue to trust him wholeheartedly and throw aside any doubts or will you go to find out the reason behind his reluctance?<br><br>And about the blog, I dun see anything wrong with having a blog while I am in a r/s. Similarly my dear has a blog as well, and I go there often to read his entries. He does the same for mine. It is just another way of communication between us. There are things that I will tell him directly, but there will be times when one of us is busy and the other has sth that he/she would like to talk about, so why not write it in the blog first? Then at least when I am free, I can go there and take a look, and know what he is thinking about at the time I was busy. At that time I will bring up the issues written in that particular entry in the blog and see if he would like to continue to talk about it.</div>
