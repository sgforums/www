So  i guess such a loooooooong time together will surely .. 'dampen' the 'passion' for each other. THen again maybe it doesnt ? Thats why the process of dating n a long relationship slowly builds up understanding each other so as u are married knowingly knowing u want and can be married to each other.. till death do us part. But of course ammout of attention given is not really an accurate assessment of straying i agree in that. My friend married with wife n a kid still goes Karaoke , GRO's but still loves the wife. I dont see anything wrong with that btw..~<br><br></div></blockquote>/raises eyebrow<br><br>actually, "honeymoon period" refers to the initial phase of courtship where couples wanna spend all their time together and can live on water and each other alone. not the real honeymoon for marriage.</div>

Yeahh..where are the other guys  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually i am talking about "crush" not "liking" A crush is just a temporary attraction, it won't hurt your r/s i supposed? Everyday we met so many different kinds of people, chances of attracted to someone is possible even if you are in a r/s.<br><br>The guy will pay less attention after the honeymoon period, that is understandable. He might be going through a tough spell in his life, stress at work, family problem or personal problems. But if he can miss the two big dark circles uncle your eyes or he didn't notice your new blue coloured hair, then you have to switch on the radar liao. Normally girls have this intuitive power to sense when something is not right. So you have an advantage over guys. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Was having drink over the weekend with my regulars pals(guys &amp; gals) in a pub. Among our group there is a guy and a girl who are interested in each other. Few days before we met up, the guy had a small misunderstanding with this girl which clearly made her very angry. This girl talk to us as per normal, joking and having fun, but keep ignoring this guy. She even gave him hostile look when he tried to talk to her. Later before leaving the place, she said bye and shake hands with us but not to this guy.<br><br>After this girl left, my guy friend looked very worried and asked us wheather the girl is still interested in him. We told him that he should be happy instead, the way the girl showed her emotional side was a good hint that she got feeling for him. Give her a few days to cool down but at the mean time don't go and pester her. This advice was given by guys. Do you think we got it right??<br><br>Fyi, the other girls didn't want to say anything, girls support girls mah, they were also angry with this guy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Maybe sometimes he will show like he cares but there will be times when he starts to withdraw his affection because he is not sure abt how he is feeling as well. So maybe he thinks it is better not to show so much care and concernn towards the girl for now, because it might get the girl to become to fall too deeply for him. And since he is still uncertain, he would like to prevent this situation I guess, maybe to prevent the girl from getting hurt as well.<br><br>The guy should only ask her for exclusivity once he is completely sure abt his own feelings. For me as the girl, I will try to fill my time with other activities lor, and hang out more with my frens and family members so that I won't be hanging by the phone waiting for the guy to call to let me know that he is now interested in getting exclusive. So if I sense the guy is being uncertain, I will not stop my life because of him oso, but just get on with my life as usual...then wait for him to approach me to let me know that he is interested in getting into an exclusive r/s.</div>
