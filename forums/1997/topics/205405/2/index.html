            <div class='col-md body'>..... The most challenging thing in a relationship would be with a girl who is very outgoing in her social life. She likes to mix around and surround herself with lots of friends. The challenge is big when she got more guys' friend than girls' friend. The challenge is even BIGGER when she have some very close male friends. Be prepared to share with her group of males close friends if you are in this type of relationship.<br><br>.....From the outside, this type of girls looked free and easy. But in actual fact they guard their innocence very tightly. There will be lots of benefits if you are in this kind relationship, they can be very loyal, trustful and reciprocate your support.
