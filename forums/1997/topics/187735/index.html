            <div class='col-md body'>Just got this forwarded msg from my mail.<br><br>My name is Vivian, and I am 18 years old. I have a<br>little sister and brother. As a family we live in what<br>is supposed to be a secure apartment. At 9.15 am,<br>May 14th, 1999 a huge crowd had gathered around<br>our apartment. They screamed, "Butcher the<br>Chinese! Let's eat pigs! Lets have a party!" We live<br>of the 7th floor and we got a call from a family on<br>the 3rd floor saying that the crowd had reached the<br>2nd floor. They even chased some occupants<br>upstairs. We were all very frightened. In our fright<br>we prayed and left everything in God's hands.<br>Afterward we left our room and went upstairs to the<br>top floor, as it was impossible to go downstairs and<br>escape. We got to the 15th floor and stayed with<br>some friends. Not long afterwards we were<br>surprised because some of the crowd coming out<br>of the elevators right before we entered the room.<br>We hurried into the room and locked it tightly. At<br>that time we heard them knock at the other rooms<br>loudly and there were some screams from women<br>and girls. Our room was filled with fear. We<br>realized they could come to us. So we spread<br>throughout the room hiding in the corners. We<br>could hear girls of 10 to 12 years<br>screaming, "Mommy, mommy...mom...mom...it<br>hurts." That time I didn't know that these little girls<br>were being raped. After about half an hour the<br>noise diminished and we had some guts to go out<br>and check. It was indescribable. A lot, some of<br>them young girls, were lying on the floor. Oh my<br>God, what has happened? Seeing all of this we<br>screemed and little sister Fenny, screamed<br>histerically and hugged her father. Tears started<br>coming down from my eyes. With our friends, a<br>newly-wed couple, we started going downstairs.<br>Reaching the 10th floor, we heard a scream for<br>help. The scream was very clear and we decided to<br>go down and see. But as we turned we saw a lot of<br>people. I saw a woman in her 20s being raped by 4<br>men. She tried fight back but she was held down<br>tightly. Realizing the danger we ran as hard as we<br>could. But unfortunately the mob caught Fenny.<br>We tried to rescue her, but could not do anything.<br>There were about 60 of them. They tied us up with<br>ripped sheets, myself, my father, my mother,<br>Fenny, Donny, Uncle Dodi and my Aunt Vera.<br>They led us to a room. Uncle Dodi asked what they<br>wanted, but they did not reply. They looked evil and<br>savage. One of them grabbed Fenny roughly and<br>dragged her to a sofa. At that time I knew she was<br>in great danger. I screamed loudly but one of the<br>mob slapped me in my face. My father who also<br>screamed was hit with a piece of wood and he<br>fainted. My mother has fainted when Fenny was<br>dragged to the sofa. I could only pray and pray that<br>disaster would not befall us. Uncle Dodi kept trying<br>to stop them by offering money. His efforts were<br>fruitless. And in the end 5 people raped Fenny.<br>Before beginning with the raping they always said<br>Allahu Akbar!(an islamic phrase in arabic meaning<br>God is great!)They were ferocius and brutal. Not<br>long afterward, around 9 men came to the room<br>and dragged me. I also saw them forcing and<br>dragging my Aunt Vera. But at that time I passed<br>out and everything blank. I became conscious at<br>around 5 or 6pm. My head was hurting and I<br>realized I had no clothing on my body. I cried and<br>realized my family was still there. My father was<br>hugging my mother and little brother Doni. I also<br>saw uncle Dodi lying on the floor and Aunt Vera<br>was crying over his body. I felt so weak and fainted<br>again. The next day I was in the Pluit hospital. My<br>father and mother were beside me. With all the<br>pains on my body I asked, "Mom, where is Fenny?<br>Mom?" I felt a stinging pain as I said these words.<br>My cheeks were swollen. My mother cried again<br>and couldn't speak any words, while my father,<br>holding back his tears,managed to smile at me.<br>After 4 days in treatment, my condition has<br>improved. With a sad look, my father told me then<br>what had happened. After I fainted 7 people raped<br>me. At that time my father still couldn't see well<br>after being hit with a piece of wood.<br>They raped me repeatedly. Then my father<br>said "Vivian, Fenny is gone..." I was confused and<br>cried out, "Why Dad?" My father couldn't answer.<br>He told me to rest and went out of the room. I cried<br>over and over again,feeling that my life had no<br>meaning any more. A week ago, after I was<br>released from the hospital I was told everything that<br>had happend. When Fenny was raped she kept on<br>fighting and so he was repeatedly slapped by her<br>rapists. The last time she fought Fenny spitted on<br>one of them. Offended, the man grabbed a knife<br>and stabbed Fenny's stomach over and over again.<br>Finally she died with blood over her whole body.<br>My father told me that uncle Dodi had the same<br>fate watched by Aunt Vera who was also raped.<br>My aunt Vera now stays with her parents. She is in<br>shock. Her face is blank and refuses to eat.<br>Almost every hour my mother and I cry over all<br>these happenings. I can never. These mobs of<br>people are uncivilized monsters.The scariest part<br>about all these is that most of the girls and women<br>were raped by soldiers, whose jobs were to control<br>the chaos. Some were raped by commoners, the<br>rest by demonstraters (most of whom are university<br>students). Most of the victims were raped by a<br>minimum of 3 men.The victims ages ranged from<br>10 to 55. Most of the victims were raped in front of<br>friends or family.Some were thrown into burning<br>buildings after being raped (these were often<br>witnessed by family and friends). Most them<br>committed suicide. The rest of the surviving victims<br>are divided into these sections, admitted into<br>mental institutions,fear of public places, fear of<br>anyone male, did not report to authorities. The list<br>goes on and on. Please forward this Yellow Ribbon<br>to all friends around the world to show our soladirity<br>and sympathy for the victims of the riots and chaos<br>in Indonesia last May 13-15. Let us all remember<br>them in our prayers. Because of their race, many<br>Chinese Indonesian were abused, tortured and<br>killed. Their houses and stores were looted and<br>burnt. Hundreds of Chinese Indonesian girls/women<br>(aged 10-55)were sexually harassed and gang<br>raped brutally.Some victims were even raped in<br>front of their family members or in front of inhuman<br>cheering crowd. Some of them were even thrown<br>into the fire and burnt to death after being raped.<br>Yet, not many actions seem to have been taken to<br>investigate all this or to help the victims. And not<br>every many people seem to know or care about<br>what happened. Please pass this ribbon around as<br>the symbol of campaign.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
