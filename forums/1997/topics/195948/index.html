            <div class='col-md body'>When ordering food in a everyday Korean restaurant, you pick out a main dish, and they serve it up to you with lots of <span style="font-style: italic;">banchan</span>. Banchan being  side dishes which accompany the main dish. The most basic of banchan is of course kimchi! But there are others too, mostly vegetables served either too spicy or too salty, but always too much for me to handle!<br><br>But wait! This is not an article on Korean cuisine. This is the story of one man, one bicycle, nine cities, eleven days and six hundred kilometres in-between. This is about the journey I took to discover Korea, myself and how stupid I can be. This is about overcoming the language barrier, the psychological limits and the physical pain to fulfill a dream!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the forum owner do not object, I would like to write out the draft of my story on this forum. I feel that this would be the best place since its marked for the bored. I cure my boredom by writing, and hope to reduce others by giving them something to read. It would most likely be in 13-15 parts. Everyone is invited to correct my grammar and spelling mistakes (except in the italic section!). Hope you people will enjoy it. For an idea of banchans see <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=184192" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=184192</a>. The first part would be up on sunday, 18th of June. Thanks!</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was inspirational, hearing the stories of my seniors from the school's cycling club. How they cycled around Malaysia after their final term in the Polytechnic. They shaved their hairs off, and departed on a journey through Malaysia, surviving on nasi lemak and roti prata (or so they say!). Living in accommodations ranging from motels to temples to police station. In a nutshell, on that night in December 2003, I decided in my heart that I wanted to venture beyond the shores of Singapore to cycle<br><br>My first idea was to cycle in Australia, from Darwin to Adelaide, passing through Alice Springs. But after a short consulation with the "Oxford Progressive Atlas Second Edition", it was abandoned. The total distance of 4000km would take at least 40days to complete. Not to mention the logistic nightmare of getting much-needed water, considering that half of the route would be in the desert.<br><br>I flipped through the Atlas again, where else could I go? Malaysia? Too close... China? Horrible drivers! Europe? Too expensive... Japan? Good idea! Korea? Not bad either! Soon, it was down to those two, Japan or Korea. In the end, the decision was not too hard to make. Korea is not divided into multiply islands and is slightly smaller. Adding to its credit was my fascination with Korean movies and actresses. Another decision, another hurdle cleared. Korea it will be.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Back to the World Cup for now... More to come soon... Grammar and spelling corrections are welcomed!</span><br><br>A map was what I needed next. A few good maps popped up on the internet. Pretty good maps too! But there is one problem, its not easy working with a virtual map, a paper one is still required. An option was to print out the map, but all the printing, cutting and pasting would just make my life worst. Soon I found myself browsing all the major bookshops in Singapore.<br><br>Weird it seens, at that time I could not find a single map of Korea anywhere. In a moment of desperation, I posted a cry for help on the local internet cycling community. And help came...<br><br>A moderator of the website was due in Seoul for business. And offer is made to purchase a map from Korea. It was quickly accepted by me. On 13th May 2005, the map arrived.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Making chances here and there.</span></div>
