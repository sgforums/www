Whether you can lead a meaningful life or not, it depends on what you choose to do with your life. If you choose to spend every waking hour just sleeping, eating and going to work, of course you will feel like your life is meaningless cos it has become sort like a routine. But if you choose to set aside some time to pursue your own interest, then maybe your life will change for the better  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Hmmz, for my case, I feel that it doesnt really matter if you spend the whole day slping or eating etc, as long as you feel like it and njoy it without regrets, then there's no probz with it... coz ya'd feel happy, so the main thg is 'try to enjoy the thgs tt u do' although they may seem monotonous but hey, tink you will learn something new each and every dae, or let's say if you feel that your life is sianz then ya not being appreciated for what u've done, try to draw a clear line between u and them, then always remember to take time to urself, e.g let's say if u enjoys going for leisure walks, watch movies etc, dun deprive urself of them.. go do the thgs u njoy.. aft work, on wkends etc.. no problemo, tis ur life, true, we have committments, but we still hafta tek care of ourselves, our needs when we'r done with the committments thgy.. so do the thgs u njoy to clear ur mind, will tink better, tek up yoga, go for slow walks, go eat ur fave desserts etc... tek time for urself... do the thgs tt u njoy among the other committments.. tis ur life bahz.. live well...</div>
