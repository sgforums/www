My two cousins had female tutors before who fared poorly when it comes to teaching them Maths and Science. They complained that their tutors didn't seem to know what they were doing half the time.<br><br>By considering females only, those parents have pretty much limited the selection of tutors that their kids can have. I can agree that some male tutors are a bunch of bozos who can't teach to save their own lives, but it's an utter fallacy to think that all female tutors are good at teaching, too.<br><br>No disrespect meant to rainee in particular and female tutors in general. I can see that rainee is a highly dedicated and capable teacher, and I'm sure the same goes to most female tutors.<br><br>All I'm saying is this: parents who discriminate against male tutors are really doing their children a disservice. I can still understand that parents of female students would prefer female tutors, but certainly, it can't be that &gt;90% of all students who need tuition are female.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
