            <div class='col-md body'>then i replied:<br><br>Recently I read a very interesting and enlightening article on how to be a good project mate. And below are the summarized contents. Hope it will shed light on how to be a perfect project mate to all of us.<br><br>The Perfect Project Mate<br><br>She joins the group late and missed a couple of project meetings and so missed the part where her project mate tries hard to unlearn her science thinking to try and fit in with the group, which in her opinion functions really differently. But yet this perfect project mate does not see nor understand this, and gives her humble opinions to other group members about this misunderstood project mate.<br><br>She also assumes that project mates from other faculties automatically will SU that particular module, and hence use that as an explanation as to why that project mate does not seem to put in much effort, when in fact, her original premise cannot be further away from the truth.<br><br>When meeting for project discussions, she will inevitably arrive 30-45 minutes late, every single time. The time she was 1 hour late was because she was very responsible for forgetting to bring her laptop, and so had to rush home and back again to bring it. The result, of cos is a very rushed meeting between the two project mates due to the presence of a lecture which her project mate has all the way to the other side of the nus campus. She also does not tolerate the slight snapping of a project mate, despite her having to wait so long for the entire team to arrive.<br><br>Speaking of which, that 2-person project meeting was to do up the analysis part of the project, for which this perfect project mate did not even prepare for in the least (like reading through the collated literature and interviews). However, she made it up by typing all her project mateÂ’s points in Microsoft word in broken, unchecked English, which her project mate kindly rephrased about 80% of and reformatted the entire entry. The perfect project mate then had the grace to pass off that work as if it were a single effort on her part.<br><br>She also accuses project mates for attending only 1 project meeting when in fact, her project mate attended 3 out of 5. The two times when she did not attend was because the meeting was right in the middle of her lecture and when she was down with a 38.5 degrees fever. Indeed, when the entire group met, she did not hide behind a laptop. Instead, she joined in that very lively discussion about cockroaches and lizards, which proved particularly useful to the two project peers who were busy doing the video editing.<br><br>Last but not least, she bitches about her project mates, not considering that perhaps the feeling was mutual.<br><br>So there, I hope that now, we all know how to go about being the perfect project mate. I look forward to working with such a project mate, if I happen to meet one.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>then she replied again:<br><br>(my name), it came to me as Shocking that You would make such accusations despite Your Bo-CHupness and POOR EQ. I am someone who will NOT ALLOW anyone to shoot malicious accusation at me and I Serious need to Sort out your accusation of me face to face. It is No use squabbling over the internet and I need you to explain your accusation of me. Anyway, you are the one who change the meeting time with me that time and you are the one who Ask me to remind you of the meeting because of your ridiculously short term memory. I am SO Sorry for forgetting to bring my laptop as if it is my responsibility but at least I am responsible enough to take a cab back to get it. Lastly, I seriously have not met a person who prepare 3 points for the meeting yet accuse someone who prepared as Â“unpreparedÂ”. Yes. I think you have a serious ATTITUDE problem and I will definitely be VERY glad to talk it out over COFFEE with u.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>to which i replied:<br><br>My previous reply is meant to serve the following purposes:<br><br>1) you were the one who started flinging accusations at me. As it is, that abstract I wrote was to show that as much as you felt they were accusations, I felt your article is unfounded and an utter bullshit. I do hope that you know two can play that game.<br><br>2) when you read the article I wrote, I am sure you didnÂ’t feel very good about it. That was exactly how I felt.so the next time you think of even doing something like that, think twice. The world operates in two ways. If youÂ’re unhappy with someone, more often than not, that someone is unhappy with you. You dun see me go around insulting you and making claims that you dun even have the slightest proof of just cos I am not happy with you , or the project group. Do remind yourself that you are 21 years old.<br><br>youÂ’ve only met me a few times, under restricted conditions. And yet you can label me with an attitude problem. Can I broadcast to the entire project group that I feel you have a character problem?? You seemed so mild and docile and everything when working with me, but at the back, you just had to come around and bite me in the ass. That just shows your character doesnÂ’t it? Or not. I dun know you well, nor do I intend to. So I will not label you with anything. But I want you to know that I do not appreciate being called having an attitude problem. Save your accusations for yourself.<br><br>As for memory, I can say the same thing for you. We arranged to meet at 12. I changed it to 12.30. but you came at 1.20. and when we met, I gave you all the points I have and u merely typed it in. you did not seem to have read the interviews and literature before hand, even if you claimed to have, you seem to have forgotten everything. That proved particularly helpful to our discussion. Let me advice you on this one. Next time, SHOW that you are prepared and not merely saying that you are.<br><br>As it is, I have nothing more to say to you, or the project group. The thing is over and there is no point wasting our time over such matters. If it pleases you, dun work with science students next time if you cant value their need for structure and better management. Rehearsing an oral presentation for a first time, a mere 2 hours before a presentation is definitely not a practice for us. i will not go into what I felt were extremely inefficient in our discussions and way of doing the project. Good luck for your finals, and IÂ’ll see you there.<br><br></div>

It is No use squabbling over the internet and I need you to explain your accusation of me. Anyway, you are the one who change the meeting time with me that time and you are the one who Ask me to remind you of the meeting because of your ridiculously short term memory. I am SO Sorry for forgetting to bring my laptop as if it is my responsibility but at least I am responsible enough to take a cab back to get it. Lastly, I seriously have not met a person who prepare 3 points for the meeting yet accuse someone who prepared as Â“unpreparedÂ”. Yes.
