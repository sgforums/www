            <div class='col-md body'>I used to be like a rolling stone - gathering no moss, drifting through my early years without acquiring genuinely close friends. From primary school to secondary to JC, I tended to have just one or two "buddies" whom I had closer relationship to. But when I left the school, I just sort of lost touch with them. But now, through university, I've acquired a group of four or five close friends, whom I still keep in touch with after we've graduated. But still, I don't hang out with them every weekend. We only just occasionally get together.<br><br>Well, I don't feel the need to have many friends, though it might be a good thing to have lots of contacts when you go out to work. But in the end, one true friend is still better than a thousand fair-weather ones.</div>

Congrats!! for having friends you can trust with your life. But then why are you still so worked up? It shows that you are in self denial. When a person has real friends in their life he/she should feel blessed, joyful and happy. The person's life is enriched. Whenever you think of your real friends it put a smile on your face. If you have so called real friends and they wore you down liked your case, something is wrong somewhere.<br><br>I guessed you are trying too hard, so when you didn't get the results you wanted, you felt disappointed, you felt been let down. Change your approve in maintainning your friendships, don't need to contact them so often, let them be themselves, let them handle their own problems. If they need you and still treat you as their true friend they will come looking for you. Don't have to worry too much about them too, get on with your life. Real friends don't need to keep or meet up that often, when you know you have real friends, life is a breeze and should be able to concentrate on your work or study.<br><br>To know who your real friends are, try to be assertive and know what  your boundaries are. Priroritise those you think that value  and appreciate you. Those that kept running away even though you have try very hard, just let them go. Accept and let go of friends who no longer place you as part of their life. Even real friends can turned and became strangers. Sad but true, don't think just because you are reliable and trustful, your friends will do the same. Life is not like that, simple as you may think. Chances are you all share the same friendship  but not the same values.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

People have different friends from different phases of their life. Some stay with them, some are gone because of circumstances. So don't beat yourself up because of this...just know that if you have made an effort, then that's the best you can do.</div>
