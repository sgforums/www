Ic ic..you're studying in uni now. As I a had mentioned earlier, don't have to try too hard, just make an effort will do. Most probably your friends took you for granted, because all these times you have been doing the calling, so it has become a habit for them to not to make the initiative. To see wheather they care and value you as a pal, contact them less often. If they realised that suddenly you hardly call them or you do not call them as often as before, real friends will certainly contact and check on you. In this way you will know who is real and who is fake.<br><br>I did contact my friends out for a drink or dinner at times. There are some, no matter how many times I called them they always got excuses to turn me down. The worst is they said they will call, but never do, and yes they are my true friends..this is what I thought. Since then I had cut them off . It's nobody's faults, people changed that's all. Move on make new friends that come along your way. Make friends with people who truely want to be your friends, its a two way traffic.<br><br>Cherish the time now with your friends, you can't predict the future. Those that treasure you will definately will want to keep your friendship. Don't get so worked up, you can't force them if they don't want to. Enjoy, pamper yourself, buy a CD, learn to play guitar, smell the roses but don't sniff in a bee (I had warned you)... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Perhaps you may stop for a moment and reflects what might have gone wrong. Is it something you had said? Are you been too pushy? your behaviours or they got tired of your icy facade? What lost you cannot get it back. Keep the happy memories, learn from the positive sides of the experience. Since they are not making an effort, there is nothing you can do. You alone cannot make a friendship works. Reconcile with yourself and reality. Calm down your thoughts and move on. There are lots of nice people out there waiting to be your friends. Don't lose hope, just keep on going and going and going......<br><br>Meanwhile take consolation that you still have a real friend around. Do what you suppose to do as a real friend, you seem to know what a quality friend consist of liow. Don't need to try too hard, you will appeared too pushy, thats make people very uncomfortable. If she treat you as a true friend, she will definitely make an effort. Remember also, she got her own sets of pals too, respect her territory and feeling.<br><br>Whats gone is gone liow, sulking won't reward you with friends, but will add a few more lines on your face. It's time to look forward not backward and don't worry about the future. Live for the moment, there are so many good things out there for you to discover  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes there is a point in friendships when you had a very close bonding with the friends but most of the time, it hard to find them especially at our age ( i assume u are aroudn 20+) but there does not mean there isn't.<br><br>Sometime it is just not fated to be friends/close friends forever. Even if there are really such things as friends forever, it's rare few especially when we have became adults. Sometime, it can take an instant moment to find someone who you can click with instantly but the next moment, no chemistry. Human relationships can have complicated issue. Partly, everyone changes at certain phrase in life.<br><br>I also felt dejected once about friends but i realise after there, i don't grasp at relationships or has a high or false expectation about it. I think i can let go of a break up easily.<br><br>Sometime, im so busy that i don't have the time to meet up or nuture the friendships but i do sms them once in a blue moon and so are them. It also take effort to maintain friends and whether the other party will make there effort so.</div>

We are human, we got feelings. Remember to pratice strict quality control on who you let in to your heart. Our heart is a sacred and fragile place, when someone walked out of it, it took a piece of you too, and it gonna hurts liked hell. Not al friends will accompany you through-out the journey. Just take your time in building up your new friendships, a true friend will reveal him/herself. Don't isolate yourself for too long though, it will turned you into a recluse.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>o.kay.. i just spent like 30 minutes reading through every single thing... n i am starting to get dizzy. Ur questino about 'Is there any point of friendship?'  well.. i ask u this.. Is there anypoint in being a loser ? OF COURSE! Blessed are the losers.. cause they are the ones who determine the winners!<br><br>Everyone needs friendship.. unless u are not right in the head. U will need at least. 1 friendship. Thats the way it is. Like they said , Good friends , true friends , best friends. . its how u categorise them n then put know which ones to put more attention to n which ones u fudge them.. or even use them. Who cares.. they use u too. So its like a two way thingy.<br><br>Anyways, u cant hold on to ur friends forever. In the end of the day.. there is only those selected few.. less then 10. But trust me.. even distance will not seperate the friendship, because i know , n i have seen it. Now it seems that things just seems to drift away.. so hazy. But u will see the light at the end of the tunnel.. n hence know the true meaning of friendship n those that are most dear to you shall reveal themselves in time.</div>
