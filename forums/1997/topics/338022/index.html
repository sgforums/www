              <p>Currently suffering from the after effect of wisdom tooth surgery this morning.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Good thing is that it didn't hurt at all during the surgery, though it was scary. Cos I can't see what they were doing to me and they kept throwing more and more blanket on top of me. Plus the needle they used to inject the anaesthesia was damn long.</p>

              <p>I have heard of people removing 8 tooth at one go O.O</p>
              <p>If got so many, tink better to go through the GA procedure where you will be knocked out throughout the surgery, only wake up after all of them have been removed. But think the pain going to be hell for at least the next few days &gt;.&lt;</p>
