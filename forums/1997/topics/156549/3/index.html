If someone offers you their seat, then he deserves to be lauded. If he doesn't then  fair enough. He certainly, i feel, doesn't deserves to be censured.<br><br>Your notions of what constitutes 'good values' might be very different to that of others. Case in point, i think you are a presumtuous, whining person, often given to bouts of self-pity.<br><br>I agree with you on one point: There is surely something wrong with the system. This is esp so when someone *expects* a complete stranger to act positively in their interests, even when that person has not asked the stranger to so act, and when that person actually seeks to censure the stranger for not so acting.<br><br></div>

But she clearly implied that she EXPECTED the youths to GIVE UP THEIR SEAT for her.<br><br>(2):<br><br>She did not OPEN HER MOUTH AND ASK for a seat, to which i am sure, the youths would have graciously given to her to support her one-handed act. </strong><br><br>In the nanny state that is SG, after being spoon fed by the nanny for too long, we have forgotten how to open our golden mouths unless asked.<br><br>Who are we to expect our society to change overnight? Should the average singaporeans with a snap of the finger change from walking trolls to smiling mother Theresas?<br><br>And then when such an incident draws the irk one fellow citizen, they conveniently pour scorn on our less than courteous people for a demonstration in ignorance just to vent their frustration.<br><br>Haven't we seen the rushing in/out at the opening of MRT doors?<br><br>Have we not seen the impatience of our local drivers on the road?<br><br>Have we not witnessed the disgusting rudeness of our service industry?<br><br>How different are these?<br><br>Society evolves gradually.<br><br>German efficiency wasn't born overnight. Neither was New Zealand warmth and friendliness.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Very good one Billy, brings out the thoughts in us</div>
