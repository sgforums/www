            <div class='col-md body'>to me , the lady is just giving a passing remark.<br><br>of course generalise UNi students as such is not appropriate.<br><br>this kind of situation happens anyway, from high class well dress workers to housing estate.<br><br>the lady should have written in such a way to address others to give up seats to people they see in need and not like condemn uni students.<br><br>have any one taken transports with foreigns shopping from little india, none of them will give a seat to even a dying or sick person that has treatment.<br><br>in singapore need seat for any valid reasons, just ask they will give.<br><br>anyway giving children seats is not neccesary as they are okay but not the below 5 years old.  those need seats.  the rest are just wild and having fun in the trains.<br><br>i have seen young professional foreign workers try to snatch Bus seat from an elderly old man.  he can tell the old man to go behind seat even though the old man about to seat in the front seat.  the old man ignore him and sat down.<br><br>that Pro foreigner wanted the front seat so that he and his GF or wife can seat together.  If that old man is weak, he would have walk back end of the bus to get seats.  fortunately this old man has guts to snub off this guy.<br><br>so the man and his wife with sour face walk right all the way back to teh end of the bus to get seats.<br><br>one thing for sure , if the old man give way,  i would be the first out of so many singaporeans to scold that foreigner man.  not to mention the bus driver.<br><br>in other countries they bully weak, old  and helpless, hear, we defend.<br><br>next time observe and see how foreigners treat singaporeans in buses and trains.  they snatch the seats right in front of everybody faces and so proud of it.<br><br>not sure if the lady that wrote article here is a foreigner or local.  here , want something just ask.<br><br></div>

She kept quiet, did she not? So she did not demand any courtesy orally. She "expected" courtesy in her mind - but who could tell? Is it even relevant that she "expected" or "demanded" courtesy? I doubt so.<br><br>But on the other hand, no kind-hearted soul offered her a seat. No one offering courtesy to her.<br><br>The gist of her letter is: why are people not giving help, when help is clearly appreciated? Surely you don't need people to tell you when help is appreciated, right? C'mon, you need to be TOLD to give up a seat for a woman who has a child in her hands?<br><br>I mean, so what if you have been snubbed before, without a word of thanks from the person who took the seat? You want something in return for the good deed? Is this becoming more like a moral transaction?<br><br>The writer of the letter has a good point to make. The students are not being magnanimous to her. And c'mon, don't tell me that the people may not be students - GOOD chance that they are, and let's not avoid the reality ya?<br><br>If on the other hand, if the woman orally demanded a seat, I would actually feel embarassed! Wouldn't you?<br><br>You need to be TOLD to give up a seat????<br><br>Where is the sense of a good heart, the sense of magnamity, the sense of courtesy?<br><br></div></blockquote>Put aside the sympathy clause for a moment.<br><br>Let's look at the underlying reasons why she wrote that letter.<br><br>1: She wanted to finger the degrading standards of courtesy in Singapore Society.<br><br>2: She experienced first hand the problem faced and therefore duly suffered what others have perhaps suffered before her.<br><br>For item 1, there is no doubt that our standards have dropped. The point of contention is: is this a new wake-up call or is it a prevalent issue transparent to our society despite its obvious signs?<br><br>We are fully aware of it but change and ethical improvement is not something that can be achieved overnight. What she has written is nothing new and was published as a gradual tool in the hopes that we as a people would be nudged in the right direction. Again i stress, it is a slow and painful process.<br><br>Item 2: It is always difficult when you experience it personally. It might sound disbelieving when you hear it from someone else but experencing the difficulty is always the alarm bell. There is a lot of anger and resentment in the manner in which she was treated by strangers and therefore, her letter lambasting the undergrads who failed to deliver on her expectations is somewhat concealing the fact that it would all have been avoided had she or her husband simply asked.<br><br>You DO not need to ask for courtesy?<br><br>Perhaps the correct statement is : You SHOULD NOT have to ask for courtesy.<br><br>But then again, we are all humans, some selfish and unkind, others gracious and polite.<br><br></div>
