She kept quiet, did she not? So she did not demand any courtesy orally. She "expected" courtesy in her mind - but who could tell? Is it even relevant that she "expected" or "demanded" courtesy? I doubt so.<br><br>But on the other hand, no kind-hearted soul offered her a seat. No one offering courtesy to her.<br><br>The gist of her letter is: why are people not giving help, when help is clearly appreciated? Surely you don't need people to tell you when help is appreciated, right? C'mon, you need to be TOLD to give up a seat for a woman who has a child in her hands?<br><br>I mean, so what if you have been snubbed before, without a word of thanks from the person who took the seat? You want something in return for the good deed? Is this becoming more like a moral transaction?<br><br>The writer of the letter has a good point to make. The students are not being magnanimous to her. And c'mon, don't tell me that the people may not be students - GOOD chance that they are, and let's not avoid the reality ya?<br><br>If on the other hand, if the woman orally demanded a seat, I would actually feel embarassed! Wouldn't you?<br><br>You need to be TOLD to give up a seat????<br><br>Where is the sense of a good heart, the sense of magnamity, the sense of courtesy?<br><br></div>

If someone offers you their seat, then he deserves to be lauded. If he doesn't then  fair enough. He certainly, i feel, doesn't deserves to be censured.<br><br></div></blockquote>This just shows self-centeredness, doesnt it? It's like - I got this seat, I do not want to give it up. It is none of my business whether you have a child in your hand or not.<br><br>Shouldn't this self-centeredness be censured?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lwflee:</div><div class="quote_body">Your notions of what constitutes 'good values' might be very different to that of others. Case in point, i think you are a presumtuous, whining person, often given to bouts of self-pity.<br><br>I agree with you on one point: There is surely something wrong with the system. This is esp so when someone *expects* a complete stranger to act positively in their interests, even when that person has not asked the stranger to so act, and when that person actually seeks to censure the stranger for not so acting.<br><br></div></blockquote>The woman did not orally express her expectation. If she did, wouldn't it have been embarassing to both her and the people arould her?<br><br>Look, isn't there an IMPLICIT OBLIGATION for people to help others who are less able to help themselves? If someone was being robbed in broad daylight in view of everyone, would you go forward to help IMMEDIATELY, or would you just stand around and see if other people goes to the person's aid?<br><br>Question is why isn't this IMPLICIT OBLIGATION exercised, in the case of this woman? Where is the magnanimity? Is it gone? If it is gone, it is sad isn't it?<br><br>So I do not think that the woman was wrong in "expecting" some help. Why shouldn't she expect magnanimity from a complete stranger? Sure there are some limits to this magnanimity (like not giving money to all beggars you meet on the street), but surely giving up a seat is not too much?<br><br>Did the woman get the seat in the end? She did not. Expectations came to nothing in this case.<br><br></div>

Which parent with a child wouldn't want a seat? Especially on a bus that moves and jerks all the time? Is it actually safe for the child to be in her arms while she stands?<br><br>If she felt she was entitled to a seat, she would have just asked for it - but she didn't right? so she did not feel that she had automatic right to a seat - so she didn't ask.<br><br>In any case, in any bus there are green seats (for SBS transit) or specified seats with signs saying " please give you seat to someone who needs it more".<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casshern:</div><div class="quote_body">and in singapore, when u stand to give a seat, people ard you will actually give you the "Don't Try To Impress" kind of look. and when the person you had offered rejects you , the "Haha!" kind of look is reflected on fellow passengers</div></blockquote>What kind of screwed mentality is that? Why should a kind and gracious gesture be frowned upon by people? What or who is the person who gives up the seat trying to impress? So what if you are rejected?
