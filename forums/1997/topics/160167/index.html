Sometimes manipulation of the back and insertion of the needles indirectly without using any viewing machines will cause damage to the nerves no matter how experience a practitioner is. It is always best to confirm... what you feel normal now, may not be normal 10-20 years down the road... this is safe practice of medicine...<br><br>But of course, as I say, most people believe in traditional medicine in which many doctors don't, they tend to be shocked and surprised to hear what you have done... in this case he may be overly cautious and caring for you, OR he may be very blunt, which I believe should be the latter in the way you explain it... If he is the latter, then he is wrong...<br><br>From my personal point of view, alternative medicine is the patient's choice, and I will not prevent them from going to seek a second opinion... they should however inform me of the medication they are taking in fear of drug-drug interaction if they still want to seek me for management...</div>
