            <div class='col-md body'>Love can exist in any situation. No matter how shaky the foundation may be, love between 2 pple can exist but rationally, it may not be meant to be.<br><br>It's difficult to determine how much the guy still loves the girl after this while. Whether he has been burnt by another girl n going back to that girl(spare tyre), no one really knows. The real question lies on whether that girl still loves the guy. Whether she wants to give another try.<br><br>As from my 1st para, since things didnt work out more den once, it's juz not meant to be. Take for example my 1st romance. A couple of weeks after I was rudely cast aside, she wanted to get back. Though I was bitter n destraught n that i really wanted her back, I knew things wont be the same as before. The trust was irreversibly shattered. I painfully chose to walk away.<br><br>Today, I can tell u that it irks n maybe pains me when I face her. The scar still remains, but at least I've healed and that I didnt carry on sth tt i truly believe tt wasnt meant to be.</div>

Some love are kept in the heart. I had been liking this gal for 8 years , since our secondary school days. The 8 years have been rocky, and there was once when we became very close but some misunderstandings arose, and nothing ever came out of it. But now we still keep in touch(although not frequent), and i can tell u straight in the face there was never once i questioned myself if i still like her, even if along the way someone else appear from time to time.<br><br>there are some people who will leave a impression on u from the first time u meet, and nothing can take that person away from u in the heart.  Never question someone's feelings for u, but question urself if he is worthy of u loving him. if u say yes, then go tell him how u feel.</div>

When I love someone, it is not the distance; nor the physical aspects (environment, background etc... u name it..) that determines the love I have for her or whether we are really in love with each other.<br><br>#1: Love is about commitment<br>Without a level of sacrifice, there is no love at all. Love doesn't exist when there's no sacrifice. And the highest level of sacrifice in a relationship is commitment. It is also the hardest task for many people out there (esp guys).<br>Which, reminds me of another point below...<br><br>#2: Love is spelled as T-I-M-E<br>First of all, life is about love. And when you love someone, you need to give your time to be with that someone. Going out of contact for too long isn't an excuse for missing that someone. Because, in love, one must spend loads of time together. There must always be a fellowship; connection so that the relationship can be built up.<br><br>#3: Relationships must have a foundation<br>Relationships can never be built up without spending quality time together. And furthermore, to build it up, it needs a strong friendship and bond as a foundation. It is just like building a skyscraper. Without a strong foundation, any stormy whether can shake it and topple it.<br><br>In conclusion, if ever a guy has no commitments, afraid to commit or even sacrifice part of his precious time to be with u, then I would say that he's too immature for you and in loving you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And that girl... doesn't know what she wants also. And because of indecisiveness in this "friendship", it keeps wavering like a tower without a strong foundation.<br><br>Do u see the pattern here?<br><br>And I would suggest that they both sit down and talk it out. Resolve it ASAP. On the guy's side, he needs to take responsibility and make a quick decision about resolving this issue. On the girl's side, she needs to be final in her decision regarding of what she really wants out of this "relationship" or "friendship".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he is an idiot then. but this case is of course normal. he may have loved you and waited for this moment for a very long time thats why, when he finally opened himself up to her, the love or the passion is intensified.<br><br>what both of them/you must do now is, to know and understand if they are true to one another. the girl, if still cannot confirm her feelings can, tell him that she is feeling so pressured from his persistance and cannot breath. sometimes, guys are blinded by their passion and forgot to give the one he loves a breathing space... especially if that guy is those not too sensitive type.<br><br>tell him "please if you really like me, wait for me, let us progress slowly. we may be able to work something out but i have to know you as a person 1st." this will give him something to hold on to rather than to let him dangle in mid air.<br><br>but 1 thing to keep in mind, if he keeps only talking but no show at all, it could mean that he is not real to you either so, for the moment, observe his actions. does he care for you, does he thinks about you and does he dare to do things like going out with ur friends or bringing you to show his close friends etc.</div>
