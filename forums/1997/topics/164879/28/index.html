It comes in many forms and many colours. Lets say you trust me to take care of this forum. How do you defined that trust? Or you trust rainee with a particular juicy gossip. How do you defined that trust as well? These two 'trust' are not the same right? The question is, even if trust can be properly defined and categorised, are you willing to listen to the advices or will you be stubborn and close your mind towards them?</div>
