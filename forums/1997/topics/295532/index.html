Then again, it's a good chance to some highly-sought overseas experiences and perspectives, which will definitely give you an edge over others, especially if you are already doing your undergraduate studies locally  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Besides, a Masters from an accredited foreign university will certainly open up more career opportunities and choices for you.  That can be extremely useful if you haven't decided on what job to go for  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
