I used to shake my head sadly at my JC classmates who would spend hours preparing for their GP by reading through lists of high-level English words and their meanings.

There's no point learning high-level bombastic words when your basic foundation is really poor. All my GP essays were written in simple English - I was more concerned with getting my points across than to show off.<br><br>If you want to do well in English, then you've got to live and breathe English. My tuition student got the shock of his life when I told him that I have NEVER studied for any English test in my entire life.<br><br>So he asked: 'So how did you do well for it?'<br><br>My reply? 'I read.'</div></blockquote>Learning the grammar rules would help, otherwise your point might not get across. There's one particular joke about the panda. One comma in the wrong place and the whole idea is completely different.<br><br>Those bombastic words are secondary. If it adds colours to the essay, I won't mind putting in for the sake of fun.
