Doing A Levels ma?<br><br>If yes, you can go for it. A Levels syllabus have changed, students can't just take pure humanities. So if you are doing A Levels and doing humanities, you have to take at least one science subject (or 2, can't remember). Have to check MOE website.<br><br>For the financial part, it could be pretty hard to get financial help as they usually have a cap. But if your family has more than just you and your brother, maybe you could get help, provided your brother is not earning too much as well.<br><br>For question 3, you can look through their HCI's website for their programs, or  you can ask your teachers.</div>
