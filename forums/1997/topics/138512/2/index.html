You get into it for the hope it will work out well. If you keep thinking it wun work, it will not work in the end. This is another example of self fulfilling prophecy at work.<br><br>You get into it because it is worth it to get hurt just to find the right someone for you, because even when you have to go thru a lot of hurt and painful experiences, once you have found him, you will be glad you have tried and not just do nothing...because if you didn't try in the first place, wud you have met him in the end? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Lets bring on more reality. What happens when you find your sexual orientation isnt restricted to the opposite sex?<br><br>Bisexuality isnt a big a social stigma as it once was. And finding happiness where you can get it is way better than suffering in silence.<br><br>An ex gf of mine is now a lesbian. It wasnt because our relationship wasnt working out, rather she felt her inclination was towards her own sex more than it is with the opposite. This is perfectly acceptable to me as I often question my own sexuality.<br><br>Im not a raging gay, neither am I a homophobe. Religious connotations aside, as long as you are comfortable.<br><br></div>
