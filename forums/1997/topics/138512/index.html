So there is always a possibility that you will get hurt, that the r/s won't end with a happy ending, even though of course that's what we all wish for.<br><br>But we all strive to keep it going...r/s is not easy work, I can assure you of that. It needs a lot of efforts to keep it going. So if you are afraid of hard work and getting hurt, maybe you are not ready to get into one.<br><br>So I guess we can only try our best and keep in mind that the possibility of it ending badly is there. Don't be scared of that possibility, because how would you know whether it will work out or not unless you try? Being skeptical is one thing, but don't let it keep you from getting into a r/s just because you are afraid you will become another number in the statistic of broken r/s or marriages.</div>

You just need to know that once the other party is not willing to put in any effort anymore, you need to break away from him. Cos I have learned thru the hard way that love is not a one way street. Just one party giving will not make it work...so instead of holding on to something that is about to sink and being dragged down together by it, let go before more damage is done. I have found out that some girls are to blame as well when it comes to this, cos they just simply dunno how to let go even when they are being abused either physically or emotionally by their bfs...Not to say that I have not gone thru dat myself.<br><br>But you see, it is those experiences that make me the person I am now...it helps me to grow up and see relationship in a different light and make me cherish love more <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You just need to trust the other party to not break your heart. Without trust, the r/s will not survive.<br><br>But even if in the end it doesn't work out, take it as an experience and learn from it.
