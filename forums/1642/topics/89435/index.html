            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GOT this from elsewhere</strong><br><br>There is this old and tall 'Kapok' tree. Actually, it is some kind of cotton tree . The tree bear fruits like single banana but it is cotton inside. It is green and hard when not ripe.<br><br>This old Kapok tree was ( I think kenna chop down already lar ) in Potong Pasir.<br><br>Last time, Potong Pasir has many vegetable farmers. So, they have many ponds to water their vegetables.<br><br>During the 7th month ghost festival, alot of prayers were offered.<br><br>So, this incident happened during the ghost festival.<br><br>A man named Peng was returning home late one night. He passes by this Kapok tree and saw a lady weeping. This big Kapok tree never bear any fruits ( cotton ) So many people always wanted to chop it down.<br><br>Peng being single and kind hearted stop to talk with this lady.<br><br>Talk what, I don't know ! Also don't know why the lady was crying there.<br><br>Then when Peng heard that this lady name Kim has no place to sleep, he offered his house to let her stay the night.<br><br>Peng sell soya beans drink in the morning market. So, he will get up very early to prepare all the soaked beans.<br><br>Peng also has a pet dog. A 100 percent black colour dog.<br><br>So far, still NO GHOST yet hor!!!!<br><br>Kim will help Peng and this go on for many weeks.<br><br>Soon, they fell in love lar. One man and one lady living in the same house. That is the expected thing !<br><br>Peng was not that poor. Soya drinks can make alot of money.<br><br>So, he throw a grand wedding dinner . Many people in Potong Pasir was invited. Maybe some readers here who have old uncle or auntie or grandparents stayed in Potong Pasir before can ask if they were invited or not.<br><br>Kim was a beautiful bride. Many people said that the pair were such lovely couple!<br><br>Fast forward............<br><br>Next few months, Kim was preagnent. Expected again what.<br><br>So, when Kim was about 8 months preagnent, Peng was so happy that soon, he will be a father! He brushed aside the idea of his wife giving birth during the 7th month to a 'ghost child' .<br><br>Because Kim stomach was getting so big, she could not go to help Peng in the market. So, she stayed at home.<br><br>Then one fateful early morning, at about 5.30am, just after Peng set out to sell his soya milk drink, there was a knock on the door.<br><br>Kim thought that Peng has forgot something and came back home. So, she just open the door without asking who was outside!<br><br>The figure outside the door shocked Kim! Black colour and moving like was floating on air like that.<br><br>Not Ghost lar! Don't always think of GHOST only!! 5.30am no ghost liao!<br><br>It was Nathan the Indian man living a few doors away! He was drunk!<br><br>He pushed his way into the house. Kim started to scream. But Nathan put his dirty hand over Kim's mouth. Then the black dog came barking into the house.<br><br>Nathan use a knife and slit the throat of the poor dog! Blood splattered all around the house!<br><br>Kim scream again and tried to ran out of the house. But drunk Nathan grab her and Kim fell! Her head knocked a table and she was unconscious.<br><br>Then Nathan raped her!!!<br><br>What a big mess !<br><br>Fateful as it is, Peng returned at about 6.30am buying some breakfast for Kim!! What a loving husband!<br><br>When he entered his house, he was shocked to see Nathan sleeping beside his naked wife with her dress torn!!<br><br>Blood everywhere and his pet dog appeared dead too!<br><br>He rushed to his wife but there was no response.<br><br>He grab Nathan and just then Nathan thrusted the sharp knife into one of Peng's eye socket!<br><br>Peng scream out in pain clutching his injured eyes and at this moment, Nathan ran out of the house.<br><br>Peng ran after him. Shouting and cursing.<br><br>The whole neighbourhood was awake by the commotion. Few of Peng's neighbour also chase after Nathan.<br><br>Nathan being 'marbok' drunk ran into a pond! It was quite deep. He could not swim and was struggling in the water. But non of those watching bother to help the drowning man.<br><br>Peng rushed back to his house. Kim was dead by then. But his dog was still not dead yet.<br><br>Police came, Ambulance also came.<br><br>Epilogue:<br><br>The doctor could not save the unborn child.<br><br>The black dog later died too.<br><br>Peng lost his left eyes due to the stabbing.<br><br>Nathan was drown and found dead at the bottom of the pond.<br><br>Tales :<br><br>It was said that Peng preserved one of his pet dog's eye. He will 'insert' the dog's eye into his now empty eye socket to look 'normal' again (when he went out ).<br><br>It was also believed that he will be able to 'SEE' souls and spirits from the other world.<br><br>His neighbour said that Peng has gone crazy after that because he will prepare his soya beans early in the morning talking to himself.<br><br>But Peng claimed that he could see Kim through the dog's eye and was talking to her.<br><br>The pond where Nathan was drown has few tales too. It was believed that Nathan has turned into a 'Chwe Qui' Water ghost and will grab the leg of people near the pond. So, the pond was filled up and vegetables were grown there instead. But Nathan's evil spirit still reside in other ponds in Potong Pasir. Many people encounter near death situation in many ponds in Potong Pasir. Some were not so fortunate but died in those ponds. The work of Nathan? It is everybody's guess.<br><br>Suddenly, the Kapok tree started to flower and bear lots of fruits. It was also believed that Kim's spirit was residing in the tree.<br><br>The small path running along the Kopak tree was forsaked by the villagers. Many had claimed to encounter Kim crying below the Kopak tree at night. She was still having a big belly. Sometimes, she will wave at passerby. Sometimes pitiful wailing of a woman could be heard too. Hunted place? Perhaps.<br><br>No body dare to take that route. Soon weeds and grass covered the path.<br><br>The old Kapok tree stood lonely and forsaken. So as the poor soul of Kim.........</div>
