              <p>An engineer who was retrenched in 2007 had to resort to scavenging for rubbish to make a living and support his family of 7.</p>
              <p>53-year-old Mr Koh is an engineering graduate from NUS with honours. 
                  After working for some years, he finally landed himself a top job in a 
                  big company in 1993. Subsequently, he worked there for the next 14 years
                   till 2007 when he was laid off. Although the company wrote him a good 
                  testimonial, it wasn’t easy for him to find another job. After he was 
                  laid off, there was a change in his outlook and he began to centre his 
                  life around his family more than his work.</p>
              <p>He has 4 daughters, ages from 5 to 9. His mother lives with him. 
                  Together with his wife and himself, he has to support a family of 7. So,
                   why did Mr Koh decide to get into rag and bone (“karung guni”) business
                   after he was laid off? As jobs were hard to come by especially for 
                  people at his age, he said that he wanted to get into eco-friendly 
                  business.</p>
              <p>“Some of the thrown-away electrical appliances only have minor 
                  problems. It’s a waste to see them being thrown away. After I repair 
                  them and clean them up, they are as good as new.”</p>
              <p>In fact, the fridge, kettle, fan, etc in his house were all salvaged 
                  from the rubbish dumps. He has been picking rubbish for the last 3 
                  years. Every morning, he will get up before the sun is up. Wearing a 
                  T-shirt and a pair of shorts, he will be the first to go to the dump 
                  sites to look for good items to pick.</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-44277" title="rubbish2" src="http://www.tremeritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rubbish2.png" alt="" width="292" height="210">“I
                   start work at 5am every morning. I will go to the rubbish chutes and 
                  HDB corridors to look for discarded items. I have to often endure cold 
                  stares from some of the residents.”</p>
              <p>He recounted that sometimes, some people who saw him pushing a cart 
                  of discarded items would immediately cover their noses and avoid him. 
                  Others would throw sarcastic remarks at him.</p>
              <p>“They thought I’m an illiterate who goes around picking disused items. I’m a university graduate!”</p>
              <p>As to how much Mr Koh is earning from his rag and bone trade, he 
                  declined to say. He only said that he makes enough to support his 
                  family.</p>
              <p>Before Mr Koh was retrenched, he disclosed that he was making $8,000 a
                   month with bonus up to 5 months. He said that few months before he was 
                  being laid off, he whistle-blew on certain procedures in the company for
                   being not proper. He felt that this might be the reason he was laid 
                  off.</p>
              <p>“On the day I was laid off, it was raining and only 1 person from the company came out to see me off. It was pretty gloomy.”</p>
              <p>Mr Koh recounted another incident. On one of the mornings, he was 
                  pushing his cart of loaded “junks” in a HDB estate at Toh Guan Rd. He 
                  stepped away to get his bike for a moment. When he returned, the whole 
                  cart and “junks” disappeared. At the time, there was a Bangla cleaner 
                  around. Mr Koh saw the Bangla cleaner came out from the utility room. 
                  The Bangla denied seeing his cart. When Mr Koh wanted to enter the 
                  utility room to check, the Bangla told him there was no key. So, Mr Koh 
                  had no choice but to call the police. The police came and asked to see 
                  the supervisor. The supervisor came and opened the door to the utility 
                  room. Mr Koh’s “missing” cart together with the items were found inside 
                  the room.</p>
              <p>The supervisor after questioning the Bangla cleaner, took out $100 
                  and gave it to Mr Koh, hoping that Mr Koh would let things rest. Mr Koh 
                  said, “After being busy for one whole morning, I was insulted by this. I
                   feel very frustrated.”</p>

              <p>He is 53 so he was born in 1958. He must have attended NUS in 1975. So in 1975 was NUS a high standard university yet ? By the time he graduated he was 1977.</p>
              <p>In 1977 was NUS a high standard university ?</p>
              <p>In Singapore, once people hit their mid 40s, their job marketable value declines. No company wants to hire a mid 40s much less a person in his 50s.</p>
              <p>Feel sorry for the man. Hope everything goes well for him. Should send the ingrate Bangla back home to where he belong, for stealing the citizen's hardwork.</p>
