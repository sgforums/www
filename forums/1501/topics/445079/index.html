              <p>
              </p><p>So my security agency is sending me to an office building (today) that requires 4 clocking rounds per day. </p>
              <p>Each round lasts for about an hour or more. </p>
              <p>Normally there will be two guards on duty and each guard does two rounds. But for tomorrow, I think I will be put together with a lazy bastard (who's supposedly a cripple but he has no problem walking to the workplace or to the food court or to the bank to get his pay). Why would they put a guard who can't do patrol at the building anyway? Just to make up the head count?</p>
              <p>And that means I will have to do all 4 rounds.</p>
              <p>That sounds easy but take a look at the schedule. </p>
              <p>There's one round at 8am, another at 10am and another two more rounds after lunch.</p>
              <p>That means after I finish my 8am at around 9-ish, I get to sit down for less than an hour before I have to get up to do my 10am. </p>
              <p>Can I do that? Sure. But do I want to? Do I want to do all the work while a supposedly crippled partner sit around doing nothing and collect the same amount of money as I? NO!</p>
              <p>So later, if my "crippled" partner refuses to do his fair share of work, I will do a walk-out. And f--king quit the job.</p>
              <p>Just one hour worth of patrolling around an office building sounds easy. But I have to say that it takes only one hour for me because I already know the route well and I am a very fast walker. It would take others (older guards) around one and a half hour. In fact, two hours are set aside for each patrol route.</p>
              <p>Anway, I could be too hasty in my prediction. Who knows? The "cripple" might have a change of heart today or perhaps I will end up having some one else as my partner. I am however, just a tad suspicious, because the agency pulled the same trick on me before. They set me up with a partner, and they told me he knew the patrol route, but it turned out on the day itself that he didn't. So I had to spend my morning showing him around the building. </p>
              <p>Never again, I told myself...</p>

              <p>Lets put it this way.. Lazy is lazy but please do not use the word cripple so excessively.. </p>
              <p>Fustration will leads to wrong decision making.. Step back take a breather and think again. Is the building a sensitive building? If it is, have you sound out to your supervisor of the tight schedule? If it isnt, and you already plan to walk out, then I suggest you just do your own clocking and ignored the other two.. Today you will have bad stomache for one hour each on both his clocking time.. Thats simple.. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>it's not your fault if you refuse to do his part of the patrolling, but don't let your anger get in your way... if he's indeed so useless, have some sympathy for him (but dun have to do his job)... Karma says that if you do good things, it will eventually come back to you... In any case, if you have such concerns, you should bring it up to your immediate boss. This has to be the best way of resolving the problem first... unless really no way out, then perhaps you can quit... but i believe ur boss will act sensibly... have some rational thinking.</p></div>
