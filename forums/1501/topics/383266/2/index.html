              <p><strong>===============================================================</strong></p>
              <p><span>from <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/445700/1/.html">www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/445700/1/.html</a></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore will for the first time boast a gaming industry, when two integrated resorts (IR) open in 2010. <br><br>One of the resorts, Marina Bay Sands, is having difficulty in finding enough dealers. It has only managed to fill less than half the 4,500 positions needed to man the gaming tables. <br><br>Ken Davie, senior vice president of casino operations at Marina Bay Sands, said: "In Macau for example, or the United States, if you say dealer or croupier, everybody knows what that means. <br><br>"Initially when we had the first job fair, we felt that we had the numbers we need, then realised that many of those were duplicates. And as we looked into the numbers we realised that more than likely the Singaporean group we were going after may not exactly understand what a dealing job entails." <br><br>Marina Bay Sands' first recruitment drive in March saw about 8,000 applications for all positions. <br><br>Mr Davie said the resort has had better success recruiting non-gaming vacancies - in particular, marketing positions are the most popular. <br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The company said the starting pay for dealers is S$1,800 a month, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before tips</span>. They may move up to become pit managers, earning up to S$6,000 a month. Shift managers may earn up to S$11,000.</span></strong> <br><br><strong>Since March, 1,500 dealers and dealer inspectors have been recruited, but the casino needs another 1,000 more.</strong> It hopes its job fair at Suntec City this weekend will help boost numbers. <br><br>However, with a second casino opening on Sentosa island, the pool of eligible candidates is set to shrink. <br><br>"You have to remember also there are two IRs. So the dealing pool may be split between both of them," said Davie. "So I may say we have 1,500 people, but it may not be that amount when we finish up. They could be applying for both, they could have Letters of Intent from both, and we can't prevent them from doing that." <br><br>Marina Bay Sands said it is focusing its recruitment drive on Singaporeans, but what if targets cannot be met? <br><br>"We haven't crossed that bridge yet," said Mr Davie, adding that experienced senior gaming staff will be brought in from its other casinos in the initial period. <br><br><strong>An applicant for the position of a dealer need to be over 21 years old, know basic mathematics and pass a colour-blind test. <br></strong><br><strong>Prior experience is not needed as successful applicants will go through an intensive three-month training course at Mountbatten Square, fully paid for by the casino.</strong> Training will start in the fourth quarter of this year. <br><br>Those who complete the course will receive a Workforce Skills Qualifications Certificate in Casino Gaming. <br><br><br>- CNA/yb </span></p>

              <p><br>the NEA position she gotten must be under the <strong>CSO</strong> scheme of service, which is for N /O/ A/ ITE holders.</p>
              <p>the civil service usually recruit polytechnic diploma holders under the <strong>MSO</strong> scheme of service, while degree holders are under the <strong>MXO</strong> scheme of service. along with the different scheme of service comes with the different salary range for career appointments.<br><br>i heard that a very recent civil service recruit review that wef 2010, ITE holders will be recruited under the MSO scheme, but the MSO Grade appointment will be placed just below the MSO Grade for polytechnic diploma holders.</p>

              <p>One cannot but marvelled at how our leaders so proudly pronounced our ranking in education and other international rankings praising Singapore like changi airport and other achievement. BUT at the same time refuting other ranking that measures other parts of the education system  that is not in our favour.</p>
              <p><strong>education system is not changi airport to be advertised and made $$$ of , thatsh what sg edu system has been doing so far. </strong></p>
