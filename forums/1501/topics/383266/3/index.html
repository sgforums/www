              <p>when you start to compare your salary with others. you might want to ask your self. how much efforts you put in when you were studying in poly. understand that not everybody born to be smart but hard working is one of the most important factor in career.</p>
              <p>I know an insurance agent who only graduated from primary but today she earned more than most of us. hard working...don't blame it to education. education teach you to be smart or at least know how to analized things.</p>
              <p>if you follows those gamers, play game everyday then good luck. why don't just drop the school and become professional gamer.</p>

              <p>Singapore government simply doesn't care about the labour pay system.</p>
              <p>If you're paid less, its simply for the sake of "competition". I do not have to tell you what the competition are but I do not get, why are Westerns FTs getting more paid than the locals?</p>
              <p>Years of education does benchmark your salary, but really, some benchmarks are just ridiculously low.</p>
              <p>MOM salary reports are accurate but they are also misleading because some people get ridiculously high pay and some very low.</p>
              <p>Let's say for design students graduating from ITE, poly, university, come out, all do same thing, no experience, see who get paid more? Or maybe all the same? So you might want to ask if the education policies here are a bit "wrong"?</p>
              <p>Yes, we earn all earn more pay through our efforts. A hardworking insurance agent can earn more because the work-pay culture/system is good. But not all industries gives you the same work-pay culture/system.</p>
              <p>I have been looking for jobs for about 2 months now.</p>
              <p>Here are some recommendations of industries in Singapore which I think doesn't offer you adequate pay in accordance to working hours and your efforts, not to mention prospects 5-10 years or more!:</p>
              <p>1) Creative/multimedia industry - graphics design, print publishing, web publishing, 3D animation</p>
              <p>2) Broadcasting/video/film production industry (wonder why they keep calling people to go for subsidised course but like no one wants to go?)</p>
              <p>3) Hospitality industry - IR, hotels (remember, they are shift work! Check if there are OT pay first!) </p>
              <p>4) Retail industry</p>
              <p>Beware of the "Glam" factors these industries offer!  The difference between "Rich and Poor" pays!</p>

              <p>Btw, they are so many government jobs, but 70-80% of them are at least a degree with experience! </p>
              <p>What happening to the learning culture in the government job sector? Is there so many degree holders/ people with that amount of experience to get that job?</p>
              <p>No time to train? Too lazy? Too stiff?</p>

              <p>Wow, I didn't know poly grads in SG are now only making $1200 a month. From what I've heard, even NS CDO officers now earn more!</p>
              <p>But then again, starting pay isn't everything. My brother graudated from a university in the US in advertising. He then went back to SG to work for $1,600 a month, and worked 18 hour days.</p>
              <p>However, he got some great experience doing that, and 10 years, and 3 job changes later, he's doing marketing in the banking industry making over $150K a year.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I started with a reasonable salary out of engineering school, but haven't seen my pay go up much at all.</p>
              <p>So in the end, a higher starting pay is nice, but you have to look at it long-term too.</p>
              <p>That's my 2 cents...</p>

              <p>But then again, starting pay isn't everything. My brother
                  graudated from a university in the US in advertising. He then went
                  back to SG to work for $1,600 a month, and worked 18 hour days.</p>
              <p>However, he got some great experience doing that, and 10 years,
                  and 3 job changes later, he's doing marketing in the
                  banking industry making over $150K a year.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I started with a reasonable salary out of
                  engineering school, but haven't seen my pay go up much at all.</p>
              <p>So in the end, a higher starting pay is nice, but you have to
                  look at it long-term too.</p>
              <p>That's my 2 cents...</p>
