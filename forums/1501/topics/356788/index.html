              <p>I was watching some Chinese documentary the other night on prospective graduates having difficulty finding jobs and having to lower their salary expectations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was one gal whose words particularly struck me. She mentioned that "she would <strong>do any job except for sales</strong> because she would learn so much more from the other fields".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well i didn't think much of it until one woman wrote in to the ST forum today mentioning the same gal and her words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dunno what u all think but sales is the driver of all industries. For freshies, you enter the bank and do sales, the basic is 2k plus and with commission, it can go to any amount that u can achieve. You learn about mortgages, insurance, investments, derivatives etc etc. Someday, you may even be the head of operations or branch manager etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know of this Mercedes car salesman who earns $6-8k a month. And he has the contacts of so many rich towkays and managers. Opportunities money-wise aplenty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This guy was an asst engineer, became an engineer and then a sales engineer and climbed his way up. He would make frequent business trips to Germany.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know of guys who sell photocopiers and they makes thousands a month! Then they go on to manage a team of salesmen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And this lady i know makes $40,000 a month just selling insurance. NUS grad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Haha, seems that some grads these days are pretty naive hor.</p>

              <p>Just this portion....</p>
              <p>There are also MLMers who make 5 figures monthly as well.</p>
              <p>There are also full time tutors earning 20k monthly, teaching just 16 hours a week.</p>
              <p>There are also full time internet marketers earning 20k usd monthly working just 4 hours a day at home.</p>
              <p>All these succeed because of sales.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then, these are only the top few percent of people. In any job, as long as you can sell yourself well (still sales) and are in the top few percent, you will fly high.</p>

              <p>banks are still hiring professional bankers. Investments wise may be a bad time but insurance and mortgage wise are still areas to expand into.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All entrepreneurs that we see have had their humble start-ups in sales. After all, they had to sell their idea before their company would even take off, right? lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many singaporeans are brought up to believe that education is the only way to a good life. In today's context, that is very true but if we do not look beyond that, it can be myopic. Just look at the Indo chinese, why are they often stereotyped as "rich people"? That's because the truth is that most indeed are.</p>
