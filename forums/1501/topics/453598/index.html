              Apparently European banks are becoming more  "innovative" in the way they protect jobs for their European counterparts . Under the guise of global scale down and job cuts, local staff in Asia are told that  they will be put into a pool  of cohorts to compete  with their global counterparts for limited jobs "worldwide". Job scope are merged to cut down on some jobs and redesignated to be based either in the West of out of Asia ( even if it was in Asia before)  Other jobs are down graded in terms of levels so that locals at senior grade  now no longer qualify- as they are deemed over qualified for the job. Still other jobs in Asia and particularly Singapore are now down graded e.g from Executive Directors level to Directors level - so as to dispense with the local staff and replaced with  expatriate lower grade staff, seconded in from Europe or elsewhere in the  so call global ' reshuffle '  Some are asked to take on a lower grade grade - thus a demotion for the local - or else be retrenched.
                  It seems a  number of banks have been doing this - truely Singapore 's growth  and job creation benefits the world not necessarily  Singaporeans.  And  do we hear any sound from MOM? Ignorance is bliss? Or blind acceptance, since locals are  afterall not global talents? To add insult to injury a European bank recently obtained a huge training grant in millions  from our local authorities and are now getting ready to  play Aladdin in its HR division  displacing local lambs for imported global  lamps!  When an instituion  claims it is downsizing and its net inflow of expats in the bank increases-surely MOM should question them! It is time local staff - band up together  and  take up civil suits against  these establishments if they feel unfairly discriminated!

              Indeed! but iti ismade worse when our governing authorities does little to help protect Singaporeans from being unfairly displaced by foreigners. Clear cut case in the finanacial institutions whereby Banks are replacing locals with their European counterparts  badly hit by unemployment in Europe! The worse is yet to come!

                 Sure they  want to cut jobs, but  no  prize for guessing whose jobs they cut first. . In the name of global reshuffle their Europeans  come in  to Singapura as expats extraordinare  to replace locals throughly cleverly redesigned , remodelled job specifications at new levels . And the high salaries were more often than not earned by  expats here,  who now opt to take local packages  . No doubt  bankers in the west have been earning  extra-ordinaire high  salary packages - Watch the dvd "INSIDE JOB" and you can see for yourself how much some of these western crooks are paid and the lies they can tell without batting an eyelid.
              
               Reliable sources  have even reported staff being told to accept demotion or leave without a job. Would you rather take a demotion or  go jobless? And of course in a particular case we were told  they continue to purportedly run some Asia pacifc training centre based here  and   our government gives them funding......and our locals get the walking ticket!

                  Exactly , that was what the bank's local HR staff told us. The bank just recently obtained a training grant of millions but is actually planning to cut its training division in Asia Pacific -thus local staff affected . If that is not deception - what is?Of course MAS is handsoff as usual   and MOM forever not aware, not involved. As the Wing Tai chairman said today in the papers . every country is simply protecting its own turf ....Singapore leh- let the dogs gnaw at  our local labour force?????

              <p>HP started sometime back in their retrenchment exercise.</p>
              <p>Sony started last month to retrench their staff worldwide.  Barclays and RBS started last year.</p>
              <p>Nope as what you thought about Singapore.  A friend who was retrenched from the foreign bank said it was pretty tough as day in day out they are face with the bad news of global financial situation and there the govt of Singapore is painting fake pictures that things are well.   See how fake and dishonest the Papigs are.</p>

                  Yes some say service related jobs and food court and toilet cleaners lots of them. BUT we are losing a layer of managerial staff, and not training a new generation of them as managers and CEOs unless they are  anointed scholars or elites,  as  these days, many of our young local graduates  altho now recruited will have a glass ceiling in Singapura - as by mid management level they will be replaced by global talents , if working in Multinationals ...even some Glcs  employ foreigners in  management and top management stratum! glass ceiling  because no restriction for foreigners to be brought in- so how can the local move up in a a compnay in Singapore ? By sheer numbers if you let  the whole worlds' talents compete with your own small pool of talents in little red dot-quite naturally  your  local citizentry pool can be easily displaced ,and overtime  it gets worse.
                   Now when Europe is in shit - they are all here  to avoid unemployment there..
                          
                   If we continue to believe in this global absolute openness nonsense without taking care of our own first, -our small population of locals will be eaten up by the world's billions and thrillions of people.(we will therefore  be self perpetuating and  actually fulfilling  this myth into a reality  that Singapore has no Singaporean  talents! )
                         
                    Thus important for youngsters to simply seek greener pastures and move-and not be tied to sentimentality of "this is home etc" or you might end up jobless!  YOU just got to move where the opportunities are!  This is how the foreigners survive- we got to do the same!We Singaporeans got to behave EXACTLY  like these foreign talents  who can easily uproot and call  any country where there is opportunity to make money  "our home".                        </blockquote>
