PSA WOS some of them no container rates incentive.

              You can apply directly through...
              
              1.   PSA website - https://www.singaporepsa.com/
              
              if you fail to get into PSA...other alternative is to apply with the contractors of PSA...I would recommend you to apply....
              
              1.   TNS Logistics Pte Ltd - http://www.tnsgroup.com.sg/
              
              2.   BIGFOOT Logistics Pte Ltd - http://www.bigfootgroups.com/
              
              there are others but these two companies above are ok...read your employment contract before you sign them. However, TNS has been in this trade with PSA for decades.
              
              Good luck to you.

They probably will ask you to come down for interview.  They really need people now to work at the PSA Terminals.</div>
