              <p>Many people actually informed the SCDF to report them, as they always put their plasticwares and paper boxes all over the place, even to the extend that they block the exit of the office. But the SCDF will always call the co. to 'clean up' the place 1st, before going down to check. Even if the SCDF really find anything, they only gave them warning. No effect at all. </p>
              <p>If we go down and destroy their properties, we will face criminal sentence instead.</p>
              <p>A lot of them turned to MOM to get their salary back, but til now no news.</p>

              <p>In between, is your company an foreign company or local ? Cos I never heard local company which have such an "weird" practice. And if you joined the company under MLM scheme as an distributor (based on what you said you will not buy their products) instead of being their employee, your case might be a little "tricky".</p>
