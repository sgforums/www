              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A Singapore recruitment agency posted on its website a list for jobs for foreigners, but locals need not apply!</p>
              <p><span>Allied Manpower is a licensed recruitment agency in Singapore which claims to provide services in human resources and manpower management. It has </span>over 29 years of proven experience in foreign recruitment.</p>
              <p>It offered a list of jobs for foreigners which can be easily filled by locals:</p>
              <p><span><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17475" title="alliejob585" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/alliejob585.jpg" alt="alliejob585" width="585" height="350"><br></span></p>
              <p>As we can see from above, the jobs are offered only to specific nationalities such as Filipinos and Chinese nationals.</p>
              <p>Of late, senior cabinet ministers have stepped forward to defend the government’s pro-foreigner policy.</p>
              <p>MM Lee repeated the circular argument that foreigners are needed to take up jobs shunned by Singaporeans without which Singapore’s economy will stagnate:</p>
              <p><em>“Look at the Integrated Resorts. (On the) rooftop, not one (construction) worker there is a Singaporean. (They are) China Chinese and the Indians. If you don’t have that, where’s the IR, and the 10,000 jobs (they will create)?”</em> he asked in speech made at a grassroots event last week.</p>
              <p>Opticians, art teachers, beauticians and website designers are hardly considered as jobs shunned by Singaporeans. In fact, many locals will be keen to take up such jobs.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Polytechnic offers a three-year course in Optometry which is popular among students. Are Filipino opticians more highly qualified than ours?</p>
              <p>Saved for the positions of IT support analyst and opticians, the other jobs offer pay of less than $1,500.</p>
              <p>For a local website designer, $1,200 is surely too low a salary, but it is more than enough for a Chinese National who has no family here. Convert it to RMB and he will take home more than RMB$5,500 a month, far more than what he makes in China.</p>
              <p>Again, there are many qualified Singaporeans who will be interested in applying to become an Art teacher if not for the meager pay of $1,200.</p>
              <p>Imagine if you are a diploma or degree holder, will you consider taking up such a job?</p>
              <p>Instead of addressing the real concerns on the ground, the government has chosen to put the blame on Singaporeans for being too “choosy” about their jobs.</p>
              <p>The relentless influx of foreigners, especially the semi-skilled workers, has led to increased competition for the limited jobs in the labor market.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans often have to accept lower pay and longer working hours out of fear of being replaced by foreigners who generally have fewer demands.</p>
              <p>Despite the widespread unhappiness and resentment among the citizenry at its immigration policy, the ruling party is adamant that foreigners are needed to keep the Singapore economy growing.</p>
              <p>There is no minimal wage in Singapore. Neither are there any social welfare benefits for those who are retrenched or unemployed.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s population just cross the 5-million mark this year out of which 36 per cent are foreigners. This means that for every person you meet in the streets, he/she is likely to be a foreigner.</p>
              <p>The ruling party is able to force its unpopular policies down the throats of a subservient citizenry largely because there is no opposition in parliament to check on them and it controls all important state institutions.</p>
              <p>In Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and other Asian democracies, citizens are able to gather and protest in the streets to show their frustration and anger against their governments.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, even a peaceful solo protest anywhere on the island except Hong Lim Park is illegal under the law.</p>
              <p>The lack of public expression of dissent helps the ruling party to recycle and perpetuate the myth through the state media that it is a “popular” government which have the “support” of the people to introduce these laws and policies.</p>
              <p>Unless Singaporeans wake up from their long slumber and reclaim their civil and political rights as citizens of their country, they will forever be subjected to the mercy of the ruling party.</p>
