              <p>I used to have a clause in my contract,
                                      stating that I am not to work for any rival company that is in the
                                      same business as my ex-company for 2 years, starting from the
                                      effective date of my resignation. But I understand that in court,
                                      this clause is not really enforceable.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Soul_rage, I also have this clause, but it's for 1 year...</p>
              <p>Then again, I know pple who moved to work in this company from other companies with the same clause, who didn't even bother. Guess it applies mostly for those who handle super duper sensitive stuff....</p>

              <p>singapore laws on protecting against company exploitation and abuses are quite non existent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>basically the company do this is due to high turnover rate. every week and month you can see staff from resigning. so by incorporating this stupid clause, is meant to deter staff from resigning within the first year, but then it doesnt stop staff from resigning if they find a better paying job. it should be find why the staff turnover rate is high and look into ways to compensate and retain staff. usually the pay is the main grouse for most staff. if you pay very little, of course the staff is not going to be loyal once he/she has found a better paying job.</p>

              <p>our government has failed us in this respect.we need a legislation, even for PMET, not only those who earned 1.6 and is educated up to A levels, to protect employees from being exploited by unsrupulous employers. what's the use of MOM if it cant even protect us from these lousy companies.</p>

              <p>many years ago, I remembered working for this company selling mobile equipment. the co required its employees to work for 6 days a week, from 9am to 6pm, only off on sunday, 6 days a week. after you knock off on saturday at 6pm, you are already very tired and just go home straight to rest. you do not even want to go out on sunday, as monday is a working day. needless to say, there are a lot of staff quitting and there are not many singaporeans working there, malaysians the majority of the staff there.</p>

              <p>i received a call in midweek, think its the call from the company's HR, but I did not pick it up, heck care.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>didnt receive any letter from the company this week, so I think they should be doing something now, like asking their lawyer to send me a letter of demand. If I receive it, I also heck care, as its not from the court. I may go to MOM for further advise, or go to my MP to write a letter to them in reply, or I may name this company in this forum or go to newpaper lol, if I receive a letter of demand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway I dun see it as if I am owing them money, its not as if I borrowed money from them or use their services. If I borrowed money from them, as in receiving advance salary from them, then they have a case, but I dun. the only crime I did here, was worked for them for less than 1 year only and resigned. the 2 weeks I worked for serving notice, I did not receive any salary from them.</p>
