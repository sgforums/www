              <p>Im a Senior HR professional wkg for various MNCs for about 8 years...Sad to say its true that many recruitment agencies in Singapore r substandard..u will realise that the better recruiters are caucasians notably aussies..they r courteous, professional and will always try to follow up if possible.</p>
              <p>My opinion is that the worst agency in Singapore is Recruit Express. The only reason they r doing well is they know how to provide good account management to companies but they show a different facet to candidates. Totti, I faced the same problem as you when I was hunting for a job previously and you know what? It happened to me 3 times at RC during different time periods. I stil rem there was once when i called back,one staff at RC asked me rudely y am I calling twice since the person looking for me will call me if its important. Asked me to wait and not to call again. The ironic thing is Im actually holding a senior capacity in the HR industry and its me who decides which vendor to use. Needless to say, I have banned RC in the last few MNCs that I worked in and will never even speak to them after my bad experience. Y would I want them to treat my candidates in the same manner demeaning my company's reputation.Unfortunately the prob is that many MNCs do not search for candidates directly and rather engage the services of these agencies. Thus all of you will have no choice but to continue looking out for opportunities with these agencies if you want to source for a job with good prospects.</p>
