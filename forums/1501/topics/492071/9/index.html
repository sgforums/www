              Personally, I feel that young Singaporeans must learn from these Young Europeans or other young Asians from other countries about working and living abroad. It would really help them to grow and see the real world outside Singapore.
              
              EUROPEAN EXPATRIATION AMONG THE YOUTH 
              
              European Millennials seem to be keen on leaving their home country for another country within the continent in search of academic and professional experiences. Students and professionals between 18 and 28 convey an enthusiasm for learning new languages, living in different cultures, and, of course, gaining a better education or establishing an international career. Here, is an overview of the expat life in seven European countries as recorded by the Think Young think tank.
              
              Why do European students and professionals expatriate?
              
              European students have different reasons to want to move to another European country, but the predominant one (46%) is to seize an opportunity to study at a university or a school abroad. Young Europeans are constantly looking to expand their knowledge, and what better place to do so than in a world renowned institution in one of Europeâ€™s most popular education hubs? Among the participants of Think Youngâ€™s survey, other determining reasons for expatriation are: experiencing another culture (38%); learning another language (33%); and improving your CV (32%) for better career opportunities.
              
              Young European students are less likely to base their decision on the lifestyle, education conditions (affordable and accessible education), or cultural heritage (including the customs and the values of the local people) of their destination.
              
              Millennials have repeatedly been stereotyped as lazy, self-obsessed,and job-hoppers. But once we go beyond the labels, we can see that Millennials are nomads at heart, globally minded, less patriotic, and accepting of differences (in culture, religion, appearance). So, it comes as no surprise that half of the surveyâ€™s professional participants are seeing relocation as a chance for personal development â€” a way to engage in the common good of a wider community, as well as to find their passions, integrate work into their lives, and be creative.
              
              The benefits of expatriation
              
              What do the European youth believe that they gain from expatriation? 67% of the young professional expats answered â€˜â€˜career advancementâ€™â€™, 57% believed it was a â€˜â€˜better quality of lifeâ€™â€™, and 42% referenced an â€œincreased social lifeâ€� as a key benefit. Anything finance related or more practical (such as savings, living costs, healthcare provision, and banking) isnâ€™t identified as a beneficial effect of expatriation.
              
              Choosing the right destination
              
              Making the decision to move to another country is a huge step to take, but how do young Europeans choose their destination country? In general, the lifestyle, economic stability, safety, and the cultural heritage are the factors that young expats-to-be are taking into account before making the final decision. The everyday quality of life and the time shared among personal, social, and work life are at the top of young expats' priorities. On the other hand, the climate, romantic relationships, and the availability of leisure activities are less important elements, and almost non-decisive when it comes to moving abroad.
              
              The financial challenges abroad
              
              Millennials have come (or are coming) of age during a severe economic downturn, which makes them more aware of how to manage their finances. Moving abroad has financial implications, and it can take sometime to adapt to the new cost of living (accommodation, transport, leisure, education fees, etc.), as well as to understand the conversation rates and make sense of the new currency you are using. All of these are challenges that have to be dealt with and overcome for a successful and stress-free life abroad which forms part of the notion of personal development. Advance research of costs and average salaries in the destination country is a good starting point for every expat-to-be -- millennial or not.

              If you need more income to bring home for yourselves and family, sales is the best option for you. You can earn as much as you want with your basic salary + transport allowance + commission + other cash incentives (especially when you hit your company sales quota).
                  
              And this is to the bosses of local Singapore companies. Your companies must function like those MNCs and your management staff must be trained to upgrade management skill and refine their corporate attitude towards their staff. Many young Singaporeans do not like working for local Singapore companies because of the lack of management staff international professionalism mentioned above. Period.
                  
              Sales or Counter Staff or Customer Service Staff are the front line of the company. Without them your company will not be effective or productive in bringing more revenue to the company.
                  
              So treat and reward your good front line staff well and generously.
