              ONE YOUNG WORLD
              
              What is One Young World?
              
              One Young World was founded in 2009 by David Jones and Kate Robertson. We are a UK-based charity that gathers together the brightest young leaders from around the world, empowering them to make lasting connections to create positive change. 
              
              We stage an annual Summit where the most valuable young talent from global and national companies, NGOs, universities and other forward-thinking organisations are joined by world leaders, acting as the One Young World Counsellors.
              
              At the Summit, delegates debate, formulate and share innovative solutions for the pressing issues the world faces.
              
              At past Summits delegates were joined by a line-up of Counsellors that included Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, Sir Bob Geldof, Kofi Annan, Sir Richard Branson, Professor Muhammad Yunus, Jamie Oliver, Jack Dorsey and Arianna Huffington. Click here to find out more about past Counsellors.
              
              After each Summit, the delegates, who are then known as One Young World Ambassadors, work on their own initiatives or lend the power of the One Young World network to those initiatives already in existence. Of those in employment, many return to their companies and set about creating change from within, energising their corporate environment. 
              
              Who can be a One Young World Ambassador?
              
              One Young World delegates are 18-30 years old who have demonstrated leadership ability and a commitment to effecting positive change. Many have already had an impact in their home countries on a range of issues, including the role of business in society, transparency in business and government, the impact of climate change, global health and hunger relief.
              
              If you think you meet the requirements, we welcome you to apply to attend the 2016 Summit by creating a candidate profile. If your profile is approved it will be displayed on the One Young World website and you can seek the necessary funding to attend the Summit. 
              
              At the Summit Closing Ceremony, delegates graduate as One Young World Ambassadors, joining a network of young leaders who are creating positive change around the world.

              How is it funded?
              
              Delegates' expenses to attend a Summit may be funded by private citizens, companies, NGOs, education establishments and public bodies.
              
              More information about how to fund a delegate can be found here.
              
              The cost for each delegate attending the Summit encompasses travel within the host city, accommodation, meals, access to laptops, desktops and mobile devices, venue costs, chaperones and satellite and wireless connectivity.
              
              The 2016 delegate fee is Â£2,975 (plus VAT).
              
              Where will the next Summit be held?
              
              The One Young World Summit 2016 will take place in Ottawa, Canada 28 September to 1 October 2016.

              This is my personal opinion. I'm not surprised if any Malaysian Property Developer / Investment organisation will hire top Property Executives/Agents from Singapore. If they get hired, normally they are offered with an executive appointment and paid with high package salary, Incentives, Bonuses etcs. Usually it comes with corporate accommodation and car too.
              
              So, all the best of luck to you.

              SENAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - JOHOR BAHRU - MALAYSIA
              
              Senai International Airport is located in one of Malaysia's strategic development zones, with a structured highway and a proposed railway network, which will eventually stretch to China as well as providing easy access to the modern port facilities of the Tanjung Pelepas Port, Johor Port and Singapore. 
              
              Our immediate neighbours are Singapore, Thailand and Brunei Darussalam; with Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia in the vicinity. In addition, the region's dynamic economic and tourist centres are within a mere four-hour flight radius, reaching out to Hong Kong, Macau, Guandong, North Australia, India, the Philippines, Indonesia and Indochina.
              
              While enjoying proximity to these key economic centres, Senai International Airport benefits from being located outside the primary commercial centres in the area. As a consequence, it enjoys lower land, labour and operational costs.
              
              Most of the regionâ€™s dynamic economical and tourist centres are located within a mere four-hour flight radius from Senai International Airport.

              Work Visas
              How to apply for a work permit in Malaysia
              
              Work permits in Malaysia are usually obtained by the employer. If you own a company and want to hire a foreign national, be prepared for a long and exhausting process.
              
              Employees and their families coming to Malaysia, who have not obtained work permits before arrival, are allowed to enter the country on social passes and to obtain the work permit afterwards. As Malaysia imposes stringent laws for illegal workers, it is highly recommended not to start working before the working permit is issued.
              
              Dependents of work permit holders have to apply for own working permits if they wish to work in Malaysia.
              
              Requirements for work permits
              
              In order to obtain a work permit, the passport should have a remaining validity of at least 18 months. The foreign national coming to Malaysia to work must be 27 years and above (exception in IT sector, where required minimum age is 23). The work permits are usually issued for periods between 6 months and 5 years.
              
              As for employers, any information regarding the visa process, requirements or the necessary forms, can be viewed on the official website of the Malaysian Immigration Department.
              
              Work passes
              
              Depending on the type of job and skills, different working passes are issued when obtaining a work permit.
              
              1. Employment Pass: This pass is issued to employees with specific skills, usually for technical or manegerial jobs. The minimum period is usually 2 years.
              
              2. Temporary Employment Pass: Issued for employment for less then 2 years or for jobs with a monthly salary less than RM 5000.
              
              3. Professional Visit Pass: Issued to foreign nationals who remain employed by the company in the home country but are required by a Malaysian company to provide certain services for a period up to 6 months.

Our products are distributed via tank trucks to seven strategically-located depots and terminals which have been conferred many times over the years  the prestigious Malaysian Society for Occupational Safety and Health (MSOSH) Award. Through this vast distribution network, we continually supply the petroleum requirements of our various industrial customers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: black; text-align: justify;">Our robust petroleum marketing business that encompasses over 550 service stations nationwide bring high quality, clean energy products to motorists. Beyond just a petrol station, Petron service station provides a one-stop service experience to travelers on the road. Treats, our convenience store offers amenities such as shopping marts and fast food restaurants.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: black; text-align: justify;">Beyond our business agenda, we take our corporate and social citizenship to heart by integrating education and environment programs into our operations to ensure sustainability and contribute to social development.</p>
