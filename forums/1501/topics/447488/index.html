              <p>Joi_lin, we have met before several people in their 30s who switch careers after losing directions and passion in their current jobs, and yes it is not uncommon to do so. </p>
              <p>However, most of them like yourself tend to look towards taking courses in other industries with a hope of switching careers, without realizing that the most optimal solution is actually leveraging their own existing strengths and experience to look for, and match prospective employers already seeking professionals with such talents. </p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">This could mean rediscovering within yourself, the work that motivates you most - something that you would and could do even without getting paid for, before looking outwards and exploring what kinds of organizations could value talents like you. Without evaluating your options clearly before spending your savings on other professional courses could result in a futile attempt to switch tracks simply because:</span></p>
              <p>1. You will most probably end up competing in a red ocean of similarly trained professionals who could be younger and cheaper.</p>
              <p>2. You may end up discovering that this new industry is not one which you would like to be in for the rest of your working life.</p>
              <p>3. As you have funded this education yourself, you feel compelled to follow through to get a career in this industry even though you may not like it.</p>
              <p>We are a group of freelancers who have been through the same work cycles as yourself, and we have helped some people along the way to secure better careers for their future.
