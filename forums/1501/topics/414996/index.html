              <p>Your services are outsourced by cactus studio. so per my undertsanding of the english language cactus studio outsourced this talent search service to you, when you are working using a yahoo email address as sgproducers(at)yahoo(dot)com? is there any inormation with a direct link to cactus studio at their website?</p>
              <p>i am sure you are not asking cactus studio to work for you right since it should then be "my services are outsourced TO cactus studio".</p>

              People have the rights to be skeptical about such offers. Unless you do not read the newspaper or news, there have been scams about such offers before. Yours could be a genuine offer but how would anybody know for sure right?
              
              I mean, put it this way. If you come across in the forum offering free spa sessions, would you be skeptical? It might be a genuine offer by the owners to give free spa sessions, but who knows right? Then again, business needs to make money to sustain itself, if you're not skeptical, you're saying that you believe business can sustain itself being a charity.
              
              In fact, I think it's important to be skeptical and not take anything at face value. Someone recently posts that his investment can make more than 200% returns annually. I'm not saying the guy could be lying, but I am just saying being skepitcal is important. People like Bernerd Madoff feeds off trust.

              <p>What does the numerb 16 mean to me or anyone else here who is not you? maybe i should post some videos related to 300. Answer me. Will my photos taken be kept in your database only for reference and there be any assurance that they will not be used for other purposes and advertisement? if you are going to help at least provide more details here about photo usage. I am not interested in your friend's studios and their reputation really so you can save that.</p>
