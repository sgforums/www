              <p>Hi fellas, </p>
              <p>I'm an Indonesian currently in Dubai and bumped onto one of those bad walls which are common here. In short, this place is definitely not for me (and many other people). </p>
              <p>Now I am looking for an opportunity to move to Singapore. Knowing that entering Singapore is not easy, I'd like to know what you'd say about how good or how bad my chance is. Please visit my <a title="online resume" href="http://www.herlia.com">online resume here</a>. Please noted that I dropped out from my university and only holding a certificate. </p>
              <p>Even rudest - pesimistic comments are welcome. </p>
              <p>BIG Thanks!</p>

              <p>dear peacefullia,</p>
              <p>if u are from indonesia and have worked in dubai.then it must be hell for u.i have heard most bosses in dubai yell,beat,rape and do everything thats horrid to their foreign workers daily and very often police would arrest innocent  foreign workers n throw them in prison.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>currently spore is overheated as they got in  more than a million foreign werkers from overaseas and destroying salary packages .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we would love to welcome u but spore has way too many foreign werkers from lack of control.pretty much like a guy eating too much food and vomitting due to eating too much food during a meal.spore is presently undergoing great chaos in employement sector where foreigh werkers strike it out in a mob outside government buildings in past and citizens yelling where are the jobs thats supposed to keep them afloat for the present n future. </p>

              <p>Elite: Frankly speaking, some of those bad stories are true, according to some journalists. Once there's a depth report regarding blue collar life here which blasted me to the corner big time.  But it never comes up to the surface. I haven't witnessed or heard from any victims directly. </p>

              <p>Lokey: Yes, Dubai is bad, worse than I thought it would be. Still, surviving is my middle name. Though I prefer moving on. Fingers crossed. </p>
              <p>Elite: I am doing my research, including collecting and calculating all information (not only salary figures), I don't think there's something odd about it. And I posted a message previously (which was deleted by system/moderator), asking for everyone's point of view regarding best countries to move to nowadays, maybe Thai? Vietnam? etc.  So, don't worry, I am not going to steal anything from Singapore, I am just researching opportunities, not only in Singapore. That's why I joined the forum instead of mass-sending my CV. </p>

              <p>Lokey: Yes, Dubai is bad, worse than I thought it would be. Still, surviving is my middle name. Though I prefer moving on. Fingers crossed. </p>
              <p>Elite: I am doing my research, including collecting and calculating all information (not only salary figures), I don't think there's something odd about it. And I posted a message previously (which was deleted by system/moderator), asking for everyone's point of view regarding best countries to move to nowadays, maybe Thai? Vietnam? etc.  So, don't worry, I am not going to steal anything from Singapore, I am just researching opportunities, not only in Singapore. That's why I joined the forum instead of mass-sending my CV. </p>
              <p>Indonesia? nothing wrong with it, but I have preferences, just like everybody else.</p>

              <p>Mancha: yes, I have done that :) I spent a lot already in Sg. Anyways, like I said, I am not targetting Singpaore in particular. Looks like the situations are not favorable for both locals and expats. </p>
              <p>Thanks for all your comments fellas... My heart for Singapore. Hope the business atmosphere will hike up soon. </p>
