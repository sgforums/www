              <p>I don't think anyone can say anything bad about MDIS here because of the T&amp;Cs of this forum. Also, MDIS always likes to say if anyone says bad stuff about them, they will sue - I have personally heard the sec-gen say this.</p>
              <p>However, as an ex-worker from MDIS, I have nothing but bad things to say about the company. I managed to 'graduate' from my contract late last year. The turnover rate is so high that they have to place so many restrictions on the position (such as 1 - 5 year contract, payment required if you leave before your contract is up - which is TRUE btw. For me, it was 3 months of salary, but couldn't afford so I had to stay on.) They tend to place employees in the wrong positions (eg. IT graduate doing scheduling and other ad hoc duties, geography/lifescience graduate doing admin jobs.)</p>
              <p>The working conditions are not up to standards and the facilities are not as cutting edge as they would have you believe. My computer monitor was so old that I could still see the refresh rate - staring at this from 8.30am to 9pm almost every day was a nightmare. People treat you like crap, as if your studies and previous work experiences don't count for anything. I got scolded for not being able to produce ridiculous amounts of analyses and have been shouted at in front of other colleagues for expressing my honest thoughts in my monthly report. My pay, despite being a degree-holder, was only S$1.8k, and no significant increments were made even though I was doing overtime and working to keep my portfolio from disintegrating. I was very upset as there was another staff in my dept who did not do as much work and she got just as much increment as myself. There is little/no staff appreciation.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, I feel like I wasted 1 whole year of my life working there. It has not helped my resume as it has nothing to do with what I studied. Also I did not learn much from working there, other than using Microsoft Word/Excel, stuff I already knew before... I'd much rather be unemployed than work in MDIS.</p>
              <p>This is my perception of my time working there. No defamation intended, but if your company is lousy, this is what you should expect to hear.. isn't it?</p>

              <p>Hi All</p>
              <p>FYI MDIS is DEFINATELY not under Government. If it really is, y are u hearing the bad stories about MDIS? Govt benefits are definately very good, do the stories sound like it has the benefits of Govt jobs? do u hear anyone posting bad comments about any govt jobs? I believe each of us already has the answer.</p>
              <p>Only SIM Uni (partially), SMU, NTU and NUS are under Govt. If you are talking about sdf fundings, all private schools are eligible to apply so please do not be mistaken that it is under govt so long they can apply for sdf funding.</p>
              <p>I would say MDIS has a tough culture and if you are looking for a nine to five job with no OT, this place is not for u unless you are very desperate. Do not also expect appreciation from yr boss even if u OT volunterary because the mgt do not appreciate them too, so y do they care much?</p>
              <p>There are staff who stayed there for as long as 10 years willingly but there are also staff who leave within 2 days. It is all very common in evey company.</p>
              <p>Even if your performance is gd but the mgt don like you, they have all means to sack u and leave a bad record in yr P file. Y bother to make a stain in yr resume? MDIS is a place that talks about $ with disregard for human feelings.</p>
              <p>Think twice before u go over there to work, market is picking up, u have better choice.</p>
