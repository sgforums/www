              <p>This is not the Singapore I know before the influx of foreigners came to our land.</p>
              <p>It used to be our parents did not have as much of a problem of finding a full-time job as compared to us now.</p>
              <p>I
               recalled a time that it took years and hard-earned demonstration of 
              commitment before a foreigner could get his/her PR, unlike today in 
              which PRs are issued like throwing confetti before any foreign Tom, Dick
               and Harry who is more than happy to reap its benefits in less than a 
              year!</p>
              <p>But mind you, I am not working as a full-timer, but as a 
              freelancer in the creative industry. I remain as a freelancer, not by 
              choice, but because many agencies are not willing to hire me full-time 
              which means paying my CPF, despite me willing to reduce my salary to 
              that of a PRC here.</p>
              <p>So far, I’ve been working for 3 agencies while
               I continue to send out 1000s of CVs. I am thankful for some income that
               comes most of the time, if not every month, since I am hired on project
               basis. I noticed that each agency promised me a job after trying me out
               for a few weeks. Those few weeks turned to months, with excuses from 
              them that they have “no budget to hire full-time”. Eventually, agency 
              no.1 (which is an MNC) hired an Indonesian fresh graduate. Agency no.2 
              hired an Indonesian fresh graduate same as agency no.1. Agency no.3 
              hired a PRC. All these foreigners were given the full-time jobs 
              originally promised to me and without having to go through the probation
               periods that I went through despite my years of experience exceeding 
              theirs!!</p>
              <p>It’s been really heart-wrenching, considering that I have
               a family to feed and urgently need that source of stable income. I have
               to continue to swallow my angst and dismay while sitting next to these 
              fresh hirelings. Some of them their English is so bad that they needed 
              help in translating and even asked the meanings of simple words! They 
              are no foreign talent, just cheap labour for employers to exploit 
              without having to relocate to 3rd world countries.</p>
              <p>Some of the 
              PRCs in the companies have told me unashamedly that they hope to get 
              their PRs within a year, buy a flat here with the govt’s grant, and then
               retire to their homeland. Commitment to Singapore has become a 
              laughable topic.</p>
              <p>From reading the articles in TR, I can see that I
               am not the only one, and am pretty dismayed that on my left and right, 
              my fellow Singaporeans are suffering from this and much more. The rising
               costs that is spiralling out of control has made me too afraid to want 
              to start a family here considering that I have to worry about my 
              retirement as well. What national identity can my children be proud of 
              by the time this country is made up of 50% foreigners? And for whom are 
              our sons defending while male foreigners can just come here easily, get a
               job and PR without having to serve the army?</p>
              <p>This madness has got to stop. VOTE FOR CHANGE, VOTE PAP OUT!</p>
