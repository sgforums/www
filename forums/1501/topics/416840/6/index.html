              <p>This is not the Singapore I know before the influx of foreigners
                  came to our land.</p>
              <p>It used to be our parents did not have as much of a problem of
                  finding a full-time job as compared to us now.</p>
              <p>I recalled a time that it took years and hard-earned
                  demonstration of commitment before a foreigner could get his/her
                  PR, unlike today in which PRs are issued like throwing confetti
                  before any foreign Tom, Dick and Harry who is more than happy to
                  reap its benefits in less than a year!</p>
              <p>But mind you, I am not working as a full-timer, but as a
                  freelancer in the creative industry. I remain as a freelancer, not
                  by choice, but because many agencies are not willing to hire me
                  full-time which means paying my CPF, despite me willing to reduce
                  my salary to that of a PRC here.</p>
              <p>So far, I’ve been working for 3 agencies while I continue to
                  send out 1000s of CVs. I am thankful for some income that comes
                  most of the time, if not every month, since I am hired on project
                  basis. I noticed that each agency promised me a job after trying me
                  out for a few weeks. Those few weeks turned to months, with excuses
                  from them that they have “no budget to hire full-time”. Eventually,
                  agency no.1 (which is an MNC) hired an Indonesian fresh graduate.
                  Agency no.2 hired an Indonesian fresh graduate same as agency no.1.
                  Agency no.3 hired a PRC. All these foreigners were given the
                  full-time jobs originally promised to me and without having to go
                  through the probation periods that I went through despite my years
                  of experience exceeding theirs!!</p>
              <p>It’s been really heart-wrenching, considering that I have a
                  family to feed and urgently need that source of stable income. I
                  have to continue to swallow my angst and dismay while sitting next
                  to these fresh hirelings. Some of them their English is so bad that
                  they needed help in translating and even asked the meanings of
                  simple words! They are no foreign talent, just cheap labour for
                  employers to exploit without having to relocate to 3rd world
                  countries.</p>
              <p>Some of the PRCs in the companies have told me unashamedly that
                  they hope to get their PRs within a year, buy a flat here with the
                  govt’s grant, and then retire to their homeland. Commitment to
                  Singapore has become a laughable topic.</p>
              <p>From reading the articles in TR, I can see that I am not the
                  only one, and am pretty dismayed that on my left and right, my
                  fellow Singaporeans are suffering from this and much more. The
                  rising costs that is spiralling out of control has made me too
                  afraid to want to start a family here considering that I have to
                  worry about my retirement as well. What national identity can my
                  children be proud of by the time this country is made up of 50%
                  foreigners? And for whom are our sons defending while male
                  foreigners can just come here easily, get a job and PR without
                  having to serve the army?</p>
              <p>This madness has got to stop. VOTE FOR CHANGE, VOTE PAP OUT!</p>

              <p>Saying that foreigners get full time jobs whereas Singaporeans don't is simply rubbish. I think that every country deals with the same problems, they want to have foreign investments, globalization, cash and standard.. but not the foreigners. There are thousands of jobs that some Singaporeans don't want to do, simply because their mom&amp;dad is taking care of them and they do not need to pay rent. In addition, we have an unemployment rate which is around 2.5% and people are still moaning!</p>
