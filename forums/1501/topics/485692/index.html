              <p>Hey, it's my first time applying for jobs so there are a few questions that I need to ask;</p>
              <p>1) What's the difference between permanent and temporary contracts.</p>
              <p>-I know the terms are pretty self-explanatory but are there any things that I need to know about these two contracts. For example, if it's a permanet contract, does that usually include probation periods or can we quit anytime we want?</p>
              <p>- What about temporary contracts? Are we not allowed to quit the job at all within the fixed period of time?</p>
              <p>2) So from what I understand; this is how the job application process goes;</p>
              <p>a) You send your resume online.</p>
              <p>b)If they call and ask you to come for interview;</p>
              <p>-what kind of question do we need to expect?</p>
              <p>-is this the time when you need to fill in the job application for and sign it?</p>
              <p>- Job application form only contains your particulars, qualifications, work experience and your expected salary right? So it doesn't determine anything. What i meant to say is even if you don't want the job after signing the job application form, you can inform the manager/anyone in charge because you haven't signed the contracts yet right?</p>
              <p>- after the first interview and they decided to hire you, then they will ask you to come again to sign the contract or some company called them "employment letter" right?</p>
              <p>-What does the contract/emplyment letter comprise of?</p>
              <p>3) After signing the contract, let's say we change our mind and decided to not work in the company? Is it acceptable if we <span style="line-height: 1.231;">inform the company about our decision before our first day of work? </span></p>
              <p>Because we haven't started working for the company right yet so technically our employer and employee relationship has not yet started EVEN THOUGH we've signed the contract/employment letter, am I right?</p>
              <p>I really wish you guys can share with me your experience and will be able to answer all the questions that I have, because I want to everything, if possible. </p>
              <p>Thank you and looking forward to hear from all of you.</p>

              <p>1) Perm contract got more benefits and is permanent position. Temp contract got very few or no benefits. Perm usually more responsibilities and tasks than temp. Temp can be sacked anytime and usually the first to go during retrenchment. Currently, there is no iron rice bowl in this era. Whether temp or perm also can be retrenched. Both can quit anytime, subjected to contract terms and notice period. Sometimes, need to pay a penalty if didn't stay within a certain duration in the job. Read the contract carefully.</p>
              <p>2) Normally job application forms are not contracts but do read carefully as they might include something to bind you. Contracts is mostly the same but do read carefully as some might differ.</p>
              <p>3) After signed contract, you're legally binded to their terms. Depends on the terms and whether they are nice enough to let you go without you paying any penalty. Before signing contract, discuss all issues during interview. Be honest and don't hide anything. Once signed contract, you're at their mercy.</p>

              <p>Hi Digimonfan2008, thanks for the reply but i need you to clarify certain things.</p>
              <p>2) How does job application forms include something to bind me? Can you give me examples? because i can't think of any. </p>
              <p>3) During interview (before we sign the contract),is it ethical to ask things like "If I decided to change my mind and not work for you after signing the contract, am I required to compensate for the total salary of my probation period"? </p>
              <p>Because I heard that it's okay to change your before your official first day of work. But I'm scared that asking such questions will make me appear to be less serious about my job.</p>
              <p>Confused</p>
