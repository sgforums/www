            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, just want to share my job hunting experiences with fellow forumners. Some background, as in my previous threads, I am a graduating student from uni and have started job hunting in about September.<br><br>Well here goes..<br><br>Started by looking at several popular jobs site and then sending out my resume to jobs that interests me. I've also uploaded my resume to most of the sites so that it becomes 'searchable'. The websites I frequently use in order of preference are<br><br>1) <a href="http://www.jobsdb.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.jobsdb.com.sg</a><br>2) <a href="http://www.jobstreet.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.jobstreet.com.sg</a><br>3) <a href="http://www.jobscentral.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.jobscentral.com.sg</a><br>4) <a href="http://www.monster.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.monster.com.sg</a><br><br>Some notes: JobsDB got the largest number of jobs daily, so its my no. 1 site. Up to date Monster.com has provided the most unsolicited calls to me by Recruitment agents, so you might want to upload your resume to Monster.com and make it searchable to the recruiters.<br><br>Besides visiting jobs site, I went to many major companies website and searched around for a "Career" or "Join Us" section and tried applying via their website. So far, most companies I applied to this way replied to my application, so, its worth a try.<br><br>First interview I went to was a port company. Turned out terrible (as it was my first) and I did not liked the job scope anyway so I knew I was done for the minute I stepped out of the room. Felt a bit dejected yeah...<br><br>Second interview was with a government agency in south side. Did not go very well also and turned out that a friend I knew went for the same interview also! In the end he got the offer that same evening, and I really felt terrible, super low and hopeless!<br><br>At this point I was really feeling stupid, cannot even pass an interview and people are getting all the jobs just by going for one interview. I was thinking, whats the use of my results in school if I cannot even pass an interview? Really sian..<br><br>Third went for a test with another govt linked agency. A technical test and an essay test. Nothing much to say.<br><br>Fourth interview was a 1st interview with a consulting company. This was OK, and it was the first time I felt confident after stepping out of an interview room.<br><br>Fifth interview was with a government agency in south side AGAIN. They called me up after the first failed interview and ask me to go for another position one and I agreed. This interview, in my opinion, went very well.<br><br>After that above interview, the govt agency called me up and said will give a provisional offer and I was like damn happy! But they said they will call me back once the offer is ready. I wasnt thinking much then, just feeling damn happy! But after more than one week still no news, and I got called up for a 2nd interview at the consulting company, so wanting to keep my options open, I went ahead...<br><br>Sixth interview - 2nd interview with the consulting company was a DISASTER. I thought I did badly, and I absolutely have no hopes when I left. But thinking I will getting an offer from the govt agency, I wasn't feeling really sad.<br><br>Still no news about my supposed offer, so I called them up, and they said the offer still not ready and said will call me back again. So far, its been more than 2 weeks. To my surprise, the consulting company called me for 3rd interview!<br><br>Seventh interview - 3rd interview with the consulting company was very brief, I thought it went OK, but it was not to be. In the evening after the interview, I received a rejection email from them. And to date I'm still wondering what went wrong. But i kept hope with the offer i was going to get, so i took it in my stride.<br><br>Eighth interview - No news from my supposed offer, so I decide to keep my options open and went to this local "mnc" in north side. from the conversation and signs i pick up during this interview, i know i was going to get offered.<br><br>Job offered from the local "mnc"! the terms were quite good, but I wasnt really comfortable with the job scope and the department i was going to be in. the HR allayed my fears and said they would arrange something for me. I believed them. I signed. Straight away after i signed, all my fears and considerations were realized. apparantly i was tricked, the HR did nothing at all. damn disappointed. at this point i still received some offers for interview, so i thought i would go to see if there were a better offer elsewhere.<br><br>Ninth interview - back to the port company as i applied for another position. the interview was weird, i din know if i had a chance a not.<br><br>Tenth interview - company in bedok. it went well, by now, i was feeling some of the numbness of going to too many interviews liao.<br><br>Job offered from the bedok company! but the pay diff was really too great. more than 300 diff. job scope wise i was more comfortable with, but i cannot get over the big pay diff so i rejected it.<br><br>up till now, more than two months since i was supposed to be offered, i din here a thing from the govt agency and its already so close to my start work date, so im actually quite pissed with them. were they bluffing me? i dun know.<br><br>so there it is, a summary of my job hunt. I guess I would try out the job i accepted, but I still have 1 interview coming up, remember the test i took? haha its been so long already and they called me up yesterday to arrange interview for me.<br><br>The morale of this long post is DUN GIVE UP. I had a rough patch when i first started going to interviews and although it did not really turn out well now, at least i still got a job, albeit one i'm not really keen on...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have experienced varying degrees of difficulty in looking for jobs I am interested in. Some had candidates with doctoral qualifications and some had candidates with 10 years of experience. Some , I missed by a narrow mark. The jobs I don't want - no problem, can just step into it and cover the time period it takes to find a job I want.<br><br>However I learnt one thing - if you fail in your interview - ask for feedback politely - I usually tell them that I want to improve on my skills . Thank the interviewers for the time (even though you might think the panels were a bunch of  shatheads) . For me , most of the interviewers actually called me up and discuss my interview with me ( I requested it at the end of the interview session when they ask me if I have any questions) .<br><br>The key thing about interviews is making your interviewer like you rather than just churning out knowledge . Research the companies you apply for. Anticipate the common interview questions: why do you want this job? What can you offer? Where do you see yourself in 5/10 years etc ? I often tailor my answers to the job description.<br><br>Second of all , in Singapore, you cannot be too picky because a foreigner can undercut you easily.<br><br>For some of you in Singapore, sometimes it is better to get the experience , accept the low pay temporarily and then run with that experience elsewhere .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are courses on communication skills and interview techniques for a reason. For high-paying jobs, HR dont look at certs anymore bcoz the pple being interviewed are definitely qualified or over qualified. They look out for behaviour, personality etc from ur interview. I'm serious. This was shared with me by someone with immense HR experience.</div>
