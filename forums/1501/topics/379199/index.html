              <p>As a graduate, you should be mapping out your career. If you have studied just for a job, then it will show during the interview.</p>
              <p>This is a common malady of Singaporeans,  as parents, government, and elders, instill into Singaporeans to study hard for a good job.</p>
              <p>Amazingly our children are still not asked what they want to be when they grow up. They are just told to study hard and get good grades, else they won't get a good job.</p>
              <p>Well now that you are a graduate, what? What do you want to be?</p>

              <p>how many ppl jobless now? i am a fresh degree graduate , jobless for 5-6mths, gone for quite a few interviews, always call me to wait for call. Gone for temp jobs still no reply from them. Is it really all companies want those who has experience? those no experience = jobless. Then no chance given how to get experience? there is always the first time to everything. All companies are like lazy to train their personnel. Where got so many experience ppl ard? Unemployment high, experience ppl rather stick to their jobs rather than hopping. Only if they are assured a higher pay job , confirm job, then they dare to hop.</p>

              <p><br>I also applied for casino job and didn't get selected.</p>

              <p>I got a diploma in accounting &amp; finance from a local polytechnic.</p>

              <p>Its not difficult to find a job if you are accounting trained with no experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do a search on the web for a list of accounting firms than call/email them to ask for job vacancies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most small accounting firms are willing to employ fresh graduates.</p>

              <p>Once you gain the experience than move on to a find a better job</p>

              <p>TS, how about giving tuition for the time being. if you do not mind low pay, you can work at retail and travel agencies, they are always hiring. have you visited any employment agencies so far? try to visit all of them. if u do not mind, you can try to be financial advisor or insurance?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know its a bad time to graduate now, but hang in there, cos the recession is just over. next year 2010 will be better than 2009 and 2011 will be better than 2010. now is almost year end, quite difficult to find jobs, but continue to look for them even if you are not successful. think of it, this is the first hardship and difficulties you have encountered so far. if this period does not kill you, it will make you stronger. This period of difficulty will make you stronger and stand you in good stead. after all, experience is a good teacher.</p>

              <p>I myself is also no better, but at least I have a job. my job and pay is not fantastic, but no choice, still have to work till the economy improve next year. once the economy improve next year, you will find plenty of jobs and unemployment rate to go down.</p>

              <p>Although I am a grad with years of experiences, I am getting the pay of a fresh grad and the work of management support officer. the job I am doing now is more of clerical and I have to eat humble pie.

I just shrugged it away, saying this is only for the time being.</p>

              <p>ya what to do. the entry requirement is A levels and yet I applied and got the job. I have thought of not accepting it initially, but if I dun, I dunno when I will get a job, esp when it is year end liao, more difficult to find a job now. I intend to work first and then quit next year, say after chinese new year. hopefully by then the economy is much much better than now and plenty of jobs in 2010. fingers crossed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you are me, what will you have done? if quit this company, have to serve 2 months or pay 2 months pay. lucky this pay is not high, I can work for 1 month for free and then pay 1 month of pay to them.</p>
