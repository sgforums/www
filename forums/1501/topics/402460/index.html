              <p>Im was formerly working in a recruitment agency and am currently in a HR capacity. In an agency its more sales orientated than recruitment initially. U got to build a strong client database through cold calling 60 calls a day. Only when you build a client base then u got the resources to do recruitment. Some companies r very sales oriented. They take risks in hiring ( u got no example they willing to try u out)  but u be out of the door in no time if u cant perform. They emphasis more on getting in the clients than recruitment. One such company is Recruit Xpress. Some companies however have a sales team dedicated to business development and sales while recruitment is being handled by another recruitment division. One such example would be Kelly Service ( However I know they underwent some minor reshuffling some time back so might be slightly diff now )</p>
              <p>As for salary, it depends on your education. I got a friend who has O levels but was previously employed by Recruit Express for $900 base and commission. Got another friend working in the same company who was getting $2K base with commision but she has a degree from NUS.</p>
              <p>The HR industry consist broadly of 4 main spectrums; Recruitment, Com and Ben, Payroll and Training. So if you start off as a Recruitment Consultant in a agency, it would be possible for you to move on as a Corporate Recruiter in time to come. For ex Microsoft was looking for a Recruiter 3 months back and 5-6 years experience working as a recruiter in an agency was one of the criteria it stated. Many MNCs prefer recruiters from recruitment agencies as they focus only on recruitment and nothing else and r quite fast paced. As for other HR functions, many MNCs are willing to consider internal transfer if your performance is good as Recruitment is part of HR and is still related to other HR functions. I was lucky in the chance that one MNC took me in as a HR Generalist although i am experienced only in Recruitment at that time. Hope that answers your qn.</p>
