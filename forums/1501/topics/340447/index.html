              <p>Adecco help me to help a job on friday and next wednesday I am suppose to go to the company to sign the contract.</p>
              <p>But I got another job offer which is a government job. I want to reject the adecco job. I know that adecco is different from other job agency in that you are not required to work for a minimum of 2 or 3 months.</p>
              <p>Cos most agencies will require their client to work for at least 2 or 3 months if not the client have to pay 30% of their salary but adecco don't have this rule.</p>
              <p>I want to reject the adecco job but is afraid that they are a big agency and they may blacklist me as they have a online system whereby they have your resume stored and they can make a remark to blacklist you cos you agree to accept their job and than change your mind later. Once they blacklist me next time they won't help me find jobs anymore.</p>
              <p>But the government 1 I also scare they will blacklist me espically I have already went for the medical checkup already. I scare the government job which is a ministry of home affair job blacklist me than next time I cannot apply government job liao.</p>
              <p>So what should I do?</p>

              <p><br>If you already went for the medical checkup for the government job, most likely you would have already secured that job position.</p>
              <p>Adecco is just an job agency, they need you more than you need them actually. If you work for them, they will get to take a good cut of your income.</p>
              <p>So choose the job that you really want, nobody owns you even if you want to be loyal to them.</p>
              <p>Afterall, do you think you are looking for a job because you wanted to do anyone a favour...like being kind and naive?</p>
              <p>NO....you are looking for a job because you need the money at the end of the month to SURVIVE.</p>
              <p>You still can be kind after you've struck lottery and became rich or retired. Otherwise, you are just going to invite other people out there to run you over, take advantage of you, back-stab you, eat you up, grind you up, step on and over you, pull and press you down for all you're worth.</p>
              <p>Must always be kind to yourself first, if not...your loved ones will be terribly upset and disappointed in you for showing them how miserable you are and how incapable you are in taking good care of yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>You are Adecco's customer</p>
              <p>And as long as you have not signed any contract, there's nothing wrong with you to reject their offer. Perfectly alright. I'm sure they wouldn't expect you to sign up with only 1 job agency or sit around without looking for opportunities yourself anyway.</p>
              <p>Govt jobs will most likely not blacklist you for this as well; if they do that for everyone (or people who quit govt jobs), there will be little experienced people left to work for the govt, not to mention they will likely lose many votes as well.</p>
              <p>So in short, go with the job you like more, or the one that compensates you more for your time.</p>

              <p><br>You will only say such things that is because from your perspective, you think you are not good enough for the job position.</p>
              <p>Be more confident in yourself, companies also don't want to hire people who are not sure of their own abilities.</p>
              <p>Do you know why Indians and China nationals are able to find jobs easier than Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>That's because they BS alot (REALLY ALOT!) to boost their own confidence and abilities to their interviewers.</p>
              <p>They get the job not because they're cheap, they are cheap only after they have clinched the job.</p>
              <p>It's just normal for everyone else to imagine that people are asking for cheap wages and that's why they can get a job in Singapore. But the truth is, most Singaporean applicants are not confident of themselves and they are not used to BS naturally to the face of another stranger without giving themselves away.</p>
              <p>It's the lifestyle and environment and society difference that Singaporeans had from Indians and China nationals.</p>
              <p>Life growing up in another country outside of Singapore is alot tougher and harder than you all wimps can imagined, so don't be naive anymore and learn to appreciate where you come from and where you were brought up at.</p>
              <p>You all should be proud to be Singaporeans like me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>And you all should learn from our "foreign talents" and take back all the jobs that are rightfully yours.</p>
              <p>But please don't go to their third-world countries and try to steal their jobs ya.....Singaporeans are not good enough to do that....YET. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Hi everyone!</p>
              <p>May I give my point of view from another angle? I've been using Adecco in my job search and been placed on numerous temporary positions during my Poly vacation breaks. Based on my experience, I have not seen a cut in my salary and neither did they charge me for using their service. Although I do know that Recruit Express or more commonly known as RE in many forums, charges candidates a fee of $50 or take a percentage cut of their salaries. It makes me wonder why they are the HR Vendor of the Year. I guess when we approach recruitment agencies to seek their help to look for a job, we have to go for the more reputable ones such as Adecco, Kelly Services and Manpower.</p>
              <p>As for blacklisting, I feel that personnally blacklisting is resorted only to serious cases such as the person does not turn up at work on numerous occasions without valid reasons. Come on. If you put yourself into their shoes, will you still waste time and resources to interview this person again for another job? And one question though, how does one know that he/she is being blacklisted?</p>
