              <p>1. ya, what you are good at. Hi I'm RoyFang. I'm a newly graduate from XXX. To be honest, I have no experience in working environment but I'm willing to learn. I'm a good team player and contribute my fair share of work during my school days. I'm believe in not only doing my best but also doing and submitting work that is of good standard and up to par. I read the job description and I feel that I'm the right person with the right ability for the job.</p>
              <p><br>2. Just say availble immediately if you are. I don't think they will tell you to start work on the same day.</p>
              <p>The aim of interview is to get the job, since you've read the description and you know you want it. If work wants you to have 3 hands, you must say you have 3 hands, or if no 3 hands, at least say you got 2 legs. aka. if you don't have the requied quality, say you are willing to learn and throw in another good quality you have.</p>

              <p>That would depends on what is the actual personal reason....but since U put it as personal reason...I presume U really wouldnt want to delve on it...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.Assuming U resigned and not terminated from your last job...this question is comparatively easy to answer....looking for greater job security,more regular hours,dun want to travel too much,etc</p>
              <p>2. this one is the difficult one...which brings U back to the original question...what have U been really doing? last Sept till now is like 8 mths...even if U can get your friend/relative to "employ" U for the period...Some companies do ask for last drawn payslip...and the "temp" company might not be willing to give cos it will not tally with their own records and if IRAS comes in....it will be a big mess....</p>
              <p>if not say U went travelling lor...but better to back it up with trip photos....just dont ask me how to get those pics.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Hi Xcert, thanks for your advice.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I will try to give a background so maybe you can help to
                      provide some more advice.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Basically, I had worked for 2 companies. Say my first
                      company = Coy A and the second company = Coy B.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I decided to leave Coy A in a moment of anger/rashness as I felt
                      that the Coy had practiced double standards with regard to a promotion that I have
                      been seeking.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Thus I started my job search and Coy B was the first offer
                      that I got.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I decided to join Coy B even though I already knew at the
                      time that the job scope is not something i would like to do. I left Coy A after
                      over 5 years of service.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Upon joining Coy B, it did not take long for me to realize I
                      made very a big mistake. To make things worse, the manager was kinda a boss
                      from hell. I decided to leave Coy B (without finding another job first) after
                      just over a year of service because the experience was affecting me physically
                      and mentally.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This is the personal reasons that I mentioned which I can’t
                      really say in an interview.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As with regards to what I have been doing since then I left
                      Coy B is when things really quite complicated.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Basically, soon after I leave Coy B, I actually got an offer
                      to join one of the casino as a dealer. However, I needed to wait after Chinese
                      New Year for the training to commence.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After attending the training for about week, I decided to
                      pull out of the training as I feel it was not something I would like to do long
                      term.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is only at the point in time that I really seriously
                      started looking for a job.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">About 3 weeks ago, I did have two job offers on the table. However,
                      there another position which I am really interested in but requires me to go
                      for a 2<sup>nd</sup> round of interview. As a result, I turned down the two job
                      offers. But I screwed up at the 2<sup>nd</sup> interview and did not get the
                      offer.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I did not do anything during travelling during these times so
                      I guess it would not be advicable to use that as I reason.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">On a sidenote, I been excising hard during these times, I lose
                      over 20+ kg.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Do you think this is something good to bring as something
                      you have been doing in the during these times?</p>
