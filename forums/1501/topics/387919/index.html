              <p>teledirect seems to be an outsourced company for SIA... i have a friend who worked there before... it seems that he is enjoying even though he is just an agent... he once told me that the working environment is stressful but still manageable... when working outside, taking medical leave is serious as other people will have to cover your work or the work will be halted... what form of penalisation did Teledirect give? No-pay leave for that day?</p>
