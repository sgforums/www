              <p>The government 
              has warned foreign managers that they should not marginalise qualified 
              local candidates in order to hire and promote their own kind. <br><br>Minister of State for Manpower <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12vc3e2d8/EXP=1321337810/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=Tan%2BChuan-Jin%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz">Tan Chuan-Jin</a> announced on Monday new guidelines targeting <span id="lw_1320117486_1" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320117863_1" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320118123_1" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320119666_1" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120600_2" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120622_2" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120712_2" class="yshortcuts">discriminatory practices</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> against <span id="lw_1320117486_0" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320117863_0" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320118123_0" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320119666_0" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120600_0" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120622_1" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120712_0" class="yshortcuts">Singaporeans</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> such as job advertisements indicating that foreigners are preferred and
               the preferential hiring of foreigners over suitable Singaporeans. <br><br>These
               new guidelines were drawn up in response to the high number of cases --
               51 in the first nine months of this year -- of unfair treatment based 
              on nationality lodged with the <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12ljdu94r/EXP=1321337810/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=Tafep%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz">Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices</a> (Tafep), reported <em>The Straits Times</em>.<br><br>Here are three case studies on why Singaporeans are lodging complaints of preferential treatment:</p>
              <ul class="yom-list">
              <li><strong>Case study 1: Foreigners hire fellow countrymen</strong> - A Singaporean complains that a foreign manager in her IT firm prefers
               his own countrymen to qualified Singaporeans. Management tells Tafep 
              that it had trouble finding suitable local candidates, but later admits 
              some departments have seen an increased representation from a particular
               country in recent years. Company then agrees to hire and develop 
              Singaporeans as its workforce core.</li>
              <li><strong>Case study 2: Discriminatory practices by an employment agency</strong> - An employment agency specialising in foreign recruitment raves about 
              why foreign workers are better than Singaporeans in an e-mail to 
              clients. The agency corrects its e-mail and pledges not to do so again 
              after Tafep steps in. Manager involved is counselled and makes a public 
              apology while staff are sent for relevant training. Manpower Ministry 
              issues a written warning to the agency after conducting its own 
              investigations.</li>
              <li><strong>Case study 3: Over-reliance on foreigners</strong> - A chief executive was swamped by complaints from his local staff 
              about the company hiring too many foreigners from a certain country. CEO
               was surprised of this practice as he was not aware of it. Many 
              employees left for another company which hired less foreigners.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Tan,
               who was speaking at a tripartism forum, stressed that while foreigners 
              are still welcome to work in Singapore, the core of a company's 
              workforce must remain Singaporean. <br><br>The Member of Parliament for <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12v0thgki/EXP=1321337810/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=Marine%2BParade%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz">Marine Parade</a> group representation constituency said that even though the government 
              is tightening its grip on importing foreign labour, employers on the 
              ground must still be watchful over their actions as many Singaporeans 
              have expressed displeasure over discriminatory practices in their 
              workplace. <br><br>“Let me emphasise that discriminatory practices have 
              no place in Singapore,” he said. He added that companies have a 
              responsibility “to attract, recruit and develop Singaporeans so that 
              Singaporeans remain at the core of our workforce”. <br><br>When asked 
              why laws were not drawn to fight discrimination, Tan replied that this 
              issue isn’t straightforward. He said that employers’ mindsets must be 
              changed to tackle the problem, and it’s better done through moral 
              suasion. <br><br>He added that anti-discrimination laws would reduce 
              flexibility in the labour market, which is a strength for Singapore, the
               same paper reported.<br><br>Tan, however, assured that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will act against employers who refuse to eliminate discrimination.<br><br>MOM
               will work with consult employers to resolve issues, but if that doesn’t
               work, the ministry will have to use other methods, such as slapping 
              demerit points on employment agencies.<br><br>In addition, Tafep will hold workshops to educate employers and ease them into the new guidelines. <br><br>Labour chief Lim Swee Say and employers’ group chief Stephen Lee both support the new guidelines.<br><br>Lee, president of the <span id="lw_1320117486_2" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320117863_2" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320118123_2" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320119666_2" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120600_1" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120622_0" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320120712_1" class="yshortcuts">Singapore National Employers Federation</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>,
               said that firms having Singaporeans as their workforce core enforces 
              their competitiveness in the long-term as foreign workers tend to be 
              more mobile.<br><br>He also pointed that Singapore’s foreign worker cap,
               which stands at one-third of the three-million-strong workforce, is one
               of the world’s highest. Lee also said that companies must nurture 
              Singaporeans as their core.<br><br>“If you replace your core with all 
              foreigners because of short-term expediency, then I start to question 
              the viability of the company in the long run,” Lee said.<br><br>Lim, 
              NTUC secretary-general, said that employers need to change their 
              mindsets. Some employers don’t think Singaporeans are willing to take on
               low-level jobs, while not possessing the ability to take on 
              high-skilled ones. <br><br>Many Singaporeans also complain that 
              employers are not willing to pay better for low-level jobs, while not 
              doing enough to help them move up to higher-level ones.</p>

              <p>These 'regulations' are just a sham. Employers will not get punished for
               flouting the anti-discriminatory rules. The headlines sounds like they 
              are seriously clamping down on FTs but if you read the fine print, it's 
              just all talk and no action. So with these half hearted measures, I 
              still would not vote for the incumbents.</p>
