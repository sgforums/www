              </p><p>By SELINA LUM</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A 24-YEAR-OLD property  agent  was yesterday jailed for 12 weeks for using fake  stamp certificates,  in the first case of its kind.</p>
              <p>  Desmond Tan Hock Heng, who was with Dennis Wee Group, admitted cheating the Commissioner of Stamp Duties of $3,694 by using eight bogus stamp certificates in  seven property rental deals.</p>
              <p>  Separately, he was jailed for another two weeks for pocketing rent payments that two clients had entrusted to him, amounting to $4,600 in one case and $3,600 in the other.</p>
              <p>  Tan is the first property agent to be charged under the Stamp Duties Act for passing off counterfeit stamp certificates as genuine.</p>
              <p>  Stamp duty is a tax on documents or agreements relating to properties, such as lease agreements, options to purchase, and sale and purchase agreements.</p>
              <p>  After stamp duty has been paid, a stamp certificate will be issued.</p>
              <p>  Stamping and payment of stamp duty for leases and tenancy agreements are made online via the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore's (Iras) e-Stamping system.</p>
              <p>  When a document needs to be stamped, the user would log on to the system to fill in an electronic form, after which the system would generate a unique document reference number.</p>
              <p>  After payment is made, the system would generate the certificate bearing the unique number. The user can then print the certificate from his computer.</p>
              <p>  Acting on a tip-off, Iras started looking into various rental transactions handled by Tan.</p>
              <p>  Investigations show that Tan, using a genuine certificate from a previous deal he had handled, forged eight stamp certificates by altering details such as the addresses, names of the landlords and tenants, stamp duty amounts and dates of documents.    </p>
              <p>  He then presented these bogus certificates to unsuspecting landlords, agents of the landlords and tenants.</p>
              <p>  He later deleted the original and fake certificates, but Iras' forensic teams recovered them from his desktop computer and laptop.</p>
              <p>  Yesterday, he pleaded guilty to five counts of using counterfeit stamp certificates between January and April last year.</p>
              <p>  Another three counts were taken into consideration.</p>
              <p>  Iras said it takes a very serious view of non-stamping and stamp duty fraud.</p>
              <p>  Any person or business that deliberately counterfeits stamp certificates and knowingly misrepresents them as genuine faces a fine of up to $10,000 and up to three years' jail.</p>
              <p>  Members of the public can check the authenticity of stamp certificates on the e-Stamping website at <a href="https://estamping.iras.gov.sg">https://estamping.iras.gov.sg</a> </p>
              <p>  Cases of stamp certificate fraud can be reported to Iras at <a href="mailto:estamp@iras.gov.sg">estamp@iras.gov.sg</a> or on 6351-3697/3698.</p>
