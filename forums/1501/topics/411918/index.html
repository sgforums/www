              <p>Contact Singapore will be launching a mass recruitment drive in Kuala Lumpur from 8 to 10 October 2010 to hire Malaysian engineers:</p>
              <p><img title="contactsg03" src="http://172.31.254.241/www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/contactsg03-640x314.jpg" alt="contactsg03" width="508" height="274"></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: </strong><a href="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/CareersSg/Engineering/Oct2010"><strong><span style="color: #ab6f07;">Contact Singapore</span></strong></a><strong>]</strong></p>
              <p>It is strange that MNCs and GLCs have to collaborate with Contact Singapore to recruit Malaysian engineers when both NUS and NTU produce thousands of engineering graduates each year.</p>
              <p>Another company Xilinx has just concluded a recruitment drive in Penang for microelectronic engineers.</p>
              <p>Contact Singapore is a government agency run jointly by the Economic Development Board and Manpower Ministry and funded by taxpayers to recruit “global talents” in liaison with the private sector.</p>
              <p>It is not surprising that many Singaporeans are unaware of its existence as its target audience is foreigners and it is seldom mentioned in the Singapore media.</p>
              <p>Despite its relative low profile in Singapore, Contact Singapore has embarked on an ambitious marketing campaign overseas to lure “global talents” to work in Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is even a list of “success stories” on its website depicting foreigners who obtained jobs in Singapore and eventually become Singapore PR with its help which includes a Filipino drummer, a PRC business manager and a Malaysian engineer (read more <a href="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/interactives/success_stories/chan_pei_ee/"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>PAP leaders have often laid the blame on Singapore workers for being too “fussy” which leaves employers with little choice but to hire foreign workers.</p>
              <p>However, most of the jobs on offered by Contact Singapore are PMET positions which Singaporeans are keen to take up if given the opportunity.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should get the priority in such jobs and not foreigners who are not necessarily more qualified than us.</p>
              <p>Other countries protect their local workforce by legislating that employers must advertise  job vacancies to locals first for a period of time before they can hire foreign workers.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the government is actively helping employers hire foreign workers at the expense of Singaporeans somemore using public funds.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, with no opposition in Parliament to raise the issue and with the political rights of Singaporeans curtailed by a series of repressive laws, Singaporeans have no choice but to watch the fiasco unfold before their eyes which will be considered as “treason” in many countries.</p>

              <p>they get them foreign engineers to:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)pay for the rent or new housing in singapore</p>
              <p>2)individual electrical and water bill in singapore every month</p>
              <p>3)no need national service that brings them away and disrupts production at work</p>
              <p>4)pay higher in terms of employer and employee cpf contribution to gov which can only be touched during old age as compared to cheap labour from india</p>
              <p>5)fill up space as most of sporean engineers had already stopped  going into engineering as salary for engineers in spore is low.</p>
              <p>how it could all backfire for spore gov:</p>
              <p>1)malaysian engineers decide to buy a house in johore bahru instead of spore</p>
              <p>2)they dont need to pay for electrical n water in spore which is very expensive and return to JB after work.</p>
              <p>3)they could decide to pack up and immigrate to usa and oz in the end</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what spore gov will say after their strategy of screwing  people had failed:</p>
              <p>1)mistakes make people wiser</p>
              <p>2)once in 50 years tsunami story</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>who will suffer the most:</p>
              <p>1)singaporean engineers who havent had much increment in 20 years</p>
              <p>2)their families</p>
              <p>3)educated people</p>
              <p>4)generations down the road</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>who will benefit the most even if strategy is a failed one:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)politicians...they get increment , high salary and a promotion even if strategy is a failed one especially when they were the ones who made the  stupid strategy in first place.</p>
              <p>2)their families</p>

              <p>In my opinion, alot of singaporean graduates shun engineering jobs due to their nature. Its tough, it can be dirty, the pay is low, and you can forget about work life balance, unless you're a deskbound engineer. And if the pay is high, its because the job is risky, or you will practically have zero life.</p>
              <p>So where else can you find people willing to be engineers in Singapore?</p>

              <p>if job n salary is low.....then its up to singaporean engineers currently to fight for a better job/life scenario and better salary.</p>
              <p>what the gov is doin is get ammo in form of foreigners to wipe out any chance of sporeans ever getting a better deal in life.</p>
              <p>so foreign engineers are merely some buffer zone or ammo to wipe out all hardwerking educated sporeans and gov dun care a hoot for sporeans.as long as they get revenues from them its ok and no disruptions in productions from forced army reservist callups too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>scenario 1</p>
              <p>---------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sporean workers,assistant engineers and engineers  :we want better job salary and better increments.</p>
              <p>authority:we will get better,cheaper n faster people from malaysia n elsewhere</p>
              <p>no need to talk.bye bye.</p>
              <p>so ends everything in such a fast paced enviroment...so before the factory is even built they have already foreigners reserved for those  engineering jobs.</p>
              <p>all sporeans in place will suffer greatly and eventually whither and die in agony and have zerolife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>scenario 2</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sporeans workers,assistant engineers and engineers:we want improvements to everything so we can lead a comfortable retirement.</p>
              <p>authority:feck u!!i will do as  what i want.</p>
              <p>sporeans workers,assistant engineers and engineers:fights it out and CIVIL WAR ERUPTS throwing whole country in turmoil.all the foreigners get the first plane out of singapore amidst grenade attacks and rebel army fighting in full scale war outside parliament buildings....flamethrowers,machineguns and RPG from vietnam were used.everyone in spore parliament n PAP were captured and sentenced to at least 40 years of hard labour in changi prison.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scenario 3</p>
              <p>---------------</p>
              <p>sporeans workers,assistant engineers and engineers:we want improvements to everything so we can lead a comfortable retirement.</p>
              <p>authority:feck u!!i will do as  what i want.</p>
              <p>singaporeans :kowtow unwillingly and silently</p>
              <p>foreign engineers:misuses power within 1 year in company and stops production lines in all parts of singapore.has sex during lunch time with operators and acts even better than LKY or LHL even though they look like amateurs.foreign engineers often come late for all meetings and get scolded by main company for tardiness.foreugn engineers might even vent their anger at sporeans and see themselves in a suitcase without their heads.</p>
              <p>and so singapore end up back to days where they never had it as bad as independence back in 1960s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>scenario 4</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>special death squads by sporean workers,assistant engineers and engineers put on ninja suits and go into authority complex....burns whole authority building n simultaneously wipe out all key personells in charge of getting foreigners.</p>

              <p>Part of the problem comes from FT undercutting asking salaries. But the main problem stems from the stigma instilled in the minds of job seekers, and future job seekers that engineering is indeed a dirty job. The sad fact about engineering jobs is that it is a dirty job, and the rewards aren't that great (depends on how you see it).</p>
              <p>For me, the sole reason of taking up engineering is my passion in it. I could say I am well paid, but I have alot to sacrifice for it to be in this industry. Another sad thing about being highly paid is the high taxes that come along with it. My bonuses are used to offset my annual income tax.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>

              <p>Actually there are many singaporeans who are pilots or flying instructors overseas. I know of quite a number myself. Their stories? They applied for SIA and did not get through. Are they inferior to the many Msians whom they take in every year? I'm not sure.</p>
              <p>All I can say is those Singaporeans who fell through are the ones who didnt do so well in the interview process. But that doesnt make them any lesser a pilot in terms of skill and determination.</p>
              <p>Some of these Singaporeans fly in Australia, Indonesia, China and Africa. Pretty amazing how their motivation takes them places.</p>
