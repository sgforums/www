              <div class="post-header"></div>
              <p><a href="http://thinkexist.com/quotation/recession_is_when_a_neighbor_loses_his_job/326166.html">A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. </a>Depression has hit me. I have just been retrenched.<br> <br> For many, retrenchment is not just economic depression. It is also 
              emotional depression, self-worth depression and a humiliating 
              depression. For me personally, it is even more embarrassing because I 
              have been known to bring work home and reject invitations to go out and 
              play over the weekend. Perhaps some people are having their last laughs 
              now.<br> <br> Retrenchment leaves a person with plenty of time to think. Don't waste 
              the experience. He needs to be brutally honest with himself. In my case,
               I cannot honestly say it was mainly my fault. It was the free market at
               work, fair and square. I work in the Electronics industry in Singapore.
               Although electronic gadgets(iPhones, e-books, smartphones) are still 
              changing our lives for the better, fellow Singaporeans who work in the 
              same industry will know that electronics has been on the decline for 
              more than a decade. The big companies (foreign MNCs) are moving out, 
              there are no big local companies to take their place and the smaller 
              companies which usually service the big ones are dying away. It is not 
              just high labor cost. Land (especially land), transport and energy costs
               also make us uncompetitive. These are infrastructural costs which the 
              government can do their part to keep low. If these infrastructural costs
               are kept low, then our wages can have more room to move up without 
              hitting our competitiveness.<br> <br> If the company cannot grow, my immediate supervisor cannot be promoted. 
              If he cannot be promoted, how can I be promoted? This time round, 
              everyone lost their jobs including my boss. One consolation was that I 
              got a "diligent and honest worker" in my appraisal before the 
              retrenchment. Hopefully, this is not just a parting gift just to be 
              nice.<br>   <br> I am tempted to lament on how unfair life is. However, this is useless 
              to me and readers who could not care less until the same thing happens 
              to them. Rather, it is more useful to think about the practical measures
               to cope with retrenchment.<br> <br> The first thing that comes to mind is to cut down on all unnecessary 
              expenses. Unnecessary expenses refer to expenses incurred beyond keeping
               one alive. Eat the simplest, cheapest food. As long as it fills your 
              stomach, it is good food. Try to eat at home. Don't eat out. The rental 
              cost in Singapore is so high, why pay for them by eating at expensive 
              restaurants?<br> <br> Entertainment expenses should be cut mercilessly. I do not subscribe to 
              the theory that good things must come with a price. A lot of good things
               in life can be very cheap or even free of charge. A person can go to 
              the library and borrow wonderful books free of charge. Get entertained 
              and be educated free of charge. There are plenty of quality 
              documentaries on Youtube. Again, one can get entertained and be educated
               free of charge. Use the spare time for learning at low or no cost. <br> <br> There are certain expenses which must not be cut. This is allowance to 
              parents and parents-in-law. The first response from parents is to cut or
               stop their allowance upon learning of their children's retrenchment. I 
              have never heard of parents stop providing for their children when they 
              are out of a job. Therefore, why should children stop providing for 
              their parents when they become jobless? People who stop their parents' 
              allowance are making a gross miscalculation. Their own children will do 
              the same thing to them when they grow up. They will not feel a pang of 
              guilt because their own parents did the same thing to their own parents.
               Setting a good model example to the children is the most effective and 
              yet, least time-consuming way to educate them. Much better than spending
               so much time giving them tuition yourself and yelling at them. They 
              either end up resenting you or hating the subject.<br> <br> The standard advice from government help bodies is to get retraining or 
              some educational certificate to make your resume look good. While these 
              people have good intentions, take their advice with a pinch of salt 
              because you know your personal situation better than them. Is your 
              personality suitable for the type of job you are retraining for? Will 
              employers be willing to hire you even after you have earned a 
              certificate because of certain discriminatory practices? (Age, hire 
              their own kind)<br> <br> I am not willing to invest in higher education to make the resume look 
              good because the education fees is too high today and the investment 
              returns do not look good. Too many people with higher education but are 
              there enough jobs requiring such higher education? In fact, after 
              spending a bomb for that piece of paper, a person may even get 
              discriminated during job interviews because he is overqualified or the 
              interviewer feels threatened. <br> <br> Finding a job is not the only option. One can think about his personal 
              strengths. Think about his hobbies. Can he turn them into useful 
              products/services to sell to people? If one can successfully do this, he
               can be a very happy person instead of slaving for people whom he has 
              been yearning to say "fuck off".<br> <br> Quite a number of retrenched people will be thinking of investing in the
               financial markets to make a living. On the surface, it looks like an 
              easy way out. Psychology plays a very important role in successful 
              investing. Retrenched people should be <strong>self-aware </strong>of their own 
              weakened psychology as market participants. Given the heightened 
              volatility in the financial markets today, weak psychology can lead to 
              bad decisions because it is easier to be tricked by the high volatility 
              to buy high and sell low given the weaker state of mind. Investing is a 
              fun game for me and I am reasonably good at controlling my losses in 
              terrible times. But, I have to take my own advice and be self-aware of 
              my new deficiency from now on.</p>

              <p>hmm.......electronics industry is dyin,.,,,,then means its all going to china and not to rest of undeveloped south east asia thats plagued by red tape and  a myriad of infrastructure problems.</p>
              <p>we all kniow its not going to korea or japan as they have their own korean and japanese indignious designers who do their deisgns to make korea or japan a mark on the map!</p>
              <p>currently spore army with its utter north korean methods on its citizen army reservists isnt going to make a spore a greater place to be in!with the onset of big MNC industries moving out permanently from spore.......spore is virtually stuck with a reservist group who can only pass ippt with silver or gold and have no other engineering design and inventions made by its citizens as that time was taken up by the ippt remedial trainings destroying growth for a future of anything.u cant design a light bulb in 2hrs or 200 hrs!!it took edison 1 month and with a team to finally make a light  bulb the first bulb that worked practically.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so if spore dies...the stupid army played a part in it by not helping much and in time.any army that come after a war with not much weapons and not much of anything  will eventually be reduced to nothingness.if that is their wish,,,,,then amen.</p>

              <p><br>its like gambling when u cant control its losses.one $ lost at  the end of the whole investment is a total waste of time as it garners no profits.if one knows what one is doing then u do  not need to have an investment.u could just setup  a company and see it grow as nothing is hidden from u immediately.if that was the case in all investments.</p>

              <p>Retrenchment happened to my father when he was 50. And he could no longer find another job with the same pay. So he went overseas and contributed to the GDP of two other countries for another good 11 years. I can tell you there are thousands others like my dad who wouldn't settle for less by remaining in sg.</p>
              <p>It's weird here.....u get older, the more worthless you are. One can think of adjunct teachers from MOE who have "gotten on in age" and are asked to downgrade to contracts with much lower pay.</p>
              <p>Old is gold. Old does not mean useless. These are the very seniors who train the younger generation to take over the reins.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone,<br><br>I am the writer of the article <a href="http://help-your-money.blogspot.com/2011/12/retrenchment-hits-me.html">http://help-your-money.blogspot.com/2011/12/retrenchment-hits-me.html </a></p>
              <p>I am quite surprised that someone would pick up on my retrenchment post and post it on this forum.<br><br>While retrenchment is a depressing thing, it need not end badly. It gives a person plenty of time to step back and think and who knows what useful thing will come out of it? I work in an industry with poor prospects. When a person works diligently but still ends up with a failure outcome and he is surrounded by people suffering the same fate, he is probably in the wrong place. When you know you are in the wrong place at the wrong time, getting kicked out of it cannot be too bad a thing :) <br><br>This is not the first time I am retrenched. Speaking from experience, my advice to those who have never been retrenched is to keep an emergency cash reserve to prepare for this event, particularly those working in the tech sector where things change at a very fast pace. With a strong cash reserve, at least one can continue to meet family obligations during the down period.</p>
