              <p><br>u  might think i might have mistakened but i have seen a chinese guy .i think he is from malaysia.he works at the local shopping mall for years.first time i saw him working at a big department store as a salesman themn later on i saw him at some electronics store...and then a book store and then back to the big department store again.all differnt stores in the same shopping centre in a few years.</p>
              <p>seems like they are treating him like a football.i would say the chinese malaysian man would have gone insane with the type of treatment by treating him like a football after all these years.</p>
              <p>at first glance,i would think people are telling him that they dont like his face.Or they dislike his presence working with them so they "throw " him away to other places or turn him into a multipurpose man for all the 50 stores in the shopping mall.whats their purpose??to show every asian that they would be treated similiarly if they arent comfortable with you??i would say no no one would run off to another work area when he is comfortable with one.but appears like they made it very uncomfortable for him n throw him store to  store.</p>
              <p>sounds and looks like some sort of racial discrimination looking at it from afar.</p>

              <p>and mind you,those people who immigrated to australia today must either have 10 years of skills,degree,high spoken english ability and highly skilled.oz gov dun accept just any one.there is one,which is under the butcher status where oz gov made agreement with all the abbatoirs in oz.those kinda jobs are usually meant for vietnamese meat seller illiterates with pri 2 standard english.they cant even pronounce fuck properly...fuck=puck.</p>
              <p>other than that,the people generally coming as immigrants or professionals usually are highly skilled with degree software,highly advanced manufacturing,or simply if they like what u were doing based on god knows what reasons.</p>
