              <p>i am facing the same problem as one of the members who posted sometime about getting sued for breach of employment contract.</p>
              <p>right now, i m in a fix and cannot move on</p>
              <p>i applied for an office administrator position and my employment contract stated office manager, i pointed out to the lady at the firm, she said the same what.</p>
              <p>when i reported for work, she asked me for my ic which i don't carry with me, i went home to get and she asked me to photocopy from home.</p>
              <p>during interview i said i prefer 5 days week, she said okay. contract stated i have to work on sat. i pointed to her, she said if need to take sat off, just apply leave, i have 20 days of annual leave and how many days will i have left. she said in that case, never mind. for both points she did not amend.</p>
              <p>the print on the contract is very small and the lights were very dim in her room, she shoved the contract to me seated in front of her to read and sign.</p>
              <p>it stated i cannot take leave on mon, fri and eve ph.</p>
              <p>salary will be paid in arrears monthly.</p>
              <p>the worst part is 14 WEEKS notice period.  I just could not open my mouth to ask her on the notice period part, and i did not know y too. i just sgned.</p>
              <p>the lady did not sign on the contract and it was my signature.</p>
              <p>i worked half a day on that day.</p>
              <p>I just felt so uneasy after that half day.</p>
              <p>I wonder who is my real employer cos there was another elderly lady who dd sewing in the sewing room.  There was no desk for me, i was asked to sit in the sewing room which has one chair and there was a computer too, i was asked to search and look for electrician.  They wanted to charge for transport to come and view the place but the lady refused to pay and i was scolded by them because of her.</p>
              <p>I was told not to put through all incoming calls to her but to take down messages in a book. there were vendors looking for payment and she did not return calls at all. is she escaping from vendors? if she is, it also means i will not get paid on time each month.</p>
              <p>i went to mom to see the advisory officer early ytd mng, it was useless,they could not do anything cos i signed the contract.</p>
              <p>ytd, the company emailed me to ask for $6,300! i m jobless at the moment, my hubby is retired and i have school going kids.  the intent to cheat is obviously very evident.</p>
              <p>i m losing sleep and appetite after the half day i worked.  what is coming by my way, next? letter of demand from them.</p>
              <p>if she is open for discussion, i would have discussed with her, she has a stature that i m not open for discussion.</p>
              <p>i am writing this cos i want to share my bad experience.</p>
              <p>i cannot move on, and best is MOM is not helping with this issue.</p>

              <p>ministry of manpower doesnt really help much,they would tell u to get your own lawyers as your pay is above $800 according to the old rule book which is found at popular bookstore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u werked for 1 day and they demanded $10,000?this is cheating and a con job on their part.there was one case where a teenage girl back in year 2001 got same thing in spore.she only worked for 1 week and left and cd simply asked the compoany sued her for $1mil.at the court the judge dismissed the company and only asked the girl to pay $ for the company employment ads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im sure the manpower laws in spore are there in the employment booklet on employee leaving company in  less than 1 week upon commencement of job.its under the back or front page.please go get the booklet thats sold in popular bookstore.im sure it would put your mind at ease and the demands of u from compoany is rubbish at most if it contrevenes the manpower laws.</p>

              <p>u lucky the rulebook states u have the right to leave and need not pay in lieu after a day or so.</p>
              <p>doesnt matter if employment letter is written or not....even if they stated the correct poition and working hours...they can still play dirty.but best if its stated in the documents unless u were desperate..the main thing is that the rules were not broken by u!then u do not need to pay .last time i checked many years ago,cases like u could leave the company as u were not even a week or a month there and dont need to pay.</p>

              <p>@Army 21, thank you so much for your posts, it has been very helpful for me. i will go and get a copy of the manpower rulebook guide booklet later when it opens and hope the book is still available for sale.</p>
              <h6><span style="font-weight: normal;">I read on MOM's website and TAFEP that an employmnet contract has to be signed by both the employer and employee on two copies and one copy to be given to each party.There was NO endorsement from her. My friends kept assuring me that it is NOT valid.and the email to demand $6,300 from me is her way to scare and threaten me.  I believe many unsuspecting applicants may have fallen to this ruse.  I pity the lady who is still working there for her. wish i can help her to get out of that dreadful place.</span></h6>
