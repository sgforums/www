              <p>I have though of a few reasons to give when companies ask ou why you are levaing your previous job.</p>
              <p>1. My boss is a gay/lesbian and he/she is always sexually harrasing me so I decided to quit</p>
              <p>2. I am too important in the company. I know everything in the company. Whenever my medicore collegues have any problems and they can't solve it my boss will have to call me to coem down to office to help them even though I am on mc/leave/off day.</p>
              <p>Thus, because I am so important in the company, I need to be on 24 hours standy as all my collegues are useless people who need me to help them. Thus, I have no life in the company so I decided to resign and find another job.</p>
              <p>3. I am so handsome/pretty that my boss likes me and we got into a relationship. After that we broke up and I resigned because its very awakard to see each other in the office everyday.</p>
              <p>4. The company want to cut cost and so retrechn me and employ a foreign worker.</p>
              <p>5. The company have financial problem always pay salary late. I don't feel safe so decide to resign</p>
              <p>6. The company don't want to pay me cpf money. They record me as a temp staff so that even if I complain to CPF, they can say that they don't pay cpf contribution to temp staff.</p>
              <p>7. The boss told me during the interview taht I will be given $200 increment after my probation. After the probation is over and I became a perm staff, he did not give me the $200 increment.</p>
              <p>Thus, he cannot be trusted. I don't feel safe working for such a boss</p>
              <p>So I decided to resign</p>
              <p>How you find all these reasons?</p>

              <p>ya great power come great responsibility but still receiving low pay thats why I am resigning.</p>
              <p>Seems like a good reason to give.</p>
              <p>In fact, all 7 points that i mentioned are all fake reasons and I think all of them are good to give espically if you have worked in the company for a short time only like 3 months</p>

              <p>I suppose they did not check your resume that is why you got 3 job offers? because if they check and found that you are lieing they wouldn't want to employ you. lol</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>never say badly about ur past employments even though it truly sux. if you got to know something about the company, e.g. staff benefits, career prospect then say something that is present in their company and u're looking for it. e.g. this mbs that i'm going through calls up my two previous jobs with referee and asked the reason why i resign, so good luck</p></div>
