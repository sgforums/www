            <div class='col-md body'>Just to let those interested in dental assistant job know that you do not have to be a qualified nurse to do the job....but of course you have to attend for the dental assistant course to be qualified for that position. If you are a nurse, that is an added advantage because you already know the SOP of health industry. However, as a nurse...I think you should also need to attend that dental assistant course to know the dental surgical tools and equipment better...it is like a scrub nurse knowing the surgical tools and equipment while assisting the surgeon in the operating room. To my knowledge, you will be working in the clinic and also sometimes in the operating room of a medical centre or hospital.</div>

If you have a degree and lose your job before after 50, you many never be fully employed again.
