              JOBS IN USA
              
              A JOB IN U.S.A.
              
              Many people who live in other countries want to work in the United States for many reasons. One reason is to earn more money and have better employment opportunities. Another reason is to know more about the country and the cultural variations. One more reason is to learn the city to move permanently one day and become a citizen. However, before considering this life change, there are a few things foreigners can do to better their chances in the USA.
              
              One issue is the language skills. Ahead of time, polish your English, so you can communicate better and compete with other applicants that manage the language or have better communication skills. Another important issue is to have all your documents ready, depending on what country you are coming from â€“ green card, visa. Contact the embassy for more information.
              
              Have clear in your mind what type of job or career you want to pursue. If you want to be a restaurant manager, but do not have much experience in the USA market, then you may have to start in a lower position, and work your way up. So map out a plan that you can follow once you get to the USA. Depending on the type of job you are trying to get, learn and study the customs of the area, and local points of interest. Learn how to navigate through the area and the most popular places. Today, if you have access to the internet, this is easier than ever, as there is a lot of information available.
              
              Polish your interview skills. You may be interviewed by phone or in person, even over long distance, so you want to make the best impression possible since the interviewer may only have your voice, communication skills, and background work as a reference and cannot see you, unless you are interviewing through a computer or smart phone.
              
              Research salary offerings for the position you are applying for so you know how much it pays, when it is time to negotiate your salary and compensation. Depending on the area you will live and work, salaries vary, paying much less in rural areas than in the city.
              
              Secure a place to live, and calculate what your living expenses will be. Be realistic about this number, as it may surprise you. Many Americans are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, so donâ€™t let that factor discourage you or opaque your dreams and goals. Focus on your future and plug in into the working system. If you assimilate into the culture, it will become much easier for you.
              
              In addition, consider sponsorship, and be open with your future employer from the beginning. If she/he sees a lot of drive, determination, and honesty in you, this will work to your advantage and you may be getting the job after all, despite other applicants. The most important thing is that you can show how much you can offer the company and the skills that you have. In addition to that, learn as much as you can about the company you want to work for and its history. This always works in your favor, as many times, applicants forget about this important step.

              MOVING TO HAWAII TO LIVE AND WORK
              
              If youâ€™re a foreign national who longs to live in Hawaii, there are several ways you can make that happen, even without a green card (permanent resident status). Some visas are much easier to get than others, and the type you get will determine how long youâ€™ll be able to reside legally in Hawaii and if youâ€™ll be allowed to get a job during your stay.
              
              Visitor Visa
              
              A visitor visa is probably the easiest type of visa to get, and if youâ€™re coming from one of the 35 countries that participates in the Visa Waiver Program, you wonâ€™t need a visa at all â€” just pack your bags, grab your passport, and come to Hawaii.
              
              Hereâ€™s the catch: The longest youâ€™ll be able to stay in Hawaii is three months, and you wonâ€™t be able to work if youâ€™re on the B-2 (â€œtouristâ€�) visa.
              
              Student Visa
              
              Another visa thatâ€™s fairly easy to get is a student visa. To be eligible, you must enroll in an approved school and take at least 18 hours per week of coursework. When you apply for a student visa, you can also apply for a separate but related visa that will allow you to bring your spouse and children with you to Hawaii. Once you receive your visa, youâ€™ll be allowed to remain in Hawaii until your approved course of study is finished.
              
              Exchange Visitor Visa
              
              Exchange visitor visas are designed to allow people from all over the world to share their culture and knowledge with other countries. To obtain this type of visa, you must be accepted into a certified Student and Exchange Visitor Program.
              
              The programs are administered by institutions across the globe, some of which are in Hawaii. However, just because you are accepted into a program doesnâ€™t mean you will be assigned to the location in Hawaii.
              
              Like the student visa, the exchange visitor visa allows your spouse and children to accompany you to Hawaii on a related visa. You are allowed to remain in Hawaii for the duration of your exchange program.
              
              Temporary Worker Visa
              
              Temporary worker visas can be more difficult to get than the previously discussed visas, because they require a prospective employer to file a petition on your behalf. That petition must then be approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services before you can even apply for the visa.
              
              The payoff for jumping through these hoops is that youâ€™ll be allowed to earn money during your stay in Hawaii, which will last as long as you work for your sponsoring employer.
              
              Immigrant Visa (Green Card)
              
              Immigrant visas â€” also known as green cards â€” are the hardest to get. But once you have one, you can reside in Hawaii permanently and change jobs whenever you like. In most cases, to apply for a green card, you must be sponsored by a prospective employer or a family member who is a U.S. citizen or green-card holder.
              
              Roughly 140,000 employment-based green cards are granted each year. The five categories of workers who are eligible to apply are (in order of preference):
              
              1.   Those with national or international acclaim in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics; internationally recognized professors and researchers; and multinational managers or executives.
              
              2.   Professionals holding a post-baccalaureate degree or a baccalaureate degree plus five years of experience in their profession; and people with extraordinary abilities in the sciences, arts, or business.
              
              3.   Skilled workers in jobs requiring two years of training or work experience; professionals in jobs requiring at least a baccalaureate degree; and unskilled workers in jobs requiring less than two years of training or work experience.
              
              4.   Certain special immigrants, including broadcasters, religious workers, physicians, Armed Forces members, Iraqi/Afghan translators, and more.
              
              5.   People who invest $500,000-$1 million (depending on the unemployment rate in the geographic area) in a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for U.S. workers, not including the investor and their family.
              
              Green cards can also be sponsored by certain family members. Those eligible for family-based green cards are (in order of preference):
              
              1.   Spouses, unmarried children under 21, adopted orphans, and parents of a U.S. citizen. If you are a parent of a U.S. citizen, your child must be at least 21 years old to sponsor you.
              
              2.   Unmarried children age 21 and over â€” and any of their own minor children â€” of a U.S. citizen.
              
              3.   Spouses, minor children, and unmarried children age 21 and over of green-card holders.
              
              4.   Married children and their spouses and own minor children of a U.S. citizen.
              
              5.   Siblings â€” and their spouses and minor children â€” of a U.S. citizen age 21 and over.
              
              Because there are more qualified applicants than available green cards per year (except for the first-preference category, which doesnâ€™t have an annual limit), most family-based green-card applicants must wait for years until itâ€™s their turn (based on the date they filed their application) to get the next available green card in their category.
