              <p><br>Its obvious, that Kirstovorus didnt feel its unfair if he cannot work fast or pick up things fast during his probation period and he gets sacked.</p>
              <p>If you cannot pick up the pace, you are either not interested in the job, not willing to learn the job and not enjoying your job.  Stay for what?</p>

              <p>1. You do work very slow. I can do the work myself which is faster or employ someone who can do the work faster than you. So I am going to sack you.</p>
              <p>2. You make mistakes. Although it is not serious mistakes and not much mistakes too, but I need to check your work after you finish it. In that case it is better for me to do the work myself. So I am going to sack you.</p>
              <p>3. You learn things very slow. I want to sack you and employ a fast learner.</p>
              <p>These are some of the lame reasons that I heard before that is used by the company to sack a staff.</p>

              <p>Nope your company got one written procedure but eveyone do their own things any say anything nice to hear can he or she is right. so even if you follow the procedure suka suak everyday just say this is wrong that is right, no that is right now this is wrong then . kanabey join new company have to hehehe smile greet good morning to every one including the guard's dog everyday buay sian arh? everydae smoke smoke people die not because cancer cannot cure but is after treatment still smoke cancer will never go away. i learn things but people keep changing policies, proceudres, the thing sthey say and taught i doubt even trie because its not how that's to be done.</p>
              <p>don't be so naive lah, you can do a zillion right things and be sacked while and people can do a zillion wrong things and still keep job be laojiao lanjiao</p>

              <p>I think even within the 3 month probabtion period, those reasons are perfectly valid for a staff to be sacked. I mean after working for 2months plus, you still don't know how to do basic stuff? Then you must be quite crappy or working with no interest in the job.</p>

              <p>from what i see usually the probabtion period is more for employee to fit in adapt to the work environment. probabtion can be extended and employees (good ones) will usually call employee in and review the problems with them if the boss see potential in developing the worker even if he cannot pick up fast. do the same thing over and over you tell me no one can perform faster or more constant?</p>
