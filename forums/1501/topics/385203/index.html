              <p>1. You do work very slow. I can do the work myself which is faster or employ someone who can do the work faster than you. So I am going to sack you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. You make mistakes. Although it is not serious mistakes and not much mistakes too, but I need to check your work after you finish it. In that case it is better for me to do the work myself. So I am going to sack you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. You learn things very slow. I want to sack you and employ a fast learner.</p>

              <p>These are some of the lame reasons that I heard before that is used by the company to sack a staff.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Let me explain why the 3 reasons are lame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. When a new staff join in the company, he/she is not familar with the work so it is natural that he/she does the work slow. Once he/she is familar with the work, than he/she will be able to do the work fast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So to sack a new staff who do work slow is lame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. When a new staff comes in to work, he/she is not familar with the work so it is natural that he/she makes mistakes. Once he/she is familar with the work, than he/she will not make mistakes anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, who doesn't make mistakes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To sack a staff because he/she makes mistakes is lame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Same as point 1. A new staff who is not familar with the work will learn things slow. This is very natural.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To sack a new staff for learning slow is lame</p>

              <p><br>That person is still doing his/her job. Just that because he/she is a new staff he/she does work slow, learn things slow, make mistakes etc.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>So.. how  "new" is new? 1 month? 3 months? After a certain time frame and there is still little/no improvement, is the company allowed to sack the under-performing employee now?</p>
                  <p>Its completely ridiculous to assume that the employee have the right to surf facebook/the net while working. The company is <strong>paying</strong> you money for your time, so they <strong>own</strong> your time completely under the conditions stiputated in your contract.</p>

                  <p>So the company is expected to spend money to craft the workplace into an idiot-proof environment where the employees are forced to do exactly what they're employed for? Where are the extra funds going to come from, deducted from the employee's pay?</p>

                  <br><br>So some employers have the habit for firing unfriendly employees. How unfortunate for the employee. It is within the employer's prerogative to do that, especially if the employee has to deal with customers.

                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Lets face it. If a person doesn't smile, he'll look unfriendly and sullen. Nobody likes to buy something from such a person.</p>
                  <p>You may think that its unfair to sack an employee within the 3 months probation since the employee is not ' given enough time to shine '. However 3 months is a very long time, enough to clear show that the person is not suited for the job. Part-time employees in event/roadshows etc are given learning curves of mere hours and you don't see them screwing up as much. The probation period is meant to weed out undesirable employees, or else whats the point of "probation"</p>

              <p>So judging from Kristovorus post, I can say that he will not feel that it is unfair if he get sacks during the 3 months probation if he does work slow, learn things slow etc.</p>

              I fully agree to the injustice done to staff in 3-months probation for working slow and trying to make them work as if they are working in the new office for 3 years.
              
              I have been removed from my last office due to the same reason. sighzzz

              <p>i encounter many such scenes very funny.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(1) the china man supervisor say you go in do this. so the chap also go in and do as told. then the china sup say did you do it. the guy really did as told then the sup just twist around say he never do. in the sack letter never mention details just say failure to complile. the HR never give a report on the details, just say a few sentence like that. then at the coffee tshop and around company can cook a lot of disjhes on what happened but still non documented on details of how the employee fail to comply</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(2) another case the superior see the report then always ask why why why anymore anymore anymore details when the report clearly states everything. tell you change this change that then change everything back again. then ask why this why that and say oh i cannot work with you. "i resign lah bloody hell" the employee did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but really no point in those cases. that gu can do for a while without job but the chinas and the whywhy men they can't, not a day without job to finance the condonminium and they punick employment passes</p>
