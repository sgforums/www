              <p>They bring a lot of foreigners in, give them jobs and dilute the unemployment rates of "residents". Residents consist of Sgporeans and PRs. So there u go, a lot of Sgporeans still unemployed, if you check WDA and CDC figures but the rate still goes down because a lot of new residents find jobs.</p>
              <p>Try digesting that and let me know if you need more help.</p>

              <p>Basically, there are 3 groups of local workers here,</p>
              <p>1. the younger workers who are mostly PMEs</p>
              <p>2. the middle age workers, a mix of PMEs and lower wage workers</p>
              <p>3. the older workers, mostly from the 70s and 80s generation, not very well literated and their mind are mostly set, not flexible.</p>
              <p>1. Young workers today are mostly tertiary graduates from Poly or U, or at lease some former specialise training and certification, this group, being young, is current head hunted vigorously at the present tight market condition. No problem for them.</p>
              <p>2. The middle age workers are in two parts, one being matured and were successful in their career leading to them climbing up the corporate ladders all the way up to CEOs, MDs or GMs, for them, you dun hv to worry, most had already attained their 5 or 6 Cs. The worrying part are those who, after years of working but are still trolling along the lower wage precinct, the govt encouraged them to upgrade, re-skill, re-eduacate, or pick up another skill as buffer to their current jobs. And all these courses are almost free for those 40s and above, from IT to Bartender to tour guide etc etc..for them, there is no way out, as employers preferred new and young blood like me, these group of aunties and uncles must upgrade themselves, contribute their experiences and know how to the organisation they work in, and to do that, they must know how the new way of working, things like IT and processes are different in comparing to 90s and 80s kind of working style.</p>
              <p>As for those 50s or 55 and above, we also hv to take care of them, cos these group are growing bigger and bigger by the years, if nothing is done to help them, it will be a big problem, govt sectors should redesign jobs and pay structure to cater to these group, and govt should urge private sectors to redesign jobs for oldies who are still able to work with lots of experiences. However, these group of peoples hv mental problems, most are stubborn, high medical cost/leaves and reluctant to accept changes, so it will be an uphill task for the both the govt and the private sector to realign their organisation to cater for these group of peoples, as the saying goes, old is no fun, nobody likes to grow old and certainly, nobody would like to employ a old worker, but as our society ages with longer living, we must provide the relevant income for oldies, re-skill and re educating them who never attract them, the other way is to change jobs for them if they are working in labour intensive industrial, to a lower mental and physical stress industrial.    </p>

              <p>The government introduced a brilliant way to reduce employment by allowing more unskilled migrants to get permanent residence. By doing so wages were lowered and thus the company could better afford more workers hence lesser unemployment.</p>

              <p>The govt has also reduced corporate tax a few years back so as to 
              attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) such as MNCs to set up 
              factories here. This creates a lot of jobs and helps to boost the Gross 
              Domestic Product (GDP) of the country. However, by doing so, the GST is 
              raised from 5 to 7% so as to recover the losses caused by the drop in 
              corporate tax, Presence of MNCs in our country also makes Singapore a 
              hunting ground for cheap labour among first world nations, thereby this 
              stagnation of salaries among the lower to middle income classes.</p>
              <p>The
               govt also gives jobs by creating a lot of statutory boards and having 
              thick chains of commands, otherwise known as bureaucracy. On a plus 
              point, Singaporeans will have a lot of areas of the country well managed
               but the downside is, to get some matters done requires one to pass 
              through a lot of channels and hence, wastes time.</p>
              <p>Of course the 
              govt has also tried creating jobs via the 2 casinos, universal studios 
              etc.....Integrated Resort in short. The plus side is many Singaporeans 
              have found jobs but a visit to the casinos on weekends reveals 
              otherwise. The presence of foreign workers are very prominent there.</p>
