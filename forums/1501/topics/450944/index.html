            <div class='col-md body'><p>hi, recently i have been rejected by every single uniformed group in the hometeam for my application as their respective senior officer position.<br><br>i wish to know the reasons behind but all i got was that information is classified,<br>except for SPF, i was never even given an oppotunity for invitation to any other selection accessment.<br><br>i do not have any physical disailities, was active in CCA, sports, and have a few awards, along with half year of work experience in managerial related scopes since my graduation, all along having many other partime experience in various fields of exposure.<br><br>though i was not told, but i am pretty sure me, my family and relative side has a clear record from the law with no outstanding issues.<br>the only reason i could think of as rejection was the fact that i only got a 2nd lower honors from SIM UOL.<br><br>thus i hope for advices here as to whether i should carry on the small hope of trying for home team (which is my dream), or accept the fact that Home Team will only internally regonise NUS and NTU 1st class as formal applicants of senior officer positions?<br><br>is my timing of application just wrong? or is there actually existing senior officers of the home team that actually holds a non NTU NUS degree?<br>thanks for advice..</p></div>

              <p>I heard of someone telling me they had a officer from uniSIM.</p>
              <p>Having said that, i strongly believe they always give priority to NTU,NUS grads.</p>
              <p>So yea.. Hard luck.</p>
              <p>my wild guess would be, maybe they don't accept long distance learning like UOL,RMIT.</p>
              <p>But local private uni like UniSIM might have a chance.</p>
              <p>You can look for the Senior Officer thread where a couple of them are from UniSIM was called up for further interview.</p>

              Hi,
              
              May i know what your PES status is and your rank during NS?
              
              I'm also very interested to join the home team as a senior officer. I'm doing a UOL BnF degree at SIM (Yes still doing. In fact while I'm typing this I'm studying for my final 2 papers next week. Am I being too kiasu?Haha...). Anyway, I've actually already applied for  Prisons, ICA and SPF. Prisons has asked me to email them my academic results so i promptly emailed them my O-level, A-Level and 1st 2 years results for my degree, which im sad to say is pretty horrible (I can only at most get a 3rd class). Within a few days I got a rejection email. ICA and SPF have not gotten back to me yet.
              
              I don't know if I sending my application too early. But I just applied anyway, and a few other jobs as well coz I don't wanna wait till the results come out before i apply for anything. My CCA records are pretty impressive too, if I can say so myself. And I was a Sgt during my NS days in the army and im PES A. 
              
              Ok I don't know why I typed so much when I just wanted to ask those 2 qns above. Haha... Thanks in advance for replying.
