              <p>I'm not happy with my current job and so I have been looking out for job opportunities.</p>
              <p>Some days ago I chanced upon this job ad which I thought was an exact fit. But as a I read on and digested the ad I realised it was an advert of my job! The description was right on, the internal organisations mentioned were the exact people I deal with regularly. I am in the same industry put on in the ad, right down to the internal systems published that I operate!</p>
              <p>I find this too much of a coincidence.</p>
              <p>My relation with the boss has been frosty lately, even downward trending. The boss has been been trying to make me take up jobs at offices located at far-flung corners of the island to which I have indicated I'm not keen.</p>
              <p>The boss had set up a meeting appt a week ago and this will take place next week. I am dreading this meeting.</p>
              <p>Has anyone encountered something similar? How did you overcome the entire episode?</p>
              <p>I dun know how I can get thru this torturing long weekend.</p>

              <p><br>This is worrying, stressful.    Do you have any union in your company?  If you have, talk to the leader of the union.   </p>
              <p>There again if the boss decides to take in someone else for your job, you can do nothing about it.   Either you stay on and ask for transfer to other department or quit.   If your boss wants to terminate you, make sure the company pay you salary in lieu of if they don't give you any or sufficient notice.</p>

              <p>Pal, you panic too easily.</p>
              <p>You got to hold on. Don't quit so fast. So what if your boss is really looking for somebody whose job function are similar to yours? Your boss sounds like a very incompetent one because he is not being forthright with you regarding his plans for you in the future.</p>
              <p>Reality is, most bosses are horrible bosses, they have no management, leadership and motivational skills.</p>
              <p>Tell, you how to overcome...build your bunker, pray, hunker in and try your best. If you give up now, he wins. You have to persevere to build your character. You control your own destiny. Don't care about your boss, you are listening to him because he wears that stupid badge to say he is the boss. THat badge can be pass on to anyone else.</p>
              <p>Most boss-staff relationships are frosty before they become cosy. You have to find a way. Quitting is not the solution, trust me.</p>
