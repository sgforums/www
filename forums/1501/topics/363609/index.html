              <p>i am greatly upset by an incident regarding the wrong calculation of my salary by my employer. The company is located at Defu lane 10 and is a reputable pest control company. This is my first job after graduated from poly and might be the first and last job i working.</p>
              <p>That time i apply for the position of admin assistant n went down for their interview, the boss was seems nice and he offered a salary of $1400 for a 3 mth probation period and $1500 upon confirmation. A few days later, his secretary (the boss sis) called mi and i m shortlisted for the job. I told her that this was my first permanent job and asked her to explain abt the contact. she told mi that i am to serve a 2 wk notice upon leaving the company within the probation period, after confirmation will be 1 mth notice. i agreed and signed the contact.</p>
              <p>During this period of working under the company, i m not that satisfied with their environment (toliet is full of files) and my colleagues talk alot of badwords (seems like very unprofessional). Moreover, the boss there also scold lots of badwords towards their technicians and anyhow sack his employee. i was told that as i am still new there, i have to multi--task(whatever things pple cant finish i hav to help), but this is much more different from my job scope which the boss have briefed mi during my interview. Furthermore, i alr work for 1 mth in that company but a proper desk n computer hav not been given. because of all these issues, i tink that i dun hav any prospect in that company n decided to leave.</p>
              <p>i told them that i wanted to leave n i gave my resign letter. They called mi the nx morning n said that i no need to fulfill the 2 wk notices as they want to hire another person. i agreed n was told to collect my salary the following wk.</p>
              <p>i went down n collect but to my horror, they only gave mi $652 instead of $1033(as i got take 4 days no pay leave for my grad ceremony). Even the vesak day public holiday they also must deduce money from my salary as they claimed that i didnt work for the whole of 3 mth. i was very upset n decided to call MOM for help.</p>
              <p>The MOM told mi that there is a miscount in my salary. moreover, the company have previous complaint record in MOM. As they didnt give mi a black and white stated that they don't need mi to serve the 2 wk notice, the MOM might afraid that my company might lie to the court and say that i didnt serve the notice n hav to compensate them $ instead. Thus, i have no enough evidence to get back my salary.</p>
              <p>i tried to contact my company for the black and white last date of my employment but they refused and are very unfriendly. i even told him that i am in financial problem but the idiot boss even shouted at mi and also wanted apology from mi through email. He don't feel any sympathy for mi, even a small sum of money also wan to cheat. i feel unjustified, because of the lack of evidence the companies can go away freely with my hardearned money.</p>
              <p>i really feel hopeless and cried over it again n again. i cant trust any pte ltd company and have rejected one job recently. i really do believe in karma and hope he can get his punishment in hell. hope everyone can know abt this and avoid working for this PEST company.</p>
              <p>anyone encounter such thing b4? pls feel free to share</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Does your boss know that you have made complaint against him at MOM?</p>
              <p>If he still doesn't know, call him up to tell him if he does not pay you the rightful amount of salary, you will make a complain at MOM. See his reaction thereafter</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Make sure that he contributed to your CPF, else wait 2 months then complain to MOM regarding non-payment of CPF.</p>

              <p>You not smart enough, what you should have done is endure till payday, once you take your pay, you immediately resign the next day, don't even give them a letter of resignation.</p>

              <p>Wah. Thats really unlucky of u. But what MOM told u is true. Without anything as black and white to prove that they told u there's no need to serve 2 weeks notice, u are indeed at a disadvantage. I think even if you take up further actions with MOM, I feel you are fighting for a lost cause.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I can think of now is to maybe bring this matter up to the press, make the company feel presurizzed.  Make this thing big news.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But really, it is really bad luck to get such a company. And it's your 1st job ever. o.o</p>

              <p>Well if you continue your thinking and refuse to change yourself to suit the enviroment and expect the enviroment to suit you, too bad.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>why pity them? WHY PITY U, TS, you are just one of these kind of people i mentioned.</p>

              <p>From what u have commented above, i strongly disagree. I believe that it is my right to leave the company, as long as i have gave a 2 wk notice to them. I have the quality to work in a better environment, as mentioned above i have just rejected one company who offer to hire mi. I dare to say that i have committed to this job wholeheartedly, I did nothing here, so i have nothing to be afraid of, whereas those who is out to cheat people money, have to afraid of when they will receive their punishment.</p>
              <p>In my directionary, the basic thing that the employer can provide is a conducive environment, not to mention about the dirty toliet, i have work for one mth but have not been given a proper desk and computer. Ask urself, would u waste ur time working for such company? Maybe u alr wasted half of ur life.</p>
              <p>I can say that u are too baised against the "newbie". Everybody is objective here and pls stop acting like a "old bird". i would NEVER blame my life, fate or myself. I will only blame the evil society. And u are one of them.</p>
              <p>Keep this in mind, no matter how baised u are against the newbie, the "old birds" will eventually be replaced by the newbie. I don't pity myself, cause i knows what is right for mi and what is wrong for mi. I only pity u, who is a selfish, impolite, thoughtless, and well, difficult person.</p>
              <p>I don't think anyone would want to waste their time talking to u, u NEED some time for self reflection.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">First, check your employment letter / agreement, whether during probation period, holidays or medical leaves are paid or un-paid.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Second, you were told that you need to serve 2 weeks notice upon leaving during probation. <span> </span>When they said no need, it implied you might need to pay in lieu of notice. You did not ask and assume they would let you go without serving notice?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">So, from all the deductions such as your 4 days off, holidays, and the 2 weeks of notice, the amount they paid you was about there, right?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Lesson learnt, anything not sure, ASK, do not assume….</span></p>

              <p>Hi TS</p>
              <p>Some of my colleague work for more than 20 yrs also dun have a proper table and computer and mine is a MNC.. toilet is dirty ? then clean it .. who do you expect to clean it ? your boss is it ? .. sorry if I sound harsh .. but I dun blame u ,when I first started work i think like you .. for a SME, every cent count , the boss will scrimp every cent they can .. life is very harsh out there for these SME, that y nowsaday they can only get FT to fill the job</p>
              <p>take it as a life enriching exp.. get a garment job , you will want a proper treatment there .. some GLC will only squeeze you dry in your work .. after sometime you will realise the only one who do not have to do anything are those management staff and get fat pay</p>
              <p> </p>
