              <p>but i'm new to job market and i just want to know usual standards. Also, i know in government pay will correspond according to honors, and if i see correctly so far, can expect starting 2600-3100 depending on which job and what honors. Accurate?</p>
              <p>But i think private sector don't care about your honors, and often must say expected salary. So what's a good minimum?</p>

              <p>1800-2200? that looks like diploma pay lei, like what junyang say.</p>
              <p>most of the jobs that list the pay are looking for diploma holders, and i see it the most common range is like 1400-2000 region. And the 2600-3100 range is i take from seeing threads and websites about DSTA, HASE, or some other govt. job.</p>
              <p>so u mean grads who got jobs in banks, or engineers with some engineer job getting 2.2k only? that is uber-shit pay ley! i hear government best for early pay increase, like 300 a year...then all these private sector, probably must wait 4-5 years to make 3k????</p>

              <p>Singaporean fresh local Grad here, just graduated, but not first class :(</p>
              <p>Stated minimum expected pay of $3500 during interview</p>
              <p>Actual pay given: $3500...</p>
              <p>Government Job</p>
              <p>It actually depends on which industry you are in... and also your luck, because if you know which are the companies that pay higher, you can always look for them first.</p>
              <p>No harm trying to state higher pay expectation, because if they want you and then not able to pay you what you expect, they will let you know, and ask you if you still want the job.</p>
              <p>However, if you state much lower than what they can pay you, then it is obvious that they would not pay you higher than what you state because that is your expected pay afterall.</p>
              <p>However, if you apply for those wulu wulu small companies then you would not expect to get too high a pay also...</p>
              <p>Most importantly is dont sign bonds with the company!!!</p>

              <p>expected salary if really required put $2500 and above, else just put market rate. If they are going to deny you an interview because somebody else is expecting a couple of hundreds dollars less then the company is not worth it.</p>
              <p>I would work on my CV and interview. If both impresses the interviewer, a couple of hundreds wouldn't matter.</p>

              <p>5k for starting lawyer? i dont think so. 4k maybe.</p>
              <p>i think u request 2.2k is ok. 2.8 abit high.. starting pay for grads is not high, but promotion should be quite readily if your performance is good. thats wat i think.</p>

              <p>Mcpng1 please dont take half the ppl here advise here. Most of those who are saying 'wah! 2.2k so high ar??? Go lower go lower' have no freaking clue what they are talking about. Probably never even had the chance to GET a degree thats why can think like that. My friend got some jiapahlang degree from dunno what private uni can still command for a 2.5k starting salary and got it. If you are from local Uni, please dont stoop to the diploma holder's level and ask for some rubbish pay like 2.2k</p>
              <p>However, since you are looking for a job in a sector not relevant to your major/degree then i think 2.6 - 2.9 is fair and fine. Depends on the company mostly. Like someone said up there, if the company wants you, they will pay you. You dont need to lower your standards to get the job. Be truthful, honest in your interviews and most interviewers will be able to appreciate that.</p>
              <p>Lastly, please dont be tempted by the SAF/CD/SPF goverment jobs. Sure, starting salary will be 3k+++ but in a few years, if you compare your pay to your friends in the private sector, you will cry. Trust me. Thats my two cents. Hope it was useful. The halftime break for the Brazil holland match is almost over.</p>

              <p>Mcpng1,</p>
              <p>Im a senior HR professional/ Recruiter working in many different fortune 500 companies in the last few years. Let me summarise. In singapore an industry is normall segregated into 3 classes. The first is those SMCs. These companies are normally local firms which might have a presence in Singapore/ Malaysia. If you are a biz fresh grad starting work in an MNC, the basic pay will defin be 2K -2.2K. U might have exceptions up to 2.3K but no way more than that.</p>
              <p>The second class would be  MNCs. They would pay 2.2K-2.6K depending on the results of the interview and the results of the discussion between HR and the Hiring Manager. In these MNCs, normally results do not count for much unless they took u in on a in house scholarship program.</p>
              <p>The third class of companies would refer to the premium MNCs. These companies are companies like Shell, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Standard Chartered etc. These companies pay well and normally do not hesitate to pay high for graduates with good results as they are very selective with what they look for in the candidate. Standard Chartered for example revealed last yr they only select one out of 80 candidates for each position on average. These r the companies which noone will reject. They are willing to pay 2.5K-3K for graduates with good degrees.</p>
              <p>Do note too that benchmarking for salaries differ in each industry. The industries that pay the best in singapore at this time are the banking and finance industry( 20-30% above average )and the oil and gas industry. Do note too that almost all MNCs do not differentiate between local degrees and overseas degrees. Most companies that differentiate are the local medium size firms or the GLCs . They r the ones u normally they which state " only local degree holders can apply" in their job criteria.</p>
              <p>In addition if you are a degree holder, never quote below 2.2K. This is due to the fact that many shrewd HR staff will negotiate with you as they know fresh graduates are very eager to find a new job for experience. In addition always provide a range of about 200-400 difference. This give u and the HR person more flexibility to negotiate if you are selected for the job. hope this will provide enough info for you</p>

              <p>Above is dated sometime in Nov 2008 and is quite accurate in my opinion because i have friends there.</p>
              <p>What Xan said is correct.</p>
              <p>Premium MNCs do give up to more than 4k. Usually are those MA programmes.</p>
              <p>Cream of crop student going investment banking or consutling can expect pay anywhere from 8k to &gt;10k fresh out of school.</p>
              <p>On the other hand i do have friends drawing 2k but they are very rare and usually with very small SMEs.</p>
              <p>but the average pay is between <strong>2.6 - 3.2</strong> for a fresh grad</p>
              <p>So whoever is saying tt the pay is 1.8 to 2.2 need to keep with the times or perception.</p>
