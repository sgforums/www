              <p>Contrary to the beliefs of most pple, most MNCs do not differentiate between overseas and local degrees with the exception of a few companies. The companies which tend to do it more are the SMCs, GLCs and stat boards. Nowadays even GLCs like NCS, Certis Cisco, Singtel are not that discriminating anymore. The last time i worked in 2 GLCs, everyone in my department was holding an australian overseas degree which they studied locally. And we are not even talking about top aus universities like New South Wales or Western Australia or Monash.</p>
              <p>If you are a university graduate with excellent results and want to get a higher basic, you can apply for a position in the stat board. they grade you according to your results and quality of your honours degree. For example if you have a first class honours degree u be can paid about 3.2K - 3.6K. as compared to a fresh grad with mediocre results which will get bt 2.5K-2.8K. Their starting pay may be higher than the market but their increment is very low if you are not promoted. The average annual increment for an average performer in a stat board if there is no promotion is about only $90 - $120 while an MNCs is willing to pay much more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have interviewed and met up with countless candidates and realised that generally candidates who start off in an MNC tend to achieve success easier or get paid a lot more. This is due to the reason that although many MNCs do not differentiate much between local and overseas degrees, they demand for previous experience in working in a diversified or what we call "MNC' environment where u have exposure to diversity or matrix report environment. Thus if you are offered higher pay in a small local firm or a slightly lower pay in an MNC, always take up the option by the MNC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want to venture into banking as mentioned by MCpng1, you would definitely want to venture into private banking rather than consumer banking. The discrepency is huge. Investment banks like Merill Lynch and Morgan Stanley pay over the odds for grads with the attributes and academic results that they r looking at. What nox mentioned above is extremely true. You can be paid more than 7K a month after training as a Fund Manager for example even though u do not have much experience. However the stress is tremendous and you need to work something like 12 hours a day. In a consumer bank such as Citibank, you could start off in a corporate function or a financial consultant / relationship manager position ( depending on their observation of your traits during your training period ). The starting pay would be more subtle like 2K plus. Of cos for sales positions you get paid commission too. You may not have such a chance again</p>

              <p>It seems that a degree holder joining a SME is courting doom then? 2000-2300 salary and not "MNC environment", also probably not going to receive much pay increases. Unfortunately, it feels like it's otherwise impossible to get my foot through the door in a particular industry when my major is unrelated. Guess that will be a tough choice.</p>
              <p>What are your perspectives of joining the public sector first for a few years then changing out to private? Seems like a lot of people do this, but I wonder if it's because it's a good plan, or because they landed a job in public sector and later found some negative reasons causing them to want to leave?</p>

              <p>I would say most people join SME as a temp. solution and jump ship when opportunity arises. Hey at least that beats bumming around at home. But some do stay on at SMEs for various reasons such as love for the job, good environment or unwilling to uproot from comfort zone blah...</p>
              <p>As for switching industry... you have to ask yourself why do you want to switch industry. Are there no major players in your industry? I would say that a grad degree specialized or not is still quite a generalize degree.</p>
              <p>For example engineers are train to be analytical so a lot of companys want engineers for their analytical skills. Hence, you can hear engineers going to banks and other stuff.</p>
              <p>So then u ask what differentiates a degree holder from another one. it will be their cca their volunteer work internships. For example engineers that made it to banks always have a good portfolio of ccas and internships at banks and of cos good results ie cumlaude/2nd upper and above. SO you have to ask yourself do you have these qualities that huge MNCs are looking for. If you have then i would say it will be relatively easier to ace those interviews.</p>
              <p>Again joininig public sector first is akin to joing SME first. The general concensus is do whatever job you have first and evaluate your options later. your fresh grad status "expires" in 18months so within this time you still can "market" yourself as fresh grad.<br>So its not uncommon to hear fresh grads in SME, public sector or mnc jumping ship regularly. But do not do it too often as it will reflect badly in your resume.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps... btw i have yet to know what degree and uni u are from.. i believe i can better advise if i have availabe these information</p>

              <p>As what nox mentioned, there is no right or wrong in preferring to join MNC or SMCs. U will definitely get more exposure and money in an MNC but yr role may be more rigid due to the matrix structure and strict conformance to your JD. In an SMC, your role may be more flexible and you might have more time and autonomy although u get less pay. It depends on what you want in life.</p>
              <p>Joining public sector as a first step is a credible option. But working many years in the public sector is not. It depends on the job scope too. For example if you work as an army regular in Mindef for 8 years what are you going to do when you leave the force? Your pay will definitely not be as high as what you are getting in Mindef. If  you work in a relevant job in the public sector for about 2 years initially and the job utilises your academic specialisation or what you want, then it would be different as this would count towards essential or relevant experience.</p>
              <p>As for CCA being taken into account by organizations during interviews, actually virtually no company takes that into account when they are sourcing for talent with experience. This may be used only as a gauge when they r sourcing for trainees ( fresh grads ).</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>hello everyone,</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>I'm Mabel, an undergraduate from a local university. I see all of you discussing about jobs here, I thought I could offer an alternative form of income to all of you. =)I recently came across Stephen Pierce's site and saw his offer for his free book. Though a tad comprehensive at first, I signed up for it. I mean, it's free anyway, right?</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>All I had to do was to pay up for the shipping fees which add up to only USD$14.22. After that, the website will prompt you to order a one month free trial Stephen Pierce's MRMI SuperCash System program for only 1 buck! And you can use the program immediately after registering.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>I've been in this program for a month now and I am rather impressed by what they offer, hence, I'm sharing this great deal with other Singaporeans. In this program, I had access to tutorials on how to make money on the internet, step-by-step video and audio tutorials on different internet marketing strategies and resources required are provided as well! Moreover, a forum is available for all members to interact - comment on their success, ask questions when in doubt, etc. In fact, I tried asking a few questions before and I was amazed at the efficiency and willingness of other members to share their experiences.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>You may ask, if it's so easy to make money, then everyone can just shake leg and make money with just clicks of their hands! Yes, I believe that's true. But you need to be determined and make an effort too! First, you must trust that this is not a scam and make the first move (I had my own doubts as well at first). Then, you must be willing to spend time making your internet marketing dream come true.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>I am only 22 years old, a student, and made my first online marketing affiliate website! Please visit <a href="http://www.thestephenpiercefreebook.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.thestephenpiercefreebook.com</span></span></a> to take a look! If you are not willing to spend money on the shipping fees, you can try out the <strong><a href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?Clk=3853867"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">$1 MRMI SuperCash system</span></span></a></strong> first.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Stephen Pierce appeared in many news channels, including our own Channel News Asia. There are many credible testimonials in this websites as well. Even for those who give up halfway, you get to learn more about internet marketing, affiliate programs, autoblogging, PLR sites, turn key programs, etc. That's all that I learnt in just 4 weeks! And mind you, I'm on a vacation job and busy with school stuff at the same time. So if i can, so can you!</span></p>
