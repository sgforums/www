              <h3 class="post-title">The Truth about Jobs, Jobs, Jobs....</h3>
              <p>In this posting, I'll tell you why the PAP will never ever establish a minimum wage.<br><br>In
              this recession, the US unemployment rate soared to 9.4%....and
              Singapore's resident unemployment rate is 4.9%. These unemployment
              numbers are however not an apples to apples comparison. Before I drill
              into the numbers lets start with a story.<br><br>In the 1980s
              recession, one of my seniors who was about to ORD took leave to attend
              an job interview. He was a poly graduate. A few days later he received
              the job offer but instead of looking happy, he had this frown on his
              face. "I can't believe it but the pay is $400 a month!", he said.
              Before the recession, people with his qualifications were paid $750 a
              month. He took the job anyway because he couldn't get another one. At
              that time, it was possible for a single person to live on $400 a month.
              The moral of the story is there is almost always a job available when
              you are willing to accept any pay. If you're willing to work for free,
              send me a mail and I'll get you a job and you don't have to be
              unemployed. It is completely meaningless to talk about employment level
              alone without talking about wages. When you compare the umemployment
              rate of a country with minimum wages with one without a minimum wage,
              you're not comparing apples to apples.<br><br>The minimum wage in the
              US depends on where you live but the average is US$7 per hour. If a
              person works full time, say 8-6pm every weekday, the month salary is
              US$1400 or S$2000.<br><br>The bottom 10 lowest paying jobs in Singapore are:<br><br>Lowest paid jobs*<br><br>1. Office cleaner $600<br>2. Manufacturing labourer and related worker $760<br>3. Kitchen assistant $991<br>4. Plastic product machine operator $994<br>5. Hospital attendant $1,000<br>6. Travel agency and related clerk $1,016<br>7. Waiter $1,080<br>8. Pre-primary education teachers $1,100<br>9. Lorry attendant $1,102<br>10. Pest exterminator $1,106<br>* Based on median starting salary ...data from The New Paper.<br><br>See
              Obama has a more difficult task creating jobs in his economy because of
              the minimum wage - he has to create jobs that pay better than the
              minimum wage. All our leaders need to do to get the unemployment rate
              down is to tell the people not to be 'fussy' about salary. In other
              words, you can say Singaporeans always have employment as it is just a
              matter of accepting whatever pay that is offered.<br><br>However, what
              good is a job if you do make enough to feed your family? If our
              economic system is equitable, a person working full time should be able
              to raise a family, afford a home have and all the basic necessities.
              When you have people working full time and not able to make ends meet,
              you have poverty. To make sure people are paid decent salaries, many
              developed countries set a minimum wage.<br></p>
              <p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357922297519875842" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; width: 380px; height: 314px; text-align: center;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Slsp8S3RJwI/AAAAAAAAA3s/CLm2UVgAwwM/s400/380px-Wage_labour_svg.png" border="0" alt="">The
              frequently cited problem with a minimum wage is that it will result in
              higher unemployment. The above graph illustrates the problem. The way
              to keep unemployment from becoming higher is to make sure your
              equilibrium point is close to the minimum wage. Govts can do this by
              having a robust economy with well paying jobs and making sure the cost
              of living is contained. With massive imported labor, the Singapore govt
              has caused the supply curve of labor to shift to the right. This moved
              our equilibrium point further down from where our minimum wage is.
              Also, the cost of living increase over the years means our minimum wage
              has been going up....moving further form the equilibrium point.</p>
              <p>The
              reason why the PAP govt does not set a minimum wage is simple.
              Unemployment will escalate if they do that. What this means is a large
              number of Singaporeans are employed at wages way below what they need
              to live decently. We see this from the stats - 20% of the population
              make something like $1300 or less.</p>
              <p>Being able to establish and
              enforce a minimum wage says a lot about a govt. If they have created a
              system in which people who work full time jobs can make a decent
              salary, setting a minimum will not be problematic. If a govt creates an
              economy that is dependent on cheap labor and cannot keep the cost of
              living down because of its other interests, it will never be able to
              set a minimum wage without creating problems for itself.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong aims to introduce a minimum wage by early 2011 [<a href="http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/6/25/business/4190223&amp;sec=business">Link</a>]. South Korea already has mimum wage [<a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2009/06/123_47677.html">Link</a>]...so does Japan[<a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=4920">Link</a>]...so does Taiwan[<a href="http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?CtNode=122&amp;xItem=24054">Link</a>]...and all developed western countries.</p>
              <p>But
              Singapore? The govt has created a system in which we can never
              establish a minimum wage....because of the sheer number of people
              working at income levels that are so low relative to cost of
              living....a natural consequence of our large income gap.</p>
              <p>Next
              time someone tells you things are better in Singapore because
              unemployment rate (among residents) is low remember that is only half
              the story.</p>
