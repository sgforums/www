              <p>English is the main language in Singapore. If anyone replies you in Chinese with the heavy China accent when you speak English, I suggest you demand to see the person's manager. That manager had better know how to speak English.</p>
              <p>Welcome to Singapore!</p>

              <p>Hi Limsedinay,</p>
              <p>Knowing the chinese language can sometimes give you an advantage in getting a job in Singapore. But generally, they are not a must for you to get a job.</p>
              <p>As for your English, you can try taking up language courses just as Farid has kindly suggested in some of the local education institutes.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>hi turk,</p>
              <p>sincerely i hope you stay in turk and come here for tour if you have the time. you see unless you have money to migrate and contribute to another country as a citizen there it is cool. since you cannot communicate in english / chinese / even malay or tamil then you are going to create problems here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you see in sg we have many problems with foreigners, ppl on visit or business come here for 6 months either to push drugs or whore. so please let our police have a better time and country less crime news.</p>

              <p>Hi, I am a tourism student from temasek poly and am currently doing my 1 semster of my studies at Tourism Academy at Sentosa. </p>
              <p>I guess you do not have to worry about studying with younger friends. Basically, in a poly environment usually there would be students of different ages. I have friends who are hitting 23 this year but yet they are from the same cohort as me :D</p>

              <p>now i think you reeally have problem communicating. racist every country got. singapore is consider very good already. good life in turks does not mean you will have good life here. i also have good life here in sg but i never thought of a need to go another country. only when you feel life not good enough then you need go another country to WORK.</p>
