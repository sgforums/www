              <p>This is a true story which happened to my friend.</p>
              <p>He resigned from his ex company. According to his ex company's HR policy, staffs who resigned will get their last month salary by cheque within 1 week from his last day of work.</p>
              <p>After waiting for 2 weeks and calling the HR department many times to check, they keep on saying that they are in the process of preparing the cheque.</p>
              <p>So after 2 weeks, he went to MOM to make a complain.</p>
              <p>He went down to MOM and they told him he need to make a appointment, cannot just walk in. So they booked a appointment for him 4 working days later as they say that all slots are fully booked.</p>
              <p>So when the day of the appointment reached he went down to MOM.</p>
              <p>He told the MOM staff everything and gave the HR director contact number. The MOM staff called the HR director but she was not in. The HR Assistant answered the call and say that they will prepare the cheque for him within 1 week.</p>
              <p>He gave the HR director email address to the MOM officer so that she can email the HR director to chase for his salary but the MOM officer say that this is a call centre and they got no email.</p>
              <p>He ask the MOM Officer what if after 1 week the company still never pay him salary. She ask him to call MOM to book another appointment again and that she will record in the system what happen today so that if next time he comes down again and he meet another officer, the officer will be able to follow up on this case. She also say that the next time he can pay $3 to lodge a case with MOM labour court if the company still never pay</p>
              <p>This shows how useless MOM is.</p>
              <p>First, you have to wait for 4 working days just to book an appointment to go down to make a complain.</p>
              <p>Than, the MOM officers don't even have email account. They got a system for them to record down what happen but got no email account. Is the government so stingy until don't even want to give their staffs a email account?</p>
              <p>Than, go to labour court also must pay $3. Singaporeans pay taxes to the government and now when they are in trouble the government don't even want to protect them and charge them if they want to help them.</p>

              <p>1) Always call to enquire about action to be taken, before going down. Now you know.</p>
              <p>2) Collate the evidence yourself. If i am the MOM officer, and some guy just show up, and claim this and that, I can only call the employers to find out their side of the story before I dare to commit to any action. What if the story is not true, gana sabo also don't know?</p>
              <p>3) Always email the company yourself. And than forward any reply you get to the authorities. Why are you even pushing this to the MOM officer? no wonder they are loaded with work til appointments takes 4 days.</p>
              <p>4) If possible, do things online. Black and white record is easier for MOM to handle, and anything wrong, easier for you to refer, compared to phone call. (e.g. no action taken by MOM for 1 week, can forward email to MP)</p>

              <p>2. Letter of resignation ==&gt; Anyone can type but not submit? Any written reply by the HR acknowledging the receipt of the letter? Also, proof of non receipt of salary (i.e CPF contribution) The employee handbook is not necessary, paying salary within one week is MOM law.</p>
              <p>3. If got forward the email to MOM, they would have sent an email to you acknowledging the receipt of your email. forward to your MP.</p>
              <p>4. The thing to do online is to document all the lodging of the complaint you made. This is the first step in building up your civil suit to sue the company for non payment of salary</p>
              <p>If the MOM officer ask you to go down to get details, it will be short and sweet, since everything is documented.</p>
