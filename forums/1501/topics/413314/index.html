              <p>companies actually relocate operations overseas......or are infested with difficult people.there is no such thing as job hopper in the modern world.u think we are stupid?????no such thing...if a person is well educated.......finds that $$$$ and skills are no good and have difficult people around them.....then the job is up in smoke.</p>
              <p>in spore,its either u get paid same rate as chinaman n u are unable to survive in spore.....thengo find a job that has a better future.so if next job u have has company that has debts of $1billion then go to another company...and if next company has been affected by 9-11 airline...recessions......company relocation...until u get a temp job n low position...time to kick the bucket n immigrate!</p>
              <p>people dont job hop unless they have no choice...not disorder problem.people with disorder problem cant study n focus even on 2 mths on the job...so its not disorder problem but rather company has problems as in difficult people,workplace harrasment,ns reservist issues,company relocation,recessions,company playing dirty n getting rid of staff using any dirty undertable method....so if one is experienced at work...u will notice anything is possible to companies under the sun.</p>
              <p>so if u have 1 year and have went thru 3 mths probation......then u have no disoreder problem unless u have been exposed to racism or workplace bullying or supervisor trying to ram a 20kg metal piece up yer ass.</p>
              <p>however if u went went thru various jobs after years in the same field and have much skills...then its time u set up your own company as u have by this time acquired all the knowledge,skills and expertise.had u stayed in just one company still using 1970 technology then u are in trouble.u will be addicted to your company.so without your company...u will die.....just like a drug addict without drugs.</p>

              <p>like a soldier:.....one who only knows a weapon or 2 and fights only in one weather only.</p>
              <p>now take a look at another type of soldier who knows 4 or 5 other weapons and always improve himself after mastering one weapon.he knows how to fight on land,in the sea,in the air,in snow,in broiling deserts etc.</p>
              <p>just as the above applies in  a civilian modern workplace...the one who knows how to conquer and reduce or make stuff will be the only survivor...the rest are just corpses waiting to rot.</p>

              <p>there is however one type of organisation that demands loyalty forever.its the italian mafia or yakuza or 699 gang .no skills needed.....u just kind of walk around...look fierce.....just dun tell people yer pay is less n have not much skills other than the rubbish collector in some countries.</p>
              <p>in spore there is no loyalty from company even if u served them loyally for 10 or 20 years.after that they fire u because they got yunger,much more alert,better skilled ,much cheaper and faster up to date  people.dun think backside would be werth much to any employer after 20 years irregardless .</p>
