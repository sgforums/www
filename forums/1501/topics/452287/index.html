              In the last few years, I have gone for some interviews every now and then, and even got job offer out of some of the interviews.  While the remuneration and the influx of foreigners have continued to be the hottest topics among working ppl and employers, I notice a very worrying trend for the employees and that is: employers are now only giving term contract to staff, instead of permanent position.  In the past, I used to think only a few companies do that and they probably did so for some special reason (ie company policy, corporate decision etc).  But these days, it seems that no employer will offer a permanent position, although some will convert the contract staff to permanent.  I myself was one of them who got converted even before the expiry of my contract.  At first, I thought nothing of it.  But some times later, I have colleagues who didn't get converted but had their contracts renewed for another 2 years and they got perplexed over it.  At the same time, I have gone for a few interviews lately and every one of them is offering a 1-yr, 2-yrs or 3 yrs contract.  Even People's Association is offering only 3-yr contract which the HR indicated that at the end of the 3rd year, they may or may not renew you, subject to whether they need you or not (they didn't phrase it like that, but that's how I interpreted when I went for their interview).  
              
              In where I worked, I was with the Cost Management Committee and read some of their old notes where I chanced upon this part on HR's initiatives on cost management.  It said that they would only offer 2-yr contract to staff to save cost and somewhere along the line, it further elaborated that in the event, the company needed to downsize, these "contract staff" will be the first to go and the company would do so by not renewing their contract when expired.  The rationale is to not let the company incur payment of retrenchment.  
              
              I find this trend is very worrying esp we are still importing cheaper labours whom our govt like to call them foreign talents.  It seems that the govts are bo chup about this, cuz I don't think they are not in the know of this situation, esp when their good friend PA is also doing it.

              <p>As I have explained in related threats that we have to accept spore has peaked when govt begin to limit the inflow of alien workers.  Recent survey by Hayes consultants (if I am not mistaken) shows employers in spore do not feel they are less satisfied with the quality of new recruits(39% I believe) compared to those in HK(54% I believe).  Of course, the softening of job scene is also due to the crisis from EU, US and the weakening of China since Spore is largely an export country almost totally dependent on our trade partners performing.  Zero interest will last very long</p>
              <p>In the founder of democracy(Greece) nation, 78% of greeks reject austerity but want to stay in EU inspite of all the reasoning offered.that one cannot eat the cake and have it.  I hope sporeans will one day realise this problem. soon enough if they are not prepared to face the sufferings of joblessnesses, less grad jobs and oversupply of grads like other countries etc.  If we want to go backwards from the present state, there will be sufferings coming, not just discomforts.  The best for spore is try to remain status quo now.  Our heroes are only human and not gods and so do not expect miracles - every fruit has to bear the testimony of past hard work and wisedom, nothing less.</p>

              <p>Are we serious to think that the world is so simple that if we have fewer or no foreign professionals/skilled workers those jobs will be given to sporeans?  I have no doubt about this if we are the decision makers.  But the problem is it is the employers' call and not even the govt's call.  So please let's not argue - ask the dominant employers what they will do. </p>

              <p>actually I have no issue with employers having more power or what.  we cannot control them.  if the job market is bad, naturally, they will hang high high and benefit at the expense of employees and job seekers. </p>
