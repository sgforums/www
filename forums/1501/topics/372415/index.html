              <p>My company doesn't have performance or 13th month bonus... but the resignation rate isn't quite bad. Our monthly salary is higher than average, but after calculations, it's roughly the same as those who are paid bonuses. Could be lower, especially those with performance bonuses.</p>
              <p>Hehe, some have stayed there for 10 years, 20 years.</p>
              <p>I guess it boils down to which department you are in... if satisfying and challenging, you might not want to leave.</p>

              <p>Have you ever worked in a company that does not pay 13 month bonus and only pays performance bonus?</p>

              <p>Meaning that the company can just say that your performance is lousy or the company is not making money than you get zero bonus.</p>

              <p>Are there very high resignation rates in these type of companies?</p>

              <p>I am currently working in a company that does not pay 13 month bonus and from what I heard the company have very high resignation rates and most of the staffs there do not work for more than 3 years than they will leave the company..</p>
