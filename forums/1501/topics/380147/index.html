              <p>On Monday I started new job, assuming Boss will give appointment letter to sign, but there's no letter. Yesterday I asked again and he said to sign in 1 to 2 days' time after he resolved his problems but the letter not prepared by him. I saw his wife, Boss Lady, and the pretty admin clerk Zo-Bo-Lan, doing nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today decided to inform him not coming to work until I sign letter, but there's no reply from him or the company. Since no letter, I'm not one of his staff, but can I claim salary for two day's of work??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please advise, and any wrong to walk away from work?? Thanks </p>

              <p>Is very small architect firm. Boss is Malaysia-born Singaporean registered architect.</p>
              <p>I attended another company interview. Boss was also a Malaysia-born Singaporean registered architect saying got a big condo project in Vietnam and more projects were coming on the way. Made me excited like I was about to relocate there. Then after a few emails no news now, totally silent. May be due to recent typhoon destroyed Vietnam that he needed to stop project.</p>
              <p>Last time I also worked for a Malaysia-born Singaporean boss here but construction company and sent me to China. Boasted got three projects coming. After 1st month in China, they did not paid the salary on time. Waited about three weeks later then got our salaries in China, really cannot "dong" or "tahan", although rent was free to us. Also the Malaysian bosses boasted to ang-mohs clients in China they can complete the factory in 6 months, but many problems happened. Later I left the company and found out they were actually sub-contractor and on the way to be promoted as main contractor, so no experience at all, so "Luan-Zhu-Lai" (in Hokkien) anyhow boasted to ang-mohs (white men). Later they completed the factory in 18 months, one year more than what they had forecasted.</p>
              <p>Unless here no jobs, only Malaysia-born bosses companies and no choice, I will work for them, or else, better not work for these "Luan-Zhu-Lai" people, really is in disorder as they do not obey their laws in Malaysia even.   </p>

              <p>Also, for info, many Malaysian registered companies here in Singapore, then went to China and overseas, boasted to clients they were actually true Singaporean branded companies with Singaporean quality and values. Even they came here to learn our own branded Bah-Ku-Teh, Hainan Chicken Rice and Laksa (really Singapore styles and not Malaysian styles) and started restaurants inside China, then all their shops put Singapore names, told the Mainland Chinese their bosses were Singaporeans, actually Singapore Permanent Residents. Why I knew?? I asked the waiter to call his boss out and I spoke to him. Later I found his Malaysian-slang Chinese language and he knew I was the true Singaporean, he immediately kept quiet and said no more.</p>
              <p>Our Singapore brands were very famous and well-known in Mainland China but many Malaysians and also HongKies copied our products, lied to Chinese customers their products were truly Singapore brand. And their bosses were Singaporeans. (PR la!!)</p>

              <p>Our government does not know??? They knew but could not do anything that was why more and more Malaysian Chinese came here to be bosses and became S'poreans.</p>
              <p>So not only we need to compete with Foreign Talent for jobs, we also compete with Foreign Bosses for business, where is the Singaporean PRIDE??? You buy and eat the Chicken Rice and Laksa in China, actually cooked by Malaysians and HongKies, do you feel proud your national products marketing by foreigners in overseas??? </p>

In Chinese language Ma-Lai-Xi-Ya means "when horse is coming, Sure Die La" so not good luck name. In Chinese language Singapore name Xin-Jia-Po means "the hills keep adding new things" so always adding in good luck.  </p></div>

              <p>Latest news: Funny, I never signed the appointment letter and the Boss can terminate me and issued me salary for two days.</p>
              <p>Yesterday MOM clarified new laws since 1995 employers no need to issue Contract of Service in the form of paper to employees. But I argued for my case, Appointment Letter wasn't Contract of Service as the job is not yet confirmed. So I don't know how my Boss going to pay me two days salary. At least he don't pay, I can demand from him as is written in his email to me. I'm still waiting for MOM for more answer.</p>

              <p>Spoke to MOM officer (MInistry of Manpower) that she noted me Contract of Service is a mutual agreement between employer and employee, even no documentary proof is considered employment agreement, includes email but not SMS. (short message)</p>
              <p>In my case, though I never signed any documents, is considered a mutual agreement between Boss and me to allow me to work for my Boss, as employment agreement.</p>
              <p>So in future, should ask for Letter of Appointment / Employment in interviews to sign before starting the jobs. If no such document, how can the employees claim salaries if there's no documentary proof and the employers refuse to issue salaries. There were employers refusing to bind mutual agreement as employment agreement if it includes email. They can just send SMS for employees to start work.</p>
              <p>Looks like MOM only cares employers to save paperwork and can sue employees off-guarded. Also MOM said employers can sue employees not under Employment Act in Civil Court, as some employees in executive and mangerial posts, or so earn more than S$2,500 per month not under the MOM Employment Act.   </p>
