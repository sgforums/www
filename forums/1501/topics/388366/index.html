              <p>I kept getting fired in the corporate world and now that I went back to school, hopefully it would improve the situation. I have terrible communication skills as I have no friends and people around me are not very helpful to my situation either.</p>
              <p>You can say that after my previous setbacks, I have doubts about whether I could actually overcome and be able to maintain my job in the long run.</p>
              <p>Anyways, I have a part-time retail job right now and not doing amazing.</p>
              <p>I don't know why I have to always live at the ends of the threads. I don't even know what do these people want....I feel so lonely and useless....(random) I just don't know anymore....</p>

              <p>cos i got the same experience, i was from nyp, and my poly result is quite ok one (gpa 3.8++) almost every subject can get A...... but everything changes when i got into NTU, i only can get B's ..... sometime is the moderation(if you score in that paper so does everyone else), in poly most of the student quite relax one, so you if you study you will score. But in uni, everyone are very competitive, especially those foreign students. If i look back, i think that my poly education was just a introduction(if study hard one or two day before the exam can get A's). i think you will know how i feel if you starts to take the ACCA exams. </p>

              <p>is your attitude of doing things. the skill that every job requires are different, unless you are talking about those labour intensive or blue collar jobs. if a job only requires the basic stuff than everyone can do it, and i think the pay is not high. for professional jobs, i do think that you will need the knowledge you learn, although not all of what you learned in school will be used. if you are a slack and carefree person, you may wanna work as a freelance or those jobs that are slack. i heard accountants work load is quite high, if you cannot take that kind of life, better change you job sector.</p>
