              <div id="post_message_11717">Hi, need some advice on which MBA is the most recognised in singapore among my selection apart from the local universities - Bradford MBA or Nottingham MBA? <br><br><br>I have just received my BSc (Hon) Business Computing with second lower honours from the University of Bradford through MDIS with close to three years of working experience inclusive of internship, in my mid twenties and currently working in a local GLC as a software engineer but my interest is not in IT but rather in areas - business/management consulting, banking etc rather than be a developer, tester etc . I have tried to convince myself that interest can be cultivated since I did an IT diploma in a local polytechnic but to no avail.<br><br>I have chosen either Bradford and Nottingham as they are priced within the same affordable price range of between $26 000 to $33 000 with a broad focus as compared to the Strathclyde MBA which is quite financial focused. Both schools have quite a decent reputation with various strengths.<br><br>I have quite an inclination towards the UK universities as I have been attended classes at Bradford's campus before for a short period, the Australian degrees are quite common and the US MBA are quite out of my reach and age. I am also open to other suggestions. <br><br>I don't aspire to be the Top 10% -20% of the highest earner etc as I know I can't at least at the moment. A decent salary after my MBA and being able to be involved in my passion is what I am looking for - business/management consulting, banking etc. <br><br>I don't want to regret like some of my colleagues who have chosen to pass their chance for a career switch when they were young in their mid twenties just because there are better people out there and choose to stay in their refuge, complain for life and lament that other people are earning and leading a much better life . <br><br>Just because I am not a graduate from an elite school doesn't mean I should not aspire, plan and work for a better future. <br><br>I understand that there are better qualified and experienced people out there also seeking to break into the business field from a technical background.<br><br><br>Thank you for the advice.</div>
