              Hi, I have just retired from teaching recently. Sad to say, MOE is not even keen  to  let me do relief teaching and continue earning a living! Asking me to find job elsewhere. I know thousands or hundreds of students out there whom I have taught  know me. Your PE/CME/ART teacher. If you are one of them and have any job for me even cleaning your office, please let me know.  Thanking all of you!

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your suggestion. It is a worthwhile one to look into. MOE spends so much money on training teachers when in service and after that does not require the service after retirement. Sad. One of the reason given also too many applying for relief teaching. Also many not eager to employ those above 55 years of age. At least CISCO offers Security Officer job at Changi Airport. Great!</div>

              To Mohan21.
              
              I can feel your sadness and disappointment with MOE. It actually contradicted the Singapore government employment campaign to the employers to employ mature workers or elderly workers in their 60s. I think you need to overcome your unhappiness with MOE soon. So what are your plans in your job search? You mention about CISCO...did you apply for it?

              <p>Reply to ditzy – Its because of medical reasons. However, still
              mobile to do work. Relief teaching that is not so demanding should
              not be a problem. You work for an organization for so many years
              faithfully, even when you are sick you go back to work and in the
              end when looking at re-employment, when you are rejected for sure
              you will feel sad!</p>
