At that time, Recruits was  about only ten pages thick, research jobs all looking for phds with experience. So I went back to study an Msc. in '07, situation was slighly better, I got to work in an MNC for 1 1/2 years, but I was underpaid (I had gotten an Msc. degree). I left the job months ago without thinking too much or getting an offer first because of very long and irregular OT hours. It is supposed to be easier now for me, after searching, I have sent emails to more than 10 openings that match my qualification and experience, something not possible in '03 or '07. But still no reply from any of them. Hard to imagine if there are many with the same research background are looking for research jobs at the same time.</p></div>

              <p>made some advancement today on my material specimen tests.</p>
              <p>Discovered i could dissolve a chemically unreactive adhesive material after using and make it not adhere by formulating a film of 1 mil or so.got great results on 2 test specimens.but i need to dissolve unreactive material to a non viscious fluid further for  ease of processing which would make release on surface harder due to chemical which actually is corrosive and destroys property if material.</p>
              <p>further tests are to be made regarding other types of chemicals or neutralising of corrosive properties using chemicals  using water on plastic tester.</p>

              <p>in 2 years time since 2007, singapore has changed alot.  govt open our doors wide wide to "talents" all over the world.  the supply of manpower has increased, but the demand has dropped due to the economy downturn. </p>
              <p>nowadays many of the jobs available don't require graduate qualifications.  when grads apply for such jobs, companies don't even dare to hire them.  if you have a post-grad degree, you are actually discriminated against.  on the other hand, being a grad most likely you will find those jobs not your cuppa tea. </p>

              <p>Elec engineering and mech engineering degree have traditionally been the easiest to find jobs in the private sector.</p>
              <p>As for you, from the research background and armed with a Msc degree, MOE or any poly will gladly rope you in to teach students. With your qualifications and experience, I'm pretty sure you will get more than 3k in these 2 places.</p>

              <p>If that's the case, then he's considered choosy, and should not complain if he cannot get a job he wants, or the pay is too low for his qualifications.</p>
              <p>A research job isn't any simpler or more difficult than a teaching job.</p>
              <p>It's not about policies; it's about being practical. Teaching is merely one of other jobs he can do. He could research on how to impart the ideas of physics better and write some books out, or he could do other things! He says he has a Msc degree, surely he can think creatively how to solve his situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone wants a high paying easy life job. But think again, you want to be lazy and be well paid? Dream on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it's up to pple to decide what they want to do with their lives. Every minute spent complaining, sighing, and waiting for things to happen to you is every minute loss. Waiting for things to just happen magically is an express ticket to hell.</p>
              <p>If the mountain won't come to Muhammad, Muhammad  must go to the mountain. It's that simple. If this profession does not want to take you, move on to another.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Research and teaching are different. Teaching students, nurturing talents require heart more than head. I have conditioned my mind or have been conditioned to perform logical thinking all these years. It will take a long time to switch. I guess my current best option is to pick up some new skills that are much sought for and be open for other opportunities. And yes networking.</p></div>

              <p>Of course it is different. But no point stubbornly sticking to one place where you can't secure any income right? And it's merely an opinion...</p>
              <p>I'm being practical. What I meant is there are still opportunities out there that will gladly take you in and pay you well without much more stress than your previous research job.It's whether you are willing to accept them.</p>
              <p>If you aren't willing, then you are not forced to be jobless; you chose to be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway I'm just sharing my thoughts. Your life is in your hands, suits me fine if you want to continue waiting indefinitely or chase about some sought after new skills that might become irrelevant in the near future.</p>
