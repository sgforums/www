              <p>Who to blame for leaving your job before finding another? Upgrading requires a plan, you didn't have one. You want to seek for a higher pay, nothing wrong with it, but where's your backup plan? You drove yourself into the state of unemployment.</p>
              <p>There are many mistakes you have made in your actions to upgrade. I don't want to bombard you at all in my posts, but the fact is in the real life, you hold the key to whether you are employed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think about this.... you left a salaried job first, then attempt to seek for a higher salaried job. Yet when you can't find it, you blamed on poor employment conditions.... so why do you even leave the first job in the first place???</p>
              <p>To upgrade, you may say... But upgrade what??? Upgrading is about upgrading of skills set... Upgrading of experience in doing different things... in learning new skills...<br>Correct me if I'm wrong... You are treating upgrading as upgrading to a higher salary for a similar kind of job, i.e. Admin Assistant.</p>
              <p>But put yourself in the shoes of your prospective employer... If you were to apply for a job that many can do as well, why would the employer be willing to raise your salary over time when he can easily replace you with another local fresh poly grad? Why would a new employer be willing to give you a higher salary?</p>
              <p>And so what if you worked for 2 years in your previous job? If it's the same routine job in the same company, it merely counts for an experience of doing something that someone can also pick up in a matter of... days or weeks?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, my sis had to send out 60+ applications before receiving 2 replies in 2008. Have you sent 60+?</p>
              <p>I'm spending the time to say all these not to suan you or anything... 
              but to make you think deeper... not to blame but to take some form of action...</p>

              <p>The reason I quit before finding one is because of the sudden change in working hours of the company which I cannot compromise. So I need to leave before finding one.</p>
              <p> The picture you gave me is somewhat similar. A local with experience and FT/local without experience doing simple work, of course I lose out. It's either I negotiate a lower wage or I search longer for a job. But call me stingy or whatever, 100 is alotttt to me</p>
              <p>Honestly I don't know how many I sent out but definitely not 60 &gt;.&lt; OMG! 60+ in 2008... I can sense despair...</p>

              <p>you asked me? a jobless person?</p>
              <p>starting a business requires capital, enough cash to last through the zero cash-flow period.</p>
              <p>that's why I'm saying, had the government not imported so many talents, we would have found jobs and can have savings, and when the MNCs are about to leave (if it happens), some feeling insecure will think of starting a business. My two-cent worth.</p>

              <p>1) You have job choices. You refused to take it by saying it's different. That's choosy in my opinion; you chose not to earn capital to start a business.</p>
              <p>2) If you think it's crazy to start a SME from being jobless, what makes you think we can let local SMEs rise when the MNCs move off and leave citizens here jobless?</p>
              <p>And I guess you wouldn't want my honest opinion of you here because it will be too brutal.</p>

              <p>1) Chill. Advice taken not ignored, though not now. Has been trying out other avenues.</p>
              <p>2) There is a difference between jobless with cash, and jobless without cash. And when MNCs leave, competitors are less.</p>

              <p>1) Glad to hear that. Wish you success!</p>
              <p>2) MNCs can actually spark more SMEs to cater services to these MNCs. So it work both ways too! Opportunities are always present. Remeber, what you see as problems can be seen as business opportunities by others.</p>
              <p>My previous post was typed out after a long tiring day (Imagine wake 7am, sleep 2am, in between is work). Chill too :)</p>
