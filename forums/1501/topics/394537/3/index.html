              <p>Wages is really pathetic nowadays... If this goes on in the next couple of years, I might REALLY consider working as a cleaner/ waiter overseas - the worst case scenario. A waiter has salary of minimum 5-6k SGD excluding taxes and expenses. minus everything I still get 2-3k if I eat cup noodles everyday. Better than the stagnant salary I'm getting now.</p>
