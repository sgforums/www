              <p>You might need to change your expectaions and career path.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>High end, high value added jobs are getting lesser and lesser in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless you are very lucky to get back to your research areas, you might have to settle for careers in the service/tourism sector now (read careers in IR, casino gaming and related jobs).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even then, this IR, casino sector might lose its appeal after a few years and you might need to be retrained into other areas depending on what the government comes up next.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just look at the past 10 years of various hubs they were pushing.  Most of them kind of died off and lost their appeal after a while.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, their mantra is "as long as you get a job (no matter which sector or pay), you should be thankful to them". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>the unofficial but accurate unemployment figure for US is around 20%............in certain European countries like Spain, it's already officially over 20%...........that's close to depression levels so you can imagine how good economy is gonna get.................and don't forget the manipulated economic figures from China..............where car sales had gone up but petrol consumption remained flat..............factory production went up but electricity consumption went down................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>govt jobs will be safest in the near future or jobs catering to the high-end market.................depression will eventually come................</p>
              <p>even graduates will be in big trouble as PAP is letting in foreign graduates by the boatloads and they're cheaper.............</p>
              <p>for those lucky enough to have parents that can see them through university, time to see if can escape to Australia or New Zealand..................</p>
              <p>for those who are not ambitious or know their own limits, then join SAF is best as govt still throwing tons of money in the military.....................the crappy graduates would fare better in the Police where it's basically a dumping ground for 3rd class graduates..........</p>
              <p>stay clear of properties now and wait for the big crash...............same for the stock market.............try not to buy a car................</p>
              <p>as for the rest, vote PAP out so your kids can have a future.....................only the elite will prosper here at the moment.</p>

              <p>Sorry to say this but regardless how many years you worked, your asking of 1.7 is high compared to what the FTs are asking for. They easily undercut you by 300 to 400 bucks.</p>
              <p>For a mere admin assistant post, FT can do the same for less, which employer doesn't want that?</p>
