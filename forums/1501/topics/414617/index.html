              <p>It doesn't hv to be foul-mouth or such. I think the issue is these ppl use their rank to force the lower staff to do things against their will or things they dun like.</p>
              <p>My previous Co. also like that, just that i got pink slip along wif my former bastard manager who play "games" wif us to do meaningless things which may cost us our jobs. I play along his games &amp; whistle-blow him once spotted an opening against him.</p>

              <p>2. implement a method on how to avoid future mistake</p>
              <p>3. encourage your junior, counter-check her work once more before submitting, calm her, say, buy her some rose tea/ camomile tea</p>
              <p>4. send that manager's resume to the headhunters; and pray that the manager will be headhunted, and you can say bye bye to that manager very soon.</p>

              <p>Oftentimes, bosses find fault and scold their subordinates pinning the blame on them to make themselves look and feel better. But they know deep inside that it's all very superficial. Just be humble and take the verbal thrashing. Offer no resistance t all: one ear in, another ear out.........and you'll be all right.</p>
              <p>This happens everywhere you go. As long as you are working just as a mere employee, you'll have to face this sort of thing. The most you can do is resign and find yourself another place to work. But you'll never escape from this. A different work place may have this in a different shade but it's all the same............</p>
              <p>I always believe that what goes around comes around. These nasty bosses will just get their just desserts one fine day...........</p>
              <p>Just keep your focus on what you are working for and everything else is secondary.</p>

              <p>not everyone is like that....</p>
              <p>i have some proposals for you</p>
              <p>1. avoid that manager as far as possible.  minimize all possible eye contacts and communication.</p>
              <p>2. implement a method on how to avoid future mistake</p>
              <p>3. encourage your junior, counter-check her work once more before submitting, calm her, say, buy her some rose tea/ camomile tea</p>
              <p>4. send that manager's resume to the headhunters; and pray that the manager will be headhunted, and you can say bye bye to that manager very soon.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks bebe....</p>
              <p>I hv talked to my junior, and she already go the phobia and making mistakes. Told her to work as what you use to do everyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, agreed with point 1, no eye contact, detour if manager walks towards you. Less contact, less conflicit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pt 2, My junior and others have come up with a checklist to handling over whatever tasks not done. Thaks.</p>

              <p>Oftentimes, bosses find fault and scold their subordinates pinning the blame on them to make themselves look and feel better. But they know deep inside that it's all very superficial. Just be humble and take the verbal thrashing. Offer no resistance t all: one ear in, another ear out.........and you'll be all right.</p>
              <p>This happens everywhere you go. As long as you are working just as a mere employee, you'll have to face this sort of thing. The most you can do is resign and find yourself another place to work. But you'll never escape from this. A different work place may have this in a different shade but it's all the same............</p>
              <p>I always believe that what goes around comes around. These nasty bosses will just get their just desserts one fine day...........</p>
              <p>Just keep your focus on what you are working for and everything else is secondary.</p>
