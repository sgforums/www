              <p>while  ministers and politicians take home $1million or $50,000/year, the average tech guy werking in a high tech MNC industry  takes home only $24,000/year only.,,,,,with his diploma he sees it impossible to get a degree with his salary is unable to see him thru every month.</p>
              <p>with his savings depleted and him being close to starving by the roadside he decides to end his life inside the istana during a public holiday.</p>
              <p>even $3000/mth in singapore isnt sufficient to see thru life and savings in spore as life of a MNC is only 10 years before they decide to pull out of spore or retrench people.</p>

              <p>thats where the problem lies here.. while we have to work our lives out to make a living here, they have the opiton to go back and live like a king, to make matters worst, competition is stiff due to the "flood" of workers, some PRC tech i know come here on company expenses and work on contract based for 2 years, their monthly pay is $800 but that was abt 2-3 years ago. right now i have already quit that manufacturing  line of work but as far as i can see, more and more workers are non-sgeans, even in non-manufacturing areas, in short we are forced to lower our pay expections to secure the job but still go thru a rising standard ofl living where some can barely make it thru.</p>

              <p>If 2k is the take home pay, that means he is earning 2.5k per month. and that is higher than average for a diploma holder with 3-4 years of experience. I do not see the reason why he cannot go for a degree unless, he has a family to take care of.</p>
              <p>3000 per month is mainly for a degree holder who is still climbing or a diploma holder at his peak.</p>
              <p><a href="/users/255246">Annilator47</a> : It's still true that most PRC earns lower salary. but the PRCs that come to singapore are slowly no longer poor, most of my PRC friends can afford to go overseas studying 50k sgd, or can afford to break the scholarship bond because they do not want to work in sg. one of them can earn 5 digit, fresh graduate in private university. Also, because they are given the chance to study in Poly or Uni, when they graduate, they also ask for the same salary as locals. same cert = same pay.</p>
