Upon confirmation, either party may terminate this contract of employment by giving the other one's month written notice or salary in lieu thereof.

My direct superior will not be available for a week so I managed to get in touch with him through an online platform. I gave my reason, he reply a bit.. standard.. I apologize for causing this trouble. And his last reply was "This is unfair to the company". So... now what?</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;">Look, my job is kinda like a... replacement and taking over job. The previous fella resigned. But there was no proper handing over and I never met the previous guy whom resigned. I was only given notes and stuff to read with no proper direction/guidance. I am told that I can always ask them if I don't know.. but come on, they are all busy doing their own stuff. Over the past three days, I haven't learnt or done anything of significance for their company aside from doing some "sai kang" for them. Anyway, the real reason is I just don't see this working out for me in the long run. Which is why I want out before too late.</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;">How can I get out of this web I am stuck in? Since he said this is unfair to the company. But I don't want to get into any legal complications.</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background-color: #e2e2e2;">They do have the right to terminate me without notice for misconduct, willful blablabla. So they still want to keep me and make my life difficult? I don't care for the three days pay, I just want out.</span></p></div>

              <p>I took this job because I thought it was the right job for me. Unfortunately, after thee days, I just don't see it working out for me in the long term. People tell me it is too early to say. But I know deep within myself what is good or bad for myself. I just don't see it working out for me and my future plans. I currently have a different opportunity at hand and I want to try it out. Perhaps it will be what I am looking for?</p>
              <p>No I will not be breaking any of the contract agreement, I am not a spy and I am not hopping to a competitor.</p>
              <p>I am only three days into probation, this is why I want out before it is too late. I don't want to waste the company's time. I really feel sorry for the company because the pay was actually quite good/better than average for my education level. They trusted me. I don't feel like I deserve the pay, another reason why I want out.</p>
              <p>I just want to know if I will be liable to get into any legal complications with the company for not properly "serving the notice". I already apologized to my immediate superior for the trouble but no reply.</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't intend to turn up for work tomorrow as I have already made other arrangements as well. I mean.. what is the point? I can go there, be unproductive and tell people I am resigning right after three days, sure.. But it will be awkward. Waste of time, effort and transport.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't be any complications right? I mean, come on.. three days into probation.. and I need to write out a formal letter of resignation?!</p>

              <p>Hi, ermm if thats what u want then u can play punk by being absent for 3 days straight then u'll be terminated. Else u can talk to the manager personally and see whats his/her response. Should be no problem as u're not into the job and they can always hire another to train them. </p>
              <p>My advise, talk to your immediate supv/manager. don't think u'll be liable for any compensation unless the company is asking for it. But it is better if u can serve one month notice and also give the company sometime to source for replacement. </p>
              <p>For more details u may want to check with MOM straight. But its a small matter and can be settled internally. :) </p>
