              <p>I am in a dilemma now. I am being offered 3 jobs and I am considering which job I should accept. worse, tommorrow a company needs me to go down to sign employment letter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one is a contract banking job, the other two are perm positions. if you ask me which jobs I like, of course I will tell you its the banking job, but its a one year contract and no guarantee it will be renewed. after 1 year I may be unemployed again if they dun renew my contract. the other two is a SME local company, medium sized company and not exactly small. but I gather that their operations is a bit messy and staff turnover rate is pretty high because I am in the industry, so I know. If you were me, which jobs will you choose?</p>

              <p>no la not recommended by that martin guy or anyone here.</p>

              <p>Yes I know, I used to work at call centres before. besides customer abusing you, you have your superiors screening your calls constantly and scold you when you advise your customers wrongly. also you got targets to hit, like answering 80 calls per day. if you are not performing after many warnings, out you go.</p>

              <p>both banking and the other job same pay. but one is perm and the banking is a 1 year contract. both are shitty jobs, but banking more prestigious I suppose. I have one night to consider which to take. in a real dilemma now. I hope I make the right choice</p>

              <p>its hard to move to other dept. first you need to stay in that dept for 2 years at least. the contract is for 1 year and the contract may not be renewed. I am taking the risks here. maybe who knows one year later, I am jobless again and looking for other jobs.</p>

              <p><br>If you still keen to continue working in the bank then start looking out for another banking job few months before the end of your contract.   I would say banks offer wider variety of jobs as compared to many other sectors.   The down side is whenever financial crisis sets in the banks are the first to suffer. </p>

              <p>I would take the perm job.</p>
              <p>Banks are notorious for hiring a lot of people when times are good, and retrenching a lot of people when times are bad. (like when DBS retrenched 700 people one shot last year)</p>
              <p>End of the day its about money. Take the one with the highest salary, if you do well you can get promote faster.</p>

              <p>I am in a dilemma now. I am being offered 3 jobs and I am considering which job I should accept. worse, tommorrow a company needs me to go down to sign employment letter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one is a contract banking job, the other two are perm positions. if you ask me which jobs I like, of course I will tell you its the banking job, but its a one year contract and no guarantee it will be renewed. after 1 year I may be unemployed again if they dun renew my contract. the other two is a SME local company, medium sized company and not exactly small. but I gather that their operations is a bit messy and staff turnover rate is pretty high because I am in the industry, so I know. If you were me, which jobs will you choose?</p>

              <p>Take up the banking job since your experience is in banking, though it is a contract</p>
              <p>job. Work hard on the job and get good performance so that the job can be</p>
              <p>turned into a permanent position. However, need to check first whether there is any</p>
              <p>likelihood that the contract position could be turned into a permanent position.</p>
              <p>When the economy recovers more, it will be easily to look for another job in the</p>
              <p>banking sector as the contract job will allow you to be in touch with the banking</p>
              <p>sector. It will be an advantage over other experienced applicants who are out of</p>
              <p>touch with the banking sector for 1 to 2 years.</p>

              <p>Some good advices from the forumers here.</p>
              <p>My take: Take the highest paid job for maximizing your income during uncertain times.</p>
              <p>Perm job - Not that much security as well, cuz you need to stay there &gt;3 yrs to enjoy real good retrenchment package of every year = 1 months pay if they fire you. If they let you go at end of 1st yr or on 2nd yr, you wont have that kind of package, at most is 1 yr = 1 or 2 weeks pay.</p>
              <p>Also perm job has more benefits like dental, medical, offs, leaves, transport, etc while contract may not have.</p>
              <p>And in perm job, bosses tend to upgrade you with new skills and more willing to teach you new stuff and so you can add in your resume/cv. Contract definitely no, just basic skills and you go start to do the chore to bring in business, methodical. </p>
              <p>If both jobs are of the same pay, then you have to consider which job is less stressful, which job allows you to have more free time (no OT, etc) so that you can look for other jobs elsewhere at end of 1st yr or later, or more free time for your own upgrading as in taking courses or with gf etc. And which job minimizes your transport time and cost, which job allows you to gain more network and contacts etc.</p>
              <p>If the above points didnt clear your end motivation of choosing which job, then you can go to temple and pray and ask God/Buddha which job is more suitable for you.</p>
              <p>And last thing is once you decided, you should be faithful in the execution of your job and do the tasks well. Good relationships in your new workplace and with your boss will allow you to progress in the new company. =)</p>
