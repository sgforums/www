              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>This will be a somewhat long post where I 
                      elaborate about myself so you are clear of what is going on, in which 
                      you can then hopefully give your analysis and constructive opinions.</p>
              <p>I'm
                       currently a fresh graduate thinking about my career options. I 
                      graduated from NUS with a degree in Bachelor of Computing 
                      (Communications and Media), 2nd Class Honours (Upper).</p>
              <p>I've 
                      already went through a lot of interviews for the companies I wanted, 
                      without success, and so in my desperation, I applied for ST Electronics 
                      Info-Software Systems for the position of Software Engineer and MINDEF 
                      for the position of a DXO. The application for the DXO position is a 
                      long process where you have to go for a psychometric test, then an 
                      interview, and then a tour around the DXO's workplace.</p>
              <p>From 
                      what I know from my friends, ST Electronics Info-Software System offers 
                      permanent contract with salary of $3200/month and 13th month bonus. I got an offer and so I am
                       to reply within one week's time. At the same time, fortunately or 
                      unfortunately depending on how you look at the circumstances, I also got
                       a call from MINDEF. In response to my e-mail asking them regarding my 
                      candidature for DXO position, they stated that they are keen to take me 
                      in, but they need time to process my application so I can go for yet 
                      more process... Which is medical check-up and security clearance. So I 
                      must pick one of my choice <strong>VERY SOON</strong>.</p>
              <p>I've no intention
                       to stay on my first job because I prefer to explore a little of what's 
                      outside before settling down on a job I like to do for the long-term. My
                       initial intention for my first job is software development, where I can
                       learn the in-depth technical skills (programming, software engineering 
                      frameworks, testing frameworks, etc) so that I can <strong>slowly </strong>climb
                       my way up to my ultimate goal as a project manager, which deals with 
                      management, coordination, and people-relations skills. I believe that 
                      being a Software Engineer at ST Electronics allows me to have the 
                      technical skills I need as a stepping stone towards a management 
                      position (We should lead by example, after all). My DXO position also 
                      requires Computing background, but its primary job role is to brief and 
                      coordinate the soldiers and then use the computer system SAF provided to
                       conduct simulation exercises. Secondary roles include managing the 
                      outsourced Systems Engineers who are maintaining the computer systems.</p>
              <p>To
                       be honest I have no idea why MINDEF are keen to take me in. Lack of 
                      manpower? But the people who called seemed so relaxed about it. Any 
                      ideas?</p>
              <p>Also, for those who have worked as Software Engineers or 
                      worked in DXO... What do you think I should pick in terms of career 
                      direction? I understand DXO has better remuneration/benefits than ST 
                      Electronics Info-soft (Except for salary, correct me if wrong) but my 
                      fear is that if I leave DXO after two years of service I would be no 
                      better than an ORD-ed regular whose only exposure is to military stuff 
                      and therefore has no real-life outside working experience.</p>
