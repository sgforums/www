              <p>just serve finiah and go. you confirm employee? look at the appointment letter you signed when you first join. see any difference in notice period for confirmed and non comformed employee. if the period for non comfirmed employee is less than a month you r resign letter no need serve until one month. you have to check the letter yourself.</p>
              <p>the manager in charge of HR? bohue him or her. if there's a HR the manage still have to go to HR. unless the company owned by the manager untherwise if he employee also you should gather all evidence of hime treatening you to sue you, submit the resig lett erto HR serve your notice period, get your PAY still for 1 month and go to your new employment.</p>
