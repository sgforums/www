              <p>Most are interviewed thru e2i, with 30,000 jobs needed at both IRs, Singaporean takes on 20,000, malaysian 5,000 and philipinos 5,000, however given the huge Singaporeans working there, about 10,000 are head hunted from hotels and other entertainments places, so, there is a huge void in hotels, pubs, discos, and other Food and Beverage industries, that is why, the labour is now very tight. I just heard that Sands had just head hunted about 1,000 peoples from RW sentosa by increase their pay by 50%, that is the real market we are talking about, today a mere hotel managers with paid of $4k can be head hunted to work in IRs for $8 to 10k. As labour market is tight, and services industries is booming, we are afraid that the wages will grow too much, therefore, we expect MOM to step into it and control the situation before, wages outgrowth profit or productive by a huge margin.</p>
              <p>So, if you think that you are jobless, go to e2i, they can train you to be security officer, chauffeur, chambermaid, etc etc...and it is a good career in IRs,</p>
