              <p><span><em><span style="color: #ff6600;">SINGAPORE: With the economy improving, businesses in the manufacturing, construction and retail sectors are finding it difficult to hire enough workers. <br><br>These were the results of a recent survey conducted in October and November this year, by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI). <br><br>It is a common feedback from leaders of SCCCI's trade associations that they are unable to fulfil orders because of the shortage of both local and foreign workers. <br><br>Teo Siong Seng, Nominated Member of Parliament and president, SCCCI said: "It is the same old story where there are some industries which just cannot attract locals to even go for an interview, put aside how much pay they are prepared to offer........</span></em></span></p>

              <p><span>BULL SHIT!!! Raise the salary ceilings and see IF YOU DONT HAVE QUEUES the day ads were posted!!!</span></p>
              <p><span>NO MORE MUST the foriegn labour policy be tweak. It only benefits the employers, who reap the most and spend it at KTVs, overseas trips, more ferraris for their sons and daughters, and looking down on others!</span></p>
              <p><span>Why should OUR LAND and economy benefit the few and make them millionaires??!!!</span></p>
              <p><span>Time to share the wealth around!!! To hell with MPR theories! (Marginal Revenue Product) What the hell is MC ( Marginal Cost ) when expected profits are included in its calculations?!!</span></p>
              <p><span>No more must the days of fat cat CEOs and executives drawing millions of dollars in salaries be allowed in our society, after what happened last year with the financial crisis, where even for poor performances they take such salaries home,  money off the back of workers toiling under the sun paying off huge bills monthy!</span></p>
              <p><span>No one will deny bosses their remuneration. They may have provided the capital, but the risks are also shared by employees, for if the company fails, the employees would be out of jobs, and have to find new jobs, start all over again,  worse for those 40 and above who sacrificed for such companies. Employees made profits possible.  Thus is it conscienable for bosses to take the lion's share in profits instead of splitting it with employees?</span></p>
              <p><span>If they need cheap to labour to compete in today's compettitive environment, then they probably do not have a good product for the market, and should die a natural biz death so as to save up resources for the next better player, and be one less competitor for better companies that take cares of the welfare of fellow citizens!.</span></p>
              <p><span>The LAW of supply and demand rulz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please write to your MPs so that over greedy capitalist bosses will not fool the masses again !!</span></p>
