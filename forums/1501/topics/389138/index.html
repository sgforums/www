              <p>i got mixed feelings abt this topic...</p>
              <p>i mean i do support the idea of the yellow ribbon. letting those convicted of crimes to rejoin the society and treating them the same...</p>
              <p>but then think again... would we wan someone who had committed robbery burgarly theft to be employed as our condo security? or our shopping centre security?</p>
              <p>how abt some1 who convicted of molesting or rape be employed as swimming instructors for instance? u wan let ur children be taught by him?</p>
              <p>u wan some1 who commited fraud or cheats or scams to work in ur financial or accounts department??</p>
              <p>u all say give them chances but it has to be compensated by the risks u have to take...</p>
              <p>as for casino.. it involves daily transaction of millions of dollars and one thing they wanna avoid is the 'ocean eleven'.. so i wun blame them for not wanting to hire ex criminals.</p>
              <p>well of cos we hv to give them chances as well rite.. i suggest not very sensitive departments like production, marketing, adminstrative, sales, etc..</p>
              <p>i dare say if tmr newspaper says that some XXX primary sch empoly an ex-criminal who was convicted of child molestion to teach in the sch as teacher,, i'm sure the topics wun be involving Yellow Ribbons, it will be more like MOE stupid, PAP Sucks, LKY go hell etc... haha</p>

              <p>To Starhawk and Ian :</p>
              <p><br>Not sure if it would be correct to think like you guys. The yellow ribbon campaign was undertaken simply to overcome that primitive mindset. Although I agree that the Government is just blatantly screwing themselves in the ass with this move, as an individual in a 21st century society we ought not act like barbarians.</p>
              <p>Consider these ex-convicts, denied proper employment. A ex-robber, ex-thieves, ex-conmen and frauds, human they are, they need to eat too. Without a salary, what are the chances they will return to their old ways to survive?</p>
              <p>Nearly 100% i tell you, and at that time, perhaps towards a society that refused to forgive them, they may have given up all hope of rehabilitation, and turns darker then before. Until then, will we, the society and country as a whole, be better off then denying these people who are trying to do good a chance at employment?</p>

              <p>Starhawk :</p>
              <p>Can't say I disagree with you, because this thorny issue has indeed two very feasible sides to it. Such as the one I have described as well as the thing you have said.</p>
              <p>Background checks are indeed necessary, as well as honest declarations from the staff, but I strongly feel they deserve a chance if they only have 1 occurence of any certain crime (robberies, frauds, thefts etc etc) and have served their respective sentences for it.</p>
              <p>If we're talking about repeat offenders, yes, I too do not think they deserve another shot at decent proper employment.</p>
              <p>Cheers,</p>
