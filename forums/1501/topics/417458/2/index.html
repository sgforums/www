              <p>Hi all again, I realise I have not made myself very clear in my initial post. So anyway, I'm gg to clarify some key points as raised in the previous posts in this thread.</p>
              <p>1. Position I'm applying for is ICA Senior Officer - its uniformed service - rank Inspector and above kind..pay is pretty good as far as I'm concerned.</p>
              <p>2. I'm not a fresh grad, have worked for a few years in my old job, but quit since a couple months back and been looking for new job till now. Just completed a part time degree, and thought of joining ICA because I quite interested in uniformed service..but since I'm not Pes A/ B, SCDF, SPF, SAF all those are out. Checked and found out ICA will accept those who are not Pes A/B.</p>
              <p>So well, really appreciate if someone can provide some constructive advice/ opinion on what its like to work in ICA. Thanks all.</p>

              <p>Have they already cleared you of your security clearance?</p>
              <p>If not don't be too happy yet as I have heard of people not
              clearing tehir security clearance even after being accepted for the
              job even though they are not bankrupt, did not commit crimes
              etc.</p>
              <p>They don't even know why they failed the security clearance</p>

              <p>their check your family's background and financial commitment too. not say only bankrupt people won't clear financial clearance.</p>
              <p>if you have alot of loan to service, e.g. housing loan, car loan etc, you might not be cleared too.</p>
