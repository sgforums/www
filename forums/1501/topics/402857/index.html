              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm asking this because I am offered a job and I wanna assess myself to see how much i really am worth so that I can ask for a salary that is suitable for me. I know i shouldn't be so worried about the pay at this very moment, afterall, i should be gaining experience first. But, i would like to work for what's worth and not be short-changed afterall.</p>
              <p>I am a fresh grad from NYP with a diploma in business IT (with merit), and a software development company is keen on hiring me to develop some of the iphone applications the company is engaged by their clients. I have no prior knowledge to mobile application development, but i have a pretty decent programming background. (A's for all my semester project during poly with one project awarded distinction).</p>
              <p>I feel that this is a very good opportunity because I will be given guidance on the job to help me progress with the projects i'll be engaged. As i will be leaving for NS some time in August, the company is willing to hire me for the 2 months and mentioned that they will pay me fresh poly grad salary.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure how much bargaining power I have in this position, but a couple of friends of mine suggested 1.7K - 1.8K. What are your views peeps?</p>

              <p>actually i was recommended via my lecturer. So the person in charge contacted me and was explaining to me about the company. I feel that they are keen and sincere in hiring me because i did mention upfront that i have no prior knowledge to programming iphone apps and that i will have to serve NS in 2 months time.  Despite the shortcomings, they are willing to pay fresh poly grad pay (which is why i wanna know the range) and even offered to allow me continue this job after army. Working hours are 10-6.30. At first, I thought it was a freelance job, so he said it was fine to work at home as long as i attend the project meeting. But i guess if i work full time for them, i'm expected to be in office?</p>
              <p>I sent them my resume and will be meeting them this monday.</p>

              <p>fussy? i wasn't trying to be difficult or anything. I think it is good to be honest and upfront about your own ability, rather than them hiring me to realise: "hey! you can't do this, you cannot do that.. why should i hire you in the first place?".</p>
              <p>My purpose is just to know what range are fresh poly grad like me getting for the job of developer so that i know if i am short changed. While I gain a lot more than just salary (basically acquiring new programming languages), i think nobody wants to work for a company that short change you right? Programming is no easy task, really.</p>
              <p>I did consider ditz's recommendation but looking at the number of 1.8K suggestion, i think if i'm even poped that question, i'll ask for about 1.5 - 1.7k? Actually, my main purpose is to just know what is the price range i would expect since the person in charge briefly said i that i would be paid "fresh poly grad" salary. Ultimately, I am more than willing to work for the company.</p>
              <p>Of course, I am honoured to be offered an opportunity and the company's willingness to open up this opportunity despite my various shortcomings.</p>
              <p> ANyways, i wanna thank all forumers who've given me your contributions =) I think i know where i stand now ^^ Thank you so very much!</p>

              <p>Hi, i;m an undergraduate Diploma in IT, Singapore Poly. I'm having my intern at a IT company near ur sch. My company boss wanted a iphone apps regarding puzzle shapes and i can tell u that we diploma students can't really do it. I'm not saying it's not impossible, u nid training and ample of time to do depending on the difficulty level. The syntax for iphone code is somehow like java, but it's confusing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Iphone apps developers are in demand as of today, it is the smartphone era. U nid a mac os to develop the iphone app. Do u have 1?</p>
              <p>I would suggest u to read up during ur ns time if u are really keen on the job.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, u will have absolutely no idea of what's the foundations are. I have a strong web developer colleague here. Our iphone apps, we hire experience developers to develop it. It's not easy.</p>

              <p>And, u are paid by months ? not per apps developed right?    1.8k is alot if u're not experienced. normally u develop an app, u can earn ard 2k for experience developers.</p>

              <p>from what i see you cannot  gauge how much yon are worth yet because you still have not completed your NS. Nor have you any actual working experience. Forget about your attachment. Your responsibility and commitment expectation then defers from peers working full time and has already accumulated experience. as ling as you have not gone through NS, or going over the exemptin stage you are still not coonsidered a working adult. Not going through NS even as a lobo Pes F means you must be having real serious health problems or maybe even a keng king type.</p>
              <p>got and serve NS before you even ask for a gage on your working experience</p>

              Firstly, I commend you that you are working even though you are going to enter the army in two months time. That is great discipline. 
              
              However, with regards to the pay, I would rather you stick to a conservative figure say 1.3-5k. Honestly, you are only going to be there for 2 months, so how much will the diff in salary cost you. Rather than looking at short term gains, you should be looking at how this experience will aid in your resume and make you look better when you get a full time job in the future. 
              
              Think far, good luck.

              <p>Since you are recommended by your lecturer, it is preferably to quote them a salary range with the minimum salary as the starting polytechnic graduate pay and the maximum your desired salary. This shows you are confident with the job.</p>
              <p>However, opting for a higher salary may displayed over-confident when you have no prior experience on the job and may further jeopardise your chance of your potential growth with the company. Good Luck.</p>

              <p><br>I have two main reasons for doing so. Firstly, i don't think it is right to sit at home and wait for money to either fall from the sky or ask from my mum. If i want to spend money, i should and ought to earn my own.</p>
              <p>Of course, like anyone, I want to earn some experience while I still have the time to. At least my future employer would not see me as a person who skives; I am always actively working when I have a free time. This is to eliminate questions like: Why aren't you working during your 6 months break? (They probably wouldn't find out i have a long holiday, but if they do ask similar questions like: So what did you do between your graduation and army?, i would be able to answer them)</p>
              <p>I know I'm probably thinking too far ahead, but i do not want to potray myself as a lazy couch potato etc, employer or not.</p>

              <p>When i say experience, it doesn't have to be solely the programme i am exposed to right? Even if it is IT, i believe that no matter how rapidly technology progresses, the foundation is the same.  Well, i understand that you're not asking for an answer- probably just cautioning me to what reality is.</p>
              <p>But i just feel that i would be at a slight edge compared to others if i already know how working on a project is like. On top of that, I see working as a great social networking tool. I might not be working in the same field after uni afterall, and if i ever switched field and my company needs to outsource certain niche projects, i know who to look for and things alike.</p>
              <p>But i do agree with you that in order to keep salary minimal, employers will find any fault just to even save a penny.</p>

              <p>I think it was a pleasure knowing that you guys are sharing your view on this. Now, i have better understanding on the pay i should expect. Anyway, i might not even have a chance to bargain, there are not interview per se to begin with.</p>
              <p>My purpose is know what I would expect and if, by any chance, the person in charge pops me the question during tomorrow's "discussion", or if he initiates an offer, i know if i should open my mouth or to keep mum.</p>
              <p>Still, i would like to take this opportunity for everyone's contribution. I really learn a lot from you guys. Thank You.</p>

              <p>Finally, I would like to thank buddha, my lecturer and the company for an opportunity to experience working life and the learning of a niche (and new) skillset which may give my resume a boost.</p>

              <p>Just saw your post, tot i give 2 pennies worth of advise.</p>
              <p>Im a HR professional and Recruiter for 6-8 years. The benchmark for a fresh diploma grad is $1.7-$2K. Thats the benchmark for most IT MNCs. As you have a merit some MNCs might give you up to $2.1K but u wun get anything more than that I can assure you unless what you are doing requires unique skillset.</p>
              <p>Theres are some "premium " companies wh are willing to pay more than mkt value for talents which they identify according to good academic results or positive attributes whom they think will lead to success in the company. These companies are Apple, Microsoft and Google. Generally they can pay way above mkt rates for talents and they r the ones who drag up the salary benchmark in the It industry drastically. Let me know if you need further advise</p>

UNtil he tranversed on more lands then he can explain based on another persepctive.

              <p>But 2 months preparing his mind and body physically for NS may make a difference.</p>
              <p>Also sourcing and project management based on knowing people is no good. youhave to know the right people. if all the sources you know or work with before are screwed up cases isay forget about it. Project management and programming is two different field. Also people;s thoughts and priority changes with time.</p>
              <p>when iw as younger i had thoughts of signing on with the amy. later when i started work i realised i did not make the msiatke in doing so. and i learn to like NS only when i get called up for ICT and take a break fro work.</p>
