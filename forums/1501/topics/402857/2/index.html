              <p>Just saw your post, tot i give 2 pennies worth of advise.</p>
              <p>Im a HR professional and Recruiter for 6-8 years. The benchmark for a fresh diploma grad is $1.7-$2K. Thats the benchmark for most IT MNCs. As you have a merit some MNCs might give you up to $2.1K but u wun get anything more than that I can assure you unless what you are doing requires unique skillset.</p>
              <p>Theres are some "premium " companies wh are willing to pay more than mkt value for talents which they identify according to good academic results or positive attributes whom they think will lead to success in the company. These companies are Apple, Microsoft and Google. Generally they can pay way above mkt rates for talents and they r the ones who drag up the salary benchmark in the It industry drastically. Let me know if you need further advise</p>

              <p>Ouch, this came a little late.. But nonetheless, thanks for your information ^^ My boss offered approx. 1.4k (b4 cpf) and i guess i wasn't in any greater position to ask for more; i have no idea how to program his required project.</p>
              <p>But sometimes, it's not just about the pay that matters. I think i have pretty much a flexible working hours. While he said that the official working time is 10 to 6.30, he is fine with me working from home if i do not wish to travel to the office (although travel time is usually about 40 mins to office, but travelling home is another story - 1 hr: Ask SBS) So far, i made my own hours 10.30 to 6.15, which i think most bosses in Singapore would consider me as a lazy bum, right?</p>
              <p>More over, i get a pretty decent view of Singapore's beautiful landscape and skyline since i'm sitting right at the last row at the window. I don't see a reason not going to the office, haha!</p>
              <p>Most importantly, and probably what shocked me most, was when i told him i have no understanding of the mobile phone environment, and shared that the internet actually shortlisted a couple of titles which may be useful and i couldn't find it at Borders, he immediately went to Funan to search for it and even paid for the books.</p>
              <p>He did share with me during my "interview", or some may like to call it discussion, that he wants to move towards the Americans' working style (just like oracle does) of having the flexibility of employees not working in the office. This is, i guess, by far the type of "remunerations" most MNCs in Singapore is not able to give. I exclude private banking managers.</p>

              <p>Surprisingly, most hospitals in singapore give only half and hour for meal times for their staff. More surprisingly, mine also happens to be officially half and hour only, as in my employment letter. They say the additional 30mins is a privilege.</p>

              <p><br>A few possibilities i can think of, but they are definitely not as vulgar as you are no matter which case they belong to, haha.</p>
              <p>1. Your working attitude sucks to the down right core, why should i give you the privilege? (Anyway, your attitude in the forum doesn't please to begin with, pretty much reflect your personal attitude.)</p>
              <p>2. You're a lazy bum, always not meeting deadlines, letting you work from home is as good as dismissing you but still giving you salary. Convince me why you cannot meet deadline in office and will be able to do so from home.</p>
              <p>3. Your company is "American" in name, but is a small firm trying to go medium in reality.</p>
              <p>4. Your firm's sales' not doing so great, infer why from reasons 1 and 2; most probable, likely, and logical explanation.</p>
              <p>5. You're just plain lying because your own job suck and you're jealous that new blood like us are getting better, higher pay than you.</p>
              <p>6. You're just plain lying because you didn't had the bargaining power like we did, so trying to spoil the market, which boils down to the 5th point.</p>
              <p>7. You're an owner of your own company and do not have the capital to pay what other organizations are paying, so you want to spoil the market so people who work for you naturally losses the bargaining power.</p>
              <p>By the way, half AN hour and half AND hour are 2 things. Get your ANs and ANDs right! Half an hour effectively means half of one hour, i.e. 30 mins, and half and hour, lol, i don't know, you explain to me.</p>
              <p>If i really have to force the most logical reasoning, half and hour, in my opinion, means 1 hour + 30 mins. So are you inferring that nurses and certain selected executives are getting 1hour 30 mins of lunch break? That's good to hear, is Singapore's economic that great to give such good remunerations to its people? Tell me which hospital is doing that, i'll change my degree course to medicine so i get to be a doctor.</p>
              <p>And if they are so well treated, why are you saying it's all that bad?</p>
