              <p>Firstly, you have to asked yourself on what is the expected salary that you are looking for and whether the job that you are doing is something that you like to do for the rest of the life.</p>
              <p>If you are just concerned about your pay and have no passion about your job, it is better that you go to find a higher paid job to meet your rising living needs.</p>
              <p>If you still love your job and you want a bigger pay packet, you can talk to your boss on how you can improve to handle more responsibilities so that he can justify your promotion when the appraisal period come along.</p>
              <p>There is no right or wrong answer when asking for more money but never threaten your boss with a resignation.</p>

              <p>x2. If u go, he will employ another new guy. If new guy good, he will pick up exactly where u left off, if bad, need more time only nia.</p>
              <p>Because there will be always ppl who are also doing the exact same stuff u are doing. I remember a case, one guy started the whole project, he is the only one know the thing inside out, he thought he was indispensable, boasting that the company needs him but when he left, the new guy that company employed just took one week to know everything liao because they employed someone that is of the same calibre and experience.</p>
              <p>Even high end research work, professors, researchers get replaced easily, so no one is really indispensable.</p>
