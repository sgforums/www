              <p>Just curious, but everytime I read in newspapers about Admin Exec positions in various companies, can someone roughly tell me what are the norm / average qualifications needed?</p>
              <p>i've been an admin / operations assistant at 3 different companies for approx 3 years.</p>
              <p>i wonder if 3 years of experience is enough to apply for admin exec position?</p>
              <p>btw, i've only O' levels + basic diploma in Marketing (MDIS). No accouting knowledge.</p>
              <p>need to study accounts to qualify for admin exec?</p>

              <p>it depends really.</p>
              <p>for my company.</p>
              <p>executive refers to a personnel who is able to make decisions and execute these decisions. He is supposed to take charge of the administration and manage 2-3 personnels under him.</p>
              <p>Criterias for us would be.</p>
              <p>O lvl/A lvl with 5 years relevant working experience</p>
              <p>Diploma with 3 years relevant working experience.</p>
              <p>Degree with 3 years relevant working experience.</p>
              <p>but its so commonly used elsewhere, when even a salesman is called a marketing executive.</p>

              <p>u have to ask the company what is their requirements.</p>
              <p>coz the set of requirements are for my company.</p>
              <p>There are companies that are willing to take nurture fresh graduates/personnels with limited experience. they are also willing to send you for training and stuff.</p>
              <p>There are also companies that want an experienced personnel to come in and start work immediately with minimal supervision.</p>
              <p>If whenever in doubt, call up and enquire.</p>

              <p>You study to acquire the knowledge and put it to good use.</p>
              <p>Its not about passing exams =).</p>
              <p>for your case, u may endure the few months to learn accounting, but what if, your job requires u to do accounts for years to come. Its not longer an enjoyable thingy to do.</p>

              <p>for me, 80% of the time, i get stunned when i see those claims settlements, those work orders, those billing invoice stuff........see already so complicated like rocket science.</p>

              <p><br>Hi , if u are interested to get a higher post. You can send your application and find out more during the interview. Cos' you are not opting for an accounting job , i think this job wont require too much of technical accounting skills. Even if the job contains some elements of accounting knowledge , i think the job scoope will still be far from an accountant. It will be a manageable one. If u manage to get the job , you can choose to further your studies in marketing and ask for internal transfer if you are interested of a vacancy available in your firm.</p>

              <p>thanks a lot for the valuable advice, guys!</p>
              <p>yeah, i know admin exec salary isn't very high (probably only in S$1700 -  S$1900 range), but it's better than admin asst and it's the next logical upgrade for admin assts.</p>
              <p>and yes, admin job gets very repetitive after a while and now, in my pos as admin asst, the job scope i repeat every day till i want to sleep.</p>
              <p>i don't have an interest in any of the subjects (accounting, engineering etc.), so i can't really find a suitable course to take up. haiz.......</p>
              <p>actually, i like IT lah, but IT to a certain extent, especially at degree-level (Bachelor in Computer Science), gets very mathetical and boring; i would say even harder than accounting.</p>
              <p>but then, no choice mah......in my case, i work for salary and to survive, then spend the money on leisure and hobbies.</p>
              <p>other people happen to have a discipline they like (HR, engineering, computing, graphic design etc.), so a job to them = hobby.</p>
              <p>meaning they go to work everyday = go to play</p>
              <p>for me, since i don't have such a thing, go admin loh......most general route mah.</p>
