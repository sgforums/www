              <p>I don't know about him, but I avoid all non essential services if it's not a local.</p>
              <p>in fact my only credit cards were signed because the person who asked me on the streets was a sinkie who told me he needed to hit the target. yes I hung up on all others who call me by phone and esspecially with a non local accent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I actually avoid food stalls manned by PRCs unless I know the person in question personally.</p>
              <p>too many incidents of walking out of a toliet and seeing the guy in front of me walk out of his stall and back to the food court without washing hands.</p>

              <p>It is quite the opposite, most workers that I know who come here
              are highly skilled and well educated, which is why they were
              offered a position in the first place. </p>
              <p>Why would a Singaporean employer offer an foreigner a position
              if he or she could employ a local? In my case it was because I had
              over 20 years experience in the industry and the other candidates
              did not! That's all!</p>

              <p>you  must be moving around in a very special circle then, most that I know off don't seem to have any special skills. well educated yes. but as for carrying out the tasks they leave much to desired</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in my ex company , it was the exact opposite. not irish though, just the french and american.</p>
              <p>and sadly they were hired for face value. put into a valuable and prominent position so that customers can see a white face to make the business look "modern and advanced"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the american probably had more than 20years(not young? I'll say he's probably in his 50s or 60s). but his colleagues facepalmed and felt he belonged to a different era whenver he speaks about work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I actually feel that other then the really high flying ones who can bring in contacts</p>
              <p>and the one who can bring in a gung ho attitude with a different cultural perspective.</p>
              <p>everyone else is pretty much useless.</p>

              <p>Viveliber - I think maybe if you feel that you were laid off because your boss prefers foreigners you should take action, because that is not ethical. </p>
              <p>Storywolf - Thank you for your research in to my country and it's job market, but I feel that if you dig a little deeper you can find these kinds of articles for most countries. I am sure in Ireland we do require skills from from foreigners that a local cannot do. In that case I think its a good thing to import talent. Just as my company has done, which is why I am working in Singapore now. </p>
              <p>Maybe Storywolf you fear foreigners because you doubt your own skills, because if you and Viveliber performed well in your jobs your boss would not have laid you off, it has nothing to do with foreigner. </p>
