              <p>Viveliber - I think maybe if you feel that you were laid off because your boss prefers foreigners you should take action, because that is not ethical. </p>
              <p>Storywolf - Thank you for your research in to my country and it's job market, but I feel that if you dig a little deeper you can find these kinds of articles for most countries. I am sure in Ireland we do require skills from from foreigners that a local cannot do. In that case I think its a good thing to import talent. Just as my company has done, which is why I am working in Singapore now. </p>
              <p>Maybe Storywolf you fear foreigners because you doubt your own skills, because if you and Viveliber performed well in your jobs your boss would not have laid you off, it has nothing to do with foreigner. </p>

              <p>Second, most white men are in our part of the world because they couldn't make it back home. The rate of unemployment in the western world is really bad. Ireland's is around 15%. Could be higher if their natives return home. So, there you go.</p>

              <p><br>you wouldn't know. for the lower skilled blu collar jobs, HR sometimes have to balance the number of foriegners versus locals within the organisation, they can;'t take more, not less. becasue our sg foreign cheap labor policies are too opoen arse. sometimes it may be also politics, local bosses wants more sgreans and lesser cheap labor at times so durig retrancement some of the sgreans can go first he still secure his job. as for executives and managers, sometimes and many times its politics, more in place now, and sometimes its about circumstances - example, company wanna break inot a market and need foreigner with the same natuionality or race so as to have some influence over. its not a virgin clean world out there i tell you.</p>
