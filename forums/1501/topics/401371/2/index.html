              <p>These are my take on GLC.....</p>
              <p>Since you've already done 13th yrs cycle that means you are beyond 40 yrs of age....too old to induct so they won't call you up. </p>
              <p>If you wrote in and not accepted than you should not waste further energy to apply....</p>
              <p>At some point in your past your PSLE education was not as good as it expected to be....that of course has nothing to reflect your abilities to perform in your profession.</p>

              <p>The guy who committed suicide isn't a scholar, he is a farmer aka a local grad.</p>
              <p>In the civil service, only the elite tier of scholars managed by PSC and sent overseas are scholars. The rest are farmers. That "scholarship" the guy who died had wasn't even prestigious. Give to the real scholars for "free" without bond they also think it's not good enough as toilet paper to the wipe their asses.</p>
              <p>The reason you don't know this, is because you're a superfarmer - a term reserved for the lower tier of the farmers.</p>
              <p>One of the two people who joined the opposition party, was a real scholar. You may want to know that a portion (about say, 40%) of PSC's top scholars do leave the service after their bonds and are channelled to the private sector. It's not a shocker. The government never intended for all of them to remain in public service forever, so that there would be a more even distribution of talent. In fact a few years ago responding to numerous complaints that the scholarship system was hogging all of the country's top bright sparks, a suggestion by Tony Tan to pay for the overseas education of all PSC scholars but channel 1/2 in every batch to the private sector (bond them to work in Singapore's private sector for 6 years but in any company they like) was raised. The suggestion was later rejected because the government believes it isn't really an issue, as close to half of its top scholars leave for the private sector and that it should continue to have first priority over the top stock and first fruits. When that woman Hazel Poa joined the opposition party, she had already left the Admin Service over 10 years.</p>
              <p>And please lah you peasant condemned loser, not everyone joins the opposition because they are losers eg farmers Chee Soon Juan and sister, Chiam See Tong, etc. There are actually two intelligent Oxbridge elites who joined the opposition Hazel Poa, Kenneth Jeyaratnam because of an overly and drastic unbalanced distribution of talent resulting in a limp-wristed opposition, if not non existent check and balance mechanism. Even an idiot like you can see that the opposition parties have historically been staffed by a bunch of retarded, deranged swines or low brow average uncle joes like Chee (the former) and Low Tia Kiang (latter), and the situation was desperately dire and in favour of one ruling party, do you think smart people like Poa and K Jeya dunno?! </p>
              <p>The PAP has only maintained its power over the last three decades by creaming off the top of the every cohort and bringing them into its fold. And the formula has worked flawlessly. Now the RP has wised up and is ready to use PAP's own weapons of its intellectual elite against themselves. Use your enemy's weapons against himself, how shrewd.</p>
              <p>There is an impending groundswell, and there will be more of outspoken scholars who not only are the intellectual cream of the crop, but also had the strategic advantage of having been a part of the system to understand it through and through, joining the opposition parties in future.</p>
              <p>Peter Ho, watch out for the tide. It's happening..nothing's gonna change it. And you have only yourselves to blame for opening the floodgates and stinking up the palace with swines from the farms.. Time to reap the rewards. </p>

              <p>from what i see sg gahmen not idiots. even local scholars on
                      scholarship they may be paid most of the education fees but after
                      ompleting the studies they have to filfill their bond in working
                      with gahmen as 'cheap' labor for the bond period unless they break
                      it and have to pay back the money gahmen gave them to study. i
                      believe the same applies for any overseas one. as for those foreign
                      students come here study good that gahmen recently increased their
                      fees. but still they come <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>what the hell are "local scholars"? only those who attend Ivy League/Oxbridge and other top universities aka OVERSEAS ones are regarded as scholars. This distinction is not only present in the public sector, it's also present in the private organisations that award scholarships eg SIA, PSA, GIC, SPH.</p>
              <p>If you want to break the bond, you should of course pay what is owed. This is just simple logic, there is nothing to question about something so fundamentally intuitive,whether its a cheap ass useless $30k education to farmer university (NUS, NTU) or a real scholarship, they are worth $300k to $500k in value, do you know? The terms are "we pay for your prestigious expensive education and expenses, and you come back to work for us while we groom you". If the scholar (real one) decides to renege on 'the come back and work with us' part, obviously he should pay for his education which he otherwise wouldn't have needed to if he had stuck to the contract. By working for six years, you're not even paying back with your time, since you're paid a full salary when you're back at work to serve your bond anyway and enjoy the privilege of having your career tracked and groomed. In fact, you're not paying in any way at all, other than mobility. It's amazing there are such stupid dipshits around, i've not met any in my real life social circle ever. You're just a stupid peasant dipshit. This is why the Singapore government will continue to groom the best and brightest minds of the country. Because it's well aware of the depth of stupidity of the regular man, just savour this sad shiny example. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>And if we're talking about real scholars here, the only people regarded as scholars by the govt..the SAFOS, OMS folks...'cheap labour'? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> they are paid more than any other profession comparing age by age. Of cos little peasant dipshits like you are never privy to this information. Their pay is easily three times that of the average professional of the same age, and double that of the most lucrative private sector employee professions like med and law. You're just a pathetic little peasant frog in the well, it's always a joke when froggy dipshits like you show off your ignorance and the stinky well u've lived in all your life proudly.</p>

              <p>From you posts, I can see where your problem lies.</p>
              <p>You have no depth. You most likely failed at the interview stage.</p>
              <p>The post is a managerial post, the PR probably displayed more maturity than you.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can work better than him, or he can work better than you, we will never know.</p>
              <p>With almost equal qualifications, the interviewers might have felt the PR is the  better person.</p>
              <p>Yourself, as a person with supposedly managerial skills, you rant like a yokel.</p>
