              <p>I alway try to apply for job in garment sector or GLC
               but alway
              unsuccessful .. 1st is becos I dun have a good qualification .. but
              I am defintlely as capable and diligent in my work...2nd  i
              just do not have a right connection or know the right people to get
              the job I want, so i lose out all the time ,, recently i apply for
              a job .. and came to know the job went to a FT , a PR , feel really
              sad that a true blue singaporean like me who has served 2.5 years
              of NS, burned many weekend, sweat in brunei jungle  to defend
              the country  and  done 13 cycle of ICT and contribute 20
              years of income tax .. is not favor over a PR who came to SG
              probably recentlyto enjoy the security and prosperity I have
              contributed in a little way .. just hope in future employer from
              garment sector can give priority to pple who has contributed to the
              country not someone who has better qualification from other
              country</p>

              <p>Hi, I guess the problems are here:</p>
              <p>1) 
              Don't have good qualifications<br> Govt sector.... paper qualifications are very usually the first 
              filter...</p>
              <p>2) Do not have a right connection or know the right 
              people to get
              the job I want<br> You might need to interact more?</p>
              <p>3) Recently i apply for
              a job .. and came to know the job went to a FT , a PR<br> There are too many factors to consider. 1 possible factor could be your 
              age. You mentioned 20 yrs of income tax. Suppose you start work at 20, 
              you will be 40 yrs old at least. Middle age crisis perhaps?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm afraid to say I can't help much as I'm only going to be 27. But I will wish you the best of luck as it will be really tough for you to find jobs given the circumstances you have listed.</p>

              <p>That's not very true. Do they start at $8/mth salary with few months bonus to add on? There are professions that start at that, comparing age by age.</p>
              <p>But of course, we did not look at job scope, stress level, responsibility, stability, etc <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
