              <p><strong>More job seekers refusing job offers: survey</strong><br> <span class="update">By Saifulbahri Ismail | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 29 June 2010 1508 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Many Singapore employers are getting rejections from 
              candidates whom they've made offers to, given the buoyant job market.
              <br> <br> According to recruitment firm, Hudson, 40 per cent of employers in 
              Singapore it surveyed said that candidates had declined offers of jobs 
              made to them in the last six months. 
              <br> <br> This is almost twice as many as the 21 per cent who said that they had 
              not received any refusals at all in this period.
              <br> <br> And as hiring expectations continue to rise, workers will be spoilt for 
              choice.
              <br> <br> Hudson's Executive GM, Georgie Chong, said this makes the recruitment 
              process more challenging. 
              <br> <br> "That good candidate in the current market is going to be very protected
               by the current employer. If you look at Europe and the US, the economic
               outlook there is still weak. Therefore, most of the growth is going to 
              be piled into Asia. The budget for Asia is more aggressive compared to 
              the headquarters," said Chong. 
              <br> <br> The single most important reason for refusing a job offer was the 
              expectation of higher salaries. 
              <br> <br> However, Chong pointed out that employers would be willing to meet these
               expectations for key positions.
              <br> <br> She added that companies may need to pay at least 20 per cent more to 
              attract these candidates.
              <br> <br> Chong said: "In certain sectors, for example in banking, compliance 
              roles for instance where we need very specialist knowledge or critical 
              revenue generation positions, and faced with a very tight talent pool, 
              candidates have an upper hand. 
              <br> <br> "We've even offered candidates 30 - 40 per cent more but they still 
              won't move because their employers come back with very aggressive 
              counter measures." 
              <br> <br> Such counter offers from the present employer are a significant issue, 
              being mentioned by 38 per cent of employers in the survey.
              <br> <br> The Hudson Report also indicated that many employers recognise they must
               increase salaries to retain top talent.
              <br> <br> Nearly half of respondents are prepared to offer increments of more than
               10 per cent.
              <br> <br> Other reasons cited for turning down job offers include candidates 
              having accepted job offers from other companies. 
              <br> <br> In addition, the report showed that hiring expectations in Singapore are
               at their highest levels in nearly a decade.
              <br> <br> 57 per cent of respondents across all sectors forecast headcount growth 
              in the third quarter. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p>i spoken to alot of headhunters since i am back. The job market pick up unevenly ......the banking sector is picking up but the job availabilities are mainly in sales and not alot of people want to take up, also these position don't pay well.</p>
              <p>As for other post for professional manager.....I can only said that salaries has dropped.</p>
              <p>If you can look at jobstreet.com......manager position only required 1 - 3 yrs experiences that means companies are unwilling to pay.</p>
              <p>Service providers salaries are equally bad that reflects the low profit margins.</p>
              <p>It is still employers market. I hope in a few months things will get better.....before recession hit in 2011.</p>
              <p>I agreed that this report is misleading........ </p>
              <p>oh by the way as for wages --  always relatives to the cost of Living. So back to square one argument.---- Housing and Transportation,  </p>
