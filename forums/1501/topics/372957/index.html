              <p>Write down all 3 jobs but write that it is all temp jobs and hope that the new company will not do any reference check on your ex companies?</p>

              <p>say "the grass is always greener on the other side". lol i don't know , i'd write all. even though you had short jobs, you did have collective experience, that should count for smth right.</p>
              <p>(ok i dunno abt other kinds of jobs cos i'm a graphic designer, job hopping and freelancing is super common. in our economy now, it probably applies to all unless you're really experienced and considered a GEM to your company. )</p>

              <p>It is only once in a while like once a year or maybe once in 2 years time that they employ people so they can spend the time to do a check on the ex companies.</p>

              <p>well this company I used to work for, is not once or twice a year recruitment exercise. its every once, twice and a few months type. for SME companies, employees are always on the lookout for better jobs and companies to work for. I remembered for this manager, who quitted after 3 weeks lol. nobody knows why she quitted after 3 weeks? probably found better prospects elsewhere</p>

              <p><br>if 1 of the job that you have worked is a government job and the next job you apply for is a government job too, high chances that they will check and find out that you are lieing that it is not a temp job because civil service is closely connected..</p>

              <p>afterall your job is not that vital and if you are to quit, he/she can always employ people to take your place. even CEO's are not indispensable mind you. if the company sacked its CEO, there are others who can take his place as CEO.</p>
