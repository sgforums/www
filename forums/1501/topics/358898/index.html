              <p>Got alot of people say when you apply for government job, they will check everything of your background.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Check whether you got criminal record, check your past employment history, check if you have any serious physical or mental illness etc</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anyone here know if this is true?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because there are so many people applying for government jobs and many of them are for low positions such as jobs for O level or diploma holder. If everyone of them they also want to check until so detailed, than must be very tiring for them..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Say you work in government job before. Say is just a normal position for diploma holder. You did something wrong or performance no good and youy get sack. You proceed on to apply for another government job but you did not declare that you got work and got sack by your previous government job. Maybe you leave thaty period blank and say that you were doing your own business, relaxing etc during that period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will the new government company really go and check and than find out that you are lying?</p>

              <p>Civil service will not sack u that easily. To qualify for sack, u must have broken the law or u did not turn up for work.</p>
              <p>I thnk if u apply for jobs in  non uniformed law and enforcement departments or sections of the civil service dealing with money , they may screen u throughly. Examples are CID, CNB,  CPIB, CAD, ISD,  ect</p>
              <p>As for your perfor mance rating , they will give u average even though u are poor performer. BTW tthere is a high chance that they might check with yr previous place u worked with. So ur previous place will have given u a testimony earlier and stick to it , the nest time someone calls them and enquire. But again your former superior may not be there and a new person may have taken over..  But i also heard of people with juvenile criminal records working in civil service . It depends on what offence u did, if it is a serious one or a repeat offender, they may not employ u based on yr record. And also if u have a criminal record and remained crime free for a period of time and u have upgraded yr education qualifications, their impression may change of u. U can reason out that u improve yourself and want to live a decent life now, might give u a chance. They have to, cos if they dont, no one else will. They are the govt.</p>
              <p>Btw there a lots of slackers in civil service too. Not too much to be concerned about.</p>
