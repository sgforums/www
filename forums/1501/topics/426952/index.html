              Short Biography of Bill Gates 
              Leaving Harvard to start his own company called Microsoft, Bill Gates the programmer soon became Bill Gates the CEO. With his fervent business practices, along with his ingenious marketing schemes, Bill Gatesâ€™ software soon became the standard operating system for most computers worldwide. 
              
              Being born into a wealthy family didnâ€™t mean that Bill Gates had his world handed to him on a silver platter. Although his parents did pay for his schooling, they did not endow him with any trust funds or invest in any of his business ventures. In elementary and high school, he excelled in math and sciences. It was in high school that he was commissioned to write programming with other students for a national company called COBOL. Following his preparatory schooling, he scored well enough on his tests to attend Harvard with a focus on computer science. 
              
              In 1975, Gates and fellow classmate Allen wrote programming for a new microcomputer platform. It was this design and the sale of their BASIC software rights that allowed Gates and Allen to start Microsoft Corporation. As Gatesâ€™ software programs gained popularity, so did his business practices of requiring payment for the software they developed. Before, software was an â€˜open-sourceâ€™ system that could be downloaded for free by any user. However, with Gates at the lead, other corporations began following suit â€“ everyone would have to pay a license to use their new platform. And, with the advent of the PC-DOS program and the soon released MS-DOS that would run on IBM computers, his future software dealings and distribution were sealed.
              
              One of the best business moves Gates made was to make sure all computers came with Windows pre-installed. This meant that users would have instant access to the software and it would be an inclusive purchase with the hardware. During his later years, Microsoft came under governmental scrutiny for these business practices. Gates was elusive in his testimony and questioned the true definition and meanings of words, namely â€˜distributionâ€™ and â€˜competeâ€™. 
              
              When the court ruled that Microsoft had been unfair and had created a monopoly, Microsoft had to work even harder to maintain its place on the competitive totem pole of software distribution. 
              
              In other business dealings, it has been calculated that Bill Gates has donated over one-third of his wealth, currently surpassing 100 billion U.S. dollars, to charities through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2008, Gates plans on retiring from Microsoft while still holding his CEO status. He has plans to continue his charitable donations for AIDS, the United Negro College Fund and other scholarships, and international programs. After being named one of Time Magazineâ€™s most influential people for several years, he has also garnished other awards, including honorary doctorates and humanitarian awards.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Short Biography of Bill Gates<br> Leaving Harvard to start his own company called Microsoft, Bill
              Gates the programmer soon became Bill Gates the <span>CEO</span>. With his fervent business practices, along with his
              ingenious marketing schemes, Bill Gates’ software soon became the
              standard operating system for most computers worldwide.</p>
              <p>Being born into a wealthy family didn’t mean that Bill Gates had
              his world handed to him on a silver platter. Although his parents
              did pay for his schooling, they did not endow him with any trust
              funds or invest in any of his business ventures. In elementary and
              high school, he excelled in math and sciences. It was in high
              school that he was commissioned to write programming with other
              students for a national company called <span>COBOL</span>.
              Following his preparatory schooling, he scored well enough on his
              tests to attend Harvard with a focus on computer science.</p>
              <p>In 1975, Gates and fellow classmate Allen wrote programming for
              a new microcomputer platform. It was this design and the sale of
              their <span>BASIC</span> software rights that allowed
              Gates and Allen to start Microsoft Corporation. As Gates’ software
              programs gained popularity, so did his business practices of
              requiring payment for the software they developed. Before, software
              was an ‘open-source’ system that could be downloaded for free by
              any user. However, with Gates at the lead, other corporations began
              following suit – everyone would have to pay a license to use their
              new platform. And, with the advent of the PC-DOS program and the
              soon released MS-DOS that would run on <span>IBM</span> computers, his future software dealings and distribution were
              sealed.</p>
              <p>One of the best business moves Gates made was to make sure all
              computers came with Windows pre-installed. This meant that users
              would have instant access to the software and it would be an
              inclusive purchase with the hardware. During his later years,
              Microsoft came under governmental scrutiny for these business
              practices. Gates was elusive in his testimony and questioned the
              true definition and meanings of words, namely ‘distribution’ and
              ‘compete’.</p>
              <p>When the court ruled that Microsoft had been unfair and had
              created a monopoly, Microsoft had to work even harder to maintain
              its place on the competitive totem pole of software
              distribution.</p>
              <p>In other business dealings, it has been calculated that Bill
              Gates has donated over one-third of his wealth, currently
              surpassing 100 billion U.S. dollars, to charities through the Bill
              and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2008, Gates plans on retiring from
              Microsoft while still holding his <span>CEO</span> status.
              He has plans to continue his charitable donations for <span>AIDS</span>, the United Negro College Fund and other
              scholarships, and international programs. After being named one of
              Time Magazine’s most influential people for several years, he has
              also garnished other awards, including honorary doctorates and
              humanitarian awards.</p>

              <p>so if u cant diagnose stuff accurately....i would say u are a fake psychologist or a failed psychologist.</p>
              <p>hey ged...dun waste yer time in oz.the aussies seldom pay for failed headshrinks like u.u neither have any business nor are u goin anywhere with yer profession.</p>

              <p>Sure, sure.  You make an absolute mint playing with those silly things you keep crapping on about in Shoutbox, right?  You know, "oh, that jelly didn't set - time to go eat laksa" and other such earth-shattering newsflashes. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Oh, and if you have an inferiority complex, you're usually the last one to see it, so your bleating about not having one don't mean jack, sport. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>
              <p>All anyone needs to do is look at your rambling to see that you're full of crap - shall we go into how you have shamelessly admitted that you can't even pass IPPT and yet you want to tell everyone about your SOF/Navy Seals/Duke Nukem fantasies? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm in need of amusement.  Please repeat that little fantasy about how you earned somebody else a billion dollars by making toys, and how you got suckered into walking away without a single cent, just like the big-time tycoon that you claim to be. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
