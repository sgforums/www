              <p>New task can't be easy and difficult to do, I meant new task could either be easy or difficult.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I have no idea what I want. My job scope as per defined in the last performance appraisal would make me a Jack of all trades but master of none. However, that is set to change as boss has different thinkings and would like me to fly solo, by end of this year or start of next year.</p>
              <p>Me, on other hand, decides to use put this "Jack of all trades" to good use. I'm given quite a few areas to specialize, and I've chosen experimentation as my preferred choice. This allows me to make use of my "Jack of all trades" good point and help the company in the best possible way.</p>
              <p>With the new task, I somehow feel that I may be thrown off track, however, at the same time, it complements with my current tasks (because it will directly or indirectly affect my work).</p>
              <p>By the way, boss has no idea how the new task would be like, but has given me a couple of scenarios to ponder over.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Easy to do, not-so-tight deadlines<br></li>
              <li>Easy to do, with tight deadlines<br></li>
              <li>Difficult to do, not-so-tight deadlines<br></li>
              <li>Difficult to do, with tight deadlines (the worst he can think of, which could likely mean giving up all or most of current tasks and concentrate on this, not an option I would like to consider at this time)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The other 3 scenarios give much more room to consider, and whether, at a later stage to take it up permanently. If new personnel are not hired, obviously I don't have a choice of taking it up temporarily.</p>
              <p>As for promotion chances, I'm not looking forward towards this. I've got no interest in management stuffs. I'm more interested in becoming a master of a domain. Promotion chances has no effect on what choice I make.</p>

              <p>Will of course want to climb, but the aim is not to hit management level.</p>
              <p>I did think about this before, but other than pay and a nice rank, nothing else is attractive. In this company, quite a lot of changes are brought out by non-management staffs, the job satisfaction level is higher.</p>
              <p>Management will still give ideas and implement them, but it's a once in a while thing, don't quite see the point of hitting this level.</p>

              <p>Me: If it's challenging enough, then will take it up. If it's going to affect current work, not much chance of me taking it up in the long run. Will need a few months to decide on this, when I officially take over colleague's work...</p>
