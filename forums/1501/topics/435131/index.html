              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: 
              Singapore's unemployment rate rose to 2.1 per cent in June from 1.9 per 
              cent in March as employment growth slows and graduates enter the job 
              market.<br><br>The latest statistics show the labour market easing but 
              experts said that's not surprising, given the phenomenal economic growth
               Singapore saw last year.<br><br>Total employment grew by 22,800 in Q2 - about 20 per cent lower compared to the previous quarter of 28,300. <br><br>Services led the growth with jobs gains within the retail, F&amp;B and hospitality industries.<br><br>1,900 workers were laid off - some 30 per cent less compared to the previous quarter's 2,750. <br><br>But
               unemployment rose slightly. The unemployment rate for residents rose by
               0.3 percentage point to 3 per cent from the previous quarter. <br><br>An estimated 62,700 residents (seasonally adjusted figure) were unemployed in June.<br><br>"The
               falloff in job creation overall is I think, reflective of the slight 
              moderation in the economy and to be honest, when we compare to the 
              stellar growth last year, it's quite unrealistic to expect that to 
              continue. And probably it's good to have it ease off somewhat because a 
              lot of people do find that the labour market is actually very tight. So 
              this would mean in terms of companies, in terms of the hiring 
              opportunities, it would be probably slightly better for them," said 
              Brigadier-General Tan Chuan-Jin, Minister of State for Manpower.<br><br>Some HR experts though said the labour market remains tight - with more jobs on offer than workers.<br><br>Industry watchers said one of the main problems lie in a mismatch of skills set.<br><br>"Definitely
               there will be people still looking at increasing of headcount. However 
              they'll be looking for people with specific skills set which makes 
              hiring a bit more challenging in that sense," said Jurcannie Yeong, 
              Senior Marketing &amp; Communications Executive at Manpower Staffing 
              Services. <br><br>A survey by Manpower Staffing show 44 per cent of 
              employers in Singapore reportedly having difficulty filling job 
              vacancies due to the lack of suitable talents. That's compared to the 
              global average of 34 per cent.<br><br>The firm said employers are 
              finding it tough filling in positions such as sales representatives, 
              engineers and technicians. The most common reasons cited is lack of 
              experience and lack of technical or "hard" skills - which simply means, 
              training and re-skilling remain the key to landing a job.<br><br>As for wages, experts said it will remain stable at least for now. That because companies will pay a premium for talent. <br><br>Real
               average monthly earnings rose by 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of 
              this year. And with hiring expectations remaining strong, experts said 
              wages are likely to grow between 4 and 8 per cent this year.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              I think they included PRs into the calculation of the statistics.
                  
              So maybe the actual jobless rate is higher.

              <p><br>The above means employers are not willing to train a newcomer from start. They wanted only readily-trained or experienced candidates. If all employers have this attitude, no wonder there will be "lack of talents" as all experienced employees are already promoted to managers/supervisors.</p>
