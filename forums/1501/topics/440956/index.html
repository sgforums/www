              <p>Mature job seekers are less likely to be hired by interview panels consisting just young people, a survey here has found.</p>
              <p>Their likelihood of getting and keeping the job jumped from 57 per cent to 69 per cent when they are faced instead with a mixed panel of young and old interviewers.</p>
              <p>Commissioned by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (Tafep), the survey also found that organisations with age-friendly employment practices, such as providing a 'buddy' from the same age group, were more likely to recruit and retain mature employees.</p>
              <p>The attributes of the mature job seekers matter too. Those who were tech-savvy, had a positive attitude and prepared for their interviews had a better chance of getting hired.</p>

              <p>Minister of State for <span id="lw_1320338212_0" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320339043_0" class="yshortcuts">Manpower Tan Chuan Jin</span></span> says 
              companies who are not ready for the re-employment legislation should make the 
              necessary changes now.<br> <br>Speaking at the first Age Friendly Workforce Asia 
              Conference on Thursday, Tan said employers should start tapping on all available 
              resources and assistance to make necessary adjustments before the new law kicks 
              in 2012, reported <span id="lw_1320338212_1" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320339043_1" class="yshortcuts">Channel NewsAsia.<br></span></span> <br>The 
              new law makes it compulsory for employers to re-hire suitable employees beyond 
              the statutory retirement age of 62. Under the new re-employment legislation, 
              companies have to re-hire suitable employees beyond the retirement age of up to 
              65 years old, with hiring terms open for negotiation.<br> <br>The Tripartite 
              Alliance for <span id="lw_1320338212_2" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320339043_2" class="yshortcuts">Fair Employment Practices</span></span> conducted research and 
              found that there were two ways for companies to improve chances of finding 
              suitable mature job-seekers. <br> <br>The initial step is to diversify the age 
              composition of recruitment selection panels before providing a flexible work 
              arrangement as part of human resource policies.<br> <br>"Bear in mind how we 
              treat our <span id="lw_1320338212_3" class="yshortcuts"><span id="lw_1320339043_3" class="yshortcuts">older workers</span></span>, because that is how your younger 
              workers will look at you because at some point, they will also become older 
              workers," said Tan. <br> <br>"And I think for many of us, we do realise (that) 
              building a great organisation...(has) a lot to do with how we treat our people. 
              I think this is an opportunity for us to retune the way we look at things," he 
              told the news agency. <br> <br>Tan also said that many businesses from large 
              companies to small and medium enterprises have largely implemented re-employment 
              with little or no change to employment terms. However, it is not enough to help 
              older workers find work and more needs to be done to facilitate an age-friendly 
              workplace and environment.<br> <br>Over 1,800 employers have signed the 
              Employers' Pledge of Fair Employment Practices, supporting the movement.</p>

In contrast, his chances are substantially higher if the interviewers included people of similar age or those who are older. <br><br>This is one of the findings of a recent study - comprising a survey and focus groups - by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP). The study, which took place between February and April, involved 302 respondents who are above 40. <br><br>Its objective was to identify common factors that differentiate successful mature job-seekers from those who were unsuccessful. <br><br>According to the survey, the likelihood of mature job-seekers getting and keeping the job jumped from 56.6 per cent to 69.2 per cent when they are faced with a mixed panel of young and old interviewers, instead of a panel comprising just younger people.<br><br>It added: "The perception is that someone in their generational group would be more empathetic, patient and listen to them better." <br><br>These findings were also supported by respondents in the focus groups. <br><br>The study also found that employability of mature workers increased when they are tech-savvy: Eight in 10 of the respondents who were employed in the same job for at least nine months over the last two years said they were familiar with using the computer and Internet.<br><br>"Significantly, ability to use information technology could possibly impact employability. <br><br>"Not only did it allow respondents to find out about available jobs, it also allowed them to apply for these jobs as more job applications are being processed via online channels," the study said.<br><br>When it comes to the work environment, the study found that organisations which adopted age-friendly employment practices such as providing a buddy for a mature worker who is around the same age, on-the-job training and regular feedback on performance were better able to recruit and retain mature employees. <br><br>SINGAPORE POISED FOR RE-EMPLOYMENT LAWS<br><br>The survey findings were released in conjunction with the opening day of the Age Friendly Workforce Asia conference. <br><br>Speaking at the conference, Minister of State (Manpower) Tan Chuan-Jin felt that the study had "two key findings": One, diversifying the age composition of the recruitment selection panel increases a mature job seeker's chances. Two, the provision of flexible work arrangements helps widen the pool of mature job seekers. <br><br>From next Janaury, the re-employment laws will kick in. With less than two months to go, Mr Tan said: "Our sense is that most employers are re-employment ready. Many employers, including larger companies and those in the unionised sector, have already implemented re-employment." <br><br>Mr Tan noted that the tripartite partners have worked together since 2007 to prepare employers and employees for re-employment. Guidelines were also created to identify good re-employment practices and briefings were organised over the past year for more than 1,500 employers, industry associations and unions.<br><br>Mr Tan reiterated the benefits of re-employment: It provides flexibility for both employers and workers to make necessary adjustments to meet their respective needs, thereby allowing the workers to work longer, as long as they are fit and have performed satisfactorily. <br><br>Mr Tan cited fast-food chain MacDonald's as an example of how employers are embracing mature workers. It has upgraded cash registers touch-screens with visual representation of each menu item, reducing eye strain for older workers and speeding up its service at the same time. <br><br>Mr Tan added: "There are also businesses, including SMEs, who intend simply to continue employing the worker past 62 until 65 or even older, with little or no change to employment terms. And we encourage that." <br><br>More than 1,800 employers representing some 650,000 employees have signed the Employers' Pledge of Fair Employment Practices, said Mr Tan. He added that he is "encouraged" that employment rate for residents aged 55 to 64 rose from 57.2 per cent in 2009 to a high of 59 per cent last year. <br><br>"This will help us achieve the target of an employment rate of 65 per cent for those aged 55 to 64 by 2015, and bring us closer to the mature worker employment rates in advanced economies such as Japan and Sweden," said Mr Tan. </div>
