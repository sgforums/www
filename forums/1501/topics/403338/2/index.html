              <p>Hi World,</p>
              <p>Im a HR professional for many years. Please note that an employment contract wh requires employees to make monetary compensation for early exit from the company is not covered under the Employment Act. It is covered under Contract Law which determines business transactions rather than employment guidelines. All cases under Contract Law is determined by a civil course of action not by MOM.</p>
              <p>Under Contract Law, if your company offers an unfair contract to you tying you down for a definite period of time, did the company offer you any equivalent benefit or bonus in return? This will be very important. For example when I was working in a big company previously, we offered employees a bond of 6 months but we paid them a substantial joining bonus. If the contract states an unfair term such as this but do not compensate you in any way, it will be deemed invalid by the court if it goes to a civil suit. Only ignorant people like yr boss or his HR department is unaware of this. Thats you will nvr see HR departments in MNCs doing that as they know it is an unfair clause and is not valid under Contract Law. This is a question Im always asked by many employees and the answer is pretty clear cut</p>
              <p>In addition the employment act states that the employee is able to terminate the service with the company if he is asked to perform which that is irrelevant to his job scope. This is very important and has always been used as a tool in a number of conflict cases in the civil court between staff and company. For example if you are a trainer, the company cannot expect you to perform the job of a cleaner regularly unless you are paid additionally for it. Thus your company is breaching MOM regulations by doing this and you can use this as a credible tool to leave the organization.</p>
              <p>I need to highlight again that you will realise all MNCs do not bind their employees to such contracts as they know it is not valid with the advise of their legal department and HR dept. Generally only ignorant employers do that and such employers normally do not have the advice of a competent HR person which is why they assume that they are able to force employees to commit to an unfair clause. However some bosses generally include this clause to intimidate unwitting staff. Sadly these employers are normally foolhardy bosses of local SMCs and I believe your company is in the same catagory.</p>
              <p>Let me know if you need further advice</p>

              <p>Hahahahaha! TS' boss actually has just declared his complete ignorance of the law!</p>
              <p>CBT = Criminal breach of Trust</p>
              <p>not sure what TS means by "course materials" though. Did TS sign any confidentiality / non-Disclosure agreement? If not, what TS' boss suing you for?</p>
              <p>The boss is certainly taking your blurness to bully you with such baseless threats.</p>
              <p>If I were TS, I'll just not do anything. if Boss wanna play, I'll play wif him.</p>
              <p>If the boss were to take out a civil claim, against TS, he'll have the burden to prove his claims on a balance of probability. if it were a criminal case, TS' boss will then have the burden to prove TS' crime beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
              <p>Just for this, TS' boss will want to go through so much trouble and time?</p>
              <p>he got nothing better to do meh......?</p>
