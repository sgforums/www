              <p>hi i am currently an employee with a company and i have signed a bond 
              with the company for 1 year and 6 months and current ending my 7 months service. i wanted to tender my resignation to the 
              company but my boss said that he will charge me. but i do not know what 
              are the reasons that he will charge me on.</p>
              <p>In this case do i need to pay
               the pay in lieu for breaking the bond?</p>
              <p>as i have no money to pay for it
               and i do not have a copy of the contract to check whether i need to 
              give a 1 month notice.</p>
              <p>I also have not tendered in any resignation letter but only told him 
              verbally.<br> And he said that i have caused harm to the company by informing my 
              friends of my intention to leave the company.</p>
              <p>Will that be a chargeable 
              offense?<br> I am just a small low level staff in the company and not in management 
              level.<br> Can any one help me in this regard?<br> <br> Thank you</p>

              <p>It is normal practice for parties signing an agreement to be furnished a copy of the contract. Hoe else will each party be able to determine the dos and don'ts?</p>

              <p>How did U go about trying?</p>
              <p>The company is a family-run thingy?No self-respecting HR head will not give a copy of the signed employment contract to any of its employee.</p>
              <p>Write a formal email to ur HR head asking for it.If the reply is "no" or if there is no reply in a reasonable timeframe...U might need to seek MOM's clarification on it...or even to get a lawyer to request for it in writing.</p>
              <p>Personal experience with MOM is that whenever a contract is involved...they ask U to find lawyer...but no harm trying...just email them.</p>
              <p>If U have just simply told ur friends of ur personal intention to leave...I dont see how that can be argued as causing harm to the company....unless U say things like "XXX company cannot stay one...making losses every quarter"....or things like that....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>of course U have to pay the company if U break the
              bond...that's why people who suka suka sign on a bond...finds
              themselves in trouble when they want out.</p>
              <p>if all U want is to quit and U are able to pay for it.......just ask around ur colleagues if they remember their notice period...usually for people of the same level...notice period will be the same....then just resign and give notice to that effect...its against the law for them not to accept ur resignation....but its also their right to get U to pay for breaking ur bond. How much to pay depends on ur contract...which U have to get in the first place.</p>

              <p>Really depends on what your contract states. Usually there is a bond value stated in your contract and should you break it you would be liable for that amount, and how it is broken down should it be pro rated.</p>
              <p>But now you have zero documental proof, they can suka suka state any amount you are liable to because you already signed it. They can just put 200K and the judge will still give it to them coz you signed it.</p>

              <p>You think only mah. Got any black and white piece of paper say that? Got paper contract that say that? I tell you something, I got more than 1.8k pay, but I am entitled to OT pay leh. The difference is that its stated in my letter of appointment, together with the rate, and the conditions in which they would give me.</p>

              <p>hi i am currently an employee with a company and i have signed a
              bond with the company for 1 year and 6 months and current ending my
              7 months service. i wanted to tender my resignation to the company
              but my boss said that he will charge me. but i do not know what are
              the reasons that he will charge me on.</p>
              <p>In this case do i need to pay the pay in lieu for breaking the
              bond?</p>
              <p>as i have no money to pay for it and i do not have a copy of the
              contract to check whether i need to give a 1 month notice.</p>
              <p>I also have not tendered in any resignation letter but only told
              him verbally.<br> And he said that i have caused harm to the company by informing my
              friends of my intention to leave the company.</p>
              <p>Will that be a chargeable offense?<br> I am just a small low level staff in the company and not in
              management level.<br> Can any one help me in this regard?<br> <br> Thank you</p>

              <p>fishy. it is under the law that both parties have to have a copy of the contract. </p>
              <p>A contract is not equal to a bond. Don't get confused. </p>
              <p>You have to give 1 months notification if you tender. </p>
              <p>You sounds so blur and helpless. </p>
              <p>No you will receive confirmation letter. you dont sign it. </p>

              <p>Do you know what your jobscope involves before you agreed to take the job? Or did you just accept the job because they offered you one?</p>
              <p>What do you define by long hours? If your company works on 2 shifts of 12 hours, yeah of course thats long and necessary, but you should have known that before you accepted the job.</p>
              <p>Empty promises? I dunno what empty promises you are referring to. Did they promise you in writing they'll give you 3 months worth of bonus that won't be deducted by CPF? Is that promise given in writing?</p>
              <p>If you go back to your first post, the only things I can reply is " I dunno". As for resignation, it should be formal and in writing, otherwise should anything happen after you leave, you are still liable, because technically there is no proof you have left. Contracts, and letters all work both ways. Keep them covered, keep yourself covered.</p>
              <p>Sure you can sincerely say how good a worker you are, only you know yourself. I can say I am the best human being in the world, maybe I have already raped, robbed, and killed 10 people yesterday, and still come here and say I'm fantastic, who knows?</p>

              <p><br>50 hours/week is not legal under the Employment Act. But since you've indicated that there's an employment contract signed between you and the employer, the terms of that contract overrides the Employment Act.</p>
