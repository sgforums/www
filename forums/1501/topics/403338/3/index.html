              <p>you are worried because the police will charge you for CBT and your previous employer will sue you for damages</p>
              <p>police do not anyhow charge people with CBT, they will establish and collect concrete evidence before any charge for CBT will be made. One sided statements by the boss and your former working partners will not be considered as concrete evidence.</p>

              <p>yep i didn't went back with the police for cbt as there was not enough evidence and i was allowed to go home but my ex empolyer say that he is consolidating evidence of me conducting cbt. apparently, he only plan to charge me for cbt. i am terminated from the company along with my accountant so we are not bounded by the contract and don't have to go to work anymore which is a good thing. now just waiting for police to call and get back my stuff and also waiting for the letter of court or something like that. should i seek a lawyer help now?</p>

              <p>Im shocked by your boss's gangster mannerism. Looks likes hes quite boorish and not very smart. How would his clients tink of him and his company if he forward your pic and info to them saying you been terminated. It is not legal to do so and you can easily sue him for damages. He is doing that as he is taking a bet that he has more money than you and you will not be able to have to financial resources to take him to court.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please drop me a mail with your phone number so that I can advise you on what to do as what I did to other victims. Im angered by this blatant act of gangsterism and can advise u on the course of action.</p>

I think my letter will follow suit which would be for cbt or for the same case.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>ok i just got my letter of demand today. It amounts to 25k for 11 months pay and course training fees. It says that i am terminated by the company and due to one of the clause of the company, it state that i will be required to pay the amount in 7 days if not i will be brought to court. for my cbt case, the police say its still pending. I have went to mom with my friend today and like what you guys said there is nothing they can do as this is a civil case and we need a lawyer. We went to mom because the company refuse to give us our contract and also our pay for the month and now instead they want us to compensate them. Tomorrow or the day after need to go source for lawyer already, any one got reccomendations?</p></div>

              <p>If you get letter of demand it's just a civil case (means the company taking you to court) and not a police case.</p>
              <p>He just using the police as a sidetrack to threaten you into submission.</p>
              <p>You can basically ignore his letter of demand and wait for his writ of summons, thereby you have to decide on your course of action, either to get a lawyer to challenge his claim or to pay him.</p>
              <p>You can ask him out for a discussion, record his conversation (without him knowing with a voice recorder), try to trick him into confessing his extortion (him using the case of CBT to extort money from you), then bring up the case to police again regarding his extortion.</p>
