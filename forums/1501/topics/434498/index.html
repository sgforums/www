              <p>I had just accepted and signed on the letter of job offer.</p>
              <p>The validity of the job offer is still subjected to a successful background check and was alarmed when the HR person said the check would go back to 5 years. <br><br>Everything was ok except I had "stretched" the employment dates of this job from 5 yrs ago. I did so to cover a gap. And I had stretched the dates quite a bit, ie. above 6 months.</p>
              <p>I asked HR what was this background check about and they stated they were concerned with identity, validity of employment history provided and whether there were any criminal records or bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>I'm sure 1 of the checks would include employment dates. This is giving me sleepless nights.</p>
              <p>Do you think the job offer would be terminated upon discovery of that inconsistency?<br>Does anyone have anything to share or take the load off my chest?<br>I thought of calling that ex-company's HR not to oblige if someone calls asking for info about me. Would this work?</p>

              <p>Dont worry. Cos the HR people could just be trying to determine your past work experience and see how much they should pay you if they hire you.</p>
              <p>If they dont even want to hire u, they wont bother to do any checks?</p>

              <p>Six months is not so bad but don't do more than that. It is a favorite trick done by people who like to job hop. I am not trying to give u sleepless nights but you do remember when you sign your employment contract, u promise not to omit any info or give false info. So they can do anything they want to you.</p>
              <p>However, some employers do give their staff a second chance, they may want you to prove your worth, so expect your boss to give you some pressure because he wants to see if you are what you advertised yourself in your CV.</p>
              <p>Forget about your former employer. U dun work there anymore, they dont give a shit about you. So dun bother calling them. U have one saving grace, 6 months is not so bad, I have known people who kena, did more than that.</p>

              <p>Calling a six-month period stretch as 'a bit' is subjective.</p>
              <p>If you had stretched a previous five-year employment period by six months, they can consider it as a minor oversight.</p>
              <p>But if you had stretched a one-month employment period by six months, then you are asking for trouble.</p>

              <p>Hiyas,</p>
              <p>Wld like to know if its ok to omit a company which I had worked for 6-7 mths in work history for resume? It was quite a crappy job where I had to worked till 8-9 plus for at least 3 days each wk. Plus the enviornment wasnt that safe at night, but I hang on for 6-7mths since I had signed a contract with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I didnt want to appear as job hopper.</p>
              <p> </p>
