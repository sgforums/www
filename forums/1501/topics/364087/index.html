              <p class="article_smalltext">By Terrie Lloyd</p>
              <div id="article_content">
              <p>A recent article in Forbes magazine, titled “Searching For Entrepreneurship 
              in Japan” (http://tinyurl.com/nrzgma), posits that Japan is way behind the U.S. 
              in entrepreneurship and needs to do something about improving the environment 
              for breeding new companies so as to reinvigorate its economy. The article 
              focuses on the paucity of venture capital invested into Japanese start-ups, 
              which Forbes says amounts to just $3 billion a year<br>distributed to 3,000 
              companies. In comparison, it says that VCs in the U.S. invest an average of $30 
              billion a year into about 4,000 companies.</p>
              <p>The article further goes on to say that Japanese VCs typically earn an 
              Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of just 4%, compared to 17% or more by U.S. VCs, 
              thus indicating that not only the amount of money but also the quality of 
              companies being invested in is also weak. In other words, Japanese VC and 
              entrepreneurship are messed up.</p>
              <p>The Forbes article seems to have been based on the Stanford Project for 
              Japanese Entrepreneurship (http://fsi.stanford.edu/research/staje), which is an 
              effort by a number of Stanford and Todai academics to understand just what is 
              going on with entrepreneurship in Japan and why there isn’t more VC money and 
              more commercial successes coming out of Japan.</p>
              <p>Check out the site. There is a very good PowerPoint presentation by Robert 
              Eberhart, which spells out some possible reasons for the variance in 
              Japanese-U.S. numbers. Forbes, on the other hand, chooses to quote a 
              Hitotsubashi professor who reckons that Japanese start-ups are scared to launch 
              in to the global environment, and thus wind up cannibalizing each other in the 
              Japanese domestic markets. It is surprising that Forbes didn’t try to dig a bit 
              deeper, because there is a story worth telling here.</p>
              <p>I think it is true that:</p>
              <p>a) There is a dearth of VC money available in Japan.<br>b) There is a dearth 
              of entrepreneurs.<br>c) There is a dearth of start-ups with global 
              capabilities.</p>
              <p>Recent financials for two of the biggest VCs show a sorry picture for venture 
              capital in Japan. The largest fund, with 3,000 investee companies as of 2006, is 
              JAFCO. The company in FY2008 posted a net loss of 16.9 billion yen, while the 
              largest listed VC, JAIC, has started negotiating for delayed creditor payments 
              after posting a loss of a massive 34.8 billion yen. That’s a lot for a VC to 
              lose in just one year.</p>
              <p>Both companies are saying that the main reason for their travails is the 
              terrible state of the stock markets for IPOs. There were only 49 listings in 
              2008, less than half that of 2007, and less than a quarter of the peak several 
              years ago. But while they are quick to blame the markets, what other factors are 
              at work here? Are VCs losing money because the quality of the companies they’re 
              investing in are low, or are the quality ideas getting killed at birth because 
              of a lack of funding?</p>
              <p>I believe some of the major contributing factors are:</p>
              <p><strong>Failure to Get Past the Start Line</strong></p>
              <p>1. There is no doubt that there is a general lack of interest by most 
              would-be entrepreneurs to take a risk, due to lack of role models and their 
              brainwashing by older generations of the importance of a regular salary. 
              Luckily, the silver lining of the recession clouds of the 1990s and now is that 
              more and more people are being forced to realize that the system is broken, and 
              to survive/grow they need to take charge of their own futures. Just look at the 
              ongoing expansion in Rakuten online stores, up 4,000 last year to 27,000 
              retailers, to get a feel for this. An online store may not seem like an act of 
              entrepreneurship, but for many younger Japanese and for housewives, it is a 
              radical departure from the past. They are risking real money, the comfort of 
              anonymity, and their recreation time to run these stores.</p>
              <p>2. Lack of education about how to run a business. Japan still has a very low 
              academic focus on setting up and running companies. At the kids’ level, you will 
              seldom find schools encouraging kids to try starting their own businesses as a 
              class project—it’s just not part of curriculum nor the Ministry of Education’s 
              value system. This is understandable, given that the ministry comes across as 
              one of the last bastions of socialism in this country. Later, after students 
              graduate and start working, there is very little adult education to help people 
              jump out on their own.</p>
              <p>The good news, however, is that this is changing, as MBA schools become more 
              popular. MBAs are ostensibly for the development of managerial skills, but 
              inevitably these courses expose curious minds to alternative means of doing 
              business, including entrepreneurship and NPOs. Some of the schools on the 
              leading edge of promoting entrepreneurship include Globis, Keio, and 
              Hitotsubashi. We wonder then, why Stanford felt it had to choose Todai in their 
              entrepreneurship project?</p>
              <p><strong>Operational Hurdles</strong></p>
              <p>1. Then there is the bias of the financial system in not wanting to support 
              risk takers. Now, it’s probably only natural that banks anywhere don’t want to 
              risk their capital on start-ups, but the problem is that there is no real 
              alternative to the banks. What VCs are active in the market nowadays tend to 
              invest after a company has gone through the tough steps of developing a product 
              and is already starting to record sales—in order to reduce their investment 
              risk. To get a product up and running on in-house funding is tough and it is no 
              wonder then, that Japanese companies are defined by Eberhart as being too 
              founder-centric—you need to be mentally tough to make it past the start-up stage 
              here.</p>
              <p>2. The paucity of early-stage investment from VCs is a real problem for 
              start-ups in the technology space in particular, since in order to create 
              world-class products, they generally need to invest in processes and core 
              research. Given that small companies employ most of the workers in Japan, 
              supporting these start-ups would seem vital to the interests of the nation. I 
              find it strange that the government doesn’t do more to kick-start their 
              establishment. Tax preferences on angel and VC investing, special R&amp;D funds 
              for SMEs, and setting up a fund-of-funds to co-invest with established VCs would 
              both be natural moves.</p>
              <p>Indeed, in other first-world countries, government are establishing funding 
              organizations that co-invest with private VC funds. These initiatives can be 
              very effective and importantly for Japan send out the message that risk-taking 
              is officially sanctioned.</p>
              <p>3. Japanese VCs also need to change their investment and operational 
              strategies, by putting larger amounts of cash to work in each company they jump 
              in to, and by helping to educate the company’s management to grow in skills and 
              vision. In so doing, they will provide both the necessary resources and also a 
              means of overcoming the negative attitudes and fears bred by the current 
              education system.</p>
              <p>Some VCs are doing this already, such as Tsunami Network Partners (TNP) in 
              Kanagawa and Sunbridge in Ebisu, but these types of firms are few and far 
              between. More often the VCs choose to reduce risk by scattering their 
              investments alongside other similarly minded funds, then proceed to ignore their 
              investees post-investment.</p>
              <p>The Forbes article does, however, miss an important source of funding for 
              Japanese startups, as well as for foreign firms who are setting up in 
              Japan—investment by strategic investors. While I don’t have any figures, I would 
              guess that there are at least 1,000+ strategic investments in start-ups done by 
              Japanese major corporations every year. The average amount is typically between 
              50 million yen and 100 million yen, and is made for 5-10 years. Forbes states 
              that Japanese VCs have an IRR of just 4%, but if you’re a strategic investor, 
              perhaps you may not want any end-game IRR on your investment at all! Instead, 
              what you’re interested in is cash flow.</p>
              <p>Thus, even if an investment appears to be highly valued, so long as the price 
              being paid results in direct income and profit (by virtue of being an agent, 
              distributor, OEM, or something similar) flowing at a rate 5%-10% higher than the 
              cost of the money for the investment, then it makes financial sense. I suspect 
              that if Stanford was to investigate the volume and value of strategic 
              investments, the reason for the apparent lack of VC returns in Japan would be 
              resolved. As a case in point, Softbank made much more money out of its 
              implementation of the VoIP technology of UTStarcom than it did out of the gain 
              in shares of that company—although it did well there as well. Thanks to 
              UTStarcom’s technology, Softbank’s Yahoo BB business boomed and created a 
              multi-billion dollar revenue channel for the group.</p>
              <p>Lastly, what about the fact that Japanese start-ups don’t seem to be able to 
              connect to buyers in the global markets? We think 90% of this equation is a 
              simple lack of English-language confidence, coupled with the historic domination 
              of profitable export business segments by the major trading companies. SMEs 
              definitely need help to reach out to the global markets, and we’ve often 
              wondered why JETRO, which was originally set up to promote the exports of some 
              of the world’s now most famous brands, hasn’t been repurposed to help SMEs start 
              their export push?</p>
              <p>Maybe it is coming, but in the meantime, if a small company with world-class 
              technology or products gets a call from a potential foreign customer, they do in 
              fact get scared and hide under a shell. Usually they will either take ages to 
              come back with a quote, or they go find an aged (retired) consultant to help 
              them with English and export issues. As a result, the potential customer reads 
              the lack of immediate response as lack of interest, and they go 
              elsewhere.</p>
