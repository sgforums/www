              <p>Doctors and lawyers are the most highly paid professionals in the world.</p>
              <p>You pay them so much money and they operate on you/fight a lawsuit for you and there is no guarantee that they can cure you/win the case.</p>
              <p>So a doctor can accept your large sum of money and after operating on you, you die. He than takes your money and go enjoy life.</p>
              <p>A lawyer can accept lots of money from you and fight the case for you halfhearted and than lose the case and see you go to jail/or get sued until bankrupt and than take your money and go enjoy life.</p>

              <p>Being a minister in a country X is better. You have to pay them, yet there's no guarantee that they can keep country X safe. That particular country is one of the first few in Asia to slip into recession, and let a potentially dangerous criminal Mad Melamat escape <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hmm there are actually protocols, you know. The reason why they're such highly paid vocations is because of the skill level of the job itself. It has high requirements and these requirements have to keep in line with being in the interest of the client.</p>
              <p>No doubt that there is no 100% guarantee to a successful case won or a life saved, but these people have to act within the required industry standards to make sure they reach 100% or near it. An example would be a doctor who has to follow strict surgery protocols when operating on a patient. Should he be found neglectful of certain protocols that lead to the eventual failure of the operation (e.g. making high-risk choices that can detrimentally affect the patient's life without getting consent) and thus lead to the subsequent death of the patient, he can be sued for negligence. But if he tried his best within the industry's safety requirements and the patient still died due to causes that are uncontrollable/unprecedented, he should not be held accountable. In any case, it is common sense and common knowledge that such procedures have success and failure rates. It is also the responsibility of the doctor to brief the patient of said success/failure rates so that the patient can have a realistic understanding of the situation.</p>
              <p>In any case, going by your logic, employers would also be at risk of not having 100% effort from employees they hire. Humans are not goods to be sold or traded, and their services are given with remuneration for the effort, time and money obtaining the necessary skills for them to assist the organization.</p>
              <p>So yes, I think it is very fair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't you think it would be very naive to expect 100% success when it comes to services given by human workers?</p>
