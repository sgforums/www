              <p>@Yumii: you have to ask the HR about this issue, I have the same problem with you last time. The boss was evil (mentally abused me) and always delayed my salary. I should have given a one month tender notice period if want to quit from the job. Instead, I give one day tender notice. He still owed me the salary, but he still claimed the salary in lieu from me since I left without one month notice. Once I brought this case to MOM, there was nothing they can do to claim back my salary. I explained to MOM that i had no choice to do that. I was mentally abused, scolded every single second in front of public, humiliated, intimidated, etc...had I waited for a month more, I would ended up in the mental hospital.</p>
              <p>But still, MOM can't do anything. So I asked help from MP. MP issued a letter to MOM. Then, MOM invited me and my ex-boss to attend the court. I also asked help from several employee's asssociation in Singapore that gave free legal assistant since lawyer costs a lot. I did not even claim my money or anything from him, but he still greedily claim salary in lieu!! What the fish!</p>
              <p>Well, finally, since too many parties (excluding MOM) got involved and condemned him, he himself dropped his claim towards me.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: MOM can't always be the place we can rely on as employees.</p>

              <p>heard a colleague who tendered resignation and left company on 31 oct.  now he still hasn't got pay.  first they promised him he will get pay on 31 oct, then pushed to 02 nov, then now to 04 nov. </p>
              <p>after he left, they still call him everyday ask him to do this do that.  the manager is slack on hand-over.  my colleague is angry and refused to entertain them. </p>
