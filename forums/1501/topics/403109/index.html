              <p>lol I am taking UOL Econs and finance degree.......</p>
              <p>the more important thing is to check whether the institute you are studying is reliable actually and whether it conforms with the MOE standards for PEIs.</p>

              <p>Actually there is no MOE guideline to which university is recognised.  I learnt that when I used to work in a private school (quite well known one cuz there are advertisements everywhere). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's all up to the employer and how you sell ngor yoke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But of course, the safest is to get NUS, NTU, SMU etc degree lor.  If take private one, I would say UOL is quite known.  If I am not wrong, if you are taking the UOL degree programme here, the exam papers are actually set by London side, not the local lecturers.  And UOL constantly do audit on the schools that are offering their degrees.</p>

              <p>KNN.... where got people study for a degree course that is "more recognised" to employers in SG wan............</p>
              <p>Isn't it  better to plan what you want as a career in the longer term in your life. Then the shorter-term goals will be easier to identify.................?</p>
              <p>Studying a degree course in a field you have a passion in will probably take you further than doing one because it is more marketable/ in demand  now becoz this "marketability" changes with the times.........</p>

              <p>Actually your thinking is wrong alr, I last time also thought this way till my friend who graduated with this cert inform me. Studying tourism is not about tourist or what. With this specialisation, these graduates can further branch out into events management and other related fields. </p>
              <p>So if TS should look into the modules and see if they are what prepares him for the future that he wants, then going into it can be good choice too =) </p>

              <p>I have been working as a senior HR professional and Recruiter for the last 6-8 years. Virtually all MNCs dun distinguish between govt and pte degrees. Their regulations do not dictate too that the staff must have a local degree. However some HR managers who are from local universities do prefer campus degrees from local universities as they r from NUS/NTU/SMI. However I need to state that its quite minimal.</p>
              <p>In terms of pte degrees, its is commonly recognised by HR professionals that UOL is the best pte degree available in Singapore at the moment and is the most widely recognised. Given your options, it would be advisable for you to take up the UOL option. However do note too that the UOL degree is the most difficult to pass. Most course consultants in diff pte schools will advise you regarding this. However again, virtually all MNCs do not distinguish between pte universities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would be good for you to check the ranking of the pte university before you decide wh one course to pursue. Go google the " Times university ranking guide" before u make your choice. This ranking is used as a benchmark for most schools and researchers on the quality and reputation of the university. Generally the higher the ranking the better the school. Rem, the university that you entrol in should be at least in the top 200 worldwide before you enrol for the course.</p>
