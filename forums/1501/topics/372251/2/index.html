              <p>These are not stupid questions. Those who dunno how to answer them are usually ill-prepared or frog-in-a-well. This questions (hostile they may seem) actually helps the interviewee to sell themselves.</p>
              <p>1) For the interviewee to sell his strengths, make a comparison with other canidates.</p>
              <p>2) To see how the canidate react under pressure.</p>
              <p>3) To see if this canidate have amibitions</p>

              <p>its proven that these interviewers are untrained HR people
              asking generalist questions. there are techniques and set of
              questions asked to solicit genuine reply.</p>

              <p>Questions of these nature are design to see how you would handle
              pressure. Assuming you lost ur cool, and walk out, this would reflect
              to the interviewer u cannot control yourself. They'll never hire u for
              jobs like customer assurance, corporate communications, public
              relations especially. In fact, this kind of "pressure" interview-styles are used in relatively higher responsibility jobs in my company.</p>
              <p>What happens if a customer complain to you that
              your organisation is stupid, or gives degrading comments about you? Or
              a reporter probing u about a controvestial decision made by your
              company? You stand up and walk away?</p>
              <p>Go think about it. While I agree there are silly interviewers, most of the time, the fool is the interviewee.</p>

              <p>hmm.. i'll maybe laugh abit and ya, life cannot be fair to everyone, plus my passion lies in (the job I'm interviewing) and not (my ex-job). I've taken up (insert everything I did to improve myself geared towards this job).</p>
              <p>Think the key here is not to show any hint of defensiveness, especially in facial expression and body language. Depending on the rapport I have with the interviewer/s, I may end with a question "What's the promotion structure here like?"</p>

              <p>this could be so overuse that it sounds like a cliche.</p>
              <p>Research the job position n have a rough idea of the promotion structure. Perhaps can say something like "I see myself leading a team in charge of this this this or that that that"</p>
              <p>Worst come to worst, know the company/department's vision, say something according to the vision.</p>

              <p>Having a stable job</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">A bit buang - I guess it depends on what position you're apply for and also where. I'd actually say something like "I hope to be in mid-management and starting to work on a mba; I'm passionate about this job (give reasons) and also in my academic pursuits."</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One good point to note - Sell your strengths and hide your flaws. If you don't know how to sell yourself, even if you have a mba from insead... also can't help...</span></p>
