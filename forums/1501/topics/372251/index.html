              <p>Talking about job interviews, why is it in white collar professions, a job interview is even harder than a Singapore Idol Audition?</p>
              <p>In a job interview, I bet you the bosses still don't know what they want. Whereas in Idol Audition, at least if the judges find you can sing, they choose you. They already know what they want in their selections.</p>
              <p>Seems like every boss is actually expecting like Idol judge Ken Lim. Which I think is more unrealistic and too exaggerative.</p>
              <p>Why is it so?</p>

              <p>because if you get selected in the interview the boss will have to pay you a salary every month whereas in singapore idol if you get selected you don't get any pay/rewards unless you win the 1st price.</p>
              <p>because bosses are stupid they don't even know what they want</p>

              <p>These are the standard questions that interviews have... cos they would actually make a more vivid impressions of yourself in their mind so as to aid them in ticking the Suitable/KIV/Not Suitable checkbox on the interview form.</p>
              <p>1) Tell them how you are suitable for the job, your relevant working experiences or even task that you did that is revelant, your passion for the position.</p>
              <p>2)Defend yourself. Make your strong points visible while cover your weakness (like lazy, stupid, unwilling to learn, etc...) .</p>
              <p>3) Say it in the light of the coy line direction. like if financial line, then say that you are always interested in it and etc...</p>
              <p>4) Say it like you are gg to be employed and will be promoted.</p>
