              <p>It's a new year, and for most people that means looking at ways to 
              make the coming year better than the last. If one of your goals for 2011
               includes loving your work more, here are six mistakes to avoid:</p>
              <p><strong>Don't make today's fear your long-term reality. </strong></p>
              <p>It's
               stressful out there right now. People are out of work. Or they're 
              overworked in a job they're afraid to quit. There's a lot of anxiety, 
              fear, and anger brewing, and it's easy for that to spiral into an 
              endless, self-perpetuating loop that blocks any positive perspectives.</p>
              <p>I'm
               not suggesting the fear and anger aren't merited, nor am I  suggesting 
              you should pretend they don't exist. But you might want to  think twice 
              if you're letting them color your entire picture.</p>
              <p>Whether you 
              immerse yourself in fear and anger or turn some of your focus toward 
              positive potential, the cold, hard facts of your immediate situation are
               still the same. Your attitude can't change that. But it can change your
               experience. And it can change both the steps you're willing to take to 
              move toward a more positive future and your ability to notice 
              opportunities.</p>
              <p>Life is always in a state of flux, and that 
              includes your career. So even if it sucks now, it won't always suck. 
              Keeping that in mind can prevent you from needlessly perpetuating the 
              negative.</p>
              <p>[See <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12n230d8o/**http%3A//money.usnews.com/money/careers/slideshows/10-ways-to-make-any-job-healthier">10 Ways to Make Any Job Healthier</a>.]</p>
              <p><strong>Don't make it all or nothing.</strong></p>
              <p>We
               tend to think of career passion as all or nothing, and that's a mindset
               that gets us stuck. According to that way of thinking, if we can't have
               it all, we can't have it at all.</p>
              <p>A more helpful way to think 
              about career passion is how much energy you get from your work. You 
              might not be able to hit a grand slam (at least not right away), but you
               can gradually incorporate more of what energizes you.</p>
              <p>Think of it
               like a percentage. In that grand slam career, the percentage of your 
              work you find energizing might be eighty or ninety percent. No job is 
              perfect, so there will always be some aspects you don't enjoy. In your 
              current work, on the other hand, you might be hovering around forty 
              percent.</p>
              <p>You can sit at forty percent, waiting indefinitely for 
              the time to be right to pursue that grand slam, or you can start taking 
              steps to <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=120rn9j6p/**http%3A//mapmaker.curtrosengren.com/2010/11/jobsculpting.html">bump that percentage up</a> right now.</p>
              <p><strong>Don't assume nothing can be changed.</strong></p>
              <p>On
               a related note, another common mistake is assuming that nothing can be 
              changed, that you're stuck where you are, and that's that. But life is 
              malleable. It might not all change in one grand and glorious swoop, but 
              with effort and time, the actions you take and decisions you make can 
              have a significant impact on your happiness.</p>
              <p>[See <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=13era17ae/**http%3A//money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/01/04/how-to-rock-your-next-job-interview">How to Rock Your Next Job Interview</a>.]</p>
              <p><strong>Don't just guess.</strong></p>
              <p>Imagine
               being blindfolded in a room, given a dart, and told to hit the 
              bulls-eye of a dartboard that was hung up. While hitting the bulls-eye 
              is technically possible, it's unlikely, right? Most people's approach to
               finding a career they love is similar, involving a lot of blind 
              guesswork and, unfortunately, a lot of misses.</p>
              <p>To take the blindfold off, invest some time into understanding what makes you tick. <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=141qmsk9k/**http%3A//money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/11/05/to-choose-career-direction-look-for-your-energy-source">What energizes you</a>?
               When are you at your best? When are you in flow? The more you 
              understand where your energy comes from, the more you can consciously 
              direct your career along a path that fits.</p>
              <p><strong>Don't ignore the rest of your life.</strong></p>
              <p>What's
               happening in the rest of your life affects how you feel at work. If 
              something is draining your energy in your personal life, you're likely 
              to feel it at work. Is your diet heavy on Twinkies and chips but low on 
              fruits and veggies? That will affect your energy. Do you over-commit to 
              doing things for others (friends, family, volunteering, etc.), without 
              giving yourself any downtime? That's going to affect your energy as 
              well.</p>
              <p>Take a look at your life in 360 degrees, and explore ways to
               seek out more of what helps you feel energized and less of your energy 
              drains.</p>
              <p><strong>Don't wear rose-colored glasses 24/7.</strong></p>
              <p>I'm all for 
              cultivating a positive outlook, but too much of a good thing can be a 
              recipe for disaster. If you're walking through a minefield, all the 
              positive thinking in the world isn't going to help you avoid blowing 
              yourself up. You need to take the time to figure out where the mines are
               so you can step around them.</p>
              <p>It's the same in your career. Being able to look for the trouble spots and danger zones is key to avoiding or overcoming them.</p>
              <p>Creating
               a career you love can be challenging enough without adding unnecessary 
              difficulties. Avoiding these mistakes will let you put more of your 
              time, energy and effort into turning that dream into a reality.</p>
