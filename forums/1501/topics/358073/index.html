              <p><span class="postbody">Preliminary estimates by the Ministry of
              Manpower show that total employment declined marginally by 1,000 in the
              first quarter of 2009, as the economy continued to worsen.
              <br> <br>The manufacturing sector was severely affected by falling external
              demand. Employment in this sector has declined by 19,900, deeper than
              the 7,000 loss in the earlier quarter.
              <br> <br>Construction employment grew by 8,500 in the first quarter of 2009
              due to a strong pipeline of building projects. However, this is still
              lower than the gains in the earlier quarters.
              <br> <br> Services added 10,300 workers, which is also a substantially lower figure than previous quarters.
              <br> <br> Retrenchment and redundancy
              <br> <br>The number of workers retrenched rose to 10,800 in the first
              quarter of 2009 from 7,500 in the previous quarter. Together with 1,800
              workers whose contracts were terminated prematurely in the first
              quarter of 2009, total redundancy increased to 12,600, higher than the
              9,410 in the previous quarter.
              <br> <br>Most of the workers affected by redundancy in the first quarter of
              2009 came from manufacturing which laid off 9,000 workers, mainly from
              the electronics industry. Another 2,900 workers were laid off from
              services and 700 from construction
              <br> <br> Unemployment
              <br> <br>Reflecting the sharp deterioration in economic conditions, the
              overall unemployment rate rose from 2.5% in December 2008 to 3.2% in
              March 2009. Among the resident labour force, the unemployment rate
              increased from 3.6% in December 2008 to a five-year high of 4.8% in
              March 2009.

              <p>Ermm......</p>
              <p>Which part of my original statement was wrong? Maybe you can point it out?</p>
              <p>"<strong>Seems like "Residents" are more unemployed compared to the foreign talents. I guess the unemployment rate for foreign talents must be below 1.6%, else it won't be able to move the overall unemployment from 4.8% to 3.2%</strong>."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4 out of 10 foreigners unemployed does little to tell us the underlying data. What industries do these displaced foreigner come from? Construction? Construction is not one of the contestatble industry for Singaporeans, their displacement would have done little to help the overall Singaporean job market. If proportionately these retrenched workers are from the construction industry, then the figures for the service and professional industry will be consequently lower, hence depriving more Singaporeans of job in these sectors, jobs which Singaporeans will ordinarily choose unlike construction jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do these retrenched foreign workers get new jobs after they were retrenched?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on demographics, Singapore's population increased to about 5 million earlier this year, surely the bulk of the growth in population is prima facie that the increase was due to foreigners. Perhaps the laxed immigration policies at ICA approved many <strong>employed</strong> permanent residents and citizens, that's why figures for unemployment for Singapore <strong>born</strong> citizens are lower, it's all been agglomerated. Surely the drastic increase in population is attributed to foreigners and not locally born Singaporeans. I hope you can see that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Ermm......</p>
              <p>Which part of my original statement was wrong? Maybe you can
              point it out?</p>
              <p>"<strong>Seems like "Residents" are more unemployed compared to
              the foreign talents. I guess the unemployment rate for foreign
              talents must be below 1.6%, else it won't be able to move the
              overall unemployment from 4.8% to 3.2%</strong>."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4 out of 10 foreigners unemployed does little to tell us the
              underlying data. What industries do these displaced foreigner come
              from? Construction? Construction is not one of the contestatble
              industry for Singaporeans, their displacement would have done
              little to help the overall Singaporean job market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do these retrenched foreign workers get new jobs after they were
              retrenched?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on demographics, Singapore's population increased to about
              5 million earlier this year, surely the bulk of the growth in
              population is prima facie that the increase was due to
              foreigners. Perhaps the laxed immigration policies at ICA approved
              many <strong>employed</strong> permanent residents and citizens,
              that's why figures for unemployment for Singapore
              <strong>born</strong> citizens are lower, it's all been
              agglomerated. Surely the drastic increase in population
              is attributed to foreigners and not locally born Singaporeans.

              <p><br>Oh dear!</p>
              <p>You have a comprehension issues. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read eagle's last paragraph post again.</p>
              <p>"Reflecting the sharp deterioration in economic conditions, the overall unemployment rate rose from 2.5% in December 2008 to <strong>3.2% in March 2009</strong>. <strong>Among the resident labour force, the unemployment rate increased from 3.6% in December 2008 to a five-year high of 4.8% in March 2009."</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Surely you understand that if you and 5 of your friends only have an average of $10 and the overall average (8 persons) are $20, you definitely need more money from the other 2 person to bring up the aveages to $20. It's simple logic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your first statement is a clear show of comprehension issues, read my original post again. Since when did I say "foreign workers are more unemployed than residents"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For your benefit, the original post attached:</p>

              <p>ok than.</p>
              <p>Just keep in mind that foreign workers are here to work. when they get laid off, they leave and go home, so the numbers is not representative of the employment rate of residents versus foreign workers. Your money example is a very poor example of the situation and is very very misleading. Comprehend that.</p>
