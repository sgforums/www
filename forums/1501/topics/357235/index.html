              <p>ask for an official reply on why you cannot get their cert back, like through email or something. than go to your MP, and post on Stomp.</p>

              <p>best way is to email to SPRING and ask for help.SPRING will do their best to help you however it is quite isolated case. I have EXSA award too SILVER yet my company give me to keep. So funny why your previous company is so strict with the cert even you have been awarded. So it is not fair for you even you have silver exsa pin. I also from Food industry.</p>
              <p>Or you can go to govt and assist their help since it got power.Why not ask restaurant association for help so it will assist with SPRING?</p>

              <p>hi. i just graduate from poly and found a permenent job. before
              this i had been working in yoshinoya for 3 years as a part-timer
              and last year i was nominated for the EXSA silver award. the
              ceremony is already over. the company kept our cert and claims that
              they will only give it out to us during annual dinner and dance as
              it is their policy. As my job that will be starting next month,
              they did not approve their empolyee to have secondary employment.
              therefore, i need to resign yoshinoya before i start my job. as i
              wanted my cert back, i try to call their HQ and the general manager
              told me that i won't be able to get my certificate back if i resign

              <p>two pronged attacks to yoshinoya</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1 . Write to Straits Times Forum since they do not have the valid reason to keep your cert .Let the Public Relation Manager hve the full power from the Media to release</p>
              <p>Its very common for Japanese company to do this .So show them that here we are singaporean ,cannot be trifled with .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.Call up å‰�çº¿è¿½è¸ª to have your story featured ..they die die have to send you the cert else they will be questioned by MOM or SPRING</p>
              <p>3.Get ready to report to MOM of such abuse .Once MOM step in , they have to do something else they get into MOM black list</p>
