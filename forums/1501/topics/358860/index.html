              <p>The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has released the key findings of its report Research and re-employment, 2008 which shows tertiary-educated Singaporeans were one of the most vulnerable groups of the global financial crisis in 2008.</p>
              <p>Unlike the previous downturns when the less-educated were the most vulnerable, mature residents with tertiary education faced during 2008 an above-average risk of retrenchment and below-average opportunity of re-employment.</p>
              <p>During this time 16,880 workers were retrenched or had their contracts terminated prematurely, which is more than double that of the previous year. Most of these redundancies were recorded in the fourth quarter with 9410 workers being laid off compared to 3180 laid off in the preceding quarter.</p>
              <p>Although seven in 10 locals retrenched in the third quarter of 2008 were re-employed by December 2008, those with degrees found it particularly difficult to gain re-employment.</p>
              <p>The number of redundancies recorded in 2008 falls short of the number recorded in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis (32,800) and in the 2001 economic downturn (27,570).</p>
              <p>For further information read <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/press_room/press_releases/2009.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Redundancies and re-employment, 2008</span></span></a> on the MOM website.</p>

              <p>Allow me to suggest a  way to find out how true is what the TS is suggesting.</p>
              <p>1. Follow the style of wayang party club's highly effective video interview and document in a film the process of job application and getting help from all the organizations that says they helping to find you a job or claims of real job openings.</p>
              <p>video record all these from the time he goes to these places and submits the application , capture the date with newspaper date to prove what day that is and chronologically follow his job hunting process.</p>
              <p>1. of the many job forms submitted, how many calls did he get to either acknowledge his submission or tell him the shortlisting period ended or he was successful or not in being shortlisted and if he even get any calls emails or sms to attend any interviews.</p>
              <p>This is one solid way to prove what is going on and a snapshot of the situation.</p>
              <p>just my 1.99 cents.</p>
