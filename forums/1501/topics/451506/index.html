              I started work in my new co. this January. Thought everthing was fine, just that it is a 'one man show', meaning only the boss and me who is the employee. I thought I can learn more as since is one man show, I take care of everything from finance to paperwork. 
              
              But as month go by, I find the job may post a danger to my safety.
              Why I say that is because almost everyday, I was made to go to diff banks to do money transfer (withdrawing and depositing) and this is not even part of my job as an office clerk. The money transfer is my boss's private matter.
              
              Everyday I have to cross the roads to get to the bank and at certain time of the day, the roads are heavy with traffic. 
              
              There was even once when he instruct me to withdraw a $9k cash and start doing bank transfer and also go to money changer at a certain branch to remit money to his daughter in overseas. This I have to take taxi.
              
              I am worried about my safety. Should I resign?
