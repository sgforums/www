              <p>Dear Web Developers,<br> <br> I'm keen to pickup web development using <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio 
              2008, ASP.NET</strong>. I've checked around and found the usual classroom 
              courses not suitable for my needs. Books are good but I thought having 
              personal guidance will bring me up to speed quicker.<br> <br> I already have the source-code to a web-project (in <strong>ASP.NET 3.5 and 
              C#</strong>), now need to modify it and also to add some components. Just to 
              be sure, the source code is acquired legally.<br> <br> Basically you'll need to step me through the codes, show me the basics 
              of how things are done, and answering my questions along the way. I 
              don't expect you to know everything or to answer every single questions I
               have, but you should be fairly well-versed in your work. There is NO 
              NEED for you to prepare any coursework or materials... we just meet up 
              for coffee and chit-chat over the source code, very simple :-).<br> <br> I have programming background (was a LAN-based analyst programmer before moving to Project management) so your job shouldn't be too hard (i hope,
               hehe...), although I understand web development is different due to its
               stateless nature.<br> <br> We shall meet in a cafe like Mcdonalds or Starbucks at a convenient 
              location, and I will bring along my laptop.<br> <br> Each session should take about 2 hrs and you'll be remunerated at 
              $50/hr. If the session is complete fast and takes only 1.5 hrs, you'll 
              still be paid the full 2hrs. And if the session takes more than 2hrs, 
              you will be paid extra on half-hourly basis. For those very senior or 
              solid developers, I will also consider paying more.<br> <br> We probably need quite a number of sessions over a couple of days, and 
              can always arrange for more if you're proven to be good. <br> <br> If you fit the job (or know of anyone who does), please kindly drop me a
               PM stating briefly experience together with contacts...</p>
              <p>Anyone can 
              apply. No race, gender, or age limits. Fresh grad or even students may 
              also apply. The only requirement is <strong>good knowledge</strong>, <strong>positive attitude</strong>, 
              and <strong>can explain things clearly</strong>.<br> <br> ASAP please.<br> <br> Thank you.</p>

              <p>I guess it's only fair that potential candidate know a little more 
              abt myself. I am a chinese guy in his 30s, and will shamelessly proclaim
               myself as a rather solid programmer in my younger days :-). Had not been doing 
              coding for a number of years now since I went into business project 
              management.</p>
              <p>Although I have very little knowledge of C#, I don't need to go 
              through the basics things like loop construct, IFs and Else, 
              etc...Remember I was a ex-developer myself, so those who try to make a 
              quick bucks by attempting to smoke me, well 
              it doesn't work. You got to provide higher values.</p>
              <p>Eariler when I said anyone can apply, I meant anyone with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">solid 
              grasp</span> of C# in ASP.NET, and also OOP.</p>
              <p>This opportunity is 
              available only because I believe in paying to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">speed
               up</span> my learning. So if you're slow, I would probable have found a 
              solution to my needs.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, application is still open. 
              Interested party pls email "  <strong>learn.webdev123 "at" gmail com</strong> "<strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Thank
               you.</p>
