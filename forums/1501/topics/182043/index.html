"Stress, fear, anxiety -- the feeling goes by many names, but in the workplace, foreboding of some kind is as commonplace as Post-it Notes and coffee cups," according to Jobs Rated Almanac 2001. The bookÂ’s survey lists these as some of the most stressful occupations:<br><br>Â• Air Traffic Controller: Quick decision making is required, with thousands of lives at stake in every decision.<br><br>Â• CEO: Corporate executives have to please everyone, from stockholders and board members to employees and customers, with millions of dollars on the line.<br><br>Â• Firefighter: As Sept. 11 proved, being a firefighter is an exceptionally dangerous job. Even under typical circumstances, firefighters risk their lives.<br><br>Â• Police Officer: Danger, emergencies and unknown circumstances characterize this work.<br><br>Â• Taxi Driver: You may have the patience of a saint, but listening to passengers scream about the traffic or the planes they need to catch can frazzle even the calmest person.</div>
