              <p><strong>S Pass workers may face tightening measures: Tan Chuan-Jin</strong><br> <span class="update">By Saifulbahri Ismail | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 25 October 2012 1407 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Singapore government may tighten measures to check the inflow of foreign workers with mid-level skills.<br><br>Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said he will provide an update on this as early as the first quarter of next year.<br><br>He
               hinted that foreign workers in the S Pass category may face further 
              tightening measures as early as the first quarter of 2013.<br><br>S Pass holders are mid-level workers earning at least S$2,000 a month.<br><br>Statistics
               from the Manpower Ministry showed that the number of S Pass holders 
              rose from nearly 114,000 last year to about 128,000, as of June this 
              year. <br><br>For the first half of this year, the number of Employment Pass holders dipped from 175,400 to 174,700. <br><br>Mr
               Tan said it is likely that companies are using S Passes to bring in 
              more junior-level professionals, managers and executives (PMEs).<br><br>He
               said: "I've mentioned before the S Pass is a sector we are not totally 
              comfortable with, because there's a lot of transference of Employment 
              Passes into S Passes and we are now exploring measures to perhaps 
              tighten that segment."<br><br>Speaking at the Small and Medium 
              Enterprise (SME) convention on Thursday, Mr Tan explained the government
               is neither trying to close the tap completely nor  reducing the current
               numbers.<br><br>"The tap was turned on and running in the past, at a fairly fast-flowing rate," said Mr Tan. <br><br>"The
               tap continues to run, but what we've done is to actually turn the tap 
              to move at a much slower pace that we think is sustainable."<br><br>The government has always been moderating the increases to a sustainable rate, one that enables businesses to grow, he said.<br><br>Mr
               Tan said his ministry will continue to listen to feedback from 
              businesses and exercise flexibility where possible, as long as it does 
              not compromise Singapore's long term objectives.<br><br>He also assured businesses the government will manage the pace of manpower tightening carefully.<br><br>Mr
               Tan noted that if tightening is too aggressive, many businesses will 
              fold and if it is too slow, the economy will lose the momentum for 
              change, so a careful balance is needed.<br><br>To moderate the impact on
               companies, the government makes incremental changes and announce these 
              changes early and provide time for companies to adjust.<br><br>Mr Tan also explained why the government tightened foreign worker supply.<br><br>He said Singapore cannot continue to rely on low-cost foreign labour to grow the economy.<br><br>The
               price advantage that companies offer cannot be based just on lower 
              cost, as Singapore cannot out-compete its neighbours, who will always 
              have more ready access to low-cost labour.<br><br>Mr Tan also said over-reliance on low-cost labour imposes hidden costs on the economy and on the society.<br><br>It reduces motivation to innovate, raise productivity and move up the value chain.<br><br>Mr
               Chan Chong Beng, the president of Association of Small and Medium 
              Enterprises (ASME) said: "If (companies) want to survive, these are the 
              realities they have to face. Asking for more workers is out of date." <br><br>He
               added: "So I think SMEs should give up that idea and look forward to 
              the next level of support that the government can give and look very 
              carefully again to productivity because this is the only way for them to
               survive in time to come."<br><br>Mr Tan said the government will continue to support SMEs to grow by being more productive.<br><br>Early
               findings from a recent study commissioned by the National Productivity 
              and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC) involving 263 SMEs showed many 
              know what kind of support is available.<br><br>While more than nine on 
              10 SMEs polled were aware of the government productivity drive, only 
              slightly more than one in 10 said they eventually benefit the schemes.<br><br>Some of the reasons cited include having to deal with a tedious application process.<br><br>Mr Tan said over the next few months, the government will look at how to administer such schemes better.<br><br>Mr Chan said productivity schemes should be made simpler to understand and wanted to see more government support.<br><br>"Most of the SMEs do not have cash to go into a grant and many a time they have to fork out the money," said Mr Chan. <br><br>"So,
               the government should also look into areas in which how the SMEs can be
               helped financially to kick start any grants that they have."<br><br>- CNA/ck/xq</span></span></p>
