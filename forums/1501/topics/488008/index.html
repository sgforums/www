              <p>Hi, after doing some personality tests at a job fair, I found that there
               are a list of jobs that I am suitable to do. There are two of them 
              which I am interest in after I have look through the whole job list, 
              they are the software development and Web development. These are the 
              only two from the list that I find interest in. <br> <br> I have done bit and piece of computer programming such as basic HTML and
               using a fighting game engine call "Mugen" to create a basic fighting 
              game character which I have managed to learn halfway through and have 
              not completed yet. I have done Visual Basic, HTML, XML and Java 
              Programming at ITE 13 years ago. <br> <br> I am planning to further my computer programming studies at some 
              computer programming school such as BMC as they offer Computer 
              Programming course, but I have doubt such as I am not sure where after I
               have graduated from the school, which computer programming or software 
              development companies can I work at. I am also thinking of being a 
              freelancer to help people to code program and earn money from it like 
              freelancer webpage development. I have saw some Software tester jobs in 
              some job search engine, is it advisable for me to start as a software 
              tester?<br> <br> I have also heard from my parent that let say if I work at a company as 
              software developer or computer programmer, I must also have knowledge of
               other computing area such as Computer Network troubleshooter, hardware 
              and so on such that in one scenario if there are short of manpower whose
               is/are responsible for being the maintenance or troubleshooter for the 
              computer network (for example) in the company, as I am one of the 
              software developer or computer programmer, like for example if there is 
              any deflect in the networking system in the laboratory or office, I need
               to be able to find out where the fault is/are and to be able to solve 
              the problem which is the computer networking field, is it true?</p>
