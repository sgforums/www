              <p>Hi jacknife,</p>
              <p>What it means is that if you earn more than SG$1.6k, </p>
              <p>- You are not given the priority of claiming your salary first before paying off any of your debts to the company</p>
              <p>- The commissioner do not have the right to ask about the amount owed to you by the employer</p>
              <p>- The hours you worked can be more than as stated by MOM, and the amount of rest days and holidays can be less than as stated by MOM, in accordance to the contract of service which you signed with your employer</p>
              <p>- Subcontractors for labour are also considered as employees, thus the above three apply to them as well.</p>
              <p>By the way, this means that if you do not owe any debts to your employer/company, you can make a complaint to get the salary owed to you.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>MOM would look at your employment contract and would give you advice based on that. MOM would usually act as a mediator.</p>
              <p>I advice you to make an appointment with MOM, take half day leave and bring all relevent documents down. They are the best person who can advice you.</p>
