              I guess not many people like their current job and always hope to land on an ideal job one day...
              
              but the fact is.....there will never be one job that you can land on without any complaints...it is either you don;t like the job, the boss, colleagues, management style....
              
              it is just human nature...
              
              if you are still young and without commitments, you have the luxury to hop around...
              
              but many people have commitments like housing loan and feeding a family to think that their job is not interesting....
              
              and there are people out there who badly wants a job, but could not get one....
              
              so, just be grateful that you are working and earning an income....
              
              take your time to find out what you really want to do....

              it's not solely the environment or culture. It's the people Im working with. Esp this guy who is my boss's bf. He totally no respect for the peers and criticizing others when its not even the person's fault. He just gives order for ppl to do work for HIM. WHO THE HELL HE THINK HE IS. Just an idiot who loaf ard, and interfering other ppl matters when it dun even concern him at all.
              SO RUDE without manners at all.
              
              Funny part, he claims he is ''MY EMPLOYER" when he is JUST A "HENCHMAN".

              anyway, im preparing to throw my letter early next week before they confirm me.
              I am very tired already. I just want to stay away from this company for good.
              
              I see no point staying when I awaz get sick since working here.
              I just want a simple job ...start work on time and go back on time...

              frankly, I would say that the problem you faced with your colleague is common in other companies also.
              
              this is a sad fact of life...when people are in power, they like to abuse that power and bulldoze down on others.
              
              well, if the work experience had affected your health physically and mentally, I guess it is better to change job.

            <div class='col-md body'>For Singaporeans, you should be versatile like you are able to multi-task and do different jobs because the Singapore economy is very uncertain. Should you get terminated or retrenched, at least you have many other job experiences to fall back on. Its never too late to change job. In Singapore, Job Hopping is very common....you aren't the only one doing that Job Hopping.</div>
