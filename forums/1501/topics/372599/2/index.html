              <p>I have attended alot of interviews, but not selected. thats life in a market like this. also the interviewer tend to use this time to lower the pay even though you have experiences in this job before. The pay the interviewer said, we cant afford to pay you this much, are you willing to consider this amount, which is the pay of a fresh grad, those who are starting out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if I am offered this job, should I just accept it? at the same time, you feel that the pay you are given does not commensurate with your many years of experiences in this job.</p>

              <p>true. but some poly grad pay is higher than a degree pay and some fresh grad pay is not even 2k, some starting at 1.6 to 1.8k, whereas some starting pay is 2.5-2.8k.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but if you are continually looking for other better paying jobs, interviewers will ask you, why do you plan to quit your company? you dun stay in your company for long? what if I offer you this job and few months down the road, you quit and look for better paying jobs.</p>

              <p>During interview you can say that you want to find a better salary job as the pay is very low or lie that its a 1 year contract job that ended..</p>

              <p><span style="color: #551188;">Hi all,</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #551188;">
              </span></p><p><br>Currently, those who are still looking for a job... attended interviews after interviews and yet not selected. I have gone through this also at one time. But mine is due to age.... always got this reply too old for the job. Then I decided it's time to change mindset and look at building a homebased business.</p>
              <p>By chance I discovered this work-from-home business opportunity recently through a flyer at my HDB flat gate. Visited the TWI marketing website and registered for the free public talk. Attended the talk and was totally swept off my feet by the simple business concept with exceptional Eco-friendly products &amp; great payplan.</p>
              <p>A reputable Inc 500, 24 years old American-based company with great products and business model/concept. Launched in Singapore since 2006. Currently, have 3 stores in Singapore as of March 2009 and 4th store opening soon in Woodlands.</p>
              <p>A simple long-term and recession-proof home business. Proven, profitable and reliable work-from-home business, even ordinary housewife have done it successfully.</p>
              <p>Free weekly training provided by our group Marketing Executive Director  ...to start building this home business.</p>
              <p>I'm glad to have found this new home business. With a super low start up cost I'm in partnership with a big reputable company. And this coming Friday(2/10) the founder &amp; CEO of this company is coming here from U.S. to address Singapore partners in a speech, announcement on new developments and giving awards to newly achieved Directors at Grand Hyatt ballroom.</p>
              <p>This company is currently open in 12 countries including Singapore. Next on line to open is Malaysia market estimate end 2009 or early 2010.</p>
              <p>Best of all, it can be done without affecting your job when you get one later. You can earn an additional income from this home business.</p>
              <p><br>Take the challenge to register and attend the FREE public talk at marketing website: <a href="http://housebrand-sc1073.thetwigroup.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://housebrand-sc1073.thetwigroup.com</span></a> <br>To have a better understanding of the products and business concept, recommended to attend the free public talk. After the talk, proceed to view the Company's showroom with the full range of products.<br>No obligation, just attend and listen what you can get from the talk. Doesn't sound good or interest you, just walk away. Afterall... it's free!</p>
              <p><br>Just want to share this good opportunity. Hope it maybe of help to someone here.</p>
              <p><br>Opportunity is there but the choice is yours!</p>

              <p>Don't be stuck in this mindset that the job you applied for are those that are similar or relevant to what you have done in the past. If you don't then you will find it harder and harder to find a job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now in this day and age must be able to adapt to different circumstances. I have had friends who did marketing but went to other departments to work. Also at this period, must be ready to lower your expectations. You definitely most likely will not be able to get the pay you were drawing previously, unless your employer very generous or this position need special set of skills that very few people have.</p>
              <p>Waiphyohon - After getting CCNA cert, if possible try to go for MSCE or MSCA cert. This are microsoft certifications. Many companies are looking for people with both CCNA and MSCE certs.</p>
