              <p>TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p>Despite repeated attempts by the PAP to get companies to re-employ Singapore workers when they reached the mandatory retirement age of 62, some 15 percent of companies interviewed in a survey conducted by the Manpower Ministry still refuse to do so.</p>
              <p>The most common reason given is the lack of “suitable” jobs followed by poor work attitude and inability to keep up with changes.</p>
              <p>Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong was quick to jump to the defence of these companies:</p>
              <p><em>“Some of these companies have not put in place these re-employment practices partly because they still have a very young work force. Some of them are small companies that just started up so their workforce is still very young and they have not thought about it. Some of them have not put in place these re-employment (practices) because they were restructuring.  They do not have opportunities for these older workers,”</em> he was quoted as saying in Channel News Asia.</p>
              <p>With the inevitable aging of the Singapore labor force, the PAP is trying desperately hard to retain as many elderly Singaporeans in the workforce as possible to lessen the burden for the state.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are constantly being exhorted by PAP leaders to work for as long as they can while remaining “cheaper, better and faster” at the same time.</p>
              <p>There are no labor laws put in place requiring companies to re-hire Singaporeans. As such, employees are at the complete mercy of their employers.</p>
              <p>Neither are there independent trade unions to fight for the interests of these workers. The only legal trade union in Singapore NTUC is a pseudo-PAP organization which is always led by a PAP minister.</p>
              <p>Though Singapore is the second richest country in Asia after Japan, its citizens enjoy few social welfare benefits from the government.</p>
              <p>A growing number of Singaporeans will need to work well beyond their retirement ages to support themselves because they simply do not have sufficient savings in the bank or CPF to depend on.</p>
