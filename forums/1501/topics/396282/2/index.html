              <p>But you are not in Thailand aren't you? and do you see company in Singapore send E-mail via Mandarin? and official language is English and business communicated in English</p>
              <p>TS isn't talking about a job located under HDB flat...she is not reading Chinese newspaper. She is responding to advertisement in The Strait Times. classified ad. Folks who want to hire chinese speaking only will advertised in chinese newspaper.</p>

              <p>The chinese have muslim minority and basically have over 50 ethnicities. So to limit chinese as "Han" reflect your own ignorance about China.</p>
              <p>So does it means that if India growth exceed China and your company focus on India?  All of us chinese will be fired? Or now suddenly you hide behind generic race called yourself I am Singaporean Leh??? what would be your Sing Indian think about your double face?</p>
              <p>If you are completely absorb by one majority you set yourself up to be excluded by others.</p>
              <p>Any chinese firm who does international business will know how to speak some basic English....if the organization in China that you work with does not speak English you have to ask yourself u sure you want to do business with these folks</p>
              <p>Also.....There are plenty of foreigners working and doing business in China...they speak spanish, German, French....etc....So .....u think speaking mandarin give you an edge......Until now it is not proven yet....</p>

              <p><br>i've been saying that too...</p>
              <p>if no one wants to work the construction, the table-wiping and all that at the pittance of a wage, then use foreigners... if they demand that these jobs are to be given to Singaporeans at a higher wage, then they should jolly well put their money where their mouths are and pay up the higher cost which will be incurred by the merchants!</p>
              <p>give good value and not demand handouts</p>
              <p>most of the SC idiots' rants have this same common denominator: we want, we deserve, we don't want to work for it, you owe us a living...</p>
              <p>no one owes anyone a living.. whether you are Singaporean, foreigner or martian</p>
