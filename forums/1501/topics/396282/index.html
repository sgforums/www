              <p><br>really.. if you have to speak Mandarin, and you are unable to, should i still hire you?</p>
              <p>and if you make Mandarin a compulsory subject in school, you will hear a litany of complaints from people like you about it...</p>
              <p>screw the conspiracy theorists and whackjobs out there, you want to learn something, you learn it yourself... if you are not a fit for the job, then giving you the goddamned job is a waste of everyone's time..</p>
              <p>if you want the job that much, go learn the language... you don't see me kpkb-ing when i know i will not get certain jobs advertised because i do not speak japanese, thai, bengali, bahasa or arabic or whatever...</p>

              <p>Making it a compulsary language would be direct racist act by the gahmen.</p>
              <p>If there is one language that should be compulsary, that should be malay. I'm not pro malay or anything but look at the fact that we're comfortably sitting on malay soil.</p>
              <p>Although we're a so called multi-racial country with an ever changing culture, we shouldn't be ignorant of the past. Its said that sooner or later as more people come to Singapore, we would be losing our identity. Is Singapore fated to be doomed?</p>
