              <p>I have been working for about 6weeks in this company.

              <p>Another company just offered me a position with a salary $900 more than what im currently getting. Job scope will be different but its something I know i can do.

              <p>Better go, lots of people will kill for that kind of pay increment, and it's true, look out for yourself, working life nowdays very short, when you are 40 years old, you will be in danger of being retrenched, so make hay while there's sunshine.</p>

              <p>remember that no one is indispensible in singapore nowadays.</p>
              <p>there is no moral-contract between employer and employee nowadays to provide for a stable pay and stable job.</p>
              <p>your $2.6k job can be easily hijack by cheap foreign replacements, and therefore, your role as an employee is to be mercenary and work for the highest wage.</p>
              <p>that being said, a $3.5k job can too be hijack by foreigners, but nevertheless, you get to enjoy an extra $900 every month, and that is something to live for/ work for.</p>

              <p>update:</p>
              <p>told the news to my section manager and he received it quite well. He was disappointed but at least he didnt scold me. He tried to work out with HR for a counter offer but they could not match it, so they accepted my resignation letter.</p>
              <p>GM is overseas so i dont know how he will react to the news when he returns...anw its only 2 weeks of enduring the awkwardness so i will grin and bear it. Hopefully everyone is in the CNY mood.</p>
              <p>thanks for your opinions guys...</p>
