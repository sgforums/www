              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I believe there are alot of people out here who are very knowledgeable about pay/politics in Singapore. I am making a decision about something, pls help if can..</p>
              <p>I am holding a UOL degree (2nd lower honors) in Economics, and have just gotten a position in a certain stat board. However, the post I'm applying for is actually a executive service officer post (most of the degree posts are unavailable). As such, I understand that the post is actually for Diploma holders with 2-3 years working experience.</p>
              <p>During the interview, I had the impression that I will be given degree grade while holding this position. But I received the call from HR, while I was delighted that I selected, I realised from HR that my payscale grading is not degree grade, but diploma grade. HR had informed me thatÂ for degree grading, the scale is something call SUPERSCALE, HASE or AMAX (something like that, i'm not sure sorry). But for my case, it will be MSO because the post is actually MSO. And because of my experience, I am given MSO grade 3. So, in a way, I will be in this scale all the way, going forward.</p>
              <p>My friends told me that it will be very hard for me to change scale (from dipolma to degree scale) and next time if I"m promoted, I will be promoted from MSO grade 3 to 4, to 5, etc... and will not be going to upwards, but moving along that scale.</p>
              <p>Does anyone know what does it mean? I heard that it's also performance based... May I know what is the increment for scales such as MSO(3). Is there any bonus in stats board (I heard there's performance, mid-year, year end bonus)? Then in the event i'm promoted, does that means that I"m getting MSO(4) while retaining my designation.</p>
              <p>I dont' know and I will be calling HR to let them know my decision!</p>
              <p>That said, I must say that I appreciate that I've found a job in stat board in this bad times. They are only looking for one position and I got it. I have thanked God and I really appreciate. I am only curious about the payscale, paygrade that stat board is offering (I've never worked in stat board before).</p>
              <p>Please give me your advice, gentlemen</p>

              <p>From MSO3 you get promoted to 2, 1 than HASE Executive.</p>
              <p>There is only performance and year end bonus.</p>
              <p>I think you shouldn't accept the job as MSO grade is for diploma holder. You should apply for other stat boards which have vacancies for HASE Executive</p>

              <p>Yup. You shldnt. If you care abt long term prospects, find a better posting. 2nd Upper degree might hold more advantage since tt's usually the cut off for those high flier in most Big MNCs n government jobs.</p>
              <p>But if the money is fine with you are the moment, you can consider building up on your Job resume instead. After all freshgrad r consider greenhorn and it's the employer market now, so tt could be one approach if you got time to wait.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, check whether your present network or job finding strategies are extensive enough and work on that. Job hunting skills and career coaching might help in that aspect. Read up online for more tips for free. Think of how to stand out among the rest of your peers and cover up whatever weaknesses during interviews.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>
