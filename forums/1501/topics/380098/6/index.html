              <p><br>actually this allegation is quite dumb too....</p>
              <p>there is not reason why you cannot be of the same name as another company especially when these are two very different entities.... even if your true name is Mr Marketing and your parents name you Jovin, a company by the name of Jovin Marketing cannot sue you. any problem will occur only when there is a registered business called Jovin Marketing, you set out another business with the same name. However such restrictions do not occur in a forum nickname.</p>
              <p>Feel like calling myself Nike..... Just Do It!</p>
              <p>but of course, you realised that danny's assumptions are.... rather juvenile.... so let's humour him lah.... otherwise his job is really boring.</p>

              Hi MPS_Angels<br>
              <br>
              This the risk of working for small company. The boss can suka suka
              do what they like with a work enviroment that is
              pro-employer and with employee being not legally savy.<br>
              Employee can be helpless against such cheating, deviant, bully
              boss.  </p>

              Sadly I happen to meet one of this kind....learn to be smarter...actually I find it strange that nobody will punish these people...its not justice or punishment I would want to see actually I would like to make sure that no one else should be cheated in the same manner again....most probably the same employer can go around doing the same thing again and again....<br><br>
              
              Another incident that I can point out will be during my younger days I went for an interview for some telemarketting job and this company interviewed us just tell us that we will not be paid anything fixed salary...all you do is to call up client and then get paid for per call (one phone call $0.50 and appointment made $3.50)...lunch time also can not go out...I happened to see one of my friends there and she advised us not to work there....I would think that this is a case of bully too....<br><br>

                              <p>xtreyier, I agreed with your point. CPF is one thing that
              employers can't run away. My ex-company went bankrupt as well,
              without paying us salary but in the end the ex-owners are
              compelled to pay CPF, and now they are paying us back the owed
              salary as they want to clear theor bankruptcy status.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Latest news from CNA: "91% of Singapore workers said that they are more likely to work for an organisation that is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ethically</strong></span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>socially responsible</strong></span>."</p>
              <p>That is the right move to put these bad employers out of job applicants' radar screen.</p>
              <p>MoM must educate these bad employers.</p>
              <p>Lousy employers will attract lousy staff as these workers are not wanted elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Good employees will leave bad employers... that's common sense.</p>
              <p>Examples of bad interview questions by bad employers I have experienced:</p>
              <p>1. <strong>Can you always work OT happily and without any problem?</strong> (the position has no OT entitlement) - this is a very bad employer as it does not have work-life balance for the staff. Everybody needs a well balanced lifestyle, the employer needs it themselves but they rather slave-drive their staff.</p>
              <p>2. <strong>Can you work on weekends voluntarily but no off-in-lieu? </strong>This shows an uncaring employer. Do not join them. You will die in office eventually. If you don't die, you will fall sick.  </p>
              <p>3<strong>. As a good manager, you will work alone without any assistants</strong>! That means if you are a marketing manager, you will take on the roles of the marketing assistant, marketing executive and maketing manager. Guaranteed you should work until you die!!! You are no longer an employee but a slave. Unless they pay you well and good benefits and you are a workaholic, then I have no comment la.</p>
              <p>4.<strong> Your current salary is $3000, we offer pay you S$2500 to start off. You go for 6-month probation and we will decide</strong>!!! This is another probable sign of a bad employer!!! Unless your current salary is way above market level, then it is worth considering.... If not this is a blood sucking employer!!! Beware.</p>
              <p>5<strong>. Work 5.5 or 6 days company</strong>. Unless it is a service job but many have gone 5-day week with the promotion of worklife balance by MoM. Asked the employer why still 5.5 or 6 days? They replied: Rest so many days for what!  But they themselves  work 5-day and rest 2 days? Another sign of bad employers!!!</p>
              <p>6. <strong>Only 7 days of annual leave</strong>. Real blood-suckers!!!</p>
              <p>7. <strong>Miserable monthly salary but no AWS.</strong> Good to work temporarily only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I fully support Chin Eng and all for their good comments as responsible employees and good corporate citizen!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Danny talks nuts!!! No wonder you can stay in your company... lol...      </p>

              <p><br>thanks, but actually, the only one real point i made was that if anyone feels that his company is being victimised by unfair comments, he should make a police report because libel is a serious offence.</p>
              <p>but it seems that the individual, in spite of all his claims, cannot even make a simple correction on the website of his company.</p>

              <p><br>this has got to do with the predatory instinct of all animals.....</p>
              <p>i won't go as far as to use the word "torture", but taking advantage of someone else is a common behaviour, this is especially so when there are no strong human resource policies in place.</p>
              <p>having said that, there are also unreasonable employees who attempt to pull a fast one on their bosses....</p>

              <p><strong>MoM has grown teeth!</strong></p>
              <p>Seven employers were charged in the Subordinate Courts this week. Five were charged for failing to provide their workers with the statutory benefits under the Employment Act (EA). These included failing to or under-providing their employees with annual leave, rest day, overtime pay, rest day pay and other infringements such as requiring their employees to work excessive hours and making unauthorised deductions of salaries. <br>To read more:-</p>

              <p>What and who is covered under the Employment Act?<br>The Employment Act covers every employee (regardless of nationality) who is under a contract of service with an employer, except: <br>a)Any person employed in a managerial or executive position <br>b)Any seaman; <br>c)Any domestic worker; and <br>d)Any person employed by a Statutory Board or the Government. <br>Part IV of the Act, which provides for rest days, hours of work and other conditions of service, applies only to: <br>a)Workmen earning not more than $4,500 basic monthly salaries and <br>b)Employees earning not more than $2,000 basic monthly salaries.</p>

              <p><strong>So, as an employee, dont be victimised. No employee wants to be taken advantage of, but at the same time, employees too must not take advantage of employers, Fair play begins with you and me.</strong></p>

              <p>Please don't join a educational institute known as Jewellery Design &amp; Management International School aka JDMIS. (Website:<a href="http://www.jdmis.com/">www.jdmis.com</a>)</p>
              <p>Any position they hire are underpaid with below market prices, and yet they expect YOU to work from 830am to 9pm and need you to work on Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays, having weekday off.The bosses work every single day and expect all staff to give 150% work quality and yet they never want to pay overtime pay.</p>
              <p>All positions within the company also need to stand in as adhoc cleaners, to clean the tabletops, dry the carpet when anyone drop water on the carpet, empty the trash at end of day.They should use titles like "Operations Manager cum cleaners" in their employment ads.</p>
              <p>When I was on my first week of job, they told me to initiate a sales call to Malaysia without my basic knowledge of their school functions. Then they expect me to deliver marvelous results. I am indeed a sales cum HR cum operations cum cleaning cum inventory cum course coordinating cum work schedule manager. My title is operations manager and yet they have the cheek to pay me only S$4000.</p>
              <p>When I asked for few weeks of unpaid leave, they have the cheek to ask me to leave the job. The bosses operate on no basis of rules and regulations. Anyway I have lodged complaints to Ministry for Education, Manpower and other relevant authorities for their crazy working patterns.</p>
              <p>For people thinking of getting a job there, please be warned!!!</p>

Since this thread seems to have had some representation for employers, I would like to address some of these statements and raise some general counterpoints for those of you considering joining a small business:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>As any small business owner can attest, starting and growing a business requires tremendous effort and commitment – owners will frequently work every day in order to ensure their vision becomes a reality. Owners do this without overtime or benefits, with substantial personal investment and a high statistical probability of failure. The smaller the organization the more is expected of its team members; and if the organization is successful in growing, the more those initial contributors stand to benefit. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In the early stages of any enterprise, funding and sales are a considerable challenge; and efficient budgeting makes the difference between success and failure. Small organizations neither have the budget nor the organizational framework to support benefit programmes such as those offered my MNCs and Government bodies. Similarly, the prospect of hiring someone who will spend up to a month on paid leave is simply not a reasonable option for small business who don’t employ surplus staff to cover extended absences. As such, most small businesses need to find a balance between finding a great team and managing their operating costs by being parsimonious with their benefits and salary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In our school as well as in other growing businesses, owners and employees have responsibilities that extend to keeping the workplace clean and presentable; any potential employee that feels above pitching-in to keep their environment pleasant for their colleagues and customers should seriously reconsider a decision to join a growing business. We are proud of our facilities and have a clear vision of the positive experience that awaits out students; when staff or management see things that are not in-line with this vision, we take action (be it for a spill on the carpet or a more comprehensive recommendation for facilities improvement.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In conclusion, as a growing organization devoted to the quality of education of its students, the JDMIS does indeed expect much from its employees, instructors and owners. While its standards are high, the school offers limited benefits due to its size and stage of growth – it does however recognize the effort and loyalty of its team members that are working together to make the school’s vision a reality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Sincerely,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Alex Z.<br>Director,<br>Jewellery Design &amp; Management International School<br>www.jdmis.edu.sg</span></p>
