              <p>Guys, let's put our egos aside. Let us in goodwill find a solution. We all are not perfect, employer or employee. We all make mistakes, and do have the capacity to correct it. Let's give all a chance.</p>
              <p>Danny seems responsible enough, and even if just one voice were to sound out within that company's organisation for better, change can be possible in time.</p>
              <p>If it does not, rest assure this thread will continue to be filled with workers disappointment, which ultimately will lead to public outcry and whiplash which no public company can afford to survive without goodwill from citizens.</p>
              <p>I am sure the purpose of this thread by the TS is not penalise any company, but to help better employee and employer relationships. We all share the same aim, food on our tables.</p>
              <p>Time and patience, with goodwill on all sides is necessary for change of the better to happen, i guess.</p>

              <p>I am posting in personal capacity do not stop me from inviting disgruntled individuals from coming to our office to provide more proof on their negative feedbacks so that we can improve ourselves.</p>
              <p>I am extending invitation to Chin Eng and EarlNeo, care to make your presence felt in my office? I am no longer interested in hearing your nonsense as from all my clarifications and your empty accusations, I believe people with clear mind over here can see that you are personally attacking Gain City for your own agenda. But I am not sure what do you stand to gain from here besides showing others how comfortable you are masking behind scene, issuing irresponsible, unproven words like small kids, much less responsible individuals.</p>
              <p>And yes, Chin Eng, Danny is my real name and I am working in AMK HQ. Where do you work? Which company? Care to disclose? Or continue to hide behind scene joining in the fun with empty words, accusation or hearsay?</p>
              <p>A company who has low turnover rate is a good company? Otherwise vice versa? I would never expect EarlNeo to be so shallow and surface in his observation or thinking logic.</p>
              <p>The recent walk out of more than 70 bankers from RBS to rival banks is a bad company? Based on your logic, yes, because the numbers rep 30% of the total staff strength in Singapore.</p>
              <p>EarlNeo, every company has it own policy. If one cannot accept the policy, he has the choice to leave or not even signing on the dotted line in the 1st place. I believe you have a set of principles yourself. But in case if you don't, at least now I understand why. One has to learn to respect himself before others can respect him.</p>
              <p>Having said all these, I have made enough clarifications and I do not wish to waste more time entertaining both of you who are only capable of issuing unaccounted for remarks with knowing details.</p>
              <p>You have your freedom to continue entertain yourself with more irresponsible and unjust words about Gain City, about a company who has provided for 500 man and families. I will not rebutt further as it is pointless for me to waste my energy on both of you.</p>
              <p>Should you decide to accept my invitations to drop my our office in AMK for a good chat and prove your negative words on Gain City with evidence, we are willing to listen and make improvements.</p>
              <p>Otherwise both of you can continue to keep each other entertain on this tread and your useless accusation, after all readers here should see that who is above the board disclosing his own location while inviting others to share in a face-to-face chat, with no hidden profile or agenda.</p>

              <p>having said that.... i am not the one accusing Gain City of anything, i am never a customer of Gain City and it is unlikely that i will ever be one.... also, it is unlikely that i will ever be employed by Gain City, so whatever employment issue is really none of my business.</p>

              <p>I came across a rather disgusting employment complaint in the forum page of ST today.</p>
              <p>A boss from the food and beverage industry was once again lamenting the oft heard complain that Singaporeans are shunning his kind of jobs but a plethora of foriegners and PRs were clamouring for it, but due to strict Singappre labour laws, he couldnt hire them.</p>
              <p>What disgusts me is his lack of plain economics comprehension and pushed the blame to our citizens.</p>
              <p>The simple law of market forces determines the viability of a business enterprise - supply and demand.</p>
              <p>If the business owner wants to invest in a FB outlet, he must research if he can competes against other companies on what he can offer. Location, price and capital are the main factors. If he has it, then he should have no problem going ahead.</p>
              <p>However, if he lacks the manpower, which is virtually impossible during this crisis, it only means he is not paying a better renumeration to attract workers.</p>
              <p>For example, if every owner pays $1000 a month salary and claim this is the market rate, then there are many outlets for a worker to choose work from, from the best to the mediocre which will be shunned. FB outlest are dime a dozen in this day and age.</p>
              <p>If he pays $2000 a month salary, i would be sure his HR would be swamp with calls, and queue lines form outside his office even before sunrise.</p>
              <p>He would complain that he cannot afford such salaries, against market rates, etc, etc, lame excuses all.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, he wants to profit. If his product is good, he should be confident it will attract customers, and will have the quantity to make the profits to pay his workers more.</p>
              <p>If his product is lousy, have no confidence, pays 'market rate' or low salary, it only means he is out to scam for a few bucks off the backs of our citizen workers. Better off he dont start the biz, free up the space for more confident others, free up our intelligent workforce to work for others, free up MOM's time to helping others instead of him, and die a quick biz death. </p>
              <p>Singaporeans have money and are willing to spend. There is profit to be made. BUT BOSSES MUST BE WILLING TO SHARE SUCH PROFITS WITH ITS WORKERS. THOSE WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO DO THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBLE PART MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE AND HINDER OTHER COMPANIES WHO WILL SHARE!</p>
              <p>NO MORE MUST WE ALLOW SCAMMING WANNABE BOSSES TO CHEAT CITIZENS AND PROFIT OFF THEIR BACK, AND MAKE EXCUSES TO HIRE FORIEGN WORKERS!!!</p>

              <p>Chin Eng, you have implied in your post that you have agreed to other flammes without knowing the fact. And you keep insisting that what the others said are true. Do you know the truth? Are you in the right position to comment.</p>
              <p>A person above board would have no fear in releasing his real name without conditions. Anyway your name is your not important to me. I have invited you to come to my office and it is your call.</p>
              <p>NancyLeong, at least I am in a better position to clarify on misleading issues because I work here and I know what is going on, unlike you, whining there based on your hearsay. All your so called facts finding are through 3rd party. Who is shallow?</p>
              <p>Xtreyier, I do not agreed with you to a certain extent but however as you said, market force would decide the fate of a company. Everyone has their choice, freedom in their selection in life. I do not think you need to be so agitated because in business, there are many concerns besides just overhead cost, sellable products, etc. Sometimes the applicant can be very unrealistic in their demand.</p>
              <p>I ever came across a couple of retrenched high fliers applying for very junior post but asking for their last drawn pay citing reason that they can share their wealth of experiences with the company. But however, they failed to realise that we are in need of junior post and although their experiences are much sought after, but we maynot have an immediate need on that. So sometimes business owners are forced into making certain decision by such concerns,</p>
              <p>But on the whole, I do agree with you that ownes must pay reasonably market price and employees on the other hand, should not ask for sky high salary when they have not even proven their worth. Everything has got 2 sides. It depends on which perspective you are coming from. We have a choice in life.</p>

              <p>Discuss it objectively and don't insist your views on others as the rest are talking about it neutrally as the subject of a bad employer.</p>

I have spoke to the Jovin marketing and she is making a police report so that she can get the forum administrator to release your IP address for police investigation on your fake representation. Good luck to you. I am also interested to find out who you actually are posing off as someone else. This is plain gutless. Shame on you.</p>
              <p>When other flammers are talking neutrally on bad employers, are they? I have mentioned that we provide financia loans to some really needy employees, do they know? I have pointed out some employment conditions were pre-agreed by most parties, do they know?</p>

              <p>Again, I thank you for your openess, and would greatly encourage those who have issues with your company to have 'coffee' with you. A door had been opened where once it was closed. Some will be too disgruntled to enter, but those who thinks there may be a chance for better would be welcome thru your door, not that things may change, but the chance and opportunity is there. As mention, employer or employee, our aims are the same - to put food on our tables, if not for ourselves, then for our loved ones.</p>
              <p>And yes, there is a freedom of choice. But that freedom in Singapore comes at a price espacially for employers, both local and foreign, which they must appreciate and return in kind. Some naive local bosses think that they will go overseas instead to profit and pull up stakes here.</p>
              <p>I will share this experience with others here on my overseas assignments. I was once in Pattaya when a cashier pulled out a silver magnum and pointed it at her berating supervisor in a small convenience shop. I fled immediately - no one screws around when a gun is flashed in anger. It shocked my pampered singaporean naive young eyes on how guns could be used, but prepared me for what is to come later in my overseas career.</p>
              <p>This incident and several others had prepared me to always keep a stack of notes and a gun together in my office drawer. It is a way of life, espacially in the US and african states. The choice of use depends largely on the outcome of negotiations. I never had to use the gun, only flash it a few times in an open suit to let the more rougher elements of biz entities know i mean business. More often the stack of notes is used.</p>
              <p>Which is why many foreign companies prefer to do biz here. We have peace,  little if no corruption, rule of law and law abidding citizens. This is the premuim local bosses must recognize and not take for granted, and if he goes overseas, be prepared to live as i lived once, for to live by the gun is to die by the gun, as the anti gun lobby in US is fighting to repeal gun ownership laws.</p>

              <p>I would like to re-emphasize again that I have never denied that none of the issues mentioned are accusation, but some are based on which perspective you are coming from and some are just really based on hearsay.

But I am not sure what do you stand to gain from here besides showing others how comfortable you are masking behind scene, issuing irresponsible, unproven words like small kids, much less responsible individuals.</p>

              <p>Chin Eng, you have implied in your post that you have agreed to other flammes without knowing the fact. And you keep insisting that what the others said are true. Do you know the truth? Are you in the right position to comment.</p>

              <p>Chin Eng, on your ninth post, you have responded to EarlNeo telling him no point for him to feedback the so called wrong employment issues which in my personal capacity, i would not be able to do anything to change the policy of a corporation.</p>
              <p>Such post simply implied that you agreed with EarlNeo on his accusation to our company. You are smart in not mentioning names but just touched your heart and swear on yourself that you are not implying and I am willing to rest my case with you.</p>

              <p>again, where did i say that the accusations are true, what i say is that i suspect in your personalcapacity you may not be able to do anything. which is not to say that there is anything to be done in the first place.</p>
              <p>you accuse others of making baseless accusation, unfortunately you fall in the same boat too.</p>
              <p>whatever implication is all in your mind....as i'd said before, i have no issue with Gain City, never been a customer and probably never will. not because there is anything wrong with Gain City, but it is not a natural choice for me.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">PLEASE SHOW AGAIN WHERE I HAD MALIGNED GAIN CITY! otherwise you are no different from the accusers of your company!</span></strong></p>

              <p>Jovin marketing, are you really the Jovin or just someone faking other's identity? I have spoke to the Jovin marketing and she is making a police report so that she can get the forum administrator to release your IP address for police investigation on your fake representation. Good luck to you. I am also interested to find out who you actually are posing off as someone else. This is plain gutless. Shame on you.</p>
              <p>When other flammers are talking neutrally on bad employers, are they? I have mentioned that we provide financia loans to some really needy employees, do they know? I have pointed out some employment conditions were pre-agreed by most parties, do they know?</p>
              <p>So unless your friend are in the management position, they will not know and never know.</p>

              <p>you are damn lame.... you think the police will entertain such request? why not simply write to admin and request to check if jovinmarketing is a clone or not? i give myself the nickname McDonald's and you can get the police involve? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>so i take it that you are in a management position in Gain City?</p>
              <p>why not follow your own advice as per my earlier suggestion... go report to the police on the libelious remarks in Sgforums... your case has a stronger stand that jovin marketing.</p>
              <p>however it is strange that i am not able to locate any Jovin Marketing in the Google.... hmm... maybe they are not listed.</p>
              <p>i also did a search using Internet Yellow Pages and the search returned zip, nada, zero... maybe Jovin Marketing's phone is unlisted.</p>
              <p>in the event if you think i am implying anything... <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jovin Marketing is not my clone</span></em>.... need to clarify that, to you, with the great imagination....</p>

              <p>Chin Eng, why are u so uptight on Jovinmarketing? Admin advise as long as there is a police report lodge, they will release Ip address. Read up more on legality before you speak.</p>
              <p>I have invited you for a chat with me face to face. I am no longer interested in clarifying on your block mind and simply add on to your own indulged entertainment in your own world.</p>
              <p>Carry on with your negative posting. I think you are just someone refuse to listen to clarification and just harping on the same issues over and over again. I admire your persistence in this instances, even though you behaviour may not be someone of a sound mind. </p>
              <p>xtreyier is right. I have been very open to all other flammers including you where I am willing to listen to them in person so that I can help to clarify if there is a need. I do not see why I should waste my time with you over words game, falling into your game. When someone is not willing to face another party face to face for clarification, it only tells his character.</p>
              <p>You can say whatever you like. You have the freedom of speech. But do remember, everyone has to be responsible for their own speech eventually, whether online or offline. Do not stop your post. Do not disappoint me please. I am enjoying your flamming post. Please keep me entertain with your post. At least your post helps to relieve me off my work stress, at times.</p>
