              <p>anyway, if the company doesnt pay well or the job or company culture sucks, staff turnover rate is high. there will always be other people who will take up the position, no matter what, cos they need to bring home the bacon home every month, even if the company sucks to the core.</p>

              <p>you are not different from the accusers of your company!</p>
              <p>but as I'd said many times before, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">i HAVE NO PROBLEM with Gain City</span></strong>, which part of this simple statement is difficult for you to understand...</p>

              <p>Chin Eng, why are u so uptight on Jovinmarketing? Admin advise as long as there is a police report lodge, they will release Ip address. Read up more on legality before you speak.</p>

              <p><br>admin actually replied you...? wow.</p>
              <p>obviously i know that admin will release IP address... <strong>didn't i already say it in my first post?</strong>.... however it is the police report that is the crux.... you think police got so much time to investigate similar sound name, especially where there is no conflict of interest....?</p>
              <p>there is really no law governing the use of nicknames on the internet even though the nick may sound the same as a company.</p>
              <p>now that you are interested in reporting to police, you need to balance as to what is more important.... someone using a purportedly legal business, ie Jovin Marketing, but with no malice, vs someone badmouthing your company... to you which is more damaging?</p>
              <p>you obviously got no balls to report to the police over the post on Gain City....</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>so you won the case and never get any money back? was there any enforcement by the court and how much you spent on legal fees sia?</p>

              <p>why ah bengs sell appliances? reason is simple, if the pay and job is that good, you will see many singaporeans rushing to apply it. obviously they dun pay that well, and who wants to work retail hours and you need to stand all day long at the store. its hard attracting sg to work in retail line already, who knows, next time you will see foreigners selling appliances there.</p>

              <p>why ah bengs sell appliances? reason is simple, if the pay and job is that good, you will see many singaporeans rushing to apply it. obviously they dun pay that well, and who wants to work retail hours and you need to stand all day long at the store. its hard attracting sg to work in retail line already, who knows, next time you will see foreigners selling appliances there.</p>

              <p>I can empathise with you on your predicament. A worker works at his own expense for 30 days under the contractual terms of being assured of full pay by then.</p>
              <p>There are bills to pay, stomachs to feed, and in the case of women, cosmetics, dresses internal and external, etc. All such costs are borned by the workers.</p>
              <p>And when the employer screws around with pay, the worker is stuck with a liquidity problem. Worse if it gets dragged on for weeks.</p>
              <p>THIS MUST STOP!!</p>
              <p>Currently we can take legal action, some did, but the costs sometimes are more than what the salaries owed. There is MOM, but there is something that is seriously wrong with MOM if it only intends to help those whom are of lower salaries.</p>
              <p>Commendable as it once was and still is, but the rationale needs to be updated and upgraded. Majority of us citizens, now in the era of cheap foreign labour, had been elevated to mid management levels. Only few citizens and mostly foreigners are below the 1700/mth cap.</p>
              <p>If the MOM, a singapore born and bred institution,  continues with its policy, then it may well be serving foriegn interests and not our fellow citizens interests. We do not need unions, for unions mostly serve low wage earners, but MOM is still a power employers need to contend with if they hope to do honest biz here.</p>
              <p>We had seen how little or no regulation/interference in private enterprise had destroyed the financial wealth of the world and entrap us all into looming poverty, thus no more must we allow it to happen again. MOM must be given the power to stand up to employers.</p>
              <p>Another aspect is the CPF owed by employers. Even if they dont pay salaries, CPF is unlikely to let them go on the CPF owed. No one screws around with CPF. On this, workers can be assured of CPF Board's teeth.</p>
              <p>And thus, the last option is this site and thread. The TS, as mentioned, has no intention to penalise any employer or employee. No employer is perfect and no employee seeks for the skies.</p>
              <p>If any worker is abused, and has the evidence to back it up, this may be an outlet. No that it may resolved his problem, but it will help others to shunned his ex-company, shame it to either better performance or die a natural death. Such company must not be allowed to exists if it intends to make use of our intelligent workforce, take advantage of them,  for their own selfish aims or lack of leadership in management.</p>
