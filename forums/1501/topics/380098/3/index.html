              <p>I wonder what is the turn over rate in gain city. ie if Danny_RGS know and willingly provide us with that figure.</p>

              <p>I bet that figure tell a lot more then wat is been said here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Locking employee for 2 month even when they are just shop/sale assistance kinda hinted us abt the turn over rate...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Being a savior by providing job or just abusing employee? I guess most reader have a mind of their own to decide. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Earlneo, if you can come to my office, I would arrange to provide that figure to you.</p>
              <p>Otherwise who are you to tell us to show you our turnover figures or other classified confidential info online? Can we request you to show us your P&amp;C info on monthly income over here as well?</p>
              <p>Come on, locking employee for 2 months does not link to the turnover rate but rather the complexity of the job nature itself which requires new staff to be trained properly. This shows the responsibility of the company rather than to throw the new staff into the job, letting him siwm alone without the guidance of his predecessor.</p>
              <p>I am not here trying to create a saviour impression on Gain City. But rather fair words has to be spoken. It seems that in your opinion including other flammers here, as long as one company do not provide the comprehensive employee benefits as expected, then the company is abusing the employee.</p>
              <p>I suggest in this case, you might want to start a thread on McDonalds because they pay their front end sales only few dollars per hour over long hours of work as well.....Do McDonald ill treat their company?</p>
              <p>So like I said, everyone is free to post their thoughts here. But trying to mislead or affect ones judgement to find out the truth is never a honest act and it really only tells how much integrity one has on its own.</p>

              <p>fireng, well said. Hilter call himself a saviour. But the difference is he has long gone from this world and we are still here after 28years</p>
              <p>This proves that we do not really ill-treat our employees like what most flammers trying to mislead over here but rather as the old saying goes, one man's meat might another one's poison.</p>
              <p>Just my 5 cent worth of opinion. We should be ethical enough and not start to issue irresponsible and untrue comments. I believe we are not taught on removing the planks after crossing the river. That would be very sad for all flammers here, if they do.</p>

              <p>I need not say that all said in this post is not true. Long working hours for some departments, below market pay...maybe...but then think about it carefully. We all have a choice in life. Once we made the choice, we go for it. And along the way, something better comes long, we grab it and move on.</p>

              <p>I applaud you for your efforts and thoughts. However, as Chin Eng had clarified, being grateful for a job is one thing, but to be abused by it is quite another.</p>
              <p>I agree with you that truth and veracity should be made here, as objective as possible. There may be some hurt feelings along the way that compels one to write in perhaps an angry tone.</p>
              <p>However, that an angry tone is used certifies something had gone wrong within the company that made one such. There is no smoke without fire. One complaint may be just a vent. But when there are many others who complained the same, there may be some truth in their freedom of expression posts.</p>
              <p>No employer is perfect. No employee seeks for the skies. What minimum standards are there if employees are made to suffer for mismanagement, malpractices and character flaws from higher ups, just to earn that buck? Be grateful for being abused? You must be mad to suggest that our workers accept such fate.</p>
              <p>You may be the lucky one to face no issues, and given the benefit of doubt. What about many others? Are you calling them and demeaning them as liars?</p>
              <p>This thread is meant as another feedback channel to the employers and their management stuff. We all make mistakes, but we must correct it inorder to improve. Either they accept the criticism or they can choose to ignore it and continue on with their way. No one can be forced. Ultimately, in the end, who suffers?</p>

              <p>Danny_RGS, so it's true that Gain City requires 2 months notice? If this is true, it's rather long as MOM recommends 1 month notice only after 5 years of service. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
              <p>No, I dont think he should leave, regardless if he speaks or do not speaks on behalf of the company. Everyone must not be denied the freedom to speak, so long as it is responsibly done.</p>
              <p>The ultimate purpose of talking and communication is to find a solution, a win - win one for all, if possible. Workers and employers must work hand in hand and never be allowed to degenerate into chaos. When that happens, no one benefits.</p>
              <p>We all can do it amicably for we all have the same aim - to put food on our table for ourselves and our families, responsibly without taking advantage of anyone or being taken advantage of.</p>

              <p>I think xtreyier speaks fair words. I applaud him for his fairness and openess.</p>
              <p>For Chin Eng or whoever tried to hide behind the scene and ask me to leave, you have no position to do that.</p>
              <p>As an employee, I see no harm in clarifying on untrue words about the organisation I work in. It will only encourage you or other flammers to continue issuing irresponsible and untrue remarks and that will really hurt an organization that is not too bad as what it has been painted.</p>
              <p>Every company has its own policy and we should respect it. We should never impose personal value onto others.</p>
              <p>As I said, we are  here to clarify, not to sue anyone. But if someone wants to bring the challenge to us, we will consider so that the phantom Chin Eng could learn how to be responsible for their unjust words and behaviour towards forum speech freedom. Just a reminder to Chin Eng or phantonm alias, there is such thing as IP address.</p>
              <p>So unless you or any other flammers could prove what you said is 100% true and not just based on accusation or hearsay, you should stop issuing damaging remarks on Gain City as we have to be responsible for our words and actions, whether online or offline.</p>

              <p>to Ben750, I am not sure what is the notice period for retail sales as I am not responsible for that business division.</p>
              <p>However, a fair statement would be called up the company @ 65651212 to enquire about the notice period or you can always apply for interview.</p>
              <p>There and then, you can seek your clarifications on the employment contracts and you have your own freewill to decide whether the job offer will suit you.</p>

              <p>what i am trying to get at is: the forum is not a place for a company (a business entity) to clarify it's stand on it's employment issues. if this company is not prepared to do anything beyond just posting in sgforums, it will not achieve anything.</p>
              <p>so, if i had not been clear on this issue, i apologise.</p>

              <p>As an employee, I see no harm in clarifying on untrue words about the organisation I work in.

              <p>Thank you for your kind words and understanding.</p>
              <p>I am not the moderator and have no power to enforce anything. I only appeal for rationality. Let us not resort to threats of legal actions or whatsoever, and if necessary, then let it be the last resort.</p>
              <p>Social responsibility begins with the employer offering employment. Employment opportunities are not charitable acts for employees help companies to grow and profit, profit of which the employers gets to keep a bigger stake for his investment and risks.</p>
              <p>Let no voice be muzzled by threats, if concerns are genuine. It is only by vocing out in annonymity that a person may get heard. If a company acts on such concerns, either a misunderstanding or a real mismanagement practice, then it would be up to the management to correct such flaws, and not attempt to sweep it under the carpet, for goodwill is of paramount importance in this new world order for both employers and employees to survive, without being taken advantage of or taking advantage of others.</p>
              <p>Idealism perhaps, but change can only begin with us, and such changes are long overdue. Let not another crisis occur in order that we learn from our misakes.</p>

              <p>Hi Danny</p>
              <p><br>Nicely done. I was not sore nor sour. In fact, I do wish them well, as they had an edge over others in terms of technology when I departed. I thought I could learn and esatblish the product further. But sadly, I am not the one.</p>
              <p>Going through drawers and PC is fine for me as well. What is not fine is, they did it when I was not around. They were worried that I would do malicious things to the programme I wrote. They were worried that I could leak the key to some specific money technology. They were just plain worried that a staff like me might betray them.</p>
              <p>Naive, I guess I was. I thought by working on other areas the coy lacked in, I had a better chance. So I brought my own hardware for the job. That was the part which led to the suspicion of me stealing data.</p>
              <p>I have to admit. I was naive. A cockster maybe. But does it equate to any incapability of my performance?Perhaps, the perception I projected might be.</p>
              <p>Anyway I thank you 2 for the critism and comments. Instead of flaming or fighting back, I should read it even more carefully and think what was it that lead to the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have a good day ahead. =)</p>

              <p>To xtreyier, I agreed with you wholeheartedly, As I said, I am here to clarify and I do not like to be denied the freedom to speak as suggested otherwise by Chin Eng.</p>
              <p>I knew IP address would only be released unless there is an legal action which it is never our intention to do so.. This is the reason why we took the pain to clarify ourselves here.</p>
              <p>Of course I have never denied that there are certain truths but majority are untrue facts which we need to clarify ourselves for the benefit of others. On the character flaws of the higher ups, we will definitely take the feedback in good stride and improve on them. But we would also not hesitate to stand up against untrue, harmful remarks which may damage the reputation of the company and its employees in the long run.</p>

              <p>having said that.... i am not the one accusing Gain City of anything, i am never a customer of Gain City and it is unlikely that i will ever be one.... also, it is unlikely that i will ever be employed by Gain City, so whatever employment issue is really none of my business.</p>

              <p>Earlneo, if you can come to my office, I would arrange to
              provide that figure to you.</p>
              <p>Otherwise who are you to tell us to show you our turnover
              figures or other classified confidential info online? Can we
              request you to show us your P&amp;C info on monthly income over
              here as well?</p>
              <p>Come on, locking employee for 2 months does not link to the
              turnover rate but rather the complexity of the job nature itself
              which requires new staff to be trained properly. This shows the
              responsibility of the company rather than to throw the new staff
              into the job, letting him siwm alone without the guidance of his
              predecessor.</p>
              <p>I am not here trying to create a saviour impression on Gain
              City. But rather fair words has to be spoken. It seems that in your
              opinion including other flammers here, as long as one company do
              not provide the comprehensive employee benefits as expected, then
              the company is abusing the employee.</p>
              <p>I suggest in this case, you might want to start a thread on
              McDonalds because they pay their front end sales only few dollars
              per hour over long hours of work as well.....Do McDonald ill treat
              their company?</p>
              <p>So like I said, everyone is free to post their thoughts here.
              But trying to mislead or affect ones judgement to find out the
              truth is never a honest act and it really only tells how much
              integrity one has on its own.</p>

              <p>haha... of coz i din expect u to provide me with any figures, i doubt any company would. esp those that are in the high region.</p>
              <p>Locking employee in, is to facilitate the handing over of job and/or to provide the employer sufficient time to rehire a replacement. Long duration of more then one month are usually impose on those of higher position and are harder to replace or those with complex job scope.</p>
              <p>I doubt shop/sale assistance fall in that category. What they trying to sell? rocket science engine? I wonder what is so complicated that need to take 2 month to teach? Even BMT is only 3 month.... Beside, most employee are capable of learning on the job itself....</p>
              <p>Even if it is for the benefit of the so call "<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; color: #333333;"><strong>guidance of his predecessor</strong>", isnt there more then one shop/sale assistance that is still working? cant they fill in that role? anyway, just my 2 cents and am sure the reader know which to believe.</span></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, some employer misused that to discourage employee from resigning or at least encumber them securing a new job. If a job is that good, most company wont even bother having locking in of more then 1 month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not flaming nor comparing ur company or any company. All i did was pointing out that "turn over rate", does tell us a lot about a company and that on the above mention, "locking period" too say a lot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like all thing good, they can be misused to the benefit of either end. Am sure reader have a mind of their own to know which end it is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
