              <p>The worst employer is the Government Linked Companies.</p>
              <p>By manipulating the NTUC - which is run by a PAP Minister-without-Portfolio in the Prime Minister's Office - the Government has encouraged adopting the idea of short term employment contracts that are renewable every 3 to 5 years.</p>
              <p>The simplistic reason given was that a "short term employment contract" allows the employer the flexibility of adjusting manpower needs, without having to adjust the salary or CPF of the workers.</p>
              <p>Nothing was elaborated that when manpower is adjusted - the short term employment contract is no longer renegotiated, and the employer simply wash its hands without even needing to give a "Golden Handshake" to the "expired" contract worker - as the worker is not retrenched but its employment contract had expired.</p>
              <p>Does a worker without job need to be concerned about salary adjustment or CPF cuts ?</p>
              <p>While the interests of the Employers are considered, did the PAP Government give any consideration to the interests of those workers who have been adjusted out of their jobs when their "short term employment contract" reach its end-date ?</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances, while the PAP Elites give themselves an iron rice bowl, they expect the Singapore workers to be contented with our insecure rice bowl.</p>
              <p>The obvious winner in this setup is the Singapore Government - who is the biggest employer of Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>I fully support TS's stand. There are many good employers as well as equally bad ones, espacially our very own SMEs and it is high time to expose those bad ones, who exploit and abuse those whom are helping them to profit in this crisis period. They must be brought to light, to be exposed, and shamed, so that others will not fall into their traps.</p>
              <p>Having a job is one thing, but being used and abuse is quite another thing. No human have the right to subject another to abuse in any form under any employment situation, espacially if it is done out of corporate greed!</p>
              <p>Moderators and site owners must not and never fear the employers threat to sue. If they have nothing to hide, there should not be any fear, and are free to represent their own views here as well. That they do not, but resort to legal actions is nothing more than to deny another freedom by muzzling it with legal action.</p>
              <p>It would be up to individuals to determine the truth and veracity of all claims.</p>

              <p>I am no communist. I believe capitalism works. I do not deny bosses their big bonuses or salaries for they deserved it if their management succeeds for they came out with the capital and took the risks.</p>
              <p>All every worker wants is a fair share for their hardwork pitched in, if not an equitable share. But in this crisis, some bosses are taking advantage of the situation, to profit fully at the expense of the workers. THIS MUST STOP!!</p>
              <p>I remember back in the old days of the 70s and 80s. My dad was an employer. He paid fair remuneration for a day's work. Mom would even bake cakes and bak changs to give to his employees during festivals and such. New year dinners were compulsory 10 course affairs. During bad times, my dad made sure everyone of the employers were paid, even during bonus periods, even if we, his family had to subsist on porridge and vegetables.</p>
              <p>But now it seems such attitudes were lost. We all had gone wrong somewhere. SMEs were the loudest to scream for help to the govt, but where slowest to help their own workers.</p>
              <p>They would rather spend profits on their mistresses, first class travel, dine in the best restaurants, splurge on sports cars for their own sons than to pass some profits back to their workers. Worse still, some use hire and fire strategies, and push the blame on society, on workers being choosy or demanding.</p>
              <p>No worker seek to disadvantage others, nor do workers want to be taken advantage of. Similarly for bosses, thus a need to find back the balance. We dont need confrontational union representation, but workers sorely need protection against abusive employers, and may this thread be an expose of such unscrupulous bosses!</p>
