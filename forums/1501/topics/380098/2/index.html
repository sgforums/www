              took the risks.</p>
              <p>All every worker wants is a fair share for their hardwork
              pitched in, if not an equitable share. But in this crisis, some
              bosses are taking advantage of the situation, to profit fully at
              the expense of the workers. THIS MUST STOP!!</p>

              <p>I fully understand your feelings. Which is why all the more reason we must weed out the bad eggs - local or foreign companies, from MNCs to the foodstalls.</p>
              <p>Better we work with employers who care about workers' welfare than slog hard for those that dont. It is a brave new world order that we are embarking on, and had seen the excesses of past bad corporate behaviour. We must never allow it ever to happen again!</p>
              <p>Those who dont feel uncomfortable writing out bad experiences in forums, then they can do it privately by becoming whistleblowers to the authorities. Bad malpraticising companies MUST BE eradicated before they bring more harm to workers and our society. Better workers be cruel to the bosses than bosses be cruel to workers. The financial crisis, its aftermath of exploitive employers must never be allowed to happened again. They must be shamed, shunned, be unsupported and die a natural death for their relic selfish bad management attitudes</p>

              <p>commercial schools in Singapore like MDIS, TMC etc. staff turnover rate is very high, so if you work for less than 1 year, you need to pay them 2 months of salary or 2 months notice when you quit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sucks man this type of policy. I hope MOM can do something to outlaw these type of companies penalising when staff were to quit. paying 2 months pay or 2 months notice is ludicrous.</p>

              <p>I was searching more about Gain City and saw their poor service shown in u-tube.</p>
              <p>Also an article by Business Times on Gain City - hope the reporter will check the fact carefully before they write about the company. It mentions that the director treasures his staff and takes care of them. Hope the writer checks both sides of the story from the views of the staff too!!! Pack of lies!!!</p>
              <p>Every other day - staff in Gain City either get terminated or resign!!!</p>
              <p>A former Finance Manager with Gain City emailed me and she commented:</p>
              <p>"It was nightmare in Gain City. The Financial Controller did nothing, always on MC. Late for work yet she scolds her staff for no discipline. She was not a good example herself. Coded as the curry flavour queen in the company."</p>
              <p>"The lady HR Manager did nothing to help the staff. She was not HR trained and did not know most of the labour regulations. The lady payroll manager was a super apple polisher, she would scream and shout to complete her monthly payroll. They need 3 -4 full time HR staff to do its payroll. Super inefficient!!!"</p>

              <p>I had the intention of applying for the job of a Retail Executive at GainCity when I came across this forum. From the comments so far, it seems that GainCity is not a good employer after all. Just looking at their website, they describe themselves as a very caring employer with promises of career training &amp; advancement.</p>
              <p>I'm just wondering what kind of sales target you have to meet before they asked you to leave (if you can't meet the target). Jobs are very difficult to get these days, especially for people like me (in the fifties). There are bills to be paid every month. In the worst case scenario, I may just go ahead &amp; apply for the job. At least, there's some income.</p>
              <p>Would somebody provide more insight about this company before I decide? Thanks.</p>

              <p>Basic salary is only $800 to $900!!! Work from 11am to 10pm!!!</p>
              <p>So many executives resigned every week!!! Every other month, 1 retail manager resigns!!! It speaks for itself!!!.</p>
              <p>The overall manager incharge of retail outlets is another super Ah Beng pretends to be educated!!! He is an uneducated asshole - super apple polisher!!! Pretend to be very busy when the bosses are around... Always hide in the corner and study his part-time diploma course during office hours!!!</p>
              <p>At night, he will apple polish the bosses - drinking sessions!!!  He will make the bosses happy by sacking staff. Record holder in sacking staff!!! He is a super office politics ah beng. Pretend to speak good english but all the broken english!!!</p>
              <p>Harvey Norman and Courts have very good staff welfare!!! No wonder my friends in Harvey Norman work there so happy even the work is tough.

              <p>Peterlumazhi, I think you have made up the stories. The bosses never go drinking session with anyone. I have been in Gain City for 3yrs and I certainly know more than you do.</p>
              <p>I have given my real name here. Do u dare to identify yourself here and point out who is the overall manager who hide in a corner and study for his diploma?</p>
              <p>Do u know Gain City bosses actually provide interest free financial loans to needy employees? You are only working in Gain City for a while and yet you speak so much as though you know alot but in actual fact u know nuts.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I think there are some mis-perception on Gain City. I have been working in Gain City for 3 years and I would  like to clarify some of the missing truth in my personal capacity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Firstly, the OT claiming hours from the finance side are pre-agreed by the foreign employees and finance dept. during their employment negotiation as part of the terms and conditions on salary, applying of S-Pass, etc. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Secondly, I have never seen or hearsay on any of our directors (MD or ED) shouting to any of our colleagues during my 3 years stay in Gain City, even till now. In fact, they are always polite and humble. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thirdly, on Gain City paying below market rate, there is no right or wrong answer to this. It is part and parcel of negotiation and market demand-supply situation. It largely depends on our negotiation skills and how keen we wanted the job.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If we have accepted the job unwillingly, then we shouldn't have in the 1st place because they did not force us to accept. Obviously when we accepted the job offer, it might not be because we were satisfied with the pay but there and then, there isn't any other better offers around. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So looking back, at least Gain City in a way has tide us over the period when we need a job to provide for our family while looking around for better ones.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fourthly, on the unmentioned of 1 year contract employment agreement, as far as I knew, most of the companies in Singapore are already implementing contract employment to encourage continuous performance driven result for re-contract of employment. Even civil sector are gradually, if not all, removing the permanent contract scheme to identify performance drivers so that their career path can be better map out by the respective organisation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">On MC claims, we do accept private clinic claims besides polyclinic claims and the individual entitled claim amount was also increase from Y2007 to Y2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lastly, whether the individual HR or Finance manager has a character flaw or personality clash with the employees, the employees have avenues to address their grievances against their immediate superior. It is never the company intention for any of its middle management to mis-treat their fellow employees/colleagues which is against the company idea of creating a harmony working environment for all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Of course there are certain areas that we might have not done enough or may not be to the ideal of every employees but at least the minimum terms are provided. It is this minimum that allows the company to continuously provide a stable career and income for the about 500 staff and their families.</span></p>

              <p>To Ben750, you are most welcome to apply for retail job in Gain City.</p>
              <p>You are right. At least Gain City can still offer you income and job stability as long as you can do your work. I mean it is only fair that each employee has to perform and not expecting the company to owe them a living.</p>
              <p>For the benefit of all those flammers here who spoke ill of Gain City behind the scene without finding out the truth, Gain City actually employ people of senior age, partial disability and even continue to provide for old staffs who have been with the company since day 1 by continue to engage them, to reassign their job task in consideration to their detoriating health.</p>
              <p>To Peterlumazhi, do Harvey Norman and Courts do the same? I am not sure so I would not comment. But on Gain City portion, please check your facts right before you flame. Don't join in the fun just because you have only been here a short while when your surface factuals could be wrong.</p>
              <p>Most people leave on their own accord and even the very few people who ask to go was tolerated for no result shown for more than 6 months, which I think is pretty fair for any organization.</p>
              <p>I am surprise that some ex-employees chose to voice out their grievances here when they could have done it while they were still with the company.</p>
              <p>This only shows one's character and integrity and how truthful their words can be.</p>

              <p>Hi people</p>
              <p>I had my fair share of bad employment in a coy. I really wonder why they implement a come 8.30am - 6.20pm 44 hour work week. Hours are really long. I feel kinda silly with this timing.</p>
              <p>Next, if the notice period of resignation is 2 months, my bet is the company somehow has bad management. Lock down the staff for 2 months or pay them back. It was a damn bad move for me to sign on the dotted line for that coy. Nobody forced me, but just an inexperienced staff looking for work.</p>
              <p>Last, working long hours is fine. 2 months notice period is ok. But if you are in the bad books of the management, good luck. I had this problem with one of the coys I worked with. My fault though... Come in late, go home on time. Problem is, why must we come earlier than boss and work later, even though we have nothing on our hands to work on? As long as my work is on time, why would you care?</p>
              <p>Surf net, chit chat and play games... That was all I did for my time spent there. Learnt nothing, gain nothing and did nothing. Ended up I had an alighnment with company's direction problem, issued warning letter.</p>
              <p>Resign for the good of my mental health. Interesting part, the management was so scared that I would leak company secrets, they got my colleagues to check on me, Scan my email, open my drawer to scan my hard disk and PC etc. Good thing I don't keep any porn in them! :D</p>
              <p>Now that I left, joined a local MNC, I feel so much better.Though work here is shitty, at least I am happier. Gone are the days of  my darkest hour in work. Close to a year after, never been happier working.</p>
              <p>To those who are feeling shitty and depressed at work, do not be dispair. Hang on and find the light that you need. It will come to you eventually.</p>

              <p>Firstly, the average working hours in sg is 9am to 6pm so your hours of 8.30am to 6.20pm is still ok.</p>
              <p>Even if you have nothing to do you still have to come on time and act busy. That is life. Know how to act busy. Since you hvae nothing to do ask your boss or collegues if they need help. This will make them like you</p>

              <p>Shrekho, I am not sure why are you in the bad books or how you are in the bad books of the management. But just a simple question for you, do you treat your friends better or those who are against you better? It is a simple logic.</p>
              <p>If you can highlight how you get into the bad books, at least it is more justifiable for all including me to understand whether you have spoke fairly on your working experience in Gain City.</p>
              <p>Using your logic on coming to and out of office anytime you want as long as you are able to perform your job, does it mean that the company can pay you anytime as long as they pay you eventually? You want the company to pay you on time and yet you do not want to work on time? I think if you are your own boss one day, your employees must be laughing at your naiveness.</p>
              <p> It is a basic work discipline in every company and yet to you can't follow and simply complaining your nonsense here.</p>
              <p>And I think you are trying to mislead people here about your exit procedure from the company. It is the same for most companies. I came from a local listed MNC and when I exited from that same company, they went through all my drawers and documents so that both parties are assured that there is no loose ends behind. Which I think is to our benefit because when we move on, we do not want to be label as suspcious character who brought unauthorised stuffs out from ex-company, as in the legal case of Citibank RMs who stole company clients accounts over to new company.</p>
              <p>If by going through such exit procedure can prevent future accusation , we should be glad that at least we are cleared, and we can move on in our life with a clean reputation. Isn't that right?</p>
              <p>It is human nature for ex-staffs to feel sour about their ex-company once they did not get what they think they should get, less thinking through whether they are treating the company in the same fair and just manner, but at least speak true words not just utter rubbish to make yourself looks like a victim. When you are pointing 1 finger out, you are pointing four towards yourself.</p>

              <p>Chin Eng, we do not need to sue anyone as we only here to clarify, not suing anyone to muffle up the basic objective, to clarify.</p>
              <p>I need not say that all said in this post is not true. Long working hours for some departments, below market pay...maybe...but then think about it carefully. We all have a choice in life. Once we made the choice, we go for it. And along the way, something better comes long, we grab it and move on.</p>
              <p>But remember, no one could dictate our choice or force us into anything. It is all about our own willingness. At least one should be grateful that when ones need a job, it is the so called bad employer like Gain City who gave ones the job to provide for their family in return. Fair statement?</p>
              <p>Otherwise to those who flame Gain City here, you might still be unemployed right now, or could landed up in a worst or better job, but you certainly will not have the time or opportunity to post your unjust words here.</p>
