              <p>According to many successful businessman (The guy in Door to Door, kirosaki, tony robbins, Gan Ah Seng, Billy Lim, Donald Trumph, Steve Jobs, etc) One of the most precious and only true skill in this century is the ability to build trust through rapport with others. And that means the art of selling yourself. Some of the best professions to expose yourself to these situations are in business (sales) and services.</p>
              <p>But having said that, many fail in sales. Be it insurance, cars, property, etc.</p>
              <p>To comment on ur last question: That is a very idealistic view point, unfortunately the insurance industry in sg dun work that way. Rarely do one meet agents that are place the consumer first. Many agents will sell u the product that get them the highest commission. This applies to tied agents and IFAs. One of friend who was an agent for 17 years commented that the best way to know who is the best agent, is to join that person's agency. That way u can see the real side of him/her. (Does he curse n swear abt clients in office? Does he complain abt rules and do things the easy way? Does he uses overly sales techniques to misrepresent information?)</p>
              <p>In insurance sales, the star is the one who bring in the highest sales. No one will care how the sales are brought in, until the victims complain with evidence against the agent. I'm sure the manager/director who is bringing u into insurance will tell u they dun hardsell, but so do everyone in the sales industry trying to recruit agents.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>You get to do financial planning, selling insurance, etc for clients who don't prefer to be tied down to a particular insurance company. For the start, you will most likely start off selling insurance to increase your network. But if your network is big enough, will probably not need this, from my understanding, the selling of insurance is to ensure that you still earn some salary.</p>

              <p>heard from her that it's the boss that makes a difference. And also the kind of trainings and support the boss and the agency provides. u sign contract wif Prudential oredi? If not maybe I can get my fren to give you a call on this.</p>
              <p>I feel It is advisable to noe more b4 u confirm which company u entering cos if not u will be wasting your time and energy.</p>
