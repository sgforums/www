              <p>I had already signed a letter of appointment with a company and going to start work soon.</p>
              <p>But I got another better job offer by another company which I prefer not just because of higher salary but I feel the job suits me more too.</p>
              <p>The letter of appointment that I signed says that either party can terminate the contract by giving 1 day notice during probation period.</p>
              <p>So if say the company wants to sue me for not starting work with them, it is not worth it right because they can only sue me for 1 day salary in lieu of notice?</p>
              <p>I haven't tell the company yet that I do not want to work for them because I feel paiseh and also scare that they might insist on the phone that I start work because I have signed the letter of appointment.</p>
              <p>So I am thinking I either email them tell them that I don't want the job already or I don't tell them and don't pick up the phone when they call me. After a few days of calling they will conclude that I do not want the job as I do not answer their call and never turn up for work.</p>

              <p>it's irresponsible to ignore them and assume they get what you mean.</p>
              <p>As long as the contract says 1 day, you can inform them. I don't think you will need to pay anything.</p>
              <p>Just cook up excuses or simply tell them better job opportunity if you want to be honest. If they really wish to hire you, they may increase you pay lei...</p>

              <p>This post goes to show how low ur EQ is.</p>
              <p>Your employer has a right to ask U to start work since U have signed their Letter of Appointment.U also have the right to tender your resignation letter.As per contract...you might be asked to pay 1 day notice-in-lieu...which I personally think is fair because U are the one who wasted their time and now wants out.</p>
              <p>Just send in a formal email to them about your intention and take it from there.</p>
              <p>Vanishing from earth is not the way an adult does things.</p>

              <p>face it like a man, despair is not a solution. you need to tell them the truth and i think they can understand because nowadays economy is in a good shape and start picking up. </p>
              <p>my suggestion it is better you come down and see their HR personally, not using email or phone even though you can email or phone them, but by seeing them personally you will look gentle in the eyes of their HR people.</p>
              <p>this is my two cents.</p>
