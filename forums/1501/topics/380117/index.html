              <p>of course it'll be better to get a diploma, given that singapore is a "paper" society.. you'll get slightly higher pay than nitec, and you'll have slightly better chances for career advancement (not that im saying nitec has no career prospects whatsoever).</p>

              <p>I think one of the major problem has to be your friends.</p>
              <p>You have to think, in poly, most of the time you are with your friends.</p>
              <p>If you can get 1.441 it means you never pay attention in class.</p>
              <p>You say you dont understand...Did you ask your teacher? Did you ask your friends?</p>
              <p>Are your friends those motivated students or those playful ones?</p>
              <p>And pls dont use "Im from ITE" as an excuse. Yes, there is a gap. And there are ITE students who come to poly and get 3.8 gpa during 1st year because they have already learn in ITE some of the modules.</p>
              <p>Once again, i advise you to ask the teacher if you don't understand. Mix with hardworking friends. Don't know then <strong>ASK.</strong></p>
              <p>Don't give up after one sem. You still got 5 more to go.</p>
              <p>Work hard now. All the best.</p>

              <p>Hi Farid,</p>
              <p>Please do not give up so easily, for you have 5 more semesters to bring up your results.</p>
              <p>I do not believe that you are a lazy person, for if you are truly one, it will be highly unlikely for you to get merit even in ITE.</p>
              <p>I sincerely apologise for saying this, but it is highly likely that you are a slower learner as compared to others, as we can see from the fact that you take a longer route to enter poly.</p>
              <p>Thus, you cannot work at the same rate as others. Anything which others put in an hour of effort in, you must be prepared to put in up to as much as five hours in. I encourage you to study together with your peers. Thus, if you have any problems, you can seek them for help.</p>
              <p>Do not have the mindset that just because they do better than you, you shouldn't seek them for help, as it will be embarrassing. Learning is about humility, and thus one should seek help when necessary.</p>
              <p>As for the pay, I will say that a diploma holder's pay will definitely be higher than a nitec holder's pay. The amount of pay difference is dependent on which sector is your job in though.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>hey hey...</p>
              <p>cherish your time of studying while you still can...it makes alot of differences when you go in NS as a Nitec grad and a poly grad. These differences can determine if you will have a good 2years or a tough one.</p>

              <p>you have to consider that NS helps to build up your character as i can say that you're pretty lazy , and you'll become more prepared to take on higher studies, </p>
              <p>TS , you're stucked in a position where you couldn't understand what is going on around you, you may have been mentally affected by it, which can affect your second semester. </p>
              <p>you 'll have to make a tough decision here. </p>
