              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Want to be a social escort? You need a degree first</span></span></strong>  <br> <br>THE quality of female social escorts or professional companions has gone up, say agency owners and managers.</p>
              <p>Clients, they added, have become more discerning and demanding: They want degree-holders.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The usual going rate for escorts is around $200 to $250 for an hour's work, while overnight rates usually hover around $1,000.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">But undergrads or graduates can command up to $500 an hour.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The agency operators insist that the world of the entertaining industry - as they would prefer to call it - is not as shady as it is often made out to be.</p>
              <p>Mr Ernest Ting of MS Promotions told The New Paper on Sunday: It is often misunderstood.</p>
              <p>'Think, why would someone want to pay so much, if all that is on your mind at the end of the day is sex?'</p>
              <p>A cheaper option, he offered: 'Head down to the red-light district and get your fix there. It'll cost you less than half of what you'd have to pay.'</p>
              <p>Another agency manager, MsGlenda, claimed: 'There is often a misconception. Many times, the clients who hire social escorts or who can afford to do so, are not your Ah Gongs and Ah Peks.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">'They are respectable businessmen who have to entertain their associates who could be in town for a few days.'</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">For this reason, added a manager of three agencies: 'Surely you'd not want to send the wrong message out to your clients?</span></strong></p>
              <p>PERSONALITY COUNTS</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">'They'd want someone who can dress up properly, carry themselves well and are able to hold decent conversations without stuttering, spluttering or making sheer fools of themselves.'</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">The trend in the past two years has been to recruit women who are in their mid-20s and more highly-educated.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Demand has been good, said MrTing.</p>
              <p>He added: 'Of course the other problem we face is that these girls can work as freelancers.</p>
              <p>'As such, they could be working for more than one agency. If we relied on just the number at hand, we could find ourselves short of manpower.'</p>
              <p><strong>Except for one, all the other agencies claimed that <span style="color: #ff6600;">there has been a 40 per cent increase in the number of undergrad and graduate escorts.</span></strong></p>
              <p>One agency owner, who only wanted to be known as Ms Kimoi, said: <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">'But many of our graduates have been with us since they were undergrads.'</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">She also revealed that these undergrads 'had initially entered the trade because they needed to pay their bills or fees'.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Ms Glenda claimed: 'Many of them later realise how lucrative or easy it is to make a fast buck and they become reluctant to leave the trade.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">'But they are usually in only for the short haul. Some do quit after a couple of years.'</span></strong></p>
              <p>A major international business conference last year had also seen an influx in the number of escorts for some of the agencies.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yet all the agency owners reiterated that escorts were not required to offer sexual services.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">But, added Mr Ting: 'We can't control what is negotiated privately between the escorts and their clients.'</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The managers and owners insisted that they do not get a cut of the 'extra services'.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Said one agency manager: 'Prostitution is not illegal in Singapore but soliciting is. We're not going to risk paying a fine, going to jail or losing our licence.'</p>
              <p>The offence carries a $1,000 fine. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $2,000 and jailed six months.</p>
              <p>But summing it up best was Mr Ting, who said: 'It's a matter of feeding the right type of meat to cater to the right palate.</p>
              <p>'We supply you with what you want. Simple.'</p>
