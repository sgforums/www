              <p>If you have zero knowledge on the piano. I doubt 2 months is suffice to teach you how to play the songs that you want to learn. My fastest student took 4 month to complete a pop song, and base on the standard, its much easier than the song you requested. And that is also with practice every single day. So maybe you would like to reconsider, and think whether spending this amount for 2 months of lesson is worth it or not. Piano lessons aint cheap. </p>

              <p>Save the money and get a second-hand music keyboard. You'll learn much faster if you practise on a daily basis. If you need guidance, get a book for beginners and ask for help from friends who play the piano.</p>

              <p>lol. I love teaching students who have "strong interest". They are usually the ones who stop learning at a later time. But on a serious tone, 2 months is only enough to pick up the basics and get use to the touch of the keys and songs. Usually such crash course is making use of the memory game, which I don't really recommend. ._. </p>
              <p>If got strong interest, make it a long term pursuit. You don't have to practice everyday. You can have lesson 1x week. And practice like 2x or 1x a week? Most students just practice before they attend lesson -.- they are still coping fairly well though. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>If your friends are having their graded exams, and maybe those of higher standard, like Grade 4 and above, then I would say it do take up a little of your time. But for beginners, depending on the teacher's pace, not much time is required. </p>
              <p>For me, I would advice, if you really have the passion, sacrificing 3hrs a week is not a lot. And I don't quite believe anyone would study 24hrs a day. In fact most of my students uses the piano to relieve stress during exam periods, If its private, students usually stop lessons for exam period. </p>

              <p>You can skip grade. But the practical exams are held once a year. So got to have more than 2 months of commitment. Also, its not very much about getting the certs, everyone out there has it lol. It has become more of a invaluable piece of paper. What is good is you truly learn what music and piano has to offer. There are many Grade 8s out there who can't play very well. </p>
              <p>The sooner you get your cert, the better it is, quality of certs are going down. lol. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>To be honest, I hated Guildhall, their songs were... Crap.<br>I did Guildhall because I like changed piano teachers practically every 1 or 2 grades, and some wanted me to do Guildhall the others ABRSM. They didn't give me much of a choice though. ABRSM's A and B pieces were good. For the C-curriculum I like it except the modernist jazz ones. I mean, like wth?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At age of 17, I guess, DipABRSM is ok~... But I know of some girls from my primary school, at age of 7 go to NAFA, by 14 they get LRSM already. FML.</p>
