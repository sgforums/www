              <p>2nd: The bold + highlight part. The boss tell you direct sales and such or not (Or even insurance?) ? Or was it telemarketing</p>

              <p>1st....LOL haha, classmate and Bff never work with me cos they found work already.. then when i ask them to help me find slot in the place they are working.. their answer all very standard one.. Arhh?? no space for you la or other type of answer is Okay la i help you find but two weeks later when i ask them again their answer is that they are still helping me find..LOL</p>
              <p>2nd... I find it a scam cos the boss claim it is a charity organisation and then he told us that he have 40 employee in the company right now and he have much more outside working.. he also say he interview abt 30 ppl a day.. Don't you find it weird?? Charity organisation can have so many worker and they are all not volunteer they are all paid to work!! Then i went online to search abt them and there is not even one link abt them.. It's weird how they can pay so much employee when they are such a small charity organisation and their company is located in a very ulu and rundown place lol.. doesn't even look charitable to me..HAHA</p>
              <p>3rd.. I'm trying my best already lor.. i ask my friend for help, i ask agency for help, i ask family member for help still not enough meh? and by the way i took the shop &amp; save job but it will start a few weeks later and by the time i finish the job poly probably will start lor so i am now trying to find some work to do first...</p>

              <p>TS, what kind of jobs do you want to find? Office job? or the more hands on kind like waiter, cashier, retail assistant etc?</p>
              <p>if  you want office job, at this kind of the year, with so many fresh job seeker like you, competition is very fierce.</p>
              <p>but if you dun mind waiter, retail sales and cashier kind, now is the right period. Christmas and CNY period sees high demand for frontline service staff.</p>
              <p>just step in to any restaurant, shops and supermarkets and ask if they need to hire temp staff. You can try ShengSiong, i know that they are always short of people.</p>
              <p>Challenger is also hiring. $1600. just go to any of their stores and check it out.</p>
              <p>happy job hunting.</p>
