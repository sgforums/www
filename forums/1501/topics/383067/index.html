              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>     We are a small local publisher.</p>
              <p>     We are looking for a temp full-time Account Executive (Sales). This is only for students who had just completed A Levels and is awaiting University to start on August 2010.</p>
              <p>Requirements:</p>
              <p>- Goal-oriented<br>- Solution-oriented<br>- Good communication skills<br>- Able to commit till August 2010</p>
              <p>The main job scope, in the first month, will be admin work and handling of customers’ orders. Eventually, the Account Executive will move on to B2B sales and handle more sales responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Working hours is from 8:30am to 5:30pm (weekdays only), with three breaks: 11:00am – 11:30am (morning break), 1:00pm to 2:00pm (lunch break) and 3:30pm to 4:00pm (afternoon break).</p>
              <p>Location will be in the west (Bukit Batok).</p>
              <p>Reimbursement will include basic pay, target commission and B2B commission rate. Given the correct attitude, below is an estimate of the Account Executive’s pay:</p>
              <p>1st – 2nd Month: $1,000 - $1,200 per month<br>3rd – 5th Month: $1,200 - $1,500 per month<br>6th month onwards: $1,500 &amp; above per month</p>
              <p>The increase in pay is due to a “promotion increment” system that we have customized for the candidate. The basic pay and B2B commission will be increased, and target commission will be decreased.</p>
              <p>Although we only expect the Account Executive to stay with us for eight months, we have planned out her schedule accordingly, so that it would benefit both the business and her. Therefore, we are only looking for individual who wants to grow from us, instead of earn from us. We also want to enforce this mindset that we are looking for someone to work with us, not work for us.</p>
              <p>This will be a very good learning experience for the candidate as she will be exposed to the business structure and model. From the 3rd month onwards, she may be given the responsibility to improvise and amend the sales system.</p>
              <p>We believe firmly that if we can achieve an employee’s goals, she will eventually help us to achieve our business’s goal too.</p>
              <p>Interested candidates please email <a href="mailto:info@goodybooks.com">info@goodybooks.com</a> . Thanks!</p>

              <p>I disagree. This job opening sounds as sincere as employers come.</p>
              <p>We're talking about employing A Level graduates here; people who probably don't have any credible working experience whatsoever. Even as a temporary employee, the person would get to experience several increments and receive commissions. The breaks are generous too: 2 hours in total and meaningfully spaced apart. The employee is definitely benefitting here if she gets to experience a range of jobs according to her interests and competencies. Sales and transactional work first for the first few months, then business development work subsequently, sounds like a reasonable progression. It makes the employee feel that she at least has a chance to grow.</p>
              <p>TS, I credit you for your foresight in targeting recent A Level graduates. Most of them don't need the money (except maybe to feel proud when they're talking to their family and friends), are passionate in what they do and, despite being inexperienced, they can learn much quicker than the general working population. They probably don't treat the job as a chore to earn bucks to feed the family but a career headstart, a glimpse into the working world. My only suggestion is to rebrand this opening a little -- call it an "internship" and pitch it to various JCs' career centres. This should really get the response rate up and you can choose the most passionate and suitable candidates from the flurry of applications.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>
              <p><br>P.S. I graduated from a JC in 2007 and I'm also in the midst of planning for internship programmes targeted at recent A Level graduates for my start-up. It's great to see that I'm not the only one around who sees value in recent A Level graduates.</p>
              <p>You might also want to shorten it to 6-7 months, because university term starts in August. The kids might also want to join orientation camps and activities in July.</p>

              <p>Tuition is a waste of time. In the long term, the student loses money if you think about it. You also have to consider that A Level students do not have an economic necessity to take up a job. The pay is merely a bonus, something they can boast about to their friends and that's about it. Believe it or not, many students are more mature and far-sighted than that.</p>

              <p>Boast to their friends??? working for 800.00per month n still need to take pocket money from parents????</p>
              <p>I agree that this job maybe a bonus to those that are still taking pocket money from their parents.</p>
              <p>Tuition maybe a waste of time for you. but not to all the others. If A lvl student can plan the time well, monthly income for 2k is not really a problem.</p>
              <p>Please don't think that I just say say only..... There are examples in Sgf.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The post is still available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As mentioned by RETARDED-MORON, yes, it is more of a learning experience enhanced with pay. Whether the pay is high or low is quite subjective; since we have no control over the views of others (e.g. Apple might think it is acceptable, but Orange might not think so), therefore we focus more on the performance of the employee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, good suggestion from both of you. =)</p>
