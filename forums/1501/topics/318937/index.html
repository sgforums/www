              <p>Phoon Huat is primarily in the retail and Food Service business. So I guess generally, a food service sales executive would have 2 major responsibilities:</p>
              <p>1) Service current accounts - increase the sales by introducing new products, account collection, complaint handling, contact call, after sales service and order taking.</p>
              <p>2) Solicit new accounts - cold calling. You could be given a sales area (like WOODLANDS where there are plenty of food manufacturers like Polar who might use stuff from Phoon Huat) or a business sector (eg. HORECA - Hotels, Restaurants or Caterers) to service. You will be expected to cold call customers from these sectors or area and try to develop new accounts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are general tasks. There are of cos admin tasks like the usual sales paperwork.</p>
              <p>Its better to go for the interview and let them brief you exactly what they need you to do.</p>

              <p><br>Few things for you to take note, dun say I never impart my knowledge haha!</p>
              <p>1) Food service sales people are most likely require to drive. Make sure you check with them whether vehicle is provided or not. Some expect you to possess own vehicle and give you a transport allowance. Looking at $600 for transport allowance, its way too low unless you are driving already anyway.</p>
              <p>2) $1800 entry as food service sales exec is about right if you are fresh and holding a diploma and furthermore Phoon Huat is not a MNC so it is lesser. A fresh grad with degree can expect at least $2200 - $2400 for starting pay as sales exec in a MNC. But $600 as transport allowance is really low unless they provide vehicle.</p>
              <p>3) Sales people especially when you are starting at the bottom of the rung, works alot based on commission. OR else your basic pay and transport cannot survive. Depending on the company, normally they give you a sales target for the month, quarter or year and if you meet it, they give you a lump sump. The commission structure is not like those promoter type lah where you sell one piece, you get $10 that kind lah. So it is only fair that you get your commission if you hit your allocated target.</p>
              <p>4) Most likely you are working in the food service sector which means you do not serve end consumers but rather businesses. Meaning you are selling to bakeries like POLAR, BENGAWAN SOLO etc for their manufacturing. THUS, though per piece the product is affordable, but manufacturers dun buy by pieces, they buy by cartons, by pallets sometimes so thats why you have a SALES TARGET.</p>

              <p>1) Food industry is competitive. We are not talking about food retail where you sell to the supermarket to try to sell to end consumers like you and I. Phoon Huat is primarily a food service provider, meaning they provide ingredients and supplies to businesses like BAKERIES, CATERERS, HOTELS and RESTAURANTS. They are 1000s of brands out there who sell the same thing as PHOON HUAT. BUT PHOON HUAT is an established name in the business. Though they are not a MNC, locally, they are a very strong force to reckon with as far as food service is concerned. Thus, working for them, you have an advantage, it is an established brand with the food service businesses.</p>
              <p>2) You have to be self motivated. Most likely you are left to your own devices. Other than staying n office for paperwork, you would be expected to get out of office to do sales. Sales people always eat snake because their timing is own time own target. But if you wanna do well, better learn to eat snake but find ways to hit your target first haha.</p>
              <p>3) Well commission structure varies. But commission must be attractive to motivate sales people right? Phoon Huat is not stupid. If they offer you $50, $100 to hit target, you want? Nobody will want to work so hard just to get that extra $50. For example, my average monthly target was around $200K. My max commission is $700. and they will have staggered commission like if i hit 90% of 200K then i get $400, if get 100% then how much etc....but commission will be attractive enough I am sure, but expect to WORK HARD for it.</p>

              <p>1. Should be $1800. Of cos some companies give you lesser during probation,until confirm then give you full sum but since they advertise so big, you can insist on it lah, if they die die dun give you the full sum until confirmed, you can always reject. But take note, if i dun read wrongly, the $600 tpt allowance is only given after confirmation.</p>
              <p>2) If vehicle is provided, $600 is good enough for petrol and carpark and ERP. If no vehicle provided, you can eat grass. Unless you are already driving, I would advise dun take the job if no vehicle provided.</p>
