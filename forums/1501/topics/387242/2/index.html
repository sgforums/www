              <p><br>The problem with Singapore is that the IT line is floored by big Government-linked IT companies hiring FTs. Only SME may hire local Singaporeans, but they usually only hire staff with experience. Thus, Singaporeans with little or no experience face strong competition from experienced FTs with higher qualifications.</p>
              <p>And those application software engineer in Banking Industries and Financial services will tend to recruit Indian nationals due to the nature that they had been supporting Finance/Banking related software for many years.</p>
              <p>Thus, Singaporeans will end up looking for other jobs, secure a degree in IT management and return to end up going in to manage these FTs.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Singaporeans in IT industry do not really like to do programming, or do not really enjoy mopping up someone's programming error. Thus, they tend to switch to other fields.</p>

              <p>Seriously, will you pay an fresh ITE student or an Indian national/Chinese national with degree SGD1500 for programmer job? Will you pay fresh poly student or an Indian national/Chinese national with degree and 3 years exp SGD1800 for programmer job?</p>
              <p>Will you even consider paying 2k to a fresh Singaporean degree holder for a programmer job when you can get an Indian national/Chinese national with degree and 5 years exp?</p>
              <p>No matter how you do it, the same price you pay for a Singaporean can be replaced with an Indian/Chinese/Pinoy.</p>
              <p>And the best part of the joke? Because these IT companies wanna show off their collection of Degree holders, will you think Singaporean IT companies will want to give chance to Singaporeans for programming?</p>
              <p>The only programming job that requires a Singaporean will contain extremely sensitive information. I think I do not need to dwell into that.</p>
              <p>As for whether the flair for programming, do you think HR staff know how to check?</p>

              <p><br>of course i will go for cheaper better alternative. but unless its owned by say a boss of family buisness employment process still go be procedure. until the maximum number of foreign labor is hit die die they syill have to hire some local sgreans. flair for programing even hiring manager difficult to check. platform and ways to work differs with every company. new staff still need a little time during probation to pick up and tune in. as for the sensitive information or job nature service function of sensitive nature yes die die must hire sgreans. you go STkinectis all the technician and people assemblying the battle tanks - know what i see also sian. All malaysian chinese workers. and they can go into such facilities to work.</p>

              <p>actually the basic problem is practice. I believe if singaporean practice enough and skilled them self enough, it is very easy for them to get a programmer job.</p>
              <p>In fact, company tend to hire singaporean because it less complicated but the problem with singaporean is beside lousy skill still ask so many things. ask your self..how many of singaporean are willing to work until 11pm but those foreign talents will because they came here with one objective..to get money</p>
              <p>company esp government give singaporean priority in hiring anyway</p>

              <p><br>Well, you are comparing the whole nation with the few FT that is coming to sg to work. There would be those who refused to work OT back in their country as well. Anyway, not all those who had came are as good as you say that they are.</p>
