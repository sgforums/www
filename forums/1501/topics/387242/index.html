              <p>A indian collegue told me that his indian friend working in Citibank told him that all the software guys there ( I imagine the Oracle developers ), are from India. Whereas the managers are all chinese (should be Singaporeans or Malaysians I guess). Now I would estimate that the ratio of indians would be 20 to one Singaporean. So I would imagine that if I work in a bank as a Oracle developer, all of my closest collegues would likely be Indians?</p>
              <p>Then this Singaporean chinese collegue told me that she works in this CDE or something company that built the SCADA for the MRTs, and all of the software programmers are also Indians! And she said that Sinaporeans programming skill are lousy.She has been working only on the graphics of SCADA systems and no chance to touch programming.</p>
              <p>I got these two news and are a bit worried about my Oracle/SAP career.</p>
              <p>Are the two observations above the general condition for software development in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Where are all the Singapoeans programmers? They are not working in banks anymore except government ones with protection? They are all working in electronics manufacturing? Or there are no local talents here? How about the programmers from Malaysia?</p>

              <p>Programmers hard to earn money nowadays, usually they do freelance I think.</p>
              <p>Doing IT these years made me realise that the big bucks come from Software Engineering and Database. I believe those who are good database analyst have already moved on to somewhere where their talents are well-paid like Japan.</p>

              <p>But I like database software! Let the Indians have all the programming fun and big bucks??</p>

              <p>And banks are where the big bucks are!</p>
              <p>I have a feeling that probably for database development, Singaporeans are more concentrated in manufacturing ERP instead of banking, in some small China man software company, no?

              <p><br>that's the open end. hidden end is like what i wrote the ratio of foreign against locals. if the bosses do that and keep foreign high, locals lower to the max permissible, during retrenchment that local boss safe. if he got competition from his own local colleagues that's when the crafty scheming applies. gahmen policies, MOM don't look at the problem at ground zero for each and every industries and fine tune just apply one rule does it all, local bosses do what has to be done to own keep safe, more locals not hired or got problem in new emplyment, land cost here still costly more businesses seek to go alternate sources, and inevitably of human nature local businesses and board of directors only want more money. so like that lor.</p>
              <p>don't hear what people do charaty lah, the money will be taxed anyway so instead of going to IRAS might as well do charity and get publci documented recognition</p>

              <p>Well asked.. lol...</p>
              <p>Anyway, all programmers are the same level la.. I am an Indian and am in the Network Field, Cisco routers/switches, MPLS networks e.t.c. Its just that there are more of them. Another reason might be, the Singaporeans who actually studied computer science/engineering do not end up taking their academic related jobs. For example out of my 6 close friends, all computer engineers from NTU, only one local guy is into programming. 3 are in banks in other fields, I am in networking, another is in mindef doing some other stuff.. So no hardcore programmers.. But whereas those from India, they studied computer science with the core interest being in programming..</p>
              <p><br>Anyway, just my thinking =) My 2 cents worth..</p>

              <p>I think think Singapore school even like Polytechnic don't really groom you to be an programmer, current now as I am studying Poly part-time, when we tried to ask question related to programming from our teacher, our teacher just said why we want to ask "silly" question this and that and we as a student must practice on our own then we will learn (in fact I don't know why we need a teacher at the first place if this is the case)</p>
              <p>The problem always lie in the fact we don't learn programming early in secondary school like our "O" level for 4-5 years,(we definately will know English and Mathematics because we already have the background during primary school.) so you want Singaporean to have an talent in programming is just like asking Singaporean to create an excellent poems even if they are an beginner.Remember there is this saying : Programming are just like making poems, but few can make an excellent poems.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Schools usually teach the basics of programming. Different programing may materialize or are realised in different platform. Some 'progammers' go into design or program realization, while others works as in maintenance or troubleshooting to ensure the system works, function 24/7, or their service triggered to analyze the fault when things fail.</p></div>

              <p>there are no much programmers in singapore is simply because singaporean don't want to do programming. it's very technical yet difficult to understand, so every penies that programmers earned is hard cash. there are the lowest level of IT staffs. singaporean simply just dont want to do that, they prefers to do analyst jobs that doesn't required some many detail areas needed to be attend and the pay is better than programmers.</p>
              <p>if you ask every programmers if they were have fun with programming..answer is of course but does the pay equal to their talent, their very deep technical skills ..answer is no. but still better than their hometown.</p>
              <p>anyway,...the big bucks doesn't always come from bank. sometime it just come from your own backyard.</p>

              <p>Well if you map the career path of Singaporean programmer and Indian programmer, it is quite easy to figure out.</p>
              <p>Singaporean programmer -&gt; sign contract for 2/3 years -&gt; usually leaves in less than 3 years (mostly 1 year plus run) and go for other jobs like management/customer service/financial service for 2 yrs, realized IT still their forte -&gt; come back to become project consultant/manager</p>
              <p>Indian Indian programmer -&gt; sign contract for 2/3 years -&gt; stays for another 5/6 years as programmer</p>
              <p>BTW i wont even hire poly programmers... less to say ITE programmers. I can hire Indian programmers from India cheaper. Even worse, I hire PRCs.</p>
              <p>No offense but Singapore programmers either dont have required skill set, lack experience or simply too expensive to hire. Worse of all, all 3 add together.</p>

              <p>Nelstar i believe not all sgreans are without the flair for programing. Just that money and pay is to be the motivation for the hard work put in. If its not from indian will be china. but language is also the problem here. Those foregin labor comes here has to understand at least english.</p>

              <p>my previous employment got one china man position is engineer definitely not those construction worker grade. but when he open his mouth to speak and present. i don't understand a word he says. and he even present it loud and proud like he some american speaker.</p>

              <p>Seriously, will you pay an fresh ITE student or an Indian national/Chinese national with degree SGD1500 for programmer job? Will you pay fresh poly student or an Indian national/Chinese national with degree and 3 years exp SGD1800 for programmer job?</p>
              <p>Will you even consider paying 2k to a fresh Singaporean degree holder for a programmer job when you can get an Indian national/Chinese national with degree and 5 years exp?</p>
              <p>No matter how you do it, the same price you pay for a Singaporean can be replaced with an Indian/Chinese/Pinoy.</p>
              <p>And the best part of the joke? Because these IT companies wanna show off their collection of Degree holders, will you think Singaporean IT companies will want to give chance to Singaporeans for programming?</p>
              <p>The only programming job that requires a Singaporean will contain extremely sensitive information. I think I do not need to dwell into that.</p>
              <p>As for whether the flair for programming, do you think HR staff know how to check?</p>
