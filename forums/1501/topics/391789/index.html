              <p>Why is the "FT" so frequently use by everyone now...THEY R NOT FOREIGN TALENTS...they are just cheaper in terms of labour cost to employer..go find out what is their average wages in their countries and you will know why are all the PRCs,pinoys, indians or where ever they came from influx singapore like bees to honey..they will fetch easily 4-5 times more than what they can earn in their own countries doing the same job..say, if some hotels in england are employing bellboy in some hotel in england and pay you 5-7k SGD a mth. will it tempt you?</p>
              <p>From the way i see it, there is no way us sinaporeans can compete wif so call "FT"</p>
              <p>unless we are willing to accept the same wage as FT doing the same job.</p>

              <p>Temasek Review</p>
              <p>A probable Indian new citizen/PR has asked a Singapore citizen and NSman complaining about unfair competition from foreigners to make himself more “marketable” on a discussion about the Budget 2010 on YPAP Facebook:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/ypapbudget586.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="350"></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: </strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=153492722129&amp;ref=nf#!/youngpap?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=356053044256"><span style="color: #a91b33;">YPAP Facebook</span></a><strong>]</strong></p>
              <p>The discussion was started by YPAP member Genesis Shen who had expressed concerns that the PAP’s “generous spending” on the middle and lower income families in Singapore will “affect the Party’s long term policy of fiscal prudence.”</p>
              <p>Ting Siong, a 28 year old Singapore Chinese male who had served two and a half years of National Service shared his personal experience: he had been doing one contract job one after another because the permanent jobs are mostly taken up by foreigners.</p>
              <p>Mr Sinha Shekhar,who was born in Dhanbad, India and indicated clearly that he shared the political views of the PAP on his Facebook, replied that “there is nothing called permanent jobs” and urge Ting Siong and other Singaporeans to make themselves more “marketable and move ahead”.</p>
              <p>He also praised the  budget as being a “very prudent” one and it is “good that we have been tiSghtening our belt for quite some time.”</p>
              <p>His insensitive and callous remarks brought a barrage of criticisms from fellow Singaporeans on the discussion who questioned if he is a new citizen or PR.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean Sin Rak Sin told Mr Sinha to shut up:</p>
              <p><em>“Sinha, Cut the bootlicking crap and shut the fxxk up, will u? We do not need a foreigner to meddle with our internal domestic affair.”</em></p>
              <p>Of late, the Straits Times Forum has been publishing letters of support from these new citizens and PRs heaping praises on the PAP government.</p>
              <p>How can Sinha expect Singaporeans to make themselves more “marketable” when they have to compete directly with foreign workers who cost a fraction of them?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, NSmen like Ting Siong are at a disadvantage as they have to be away for 4 weeks each year due to reservist obligations.</p>
              <p>The PAP has been actively recruiting PRs and new citizens like Sinha into their Youth Wing and grassroots organizations to boost their flagging support base.</p>
              <p>As they are not familiar with Singapore, they tend to agree blindly with what the leaders told them, as exemplified by the comments posted by Sinha.</p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 per cent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas like Mr Sinha.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal, the relentless influx of foreigners over the last few years has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>Faced with a potential backlash from angry voters in the coming election, the PAP is now trying to sing a different tune to placate Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans do not vote wisely in the next election, they will have to bear with the lectures of not only the PAP leaders, but their new “comrades” like Mr Sinha as well.</p>
