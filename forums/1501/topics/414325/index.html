              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Vacheronlim:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>can put the employer name here ah? It's ThinkersBox (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thinkersbox.com/">http://www.thinkersbox.com/</a>), imagine people are
              sending their kids to the place for education, and the very ones
              who're educating these kids have such messed up values and
              ethics. </p>
              <p>I didn't let them deduct my salary, I was observing the contract
              which stated that I have to forfeit every single cent I received as
              my wages so long as I terminate during training period. To my
              understanding the training was just a 3-day course period,
              subsequently the OJT training phase was not applicable. They didn't
              specify it clearly during contract signing as well that's why I was
              quite unhappy over it. Besides, if I served the termination notice
              of 2 weeks, I still have to return them back every single cent, so
              serve or don't serve I'll still be rendered free labor. After the
              termination, I returned every single cent + the salary in lieu (for
              not serving termination notice), because I am quite sure their
              contractual terms can be over-turn by MOM.</p>
              <p>So subsequently I approached MOM, and based on their take on the
              whole issue, the contractual terms for termination is null and void
              because ThinkersBox only need to serve shorter termination notice
              than me, which is unfavorable terms as mentioned in Employment Act.
              Based on that, I am not liable to return every cent of wages
              received so far since the contract is not valid. Consequently, the
              notification period should follow the guidelines as set by MOM, in
              my case it's only 1 day since I have only been on the job for a
              month (which I already fulfilled by giving them half a week's
              notice). So, with that, the salary I paid back to them, plus the
              salary-in-lieu should not be given to them. </p>
              <p>As I had started work (elsewhere) promptly after terminating, I
              wasn't able to drop by to return them the money initially. The
              director of ThinkersBox (Felicia Ho) was quite persistent, she even
              said that "you don't work everyday, just drop by when you are
              free". And at that point of time, I was actually working everyday,
              and yet she was so uptight over me running away not paying that
              meagre sum of money. Until I suggested internet banking. I had
              earlier reminded them (following MOM's advice) that they have the
              option to settle the dispute in private, otherwise MOM will
              intervene. Yet all the meetups that was arranged they set it at
              times which are inconvenient for me (I end work at 6pm on weekdays,
              they say they won't wait). Then weekends they say got lessons going
              on. Yesterday I went down, was slightly late, and I saw them
              leaving the office through the building's backdoor, when I called
              out to them they just disappear down the stairs and then sms me say
              I'm late.</p>
              <p>Then after that kept insisting I must resolve the dispute at
              their office so there will be witness around (which they claim MOM
              said so, and this is something I'm pretty sure is not true).
              Anyway, if it's one of their staff filling in the witness role,
              then Felicia can come to my place and solve it too, I have plenty
              of witness at my house. In any case, Friday when Felicia suggested
              that I go down to the office, she was not in office, and only one
              other staff was there, isn't it easy to see the contradictions in
              her words? But of course, after that she changed her mind, saying
              that her staff need to leave early. </p>
              <p>For me it's clear that now they are just trying to make things
              difficult. I just want to resolve the dispute and get what is
              rightfully mine back, since she want to make it so complicated,
              then I think I shouldn't be nice and as well. Before I hand over
              the dispute to MOM, I will want to make sure that such rude and
              unethical practices by ThinkersBox will be made known to the
              parents who paid so much for their kids to attend the lessons. They
              ought to know the true colors of those who teach their
              children!</p>
