              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">Hi All,</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">Firstly, I would like to say...I am dumb enough to sign a 2 years bond contract with the former company! I have tendered the resignation letter &amp; email with last day of service in Mar'17 which my bond contract will only be ended by this Nov'17.</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">The story is like this:-</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">My company asked me to stay but I did not agree and have left the company by 30th Mar after one month notice given(stated in resignation letter and email, I bave a copied of forwarded email) I am now working in overseas and did not give my mobile number to former employer. </div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">After that, my company tried to call me (sg number) but do not have my mobile overseas number and went to my Singapore's residence and threaten my siblings I have breach the contract, need to compensate 3 months of the salary. They will call for police, MOM, IRAS..a few government department to charge/complaint about me.</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">My brother do not know the details and gave my former employer his mobile number and told him will update him after contacted me and get my advised. I have told my siblings about my case and asked my bro not to get involve in this matter, I will email my former employer to settle the issue.</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">However, after I have sent email to them, they have ignored my email, no reply but keep texting and calling my brother! I am getting angry as this should not involve my siblings and disturbed them during their working hours. I have sent another email to them asking they should stop disturb my brother, and they stopped the action. </div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">But then, they have sent another email to me..saying I breach the contract and have to compensate them 3 months salary and they have credited Apr'17 salary to my account and asked me to give back the money to them! Again, they will proceed to call police, MOM and IRAS etc... I have no idea why they still credited money to my account since I am no longer with the company since 1st Apr! (I have checked online that this issue should not related to all these government department, they can only sue me by civil court...)</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">Anyway, I have replied them to give me company account number so that I can transfer back the credited salary to company. (I did not replied them on the compensation..)</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">However, my company once again ignored my email and sent an email to my current company HR, the email content is similar to what I have mentioned above, saying that I have not resigned, breach of contract....I am totally pissed because my former employer is trying to threaten me, and also spoilt my reputation in my new company! My HR now asking me to settle with the former employer and update them, they will do reference check after I have settled it.</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">I would like to know what can I do for it? This is really unfair to me, though I am stupid enough to signed the 2 years bond contract..I ever think of pay the compensation but now I have changed my mind, I should not compensate until I really receive Writ of Summons from the lawyer..this is what I know..is there anyway that I can sue or complaint to any side that my former employer did all this shit to me..by sending a Operation Director to my sibling's resident and threaten them, and now sent an email to my current company, I can't really sleep and eat because of this issue..</div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">Please anyone can give advise without paying compensation?</div>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>Based on the information you have provided, it seems that the only recourse your ex-employer has is to file a civil case against you. Currently, there is no government bodies to help employers to claim compensation/damages against you.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, have you tried to communicate or negotiate with your ex-employer on this matter? Complaining to other government bodies will not solve your issue. Now that your current employer is aware of the matter, you will need to have a proper closure to this case anyway.</p>

              <p>Legally they have every right against you. Irregardless of your feelings, you signed a legal document and you defaulted.</p>
              <p>If you wait for your previous company to issue you a Writ of Summons, which is very cheap FYI it will forever leave a black mark in your career. WoS can always be pulled up under questnet and almost all employment questionairre wil have this question. Simply put you are screwing yourself without knowing it.</p>
              <p>Settle it and move on.</p>
