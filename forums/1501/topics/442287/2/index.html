              Basically, from ex colleagues, some people have contract, some don't, and some have 1 year while others have 3 years.Â 
              
              As for work permit applications, since foreigners will need a minimum basic salary for that to happen, what the coy will do is to print 1800 on the paycheck, deposit that money into the employee's acct, then tell the employee to return them the amount that is over what they are supposed to get, which is like 800. Is this common practice though?
              
              The problem is that most of the workers there are foreigners, in fact, I'm one of the only two non managerial Singaporean there. They don't dare to do anything for fear that their work permits will be revoked and their names blacklisted. This is probably how the coy can overwork them and underpay them. Moreover, they use scare tactics to retain employees, and when said employees have taken enough crap (and these are reeeally good people, ie. Hard workers who go beyond their call of duty to train newbies without extra money, lots of customers who want just them because they're just so good) they quit because the coy doesn't know how to retain, and doesn't bother to retain good staff. Its only when they retire to greener pastures with better pay that the coy will ask existing colleagues about old staff to see if they want to come back. 
              
              They keep having employer/employee meetings about how to retain staff but when we mention commission and pay issues, they said that oh, we are different from other coy, doesnt mean that if other coy give this much pay, we must follow suit. And if the salespeople can sell more, there will be more incentive thus more pay for all staff. The manager actually tells us that all of us are not indispensible, even if we are not there, they can still operate well.

              The workers there are too terrified to testify, their livelihoods depend on this. All except two are foreigners on work permit, and I'm one of the two singaporeans. 
              
              The only thing I can say for new job-seekers is to read the contract carefully, take note of working hours, days off, ot pay, ot conditions, job scope, termination conditions, and if possible, ask for no contract. Also, request for a few days of trial run at the job to see if it's suitable, chat with employees and gauge the vibe, all these before signing the contract. I actually had this done but I'm not very street-smart so it's not foolproof. And if they ask you to do things not stated in the contract or if you find something that doesn't tally, bring it up immediately or ask the mom about it. This means you have to be very familiar with the contract. You have to know the rules in order to abide by it.

              <p>i’m still waiting. cos the demand letter said if i didn’t pay up the money in lieu of notice and for terminating early by 28, they’ll take action. no worries, i’m panicking inside but i thought it wouldn’t be nice posting my ramblings of paranoia haha.</p>

              Ok. Update:
              
              They've lodged a "Claim made under the employment act" against me in the Office of the Commissioner for Labor, MOM. The letter is dated 13th December, received 15 December 2011. So the Assistant Commissioner will be inquiring into the claims on the 23rd December 2011.
              
              They are claiming "2 months Salary in lieu of notice". No amount stated.

              I was thinking, actually I don't have a good reason for absconding, really, except for the overworked and underpaid bit, as well as the verbal and mental abuse, all of which is hard to prove since i don't have my punch cards and it's all verbal testimony from myself (i doubt my ex colleagues will testify, they are all foreign workers on work permit. too scared). 
              
              I will bring up the working hours being more than 44 per week, as well as working for more than 6 hours without break issue though. Does that count as a counterclaim?

              thank goodness i didn't pay what they asked in the first demand letter which is like nearly 7k.
                  
              now they're claiming for 2 months salary in the letter from MOM, never even state the amount, which probably amounts to HALF the 7k. wtf.

              why would it be small claims tribunal? i mean, yes, i didn't owe them money but... (sorry bear with me one more time) wont the MOM say hey the employment act says you must give notice before leaving of pay the pay in lieu of notice.
              
              sitting tight til the 23rd then! i should go right?
