            <div class='col-md body'>you know what, thanks so much. I'm totally writing it all down now. Ok the thing is, I cannot be represented by anyone during the inquiry on the 23rd--just me. So if I want to make a counterclaim, I would need to make it 3 days before the 23rd. So if I have to, according to the letter, make a counterclaim "in writing not less than 3 working days before the date of inquiry, stating the nature and amount of your counterclaim", I will compile the lack of working hours in the contract. unless i don't have to make a counterclaim but just say that the co didn't state working hrs in the contract to the assistant commissioner. would that be more prudent you think?</div>

              basic salary is the same, yes. but I do earn commission because it's a sales based job. We, however, don't now how they calculate the commission, there's no statement that what is OT pay, what is comm, what is incentive. so... I'm just worried that they'll pull the "oh this is IN the incentives already".
              
              FYI did you know the OT is mostly, unless on very very special occasions, calculated and written down in an OT book that they say the company "owes" the employees. WTF right. not paid at all. just "Owed".

              <p>I am no expert but if i am in his position i wont use salary as a counter claim nor OT not paid as counter claim, because i believe if he read his contract, there will definitely be something along the line of  "employer reserves the rights to... should such situation arises" and "compensation with rest days immediately in the following week and/or monetary payment" whereby monetary payment would be a vague term. ( Thats what i learnt during my short stint elsewhere). <br><br>Also since his monthly salary varies since it is a sales job, totally no fight, because like what TS said, it can be "included in sales incentives"already.<br><br>Moreover, 1.5 times for OT is a guideline, it need not be followed...<br><br><br>My banker bet would be in the the over 48 hours per week and/or 44 hours per week for 2 continuous weeks issue because regardless if what they write in the contract no company or anyone (even voluntarily) can work more than what is stated. which is why so many company pay their employees OT under "other allowances" instead of OT if they exceeded it. <br><br>Also per month OT cannot exceed 72 hours too, voluntarily or not or else HR need to drink coffee with MOM too.</p>

              <p>Am pretty sure u are aware that some sales person have ZERO  monthly salary, and earn base on full fledge commission. No issues at all because salary is on employers discretion and sg has no minimum salary acts. They can work 10 hours per month or 172 hours per month and get paid the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everything regarding salary is a guideline not an act.....</p>

              <p>I understand your kind intention but don't make him fight the suit the way you ask him to because he has no grounds at all.</p>

              <p>EP holders have minimum salary of 800 I think that's why they do that. Not sure on S pass but your point three is totally off. It even have no issues to do with TS. And Singaporeans have no minimum salary clauses. That's why some elderly are toiling away at coffeeshops for 500 month.</p>

              <p>Anyway TS good luck. Your next job look out for contracts. More than half the time contracts means problem. Turnover too high that's why they play the contract game. And with contract, you can be tagged as contract worker and no benefits at all compared to FT staffs. Can play your leave can play your mc can play salary can play claims everything</p>

              My basic is 1.6k, the employment act covers that, in fact, the coy is claiming the salary in lieu of notice under the employment act.
              
              How come the punch card isn't required as proof? 
              
              And just fyi, my total supposed weekly work hours=48. As in, the so-called official work hours.
              
              4 weekdays= 4x (8.5)=34
              2 weekends= 7.5+6.5=14
              total 48
              
              alternate week one day pm shift (if we're lucky)=that week 45.75 hours
              
              But since it's a retail coy, we finish work only when the customers leave, so the real working hours are often more. In addition, we have to come in early to open the shop and close up--the extra half an hour early is NOT counted in the working hours. WTF. so if we officially start business at 10.30, we need to punch in at 10.05.

              Afternoon shift: 2pm-9pm
              
              You shall be entitled to two 45 min breaks for working on morning shift. You shall be entitled to one 45 min break for working on afternoon shift.
              
              Saturday:
