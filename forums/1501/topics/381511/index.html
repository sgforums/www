              <p>Do you think it is dangerous to work as a tution teacher?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, if you are a chio bu and you go to the student house to teach him tution and he happen to be a horny guy, he can take the opportunity to rape you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many ways that he can rape you. Like he can put sleeping pills into your drinks than rape you when you fall asleep. When you wake up already you may not even know that you got rape because you were sleeping so soundly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He can also use a knife and point it at you and than force you to have sex with him or else he will kill you. Even if you report to police later you also don't have much evidence to support your claim because it is just you and him in the house only. He can say that you were willing to have sex with him and than later try to blackmail him money and when he don't give you money you make fake police report against him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, even if you are a guy, it is possible that the student is a gay and rape you at his home too. Or if you are a chio bu and your student is a lesbian she may rape you at her home too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thirdly, even if you never get raped, the student can don't pay you the tution fees. Giving tution is not like working, there is no employment letter stating your sate of commencement and salary/fee charged per month so there is no evidence to prove that you really give tution in the event that the student don't want to pay you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So do you think its dangerous to work as a tution teacher? Can get raped and maybe student don't pay you money etc..</p>
