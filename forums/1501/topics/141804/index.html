            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>I'm venting my frustrations but at the same time looking for job openings.<br><br>I am in a small department. Feeling very very unhappy at work. For 5 years, been toiling my heart and soul but dun feel appreciated as I dun complain to bosses or show people how much i have done while others suck up to bosses and cc to them even on technical details. It's fine if they want to lick the boots of bosses, I just can't take it lying down when they try to hurl false accusations at me during their appraisal sessions, saying that my boss has no idea of the situation and that I have hogged my assistant (how absolutely untrue..). There are many other grievances that will bore you if I start to state them here.<br><br>My immediate supervisor, being a "nice" man, takes advantage of my submissive nature and subjects me to please the older insecure colleague who seeks alliance with a younger colleague (who happens to be ambitious).<br><br>Wondering if i should just quit and go even though it pays well. Tried to bear with it as I keep telling myself that it will be the same everywhere. But things are getting so much worse.. when things go missing or computers break down, they will gossip that I have manipulated the files without proof or evidence. The latest accusation was that my boss favours me (just becos my boss realise that I have been ostracised and gave me a very small but individual project.) I hope he is beginning to see the light of my plight as my other colleagues are starting to show their true colours by abusing their vendors.<br><br>I understand their jealousy and insecurities. I know that it is the world of the survivors.. but really, i just hope to find a pasture that I can settle down and earn my keep. According to colleagues from other departments, my predecessors left because of the older colleague... really dun wish to waste any time making myself feel worse anymore.<br><br>I know I'm being naive, escapism can't take me anywhere.. the next place may be worse off...but I think i need a fresh start.<br><br>I'v been keeping a lookout but it's quite hard to grab a job now as supply of manpower exceeds demand. If you happen to know of any job opening looking for executives, best if it is immediate, please let me know.<br><br>Thank you.</div>
