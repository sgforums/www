              <p>first of all i don't think just this question alone constraints if you are able to get the offer.  actually it is combination of all the questions you have been asked.<br><br>i do believe company accepts you is not much to do with the answers you gave, but more on their budget. especially when you just graduated w/o experience. if you asked higher than what it can give, then failure is the destiny<br><br>so don't worry abt too much, and continue trying more times, sure u'll get what you expected.</p>

              <p>First, state that you do NOT have any preference to work in a non-aerospace engineering field over an aerospace one. If you do not do so, even if you gave a splendid answer, they could follow up with "Then why you didn't took up that X engineering diploma instead?" and you're finished.</p>
              <p>Then, you elaborate on how some of the engineering concepts that you've learnt in your aerospace engineering course is applicable to all fields of engineering. This is to show that you know your stuff well and despite the fact that you're not a X diploma holder, your knowledge can still be of use to them.</p>
              <p>Finally, end off with some good points you know about the company (eg. "From what I've researched, your company focuses heavily on R&amp;D and as someone who is really passionate about engineering, I see myself well-suited for the position of X.") and that those are the reasons why you've decided to apply for that job despite your education (and not because you can't find any jobs in the aerospace field, even though it might be the truth - you tell them that, it's GAME OVER for your interview).</p>
              <p>In essence, an interview is not about telling others how good you are, but how could you be of more use to the company than the other interviewees - because there's no point in hiring a PhD in Chemistry (for example) if the company requires someone who can design buildings.</p>

              <p>I will answer like this:</p>
              <p>After my Diploma and attachment, I've realised that aerospace is not a specialty I would like to focus in anymore. However, as my first year of basic engineering allows me to working in almost all engineering sector (or any crap that links you to the company) I would like to gain more experience in your company. I believe I am equipped with the necessary skills such as (any rubbish related you can think of). I understand that I lack experience, therefore I can negotiate the salary I'm asking. (purposely set a little higher salary in resume and add the word nego).</p>
              <p>I believe diploma is not enough in the field, so I've make plans to take a part time degree in engineering in the coming future ( plans are not meant to be fulfilled). In the coming 5 years, I hope that I wish to be able to work in your company even after graduation so I can apply what I've learn in your company.</p>
              <p>Take only what is useful from the text, not wholesale. Of course, some of these can backfired. esp the degree part. You need to know if there are employees there who are taking part time degrees as well. If there is, you can even use it as excuse to pledge loyalty for 3-5 years to work in the company, because you are looking for  "stable job"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, if you really want to work in aerospace. wait. take initiative to call them. "harrass" agencies, since they absorb your money anyway.if you got the link, use connection into one. don't rush into one you don't like.  well, unless you no money</p>
