              <p>Hi guys, not sure if this is the correct sub-forum to post, so if its wrong, please do point it out :)</p>
              <p>Anyways, I am currently waiting for my uni admission in Aug 2013. Three weeks ago, I went to BGC employment agency to look for a job. There, I was told I was selected for an admin assistant in a govt organisation. The commencement date however, was undetermined as the agent said I need to get a clearence.</p>
              <p>This tues (23 apr), I went back to the agency to sign e contract, as she (the agent) said it is mandatory to get the contract signed to proceed with the clearence. However there are a few issues. First - the contact was 3 weeks rather than the 2 month stated by her on the phone: she said the contract will be extended as per required. </p>
              <p>The main issue, however, is the commencement date - TBC, as its not determined yet. So after signing the contract, I have this dilemma: I have already waited for 3 weeks for a three week job, and I need to wait for longer. </p>
              <p>Is there any way to break the contract now? Not for anything but if the waiting period for the job is longer than the actual employment period, I dont think its worth it...</p>

              think u can just ignore them even though u have sign a contract 
              they won't bother to sue u even if u don't want to work for them 
              the $ they going to pay the lawyer is so much more den the commission 
              they geting from yr job, any way they got a large pool of candidates to 
              choose from even if u refuse to work for them 
              I ever had experience w these agents, they r easy going ppl, trust me 
              they won't get u into any trouble, if u need me to talk to them, 
              I can always lend u a hand

              Hi MeowMeowMeow,
              
              I am also very interested in working in government agency. Therefore have some enquiries here that hope you can kindly shed some light to it :) Thanks alot.
              
              1) For this admin assistant job in the government, do you need to go for Medical Checkup / health screening before you are selected in this job ?
              
              2) You mentioned that it is a 3 weeks contract job, do this government agency pay you by the hour  eg $6/hr Or a Monthly pay ? . Maybe 3 weeks prorated monthly pay for eg  S$900. Therefore this assignment pay by 1) the hour Or 2) by Monthly pay  ?
              
              3) Do you mind sharing which government agency is this ?
              
              
              Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks alot for your help :)
