              <p>I know that in India, US and some European countries, it is illegal for the hiring company HR to ask the job applicant to fill up the application form, or ask for information such as what was your salary in your previous jobs, name of the company you worked for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, this is perfectly legal though. I feel that asking for your previous salary is a tad sensitive during the interview, especially if you did not get the job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remembered one interview many years ago, the director asked me for the revenue of my previous company, as they are competitors for the market.</p>

              <p>actually nothing wrong with those questions on previous work experience.Age is another issue depending on how old you look, but at least those people have a chance to impress the interviewers.</p>
              <p>but I have to say for asking about previous salary,  it's only to the employer's unfair advantage. What it does is really set the bar for them to cut down your starting pay. If you quote a 1 k difference in pay from your previous job, it's likely they'll bargain it down even if they feel you're worth the amount. And the 1k difference puts you on slightly weaker grounds.</p>

              <p>Having had experience on both sides of the hiring and applying process, I can honestly say that stating salary is quite harmless and probably helpful to both parties.</p>
              <p>In this day and age, info as early as possible is helpful to all parties. Let's not kid yourselves by saying its bad practices etc.</p>
              <p>C'mon in many countries like in the UK / US, the big companies PUBLISH their starting pay for fresh grads, then the guaranteed increments upon confirmation, plus the 2nd, 3rd, 4th year career progression pay packet. The really good companies put it out pronto to tell the market - we are good, we pay good, come. They throw down the gauntlet to the competition as well by saying - we want the best try matching that.</p>
              <p>The rest of the industry then takes that as a benchmark to measure themselves and to budget.</p>
              <p>Given the number of surveys &amp; websties that detail salaries in various industries in various levels, c'mon, dun kid yourselves by thinking your previous salary is some skunkworks top secret classified info.</p>
              <p>Asia, including Singapore, is in a way very backward. I've seen big Singapore companies or MNCs based in Singapore do roadshows in the UK (such as in London) putting themselves forward trying to hire foregin talent. But they are unwilling or cannot even recognise that they have to be more transparent with their pay. Even though the market expects that from them cos many UK employers are like that (look at their advertisements). They come up with the usual crap like "we pay competitive rates" which piss off the people attending the talks. They merely end up sounding evasive.</p>
              <p>Job applicants should similarly consider putting the previous and expected salary levels as your bargaining tool, its also part of the homework that everyone should do. Fact of the matter is that for the position that you are applying, unless it is a standalone position in the entire company, there is already a figure they will pay which cannot vary too much to avoid upsetting pay parity. They won't let employees talk among themselves and getting upset.</p>
              <p>As for the confidential info thingie... NDA is always a good excuse... but you can turn it to your advantage as well. Give some hints then say I'll tell you everything only when I'm on board!</p>
              <p>C'mon if its a listed company, its easily obtainable info. If not, it depends on the job scope you do - a tech guy can't be expected to know the financials. Sales guys would probably be expected to know how to extrapolate individual targets to team/division targets. Financial guys - fall back on the NDA excuse.</p>
              <p>Yawn gotta koon...</p>
