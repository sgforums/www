The money 
              being usable for studies (or medicare etc if the person is aged/sick).<br> <br> This is because the low wage foreigner biased FWLS, which imposes levy 
              on only low paid foreign workers has 2 very bad long term effects.<br> <br> Firstly, it give low wage Singaporeans easy money for almost no work, an
               embarrassment really, since employers hire these low wage Singaporeans 
              mainly to just as seat warmers so as to hit the quota sufficient to 
              employ a required number of foreign workers to get the job done. Even 
              the low wage foreigners look down on the low wage Singaporeans due to 
              this biased treatment consequent of stupid government policy. These poor
               Singaporeans also remain untrained since little training is necessary 
              to accomplish their task of keeping seats warm- indeed, the low wage 
              Singaporean profession has become that of a phantom worker.<br> <br> The low wage Singaporeans also find it difficult and discouraging to get
               promoted into managerial positions since at the blink of the eye, 
              having crossed some salary threshold, the employer is now able to easily
               replace the Singaporean with a foreign talent either because the levy 
              payable is little or absent for higher paid foreigner employees.<br> <br> The end result of all this is that we have a persistently increasing 
              pool of low wage workers doing nothing except full/ part time seat 
              warming- phantom work is now only solution available to Ministry of 
              Manpower (MOM) Inc.- it now seems.<br> <br> A universal COE like FWLS could be a large source of funding for worker 
              training, financial support etc for Singaporeans, however, in its 
              desperation to build up the finance/ banking sector in Singapore (banks 
              hire many foreigner con-men who are paid well to <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/12/should-investment-firms-bet-against-their-clients/">bet against their own clients</a>), alongside the MOM pen pushers, desperate to justify their purchase of 472 cushy S$575 chairs <a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110325-270092.html">'Designer chairs for MOM staff'</a> [Mypaper,25Mar2011] have only perpetuated this ballyhoo-fool's errand- 
              ostensibly to give poorer Singaporeans work to do. Yet all that they 
              have seem to come up with is the 'prestigious' job of seat warming!<br> <br> But while the short term policy of phantom work has certainly satisfied 
              the government need for statistical publication and manipulation, what 
              is the government to do now that the average phantom Singaporean worker 
              has since become <strong>the original laughing stock of all foreigners in Singapore, if not round the world</strong>?<br> <br> Singaporeans do not need a phantom government to create more phantom 
              workers out of poorly funded and thus poorly schooled Singaporeans. 
              Singaporeans want real training for jobs that really contribute, for 
              jobs that make the world a better place- not jobs that make them seat 
              warmers for foreign talent to carry on. An effective scheme like GST, 
              coloured with the profitability from rationed supply like the COE scheme
               for cars will certainly pay good returns for Singaporeans to get 
              properly cared for and schooled.<br> <br> To achieve that, the levy <strong>waiver </strong>for employment passes (EP) 
              foreigners (especially PMET ones) will have to end, and the phantom 
              Singaporean worker of today will have to trained to really impact/ 
              improve the world. Yes many pen-pushers at MOM might be made redundant, 
              but they must be the original phantom workers who began this infectious 
              domino of structural unemployment here in the very first place!<br> <br> Just as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6_LS4inyfQ">NS for PRs CANNOT be moneytised (see Video: Hri Kumar vs Ng Eng Hen)</a>, <strong>neither </strong>can the foreign worker levy requirement for well paid foreigners (EP, SP etc) be waived.<br> <br> Yes, I know that there are poor and sickly Singaporeans (/ those with 
              young kids) who need the assistance of foreign domestic workers (FDW), 
              but like GST, everything that moves can be taxed. Just as compensatory 
              GST rebates are given, the more needy can receive more. A foreigner is a
               foreigner, just call a spade a spade- no more illogical permutations 
              please.<br> <br> In conclusion:<br> More for a new CPF 'training fund', with equal cash injections to all 
              Singaporeans; equal levy for all foreigners regardless of occupation, 
              not just the lowly paid ones and less pen pushers at MOM please.<br> <br> Real proper CPF based training fund accounts for upgrading Singaporean 
              workers, no more phantom/ Frankenstein jobs and policies please.<br> -----------------<br> Cartoon: Thin Black man: "I'm Hungry"; Fat White man:"Stop talking politics":<a rel="lytebox[79665287]" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TSs3eMhmjhI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/WpeaPyJ73JI/s1600/talk_politics_free_hand%2528source%252C+jpg%2529.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TSs3eMhmjhI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/WpeaPyJ73JI/s1600/talk_politics_free_hand%2528source%252C+jpg%2529.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br> <br> In return for the "first class political leadership", we pay our leaders very well:<a rel="lytebox[79665287]" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TFHv1FuLrSI/AAAAAAAAAOE/saa2THDeL3w/s1600/ST23Mar2007-+Why+pay+must+go+up.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TFHv1FuLrSI/AAAAAAAAAOE/saa2THDeL3w/s1600/ST23Mar2007-+Why+pay+must+go+up.JPG" border="0" alt="" height="570"></a><br> <br> Tags: Employment, labour, unemployment, MOM, Singapore, structural,
