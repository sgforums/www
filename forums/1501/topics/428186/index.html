              <p>April 19th, 2011 - Temasek Review</p>
              <p>Singaporeans Netizens have expressed outrage following The Temasek 
              Review’s (TR) report about the largest recruitment drive in Shanghai by 
              Contact Singapore (<em>a Singapore Government entity formed by the 
              Singapore Economic Development Board and Ministry of Manpower – 
              which aims to attract “global talent” to work, invest and live in 
              Singapore</em>).</p>
              <p>Annoyed Netizens  were questioning the need for Contact Singapore 
              to visit Shanghai to recruit “talents” to fill those 200 over positions (<em>on behalf of Singapore companies</em>)
               when those positions could easily be filled by Singaporeans. It is not 
              as if the companies were recruiting Nobel Laureates or top financial 
              wizards.</p>
              <p>One of TR’s correspondent working in Shanghai volunteered to visit 
              the fair which was held on Sunday, 17th April, from morning to noon. The
               morning session focused on the electronic industry while the afternoon 
              focused on the service and finance industries.</p>
              <p>According to our correspondent who went in the morning to catch the 
              action, the fair was held in the grand ballroom of Langham Hotel which 
              is an upmarket five-star hotel located at Xintiandi, an affluent 
              shopping, eating and entertainment district of Shanghai.</p>
              <p>He observed that most applicants were pre-registered. There were nine
               Singapore-based MNCs and Singapore local companies participating in the
               fair. Some of the participating companies included Panasonic Asia 
              Pacific, MediaTek, UniConnect, DBS Bank, OCBC, UOB, Far East 
              Organization and others.</p>
              <p>Most of the companies were observed to have tables with staff manning
               and answering questions. Companies also took turns to give “recruitment
               talks” inside the auditorium.</p>
              <p>So, is Contact Singapore trying to recruit overseas Singaporeans to come back home and fill those positions?</p>
              <p>Our correspondent rebuked, “No. This fair is <strong>NOT </strong>to 
              recruit Singaporeans. The room was packed. I reckoned there were few 
              hundred applicants, mostly in their early twenties. All were Ah Tiongs (<em>nickname for Chinese nationals</em>) and I’m pretty sure I’m the only Singaporean, at least when I was there in the morning.”</p>
              <p>The occasion was described as “grandiose”. There were free flow of 
              refreshments served by waiters and waitresses, which irked our 
              ocorrespondent, “I wonder whether our government provides this type of 
              five-star service to help our graduating students and out-of-job PMETs 
              to get jobs or not?”</p>
              <p>“Something is definitely very wrong with our policy. Why such efforts
               to recruit foreigners when most of these vacancies can be filled by 
              Singaporeans?”, he added. “Furthermore, the five-star reception for the 
              foreign job seekers really pissed me off. I am sure no such reception 
              was ever extended to our own graduating students and unemployed PMETs. 
              Who is paying for all these? Singapore taxpayers?”</p>
              <p>He also questioned the purpose of Contact Singapore, “I thought Contact Singapore (<em>funded by the taxpayers</em>)
               is a platform for Singaporeans to keep in contact with Singapore and 
              wanting to come back to work in Singapore. Why is it in the business of 
              recruiting foreigners to work in Singapore?”</p>
              <p>At a TV forum on 12 Apr, PM Lee said that the Government is 
              controlling the inflow of foreigners and watching them “carefully” on 
              their impact to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Five days later, they decided to have the largest recruitment drive 
              for foreigners in Shanghai. Looks like the Government still thinks 
              Singapore does not have enough foreigners and we have room to import a 
              lot more.</p>

              <p>From what I heard, Shanghai paycheck is not far off Singapore. In some cases, the paycheck is better.</p>
              <p>My feeling is those Ah Tiong who wants to come are those who are travel bugs or those who want to see the world or the idealistic Chinaman who sees Singapore as a perfect place. <br><br>When they are tired of living in Singapore, they will finally leave.    </p>
