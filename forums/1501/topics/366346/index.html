              <p>Cos not many people suited for it. Usually for crude oil drilling, they want locals to do the construction for under US$ 100 per month. As for safety officers, the petrol-chem MNC want the locals to go for US$400 per month. So far, it is below the national pay wage so not so many jobs and there are no local oil fields, which means we have to travel to overseas fields.</p>
              <p>As for oil rig building, there are specialized engineering and marine construction jobs but the qualifications needed for the jobs are severe and very narrow, hence if the workers are retrenched , retraining them in another job starts from absolute nothing.</p>
              <p>As for Pet-chem refining and cracking, the MNCs only employ specialists and engineers and they get them straight out of universities or polytechnics.</p>

              <p>Well..if you considering overseas like Middle East n Africa, do note that experience is the most important there. Other you will be typecasted into jobs which you will suffer/no good prospects. Dun just look at money aspect.</p>
              <p>You mentioned you travelled a lot and I think all the culture shock and stuffs will not be a factor to you.</p>
              <p>I think your problem might be your networking portal. Try find some recruitment agencies or tap on your friends' network to help you. Right now, the Oil/Gas/Energy industry should be doing well and not short of employment.</p>
              <p>Can check out the government aided SPUR prog if you are employed before. The staff there might be able to cater to your needs. For this industry, a lot of age and experience. Qualifications comes third in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Good luck. Im jobless at the moment as well :)</p>
