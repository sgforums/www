              <p>THE recession is just over, but I have met various people who have been out of work for months, and some for over a year.<br><br>The technical term for such workers is the long-term unemployed (LTU). Most are in their late 40s and 50s. Their skills are obsolete and they have problems adjusting to the new economy.<br><br>Having been jobless for 18 months before, I empathised with their situation.<br><br>However, I learnt to be flexible and take any opportunities which came my way.<br><br>I went to teach in China after only a short discussion with my wife.<br><br>Previously, I would never have entertained such an idea as I was unwilling to step outside my comfort zone. I also grew more resilient over that period.<br><br>Unfortunately, some people who have been jobless for a prolonged period of time grow comfortable in that situation and settle into a routine.<br><br>Some are happy to live off whatever savings they have.<br><br>The following are a number of ways for LTU workers to move away from prolonged unemployment.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Take on short-term work</strong><br>I took up several short-term telemarketing jobs during my period of unemployment. They provided me with<br>much-needed financial resources and broke the monotony of staying at home.<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>Know what you want</strong><br>There are many training courses the unemployed can take. However, LTUs can benefit from such programmes only by asking themselves what they really want from their second careers. They should not follow the herd in taking up courses.<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>Boost your self-esteem</strong><br>Many LTUs battle depression and low self-esteem. Some doubt their abilities and others need a lot of affirmation before they can return to the workforce. The training programmes mentioned above are a good<br>way to stay in tune with the market and socialise. That way, LTUs can gain support from course mates.<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>Get family support</strong><br>LTUs should discuss their life goals with their family. A supportive family can help an LTU get back on his or her feet faster.<br><br></li>
              <li><strong>Set a deadline on returning to the workforce</strong><br>Doing so keeps a person moving towards his or her goal. I hope LTUs find these tips useful and learn to get on with their lives.<br></li>
