              The company is only trying to scare you.
              
              How much is yoour 1 month's salary? it will cost much more money for the co to take legal action against you. They cannot use the Small claims Tribunals as the nature of your case is not within the jurisdiction of the SCT.
              
              So you need to just sit tight and hold your nerves. More important for you to move on with your life and find another job. Don't let this unfortunate episode stall you in your life. 
              
              Good luck!

              <p>I am not surprised...as long as there is a contract...MOM will say its a civil case and ask U to get a lawyer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in that case...try going down to the company personally and ask to see the HR manager...or depending on what U have been employed as....the project manager,team leader,etc.....or whoever interviewed U.</p>
              <p>sometimes HR hire people independently from the people that actually requires them...so when the headcount is no more...problem starts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It might not be cost-effective to sue them...look for another job in the meantime but depending on your relationship with this current company...get a letter for your current Letter of Appointment before signing the next one...cos U wouldnt want to be caught if both sides want U to start work.</p>
