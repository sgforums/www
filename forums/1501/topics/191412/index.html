            <div class='col-md body'>To all fresh grad and undergrad, do read Ministry of manpower or Labour when you got your own free time to have a better understanding for your future employment.<br><br>A few weeks ago before I started my current job as a Customer Service Rep reputable office stationaries supplies. I went to this agency at Peninsular Plaza, and put my salary $1500 negotiable. This middle aged chinese woman( 1 of the staff- Let mi name her Reb), she asked me wat is the lowest I can go, so I said 1400. Reb then said 1400 is quite impossible for a poly fresh grad, fresh grad could only get 1200 to 1300. So max she could get for mi is 1300.<br><br>I got abit suspicious abt the amount she stated, therefore asked her how much is a degree grad, hahaha, guess wat she reply? Fresh DEGREE GRAD get only 1500. And that's the market rate for now. Also don't know why this year the rate goes so low, that was what she added. Okie, we neg for quite sometime, and I knew that she wun give mi any higher pay, and I knew that I wun depend only on this. Thank god, I found my current job my own, paying mi 1500 and agree to it, with not much of the neg on the pay, i din even talk about bonus, leave and all that. But the coy still give in the contract. I really trust this coy.<br><br>Yesterday, that "niao" agency called mi, asking mi if i'm still looking for job. Of course I replied I found a job.<br><br>Today again, she called me, asking mi if i want to take up this job offer. Of course i refused. After she fact find from me abt my current job salary and environment, she told me that coy could also offer the same price.<br><br>Ha Ha... immediately, i got a bit of fire burning in me. How could that Reb cover the fact.<br><br>Maybe they find that fresh grad are innocent towards working life, just like new born babies, can just do wat ever you like to them.<br><br>To those ppl who are under paid, do keep a look out no matter how busy you are. Dun bellieve ppl easily, to the coy, 1500 or 1600 is really a small figure to them.<br><br>For those who are looking for jobs, take your time, News paper are a better resource, avoid agency if possible.<br><br>Good Luck!</div>
