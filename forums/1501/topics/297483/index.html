            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>We are a local established publisher. Due to expansion, we have openings for two positions.<br><br>We are looking for two part-time work-at-home Sales Executive and Marketing Executive. Below are the basic requirements and job scopes for the two posts:<br><br><strong>Sales Executive</strong><br>-	Male<br>-	17 to 25 years old<br>-	Full-time student in Junior College / Polytechnic / University<br>-	Have access to computer, internet and printer at home<br>-	Matured, disciplined, motivated and hardworking<br>-	Preferably a business student in a local tertiary institution (not a must)<br><strong>Job Scope:</strong><br>-	Taking orders via email and then sending of items to customers<br>-	Direct interaction with customers<br>-	Finding new customers<br><br><strong>Marketing Executive</strong><br>-	Female<br>-	17 to 25 years old<br>-	Full-time student in Junior College / Polytechnic / University<br>-	Have access to computer, internet and printer at home<br>-	Matured, disciplined, honest and hardworking<br>-	Preferably a marketing / business student in a local tertiary institution (not a must)<br><strong>Job Scope:</strong><br>-	Working on our specialized marketing system (will be taught by our Sales &amp; Marketing Manager)<br>-	Direct interaction with business partners, clients and webmaster<br>-	Plotting new marketing plans for business development<br><br><strong>Monthly Reimburse:<br><br>Sales Executive:</strong><br>Provisional Period (1st Month): Basic ($100) + Commission (at least $80 if he works with our instructions) + Performance Bonus (1% to 5% of total pay, depending on performance) = <strong>About $185</strong><br>Appointment Period (2nd Month onwards): Basic ($150) + Commission (Unlimited, can go up to $300 to $600) + Performance Bonus (1% to 5%) = <strong>About $250 to $800</strong><br><br><strong>Marketing Executive</strong>:<br>Provisional Period (1st Month): Basic ($100) + Commission (at least $80 if she works with our instructions) + Performance Bonus (1% to 5% of total pay, depending on performance) = <strong>About $185</strong><br>Appointment Period (2nd Month onwards): Basic ($150) + Commission (Unlimited, can go up to $300 to $600) + Performance Bonus (1% to 5%) = <strong>About $250 to $800</strong><br><br>We have done a simple calculation as many part-timers like to relate to hourly pay. An average executive will use 20 hours (inclusive of meeting, exclude transportation time) to complete a monthÂ’s work, and for that he will take home at least $250. Hence 1 hour = average $12.50.<br><br><strong>Working Hours:</strong><br><br>This is a work-at-home job, with the executives having to come for a one-hour meeting at our office every Saturday afternoon, from 2pm to 3pm. Work will be allocated to the respective executives, and the executives will have to complete the work at home at their own time.<br><br>Executives will also have to submit a report every week for appraisal.<br><br>Meeting is important and should executives fails to turn up at the weekly meetings, pay will be deducted.<br><br><strong>Benefits:</strong><br><br>Executives will be exposed to the sales and marketing department of the company, and restricted information will be disclosed to them. This will allow them to understand the structure of how a company work, which will in turn translate into a good platform for them to start their own business should they desire when they graduated.<br><br>Executives will be given responsibilities that only managers in SME take, hence it is a good experience for them to learn about business and the working life that they will be facing in a few yearsÂ’ time.<br><br>Executives will also be given a basic salary, and also commission which will be higher than the basic. Upon appointment period, they will be issued with name cards, an email address and unlimited usage of marketing materials (e.g. flyers, printing services).<br><br>Work-at-home gives them the benefit of planning their own schedule. However, executives have to be VERY disciplined in planning their time and following their schedule.<br><br><strong>Penalty</strong><br><br>As executives will be working at their own pace at their own target without supervision, we will have to implement some penalties for executives to instill discipline. Below are some examples:<br><br>Absence from meeting: Deduct 50% of basic pay<br>Work not done: Dismiss from work<br>CustomersÂ’ complain: Upon investigation and itÂ’s executiveÂ’s fault, deduct 50% of basic pay<br>Embezzling company funds: Police report<br><br><strong>Reason for work-at-home</strong><br><br>We implemented work at home so that we do not need to have office space for our employees. As the executives will only need to work less than 30 hours every month, it will be best for them to work at their own home.<br><br>Please be assured that we are not a scam, nor do executives need to pay any Â“membershipÂ” fee to join us. We have been an established company and our reputation has never been stained.<br><br><strong>Selection of Executives</strong><br><br>We believe that executives can be trained up if their learning skills are slower. We also believe that executives can be trained up if their selling and marketing skills are not up to standard. Hence, what we are looking for are these characters in our executives: Motivated to earn money, integrity, ethnics, matured, disciplined, hardworking and honest.<br><br>We also believe that money earned by executives should be put to good use, hence we may select candidates who are appreciative on the concept of money (e.g. using his or her bill to pay school fees or meals instead of clubbing / drinking / smoking).<br><br>Executives who are willing to learn the ropes of business are also given priority as this is a good stepping stone for them to learn more about SME.<br><br>Executives will go through a one monthÂ’s provisional period (January 200<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and if performance is satisfactory, they will be confirmed in the appointment period (February 2008 onwards).<br><br>Do not hesitate to apply, as we may employ more should you fit the criteria. Please email <strong>executives@goodybooks.com </strong>(Subject: Marketing / Sales Executive Application) and we will send an application form for you. Complete the form and email it back to us by 18 December 2007. Short-listed candidates will be called up for interview.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Thank you for the feedback! We are implementing this system for the first time, so we treat any feedback given to us in top priority.<br><br>We set the ground rules as there will be no supervision on our part, and in order for work to be completed in time and effectively we have to instill discipline. Executives have the freedom of working from the comfort at their house, at their own allocated schedule.<br><br>Pay-wise, it may or may not be lower than any part-time jobs outside, but it is a good learning experience for students as they will be given responsibilities. According to our calculation, an hour will average around $12.50, that is, if executive spent the entire hour working instead of diverting his or her attention to the MSN Messenger ringing at the corner of the monitor.<br><br>I do agree that some of the work allocated will be a little complicated with the learning curve slightly steep, but as executives practice more, they will be able to complete the work faster and work will become easilier as they have the hang of it. In fact, if they are fast enough, they can earn up to $100 a day! However, that is a big Â“up toÂ”, and we do not want to proclaim empty promisesÂ… It really boils down to the attidute of the executives and their self-discipline.<br><br>We deal with sales of local novels. Should you have any questions, do feel free to post and I will try to log in as much as possible to answer your queries.<br></div>
