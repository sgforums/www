              <p>First, Singaporeans are asked to get themselves treated at Malaysian hospitals if they cannot afford the healthcare here. Now they are told to find work overseas.</p>
              <p>The audacious statement was made by Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Dr Yaacob Ibrahim during an interview with Malay radio station Warna 94.2FM.</p>
              <p>When asked about the difficulties faceed by Malay graduates to get jobs in Singapore, Dr Yaacob said<strong> “it is important for students to not give up their job search, and they should also be open to explore opportunities overseas.”</strong></p>
              <p>It is strange that Dr Yaacob is not aware of the fact that Singapore graduates from all races have difficulties finding permanent jobs which pay well in Singapore due to the easy availability of cheap foreign workers.</p>
              <p>If a Singaporean wants to apply to work overseas in any country, he or she must obtain a work visa or permit to even set foot there in the first place.</p>
              <p>Singapore has a unique scheme not heard anywhere else in the world where foreigners are given a year to stay in Singapore to look for jobs here:</p>
              <p>The Employment Pass Eligibility Certificate (EPEC) allows foreigners who are i) holders of selected university qualifications, or ii) current or former holders of selected skilled migrant visas to stay in Singapore for up to one year to facilitate their job search in Singapore. The EPEC is issued on a one-time basis and is non-renewable.</p>
              <p>Contrary to what PAP leaders have been saying, foreigners are allowed to compete directly with Singaporeans for jobs which can be otherwise be taken up by them.</p>
              <p>The relentless influx of engineers and technicians from China and India has depressed the wages of Singapore engineers which has remained stagnant for the last few years.</p>
              <p>Though there is a dependency quota to restrict the hiring of foreigners, it is easily circumvented by taking earlier arrivals to take up Singapore PRs.</p>
              <p>The Home Affairs Ministry admitted that two out of three PR applicants are successful, an astonishingly high success rate for a developed country.</p>
              <p>The state media reported last year of a China National working as a language teacher here who obtained a PR within two months of application.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Dr Yaacob doesn’t know that other countries do not have such lax immigration and labor policies like Singapore and it is not easy for Singaporeans to find work overseas.</p>
              <p>For example, Australia only admits skilled migrants in sectors where there is a chronic shortage of Australians and foreigners need to reside there for at least two out of the last five years to even qualify to apply for Australian PR.</p>
              <p>It is a shame that Singapore graduates are struggling to survive in Singapore due to the PAP’s discriminatory policies against them.</p>
              <p>What will our country become if our native Singaporeans are forced to seek livelihoods elsewhere and their places filled by foreigners from other countries instead?</p>
              <p>The day when Singapore women are forced to work in other countries as maids may not be too far away at the rate the PAP is mass-importing foreigners to supplant Singaporeans in their own nation.</p>

              <p>yeh araphoe thats what i mean. My friend in japan earns a freaking USD 10k/mth as a project engineer. Here in Singapore, he merely gets half of that. And a friend who got posted to Zurich for a 6 months stint got 3 times his usual salary in Sg.</p>
              <p>Even though their McD meals cost Euro$8, so what? Their purchasing power is much stronger. Here we are at the mercy of cheapo foreigners. Why are they cheapo? Because a fucking myanmar, indian or filipino engineer for example, can earn many times more than what they get back home.</p>
