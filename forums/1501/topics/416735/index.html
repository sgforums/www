              <p>Hi all, the day before i was given a call from recruit express and yesterday, i went down to recruit express(RE) for an interview, sign the registration form they gave. </p>
              <p>What i want to ask is can i continue looking for jobs through other means other than RE? Is there any penalty for doing so? Say, i've got a job offer by a company directly and wish to take that up?</p>
              <p>Just completed my A levels and looking for a temp job.</p>
              <p>Please help and many thanks!</p>

              <p>I remember seeing on the form, you can't take up jobs from other agents in there(smth like that) and that they will collect $50 from you if in future you change from a temp to a perm job. </p>

              Most recruitment companies will ask you to sign something to protect their interests but since you have not gone to any interview, this won't be of any consequence
              
               as the previous poster has said, please read what you sign.
              To clear your doubts, ask for a copy of what you signed.

              <p><br>2nd part, yes</p>
              <p>1st part, If you are converted to a perm (staff), You have to give them $50, and once you sign on the dotted line, you can't go to other agencies,if you do you pay lah and the one is much heavier (depending on the time of the contract) but if you have not, you can change your mind whether or not you want.</p>

              <p>the agreement on registration should state that if you accept an offer from their clients (that's the employer you may go interview if recommended)for a temp position and convert to perm you may have to compensate them if its right i read from post here. makes sense. the temp position means they will constantly have this position open for them to work on and draw commission from the employers)their clients. If it becomes perm then they lose one sale. also if you join the employer yourself after going for interview between a certain period of time then you are liable to pay them a fee so that people will not go back door and abuse their intro.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for going for interview every job applicant be it part time or full time has the right to ask the recruiter proper what the job is like so tha they can assess if its what the applicants wants. of course you will want a job you desire or at least can help you in what you do in future.  some recruiters very desperate at times when they cannot hit their target or when some positions very difficult to fulfil one always open (see the ad and the frequeny they comes online you know already). some companies the position/s always open, 3 months later open again you know either the company is got problem, some of their department bosses or emplyees got problem no one can work there one, or the system got problem, or the recruiter got problem introduce people not suitable LOL).</p>

              <p>Is not I think is i know it because I have friends who works in job agencies.</p>
              <p>And there are very high staff turnover rate in job agencies and they are competitors so they won't share clients info with each other.</p>
              <p>Plus, they have too many candiates to even remember who are the ones that gets blacklisted and some job agencies do not even have a proper system to keep track of their candiates, don't need to talk about blacklisting them.</p>
              <p>Of course, it is perfectly ok if you don't believe what I say cos I don't lose anything.</p>
              <p>Welcome to the real world.</p>
