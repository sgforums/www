              <p>Hi dear people,</p>
              <p>managed to land a job in a medium size semiconductor company. my first engineering job after years of graduation. I was doing some part time stuff which was not related to engineering.</p>
              <p>I still got some time before work about 2 months. i would like to prepare as much as possible. any ideas?</p>
              <p>this company provide testing services for wafers mainly. should i read books or should i find out what they really need to learn and do in the job. SHould i read general self help books on working or should i just go through their training period instead.</p>
              <p>They deal with logic, memory, and digital and analog signals in their testing services.</p>
              <p>wafer testing, wafer level burn in are some of the terms.</p>

              <p>Just keep an open mind.</p>
              <p>I was a mechanical engineering grad, but my first job was in semicon as well, times were bad. I didn't do any prep for it, and I didn't have any interest in it either. Just wasn't my cuppa tea, so I left after a year into something else.</p>
              <p>I just know that the semicon industry in singapore is really violatile. One day can be making money, next day lose it twice as fast. I just don't see any prospects in my opinion.</p>

              <p>hi.. so how did u manage to stay on in the company or industry for 17 years. what makes you have the interest and motivation?</p>
              <p>ALso, what do you think are the essential factors to do well as a semiconductor engineer? My job says its product engineer, but the company is doing wafer testing services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from my own research, wafer level testing and burn in, and also according to a friend, these things mean putting the dies on the wafer under electrical testing, stress and temperature test to see if they pass it.</p>
              <p>my friend also say that depending on the results, different grades of wafer will sell to different companies at different costs.</p>
              <p>However, I do not know whether my company does really all these things from what i research.</p>
