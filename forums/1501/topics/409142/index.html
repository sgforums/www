            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Recently I went for at a major organisation which does leasing of properties - F*R  E***T  ORGANISATION. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The whole interview turns out mainly to a personal attack. Was very disappointed in why this manager who name was Roy speaks in such unprofessional tone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is how it goes..</p>
              <p>1. He said, "So.. You are the only child. Only child are all spolit."</p>
              <p>    My answer was it depends on individual. He said, "I know de.. Cause my wife is only <br>    child too."</p>
              <p>    It doesn't makes sense to me at all. If your wife is spolit, it doesn't makes all the only  <br>    child spolit too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. He mentioned that I look different from my picture. In my picture I look more mature, <br>    but in real life I looked childish. I wonder is that the right phrasing to use? Is it my fault <br>    that I looked younger than my actual age? As a manger in the organisation, he ought <br>    to have a better interpersonal skill and a higher EQ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. He asked whether I am independent. I can say I am quite independent since young. I <br>    could take care of myself, my meals and my school work when my parents are <br>    working. He told me that his 2 years old son is always alone. Oh man! How on earth <br>    would any parents leave their 2 years old son alone. ALONE WITH EITHER <br>    GRANDPARENTS OR MAID OR IN CHILDCARE. Is that what he mean by <br>    independent?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. He asked whether I looked more like my mum or my dad? Does it concern him? To <br>    satisfy his curiosity I told him that I looked more like my mum. He got the cheek to <br>    insult my mum. "Oh, so when I see someone in Sengkang who look very childish like <br>    you confirm is your mum"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is this? Even if I don't perform well in the interview. Is there a need for you to say such sarcastic remarks? There is no wrong being direct. But a personal attack is very rude. I wonder if his position is a HR manager or Marketing manger. But even so, he has no right to insult anyone. As a HR manager, as a people person, a high EQ is important, how would your staffs feel when you talk in such a "mature" manner. As a Marketing manager, I am real surprised that you did not pissed your clients off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its been a real bad experience</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>read the comments. if the interviewers really said those then i think the childish one is the interviewer. rad them carefully. these can sue the guy more like personal attack.  if the inetrviewer ibelongs to the HR department then i can really facepalm.  but you know sales line anyone can do. most with o levels only can do already</p></div>

              <p>Some interviewers are so plagued by their own personal problems that they have to victimize interviewees .   These are the ones with zero EQ and are affecting the image of the organisations they are working for.</p>
              <p>I had my fair share of unprofessional interviewers, too.    Couple of years back I attended an interview.   I was 15 minutes early for the interview.   The person interviewing me came out to greet me and said to me I was very early for the interview and she went in to the office  then came out again to tell me I was too early for the interview.   During interview, she could not get over it and told me I was very early for the interview.   She went on to throw rubbish questions for answering.    </p>

              <p>such interviews are not normal, in contrary to the above poster said.</p>
              <p>imo, the manager crossed the line and was unprofessional.  interviewees should not have to tolerate or accommodate such attitude from interviewer.  we are here in good faith to do a transaction - candidate supply his service, employer buys the service.  when we go buy stuff, do we make personal attack at the salesman ?</p>
