              <p>If I can recall correctly, 10 years ago, average starting pay for general degree holders was around 2k.</p>

              <p>It all depends on luck. But I advise you to be more proactive in finding work. <br>2.5k is quite hard. Maybe you can try 2.1k to 2.3k, or even less.  <br><br>Questions that they may ask<br>1) What do you like about marketing?<br>2) Why do you think we should hire you? <br> <br>But combat NS doesnt count anything in the private sector. Even in public sector, its whether you completed / exempted / not completed. (You've just wasted 2 years serving without realising that you are actually disadvantaged due to NS - Not forgetting employers frown at you when you are from the combat side, due to reservist liabilities.)</p>

              <p>ask for 2k first or even lesser(if u found a company that u can
              let u learn alot of things)</p>
              <p>than after working 2-3 yrs and gaining experience u can request
              for 10-20% more pay rise than ur previous pay.</p>
              <p>first 2-3 yrs of ur working life u should learn as much as
              possible. pay should not be a priority but working experience
              gained should be. ur resume would be better and u can command a
              higher pay in ur next job.</p>
              <p>and after working for 2-3 yrs job hop if possible. if u stay at
              the same company for 6-7 yrs, ur annual increment mayb 5-10% but if
              u job hop, u can request for up to 20% more pay (this can only be
              possible if u have a good resume)</p>

              <p>LoL. Thread starter is obviously very dumb and ignorant. What has serving 2 years of NS in a combat vocation got to do with finding a marketing job? Are you looking to work as a Cisco security guard? If cisco guard, then yes you need that 2 years of NS.</p>
              <p>I think you should lower your salary expectations first, because afterall you have ZERO work experience. It is this reason why employers are inclined to hire foreigners over singaporeans because locals alway ask for higher pay and yet have no job experience.</p>
              <p>Start low first. ask for something around 1.8k to 2k. Foreigners with honors degree are willing to work below market rate and also willing to slog longer hours in the office. They are prepared to lose their weekends if they have to. Are you prepared to compete against them?</p>

              <p>You might give people the false impression, and when their company fails to give them that 5-10% annual increment, they go "oh this sucks!".  Don't be surprised, annual increments can be as low as 0.3% these days.</p>
