              <p>Hey all, this seems to be the most active job forum I found so far. (one where real people exchange ideas not just something full of "work from home, get rich quick" junk)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway... I had some questions maybe you guys would be kind enough to point me in the right direction or give some input on the situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Six months ago I was looking at jobs in Singapore for a 6 month visit on a Work Holiday Programme. Basically it would give me the right to work legally for six months while traveling the region as well. I have done a stint in Australia for twelve months in 2009, enjoyed it a lot and wanted to try Singapore as well, since I liked it on a stop over to Europe before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a job in NYC while looking for work in Singapore and with my luck did not even receive a single response to all the resumes I was sending out. It seemed awkward to me but we were in a recession and I had a job, so when I didn't find anything I simply stayed in NY. Business has slowed down a lot in the US so while I have downtime I would like to give Singapore another shot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have again started researching heavily jobs in Singapore and intend to apply for the Work Holiday Programme again... but after a few days of intense search, I am again failing to generate any response. Now I know my resume is not terrible, I have 10 years working experience in the luxury Transportation field and a year experience working in Construction specifically Surveyor/Digital Measurements work. It is experience that I would think should be in demand. I also have a Masters degree in Information Systems as well as dual Bachelors. So I would hope I am qualified for something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any idea why I am getting snubbed by potential employers in Singapore?   I am going to come to the country and work legally.  I have read much about short term contracts so its not like I'm applying for jobs that I don't intend to keep.   What gives?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suggestions and ideas would certainly be much appreciated!</p>
