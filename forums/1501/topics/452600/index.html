              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>1. Does a HR care from which university did you graduate?</p>
              <p>Well, the reason I am asking that because I am planning to take a part-time degree although I already had a place in a local uni la of course. But I felt like taking a full-time degree is a waste of time and years of experience. So I would greatly appreciate anyone who replies to this post. Especially HR.</p>
              <p>2.  How about the salary? Does the salary differs between those who graruated from private or local uni?</p>
              <p>Currently I reserved a place in NTU (Comp Science). But then, I am also considering taking a part-time degree after NS while working full-time. (Also IT related course offered from UniSIM / PSB / MDIS). The second question is kinda important to me because I heard that those from private institutions earn much lesser than local institutions. So I would like to know the truth?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for reading this post.</p>

              <p>It really depends on what sector you are looking into.</p>
              <p>For government service job, i would say they prefer local uni. Which is the main 3 (NTU, NUS and SMU). For private.... it does not make much of a difference as long as it is recognise by the singapore government.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yah, it certainy matters to a certain extent the univer you graduate from.  However, due to so much glut of degrees, it is possible for local grads to be frustrated with their career progress and like some here say a few ended up as entrepreneurs - hawkers and taxi drivers.  If you know how to use your education properly you would be able to move up as entrepreneurs because you could control how much you could grow with your abilities employees could not.  I believe many here do not think of Steve Job as just one of the Sim Lim square computer assemblers.  But if you observe carefully, his initial set up is he depended on a computer technician to assemble the workable computer to sell just like those Sim Lim guys.  Entrepreneurs need not have degrees as many do not how to use them but they can make leaps because they control far more than an employee could control his own career.</p></div>

              <p>hmm, I roughly scanned through a few TOP-TIER firms partners/directors academic credentials; not all graduated from famous unis, but all have impressive work experience.</p>
              <p>They are in their 40s+/-, not sure how things have changed nowadays. Either way, imo, there are many factors leading to top positions.</p>
              <p>Havard grads don't gurantee success - it simply put you in an ideal situation.</p>

              <p>Thanks all for your answers. Appreciate it so much.</p>
              <p>Some of you mentioned about impressive exp. My interest more towards IT (Networking/Server admin). </p>
              <p>I am sorry if I am asking a noob question here. Government service job are those like civil servants right? So does IT counts as government related service? (I guess no?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In that case, does that means it is better for IT/networking students to take a part-time degree while working full-time in order to get experience?</p>

              <p>Do you know that the one of the government agency e2i Employment and Employability Institute got offered skill training and help you to find a job especially in IT area : <a href="http://www.e2i.com.sg">http://www.e2i.com.sg</a> , but of course the final decision lie in the employers who are part of their programme.</p>
              <p>Still as some forumers said, usually IT market largely considered of "cheap" foreigner from Indian, Mainland China and maybe Caucasian for senior position. Only gaming or other multimedia related company are still "popular" among fellow Singaporan.</p>

              <p>Mbas are not really for entrepreneurs. They are more suitable for managing large and established firms. Alternatively, they could have started their businesses before obtaining their Mba.</p>
              <p>Mckinsey hires Sim grads. Obviously, it is more challenging for Sim grad(compared with Havard) to land a position in such firm.</p>
              <p>They starting pay ard 6k. Average of 10k - 15k are more for experienced hires or those with top honours.</p>
