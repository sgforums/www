              <p>They just dont have those older aged folks short listed. What can you do...</p>
              <p>They have more than 1000 reason not to shortlist anyone, right ?</p>
              <p>I think as a business point of view, we have to respect that. Although on a job seeker point of view, we despise that.</p>
              <p>Its always 2 side of a coin, there are alot of factors in hiring and recruitment. The HR represent the company, thus its right they stand by their company's interest first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just like some people just think that TAXI DRIVERS owes them a ride. We are compulsory to pick up anyone, not to forget there are alot of people who chose taxis on the street, comparing those 3.80 to 3.70 to 3.20 bla bla bla.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers are contracted as Independent Contracters, meaning we are not under any employment. No one owe us a living, nor we owe anyone a service.</p>
              <p>I think those SeLFISH complanants who keep complaining about taxi drivers being irresonsible have to wake up their idea. No one owes you a ride. I think taxi drivers should have thier little luxury on how they wanna operate their 1 man business.</p>
              <p>If you are really that urgent and need a to get somewhere, there is always to bid for priority by just calling a cab, not to expect by standing on the roadside like a KUKU waving for cab at the Very Peak hours, and any available cab SHOULD service you to deliver you to your designated location.</p>
              <p>Well anyone agrees?</p>

              <p>Was brought up in an extended family where the eldest and 2nd eldest paternal uncles were both taxi drivers. Sincerely, taxi driving is a good profession, a good vocation imho. Especially in the old days if we compare it versus market stall holders, back then if somebody owns a chicken stall they do the actual culling in the wet market. It was a very bloody business i.e. poultry business - not hawking - poultry business. In comparison, taxi driving was very 'sing-nang', decades ago they installed the mini fans in each taxi, and since back then there was minimal pollution outside of the industrial estates, e.g. in 1993 when I sat in my eldest uncle's taxi as he ferried me from my maternal grandmother's new HDB at Woodlands to Ang Mo Kio, the taxi went past Thompson and Sembawang and on both sides of the road were practically trees and more trees. In other words, taxi driving back then was cool because first of all there was car ownership, secondly since housing was that standard the only thing worth worrying about perhaps is if my uncle sent me to Woodlands from Ang Mo Kio the chances are he has to come back central area without a passenger. This is the sort of dilemma that I still see in other countries' rural countrysides such as recently when I went Ping-tung in Taiwan, the taxi driver was willing to fetch people back to Kaohsiung for free because there was little hope of him going home to Kaohsiung at 4pm with any confirmed paying passenger.</p>
              <p>If it's about foreigners, actually this one is very malu. Because both Taiwan and Singapore complain about foreigners, and the foreigners that upset us usually the most are also Chinese, just a different country. It is difficult to define what 'foreigner' is, because since I graduated all my employers were foreigners. I recall working under the Japanese, there was once I was doing a proof-of-concept till the late hours with my stewardess-turned-consultant director and two seniors that included a Vietnam-war-refugee-turned-American, then the Japanese boss iirc the name Kajiyama dropped by and chatted with us at 12am. It was a fantastic experience, because these foreigners came in with their own lifestyles and stories, I still recall the Vietnamese senior had a scar on his face because he fell down and hit some part of the boat while fleeing Vietnam, honestly, I learn more training with expats like him than working in civil service because this Vietnam guy saw war himself, yet today even the highest-flying MP a General Ng Chee Meng has seen anything but war himself. Without these foreigners and their stories of war and disasters, if something happens and you want me to trust a war-less General to lead us Singaporeans through World War 3, I really may rather just bail out of town.</p>
              <p>A bank insurance manager is only a title that sounds nice and sounds good. Sure many want this job, and the criterion is also usually pitched quite high, yet we ARE heading into the n-th recession since national independence. Becoming an insurance manager is one thing, it's almost also self-employable these days like cabbies, yet those bank insurance managers that saw the 1985 recession, the 1991-ish Iraq War recession, the 1997 dot-com bubble burst recession, in fact there are more it's just that the one I recall more frequently is the 2008-09 Lehmann Brothers recession; banking industries are the least reliable of all vocations as long as there are countries in the world that are helmed by Communist or Workers' Parties, because as long as there is socialism, comminternism or even fascism, banking success career stories are at best imaginery i.e. either self-imagined or collectively-imagined.</p>

              <p>This is because the government let too many foreigners in .....

              <p>It will get worse in future for the future generations in Singapore, especially when we are moving towards being more technological advanced. Some technologies can be accepted but some technologies are going to take our jobs away. <br>Pretty worried for those who want to be a taxi driver till retirement. Now the govt is going towards the wrong direction of pushing towards driverless cars. Imagine how many people will become jobless in Singapore in future. If then, what is the point of having 6.9 and even 10 million people in Singapore where many people are jobless due to technologies that take away jobs they want?<br>I believe everyone would prefer to drive a taxi than to wash toilets till retirement. Instead of wasting money on driverless cars, why not spend money building robots that clean public toilets?<br>Have a thought.</p>
