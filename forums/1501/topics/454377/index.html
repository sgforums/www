              <p>Only few days ago, my colleague Train Officer Arasu was relating his 
              personal story to me. TO Arasu has been with us for about 5 years. 
              Before that, he tried a few other non IT related jobs before landed here
               with us.</p>
              <p>TO Arasu has got a diploma in computer science which he took more 
              than 10 years ago in year 2000 and subsequently the same higher diploma 
              two years later in year 2002. His good friend Param also took both 
              courses conducted by <a href="http://www.tmc.edu.sg">TMC</a> endorsed by Staffordshire University in UK. TO Arasu spent more than $20,000 for the course.<br> <a href="http://gintai.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/20120619-234635.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://gintai.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/20120619-234635.jpg?w=640" alt="20120619-234635.jpg"></a><br> TO Arasu was then working in SATs. It was not recognized by that 
              company. Param, on the other hand was working as a factory operator in a
               manufacturing firm. Even though Param was a Malaysian, he was 
              immediately recommended by a Malaysian IT manager in the same company to
               take on an IT job in the same firm.</p>
              <p>After few years of IT work in the company, Param went on to another 
              company doing the same IT related job. He remains in the IT industry 
              earning about $4,000 a month.</p>
              <p>TO Arasu did not manage to land any IT related job. After a few other
               jobs, he found his way to this present company. His IT higher diploma 
              is still not recognized.</p>
              <p>TO Arasu and his good friend Param still stay in touch. Param is 
              working the 5-day week earning about $4,000 in the IT industry. He used 
              to call TO Arasu whenever he goes back to JB. Param lives in JB but 
              commutes daily on weekdays to work here.</p>
              <p>Train Officer Arasu told me that they both had the same qualification
               and about the same age in their mid 30s yet he earns only $1,400 a 
              month and has to struggle on shift work with rotating off days!</p>
              <p>When TO Arasu saw me few days ago, he told me that his friend Param 
              just called him. Again, his friend Param who is a Malaysian teased TO 
              Arasu that as a ‘Singaporean’, working as a Train Officer is earning so 
              much less than him. He is enjoying every weekend with his family in JB 
              whereas TO Arasu is working on shift with rotating off days like a 
              “Baduah!”</p>
              <p>As a Singaporean, his life is no better than a Malaysian even though 
              they possess the same qualifications. It must be his bad karma or rather
               the Malaysian IT manager that opened up a valuable career path for his 
              friend Param? Life is really full of little ironies as far as Train 
              Officer Arasu is concerned. It appears that it’s better to be a 
              Malaysian like his friend Param than a Singaporean. Really langgar!</p>
