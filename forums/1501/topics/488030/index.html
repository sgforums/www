              <p>Hi, are there any job training centre where candidate are able to try 
              and practice any jobs they would be interest in? like for example, if 
              candidate is interested in becoming a sales association, the trainer 
              will train the candidate like teaching him how to talk to customer to 
              pursue them to buy product or maybe training in call centre if the 
              candidate wants to work in a call centre to learn how to take down long 
              tedious telephone messages and to train him to be able to effectively 
              take down telephone messages without asking the client to repeat the 
              message again and etc?</p>

              <p>Do I need to pay course fee for this Training?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have checked on the WDA website, their course needs money. Does 
                  anyone knows are there other training centre such that if candidate does
                   not know what they want to do, they will get to do a personality test 
                  first. <br> <br> After doing a personality test and based on the result, there will be a 
                  list of jobs that are recommended for them based on their personality 
                  questions they have answered which is similar to Peaks and C-Vat. 
                  Candidate would pick one of the job they like from the job list and 
                  attend training if they want. The training course will have training fee
                   (of course) but candidate can choose to pay the training fee after they
                   have applied for the job, working for a month and get paid for their 
                  salary. <br> <br> Candidate can choose to pay the training fee by installment such as for 
                  example, if the training fee is $500 dollars, candidate can choose to 
                  pay $500 if they got paid for their salary for the month or maybe some 
                  candidate can choose to pay the course fee monthly such as $100 or $200 
                  per month and the following month, another $100 or $200 etc, but have to
                   finish paying the training course fee for the month(s) of the year. <br> <br> If let say during the training, the candidate find that the training job
                   doesn't suit them and they want to change to another one from their job
                   list, but the previous training job fee still have to be paid after 
                  they have trained finished from their training and have started to work,
                   and got paid for their salary. Like for example, the candidate choose 
                  to work as a cashier first and receive training with the training fee of
                   $350 and they find that cashier job doesn't suit them so they want to 
                  change to maybe working as a call centre and receive training from it 
                  with a fee of $500. After the candidate have finished their training as 
                  call centre and found a job working as a caller, the candidate have to 
                  pay total of $850 including the previous training course fee after they 
                  got their first salary either pay all together or pay by monthly. <br> <br> Not sure are there any this kind of job training centre?</p>
