              <p>I have worked in many permament and contract jobs before but this is the first time I sign a letter of appointment with a company which states that:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Your salary is $xxx a month of which 12% amounting to $yyy is monthly variable component."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I ask the HR staff what is this monthly variable component(mvc) about, she reply that it is just a policy by ntuc which states that companies can take away the 12% monthly variable component during bad times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She say that so far the company setup 20 years already they have never taken away the 12% mvc before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have never heard of what ntuc having such a crap rule that 12% of your salary is monthly variable component de leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Siao liao I got a feeling that I got cheated already. Because this job need to sign a 6 months contract and I can't leave within 6 months or I have to pay 1 month salary as compensation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My salary is not very high also, just market rate only for a diploma holder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have already signed the letter of appointment and going to start work in november.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now I am scare that the company will come out stunt say that they having financial problem and they have to deduct the 12% monthly variable component than I also lan lan no choice but to stay with them for 6 months..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You think such a situation is possible?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone here sign such a letter of appointment say what 12% is monthly variable component?</p>

              cannot be ba cos it is the company's policy. this scheme is suggested by the govt instead of cutting employee's cpf during bad times (which they did in the past and it caused a few upsets), they set aside a 10% to be cut from your pay (that is MVC) during bad times.
              If the company is doing well, it will give a 13th month pay to their employees.
