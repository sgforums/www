              <p>I believed most resumes are not true. some embellished their resume to make it look better, especially if you are a job hopper, who change jobs a few times a year. if not interviewer will ask you why you change jobs that often and your chances of landing that job is zero, especially in an economic climate now, where it is an employer's world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>does the HR do reference check on you before they decide to offer you employment? some companies HR simply didnt check and offer the candidate the job. some didnt even bother to ask you for their certificates. I got a job last time, but the HR didnt asked me for my certificates or to verify them.</p>
