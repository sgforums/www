              <p>you dun like studying eh? ever thought of going back to study in future? retail line you need secondary education I think, so is cashiering.</p>

              <p>if you dun like to study, its fine. but what is your passion? what do you like to work as in future?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suggest you go take up and learn a skill that can earn you a living. if you got a passion, its even better. some people just dun like to study or is academically inclined, but they are good in other ways, like IT, drawing and so forth.</p>

              <p>whose tammy tay? why dun u go into fashion design then? go study at laselle or raffles design or nafa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its true. at 17, you have another 13 years before you turned 30. nobody stays young forever. for those women who thinks of getting married and be housewife, what if the hubby divorced you? in this life, its better to depend and count on yourself rather than hubby. hubby can either divorce, or even die before you. what are you going to do when that happens? by then you have a child, a housewife  and not working for 10 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>your friends are also your age, what do they know about career and life haha. you will realise one day who are your good friends who care for you and those who simply only love to eat drink and club.</p>

              <p>the more you lie, the more you have to deny when they ask or verify things with you. recent case is ris low, who lied time and again. you hope the employer doesnt check, but if it does after you are employed, they may sack you for embellishment.</p>
