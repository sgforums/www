              <p>Extracted from Stomp : Foreigners shoo family away from Botanic Gardens landmarks because they "booked it"</p>
              <p>Comments by one person I found require attention.</p>
              <p>By SophiaRosieHart</p>
              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>
              <p>6.@Darn walk out on a job i get paid 30 grand a month for mate you must be joking,found a job like that in new zealand nope because they all taken and i would rather travel the world i've been to most of asia i must say singapore was the worse place i ever landed in and i cant wait in till i get to move</p>
              <p>7.and u see i already have another job lined up thats mine if i want it and most of the new zealanders here get moved around by the same company they dont keep them here because they know they dont like it just like my boss knows i hate singapore thats why next is Bangkok or Dubai or Aussie.<br>he probably worked his ass of an lied to get the job thats why he cant move anywhere because he sucks and no one wants him ouch that must hurt hahahahahahahahahaa like no one wants you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess our Governement is not aware of all these. Keep talking about about "talent". The Government need to have a system to weed out such Foreigner.</p>

              <p>In other countries, foreigners are only allowed to take up jobs
              shunned by locals, but in Singapore, not only are they allowed to
              compete directly with Singaporeans for jobs which can otherwise be
              taken up by them, Singaporeans are now told by their supreme leader
              Lee Kuan Yew that they will have to accept it.</p>
              <p>For video: </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/07/24/video-lee-kuan-yew-says-it-cannot-be-helped-that-foreigners-are-competing-with-locals-unequally-for-jobs/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/07/24/video-lee-kuan-yew-says-it-cannot-be-helped-that-foreigners-are-competing-with-locals-unequally-for-jobs/</a></p>
              <p>Speaking during the South Asian Diaspora Convention two days
              ago, Lee Kuan Yew was asked about the political implications of his
              mass-immigration policies to which he replied:</p>
              <p><strong>“So you’ve got to accept the discomfort, which the local
              citizens fear that they are competing unequally for jobs. (It)
              cannot be helped.”</strong></p>
              <p>He also claimed that China is ‘easier’ to govern compared to
              India as 90 percent of its people speaks the same language.</p>
              <p>At 88 years of age, Lee Kuan Yew is the world’s oldest living
              MP. Though he does not hold any ministerial posts in the Singapore
              cabinet, he still has five full-time and part-time private and
              press secretaries from the Prime Minister’s Office working for
              him.</p>
              <p>When asked if he will retire a year ago, Lee said:</p>
              <p><strong>“You work as long as you can work and you will be
              healthier and happier for it. If you ask me to stop working all of
              a sudden, I think I’ll just shrivel up, face the wall and just
              that.”</strong></p>
              <p>While Singaporeans are forced to compete unequally with
              foreigners, the PAP employs all kinds of dirty tactics to prevent
              its political opponents from competing with it.</p>

              <p>LKY is senile and start bubbling nonsense. Of cos, you are not the one competing with foreigners. You ask yourself. If foreigners come and compete your MM position can a not. You are like a king. Dun allow this and that and sue people to bankrupt. You even more afraid than us. Old Bastard. Talking via asshole.</p>
