              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Ever since I first mentioned that we are planning for a population of 6.5 million people, many Singaporeans have reacted with concern, some with alarm, at the thought of more people living and working in Singapore.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">They ask: Why do we need so many people? Will there be enough jobs for me or my children? Will there be enough land for housing, roads, parks? Will I be able to afford decent housing? Will the new migrants be able to fit into our society? <br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>These are all valid concerns and questions. Singaporeans are rightly concerned about their future and their children’s future. <br><br>So is the PAP government.<br><br>It is precisely because we are concerned about the future of Singapore that we are planning well ahead of time and working hard to secure a bright future for Singaporeans. <br><br>As a schoolboy, one of the first things I learnt was that Singapore is a small country. I did not really realise how small until I became Minister for National Development, and saw how we had to fit in houses, schools, roads, reservoirs, parks, factories, offices, ports and airports etc into this tiny island we call home. <br><br>We have not let our size limit our growth and affect our quality of life. Instead, we have used it to our advantage by being nimble. Our land constraint has compelled us to plan carefully for growth and to be innovative in how we make use of limited land.<br><br>When you have less of something, you tend to make better use of it. As a result, we have enjoyed four decades of good economic growth and social development since independence, and built a modern, vibrant metropolis that is one of the most livable cities in Asia. <br><br>Now, standing at the threshold of the next 40 years, we need once again to look ahead and determine the Singapore of the future. Our population was 1.9 million back in 1965 when we became independent. Today, it is 4.5 million. As we embark on our next phase of development, our population is expected to grow further.   <br><br>Do we need a larger population? Most definitely. To grow and create more and better jobs, Singapore must remain open, competitive and relevant to the global market place.<br><br>In such an economy, we need sufficient people with the right skills and experience. If we cannot get enough from our own people, we must supplement with skilled immigrants. <br><br>A larger population and greater economic activity will bring about greater buzz, vibrancy and energy, which in turn will attract more people â€¨and new opportunities.<br><br>Major global cities like London, New York, Tokyo and Hong Kong have populations ranging from about seven million to 12 million. So, too, newly emerging cities like Chengdu and Mumbai. These cities are abuzz with life and vibrancy.<br><br>Singapore must remain competitive as a city in which people want to work and live. <br><br>Is this a plus or minus for us? Will there be enough jobs for Singaporeans, with so many immigrants? Let’s remind ourselves that the reason we want to attract more skilled people to work here is so that we can create even more jobs.<br><br>If we do not create more jobs, then it is no use worrying about whether there are enough jobs for Singaporeans.<br><br>Foreigners and locals together can enlarge our economic pie, help it grow, create jobs, so that there is a bigger slice for everyone. Ultimately, let’s not forget that we are doing this for Singapore and Singaporeans.<br><br>How many more people can we accommodate? Will there be enough land for so many people? What population we want will depend on many factors – our physical constraints, the quality of life we wish to maintain, how ingenious and resourceful we are, how well we welcome and integrate more immigrants into our midst, and the trade-offs we are prepared to make.<br><br>Ultimately, we will have to decide on the Singapore we wish to have. <br><br>A recent review of our long-term land use and transportation plan concluded that we have enough land to cater to a population of 6.5 million, if we are creative and careful in using our limited land, if we plan for such growth now and if we invest in the necessary infrastructure.<br><br>If we look ahead, and start preparing now, we can create an exciting, dynamic, prosperous and livable first world city. <br>These are some of the things the government plans to do: <br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Housing:</span></strong> We will go beyond estate upgrading to rejuvenate our housing estates. We intend to comprehensively redesign some public housing estates to provide more greenery, greater convenience and comfort to the residents. And we will make sure that this new generation HDB housing willâ€¨remain affordable. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Transportation:</span></strong> As our population grows, greater transportation needs will have to be met. Existing expressways will be upgraded, and new expressways added. We will improve our public transport system even more, including adding new rail lines.  In this way, we can reduce demand for land, and minimise the environmental and traffic impact of a larger car population.   <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Parks, gardens and water bodies:</strong></span> We do not want to live in a concrete jungle. We will build new parks islandwide as well as enhance existing ones and link them up with park connectors to make them more attractive and accessible. We are well on our way to creating three signature parks at Marina Bay. We will also be making better use of our waterways and water bodies. We will transform drains and canals into beautiful, flowing streams and rivers.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">New growth centres:</span></strong> We will develop new growth centres in areas such as Marina Bay, Orchard Road, Jurong and Paya Lebar. These new growth centres will bring more jobs and amenities, including to people living in the suburban estates.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The Singapore of the future is an exciting one. I can see it in the eyes of the young people who work with me in putting these plans together. I can feel the enthusiasm in their voices as they talk about the future, their future.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">But plans are only as good as the paper they are written on – unless they can be made to happen.<br><br>So long as we have a leadership that has the foresight to anticipate challenges, the determination and the political will to address them, and the ability to bring our people along to tackle these challenges together; and so long as we have a people that is willing to work hard, and work with one another, and with their leaders, we can together create a truly global city, which we can call home. <br></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore's government saw rapid population growth as a threat to living standards and political stabilit</span></strong>y, as large numbers of children and young people threatened to overwhelm the schools, the medical services, and the ability of the economy to generate employment for them all. In the atmosphere of crisis after the 1965 separation from Malaysia, the government in 1966 established the Family Planning and Population Board, which was responsible for providing clinical services and public education on family planning.</p>
              <p>Birth rates fell from 1957 to 1970, but then began to rise as women of the postwar baby boom reached child-bearing years. The government responded with policies intended to further reduce the birth rate. Abortion and voluntary sterilization were legalized in 1970.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Between 1969 and 1972, a set of policies known as "population disincentives" were instituted to raise the costs of bearing third, fourth, and subsequent children. </span></strong></p>
              <p>Civil servants received no paid maternity leave for third and subsequent children; maternity hospitals charged progressively higher fees for each additional birth; and income tax deductions for all but the first two children were eliminated. Large families received no extra consideration in public housing assignments, and top priority in the competition for enrollment in the most desirable primary schools was given to only children and to children whose parents had been sterilized before the age of forty. Voluntary sterilization was rewarded by seven days of paid sick leave and by priority in the allocation of such public goods as housing and education. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The policies were accompanied by publicity campaigns urging parents to "Stop at Two" and arguing that large families threatened parents' present livelihood and future security. </span></strong></p>

              <p>Do u know why electronics/electrical companies choose to relocate to other countries like China? </p>
              <p>Its because wages are cheaper there and the same quality can be achieved, thus, the boss saved more money.</p>
              <p>Do u know why foreigners choose to work in sg? In the manufacturing sector, these blue collared workers can earn more than in their own country doing the same job BUT at the same time, live better, and their expected salary is lower than sgreans.</p>
              <p>When these happens, lower educated sgreans lose out to these foreigners. When MBT says the future is to get more foreign talents in, it only create a laughing joke that sg cant produce their very own talent.</p>
              <p>MBT, if sg wants to create talent, why open up university places to people who dont even appreciate it? U can do better if u saved up those university slots for locals u know?</p>
              <p>Sometime ppl criticises us, sgreans, that we have only ourselves to blame but with such a gov controlling us, how can we be free?</p>
              <p>The election is the answer. It doesnt neccessary mean the opposition is your answer, But in my opinion, there should be more opposition in the parliment. And give them real power, not just a blank cheque which cannot be processed.</p>
              <p>51% power to opposition</p>
              <p>49% power to pap</p>

              <p>He's comparing us with Chengdu and Mumbai! I believe the land they have there is many many times bigger? I have personally been to chengdu before and even though the population is huge, the area is not as densely populated as singapore. There are very beautiful, spacious and affordable condos 30-40 mins out of the city.</p>
              <p>Seems like their idea is simple. More population, more spending and therefore more jobs for everyone. And most importantly, the GDP is always maintained at that very high level. If their main KPI (which decides their increment, bonuses etc) is the GDP, then this 'population increase' is of paramount importance because a huge influx of foreigners, FOR SURE, would jack up the GDP.</p>
              <p><br>So what's the plan after we hit 6.5 million? Surely this land can only accomodate so much? I bet they have no idea.</p>
              <p>I notice that PAP tends to indulge in subtle...not too subtle self praise. "As long as we have the leadership bla bla bla......" implying that PAP will always be there for us as visionary leaders......sometimes reading too much of this makes my hairs stand.</p>

              <p>while our leaders are looking at the $$ dollars perharps they should also consider.....</p>
              <p>The possibilities of this..........</p>
              <p>Sea level rise from anthropogenic global warming could erase some island states from the face of the Earth -- but those nations could survive even without land, say researchers.</p>
              <p>Governments and people of lost islands could survive "in exile," build structures to mark their submerged territory, retain their status in the eyes of other states and await the day when their islands emerge again when global cooling drops sea levels.</p>
              <p>The trouble is current international agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, don't address the issue, said international law professor Rosemary Rayfuse of the University of New South Wales in Australia. Just what to do about the possibility of nations being lost, and how to do it, is very much on the frontiers of the legal thinking.</p>
              <p>"From the international law perspective, it's fascinating," Rayfuse told Discovery News. "Ultimately, this is going to be a very serious problem."</p>
              <p>According to the vast majority of scientific investigations, warming waters and the melting of polar and high-elevation ice worldwide will steadily raise sea levels. This will likely drive people off islands first by spoiling the fresh groundwater, which will kill most land plants and leave no potable water for humans and their livestock.</p>
              <p>Low-lying island states like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives are the most prominent nations threatened in this way.</p>
