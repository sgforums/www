              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Employment in Singapore rose for a fourth successive 
              quarter in the three months to June, supported by the strong economic 
              expansion.
              <br> <br> The Manpower Ministry's latest labour market report said that total employment rose by 24,900.
              <br> <br> This brought the total gains in the first half of this year to 61,400, 
              as opposed to a loss of 13,800 in the same period last year. 
              <br> <br> The services sector added 25,400 workers in the second quarter, smaller than the gains of 33,400 in the preceding quarter.
              <br> <br> Construction registered an increase of 2,000 workers, compared to a small decline of 400 in the first quarter.
              <br> <br> However, manufacturing employment fell by 2,300, after increasing by 
              3,100 in the preceding quarter. MOM says unemployment has stabilised, 
              after declining sharply at the end of last year.
              <br> <br> The overall unemployment rate was unchanged at 2.2 per cent.
              <br> <br> There were 84,400 unemployed residents in June 
              <br> <br> MOM says redundancies remained at around pre-recessionary quarterly levels. 
              <br> <br> 2,280 workers were made redundant in the second quarter, slightly lower than in the preceding quarter. 
              <br> <br> Redundancies in manufacturing rose over the quarter from 1,120 to 1,220, while that in construction and services fell.
              <br> <br> Re-employment prospects of residents who were laid off also improved.
              <br> <br> CPF records showed that 55 per cent of residents who were laid off in the first quarter of this year were re-employed by June.
              <br> <br> Job vacancies increased by 73 per cent over the year to 45,100 in June.
              <br> <br> MOM says that amid the favourable economic climate, both the average 
              monthly recruitment and resignation rates rose to 2.9 per cent and 2.2 
              per cent respectively.
              <br> <br> Labour productivity continued its cyclical upturn for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
              <br> <br> Year-on-year growth was double-digit at 15 per cent in the second quarter, comparable to 14 per cent in the previous quarter. 
              <br> <br> Nominal earnings grew by 5.8 per cent, higher than the 3.7 per cent increase in the first quarter.
              <br> <br> However, with inflation rising faster in the second quarter at 3.1 per 
              cent against first quarter's 0.9 per cent, the increase in real earnings
               was 2.6 per cent, which was 0.2 percentage points lower than in the 
              first quarter of 2010. - CNA/fa</span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's unemployment rate has fallen further.<br><br>At the end of September, it was 2.1 per cent, down from 2.2 per cent in June.<br><br>The
               Manpower Ministry (MOM) said among the resident labour force, the 
              unemployment rate was 3.1 per cent, also down by 0.1 percentage point.<br><br>It said in its preliminary estimates for the third quarter, total employment has grown by 24,100 in the quarter.<br><br>This
               brought total employment growth in the first nine months of the year to
               85,500, compared to a flat growth of 100 in the corresponding period of
               last year, due to the global economic downturn. <br><br>MOM said the employment creation came primarily from the services sector, which added 24,100 workers in the quarter.<br><br>Construction employment rose marginally (100) due to the completion of major building projects earlier in the year.<br><br>Manufacturing employment continued to fall (-400), though the decline eased from the previous quarter (-2,300).<br><br>Lynne
               Ng, Regional Director of Adecco South East Asia, said: "It's not 
              surprising to see the service sector adding the majority of new jobs in 
              Q3. This sector has gone through significant change this year, with the 
              opening of so many new hotel and entertainment facilities."<br><br>Ms Ng
               added that companies will continue to hire "sensibly" and that the 
              challenge now for human resource managers is to support their 
              organisation in building its talent base, while supporting budgetary 
              restraints.<br><br>NTUC Deputy Secretary-General Heng Chee How encouraged job seekers to look for jobs in other sectors.<br><br>"If
               I come from the manufacturing sector and I have a skill set that is 
              required by another company in the same industry, then with minimal 
              adjustment, I will be able to go into that job...if job creation in the 
              manufacturing sector is slowing down, whereas job creation in services 
              is robust, then we must explain to people the opportunities that are 
              present also in the non-manufacturing sector."<br><br>MOM said based on 
              preliminary estimates, 1,400 workers were retrenched and 500 had their 
              contracts terminated prematurely, resulting in a total of 1,900 workers 
              made redundant in the third quarter.<br><br>This was lower than the 2,280 workers made redundant in the second quarter.<br><br>With the pick up in the economy, redundancy in manufacturing fell to 900 from 1,220 in the previous quarter.<br><br>Services laid off 900 workers, about the same as the previous quarter.<br><br>Construction displaced 100 workers, compared with 150 in the second quarter of 2010.<br><br>The
               dipping unemployment rate points to a tightening labour market and the 
              labour movement hopes to encourage more seniors to get back into the 
              workforce.<br><br>The NTUC held a job fair for those aged 50 and above 
              which was attended by some 450 people, with some 370 vacancies in the 
              services sector - including positions for kindergarten teachers and 
              cashiers.<br><br>For seniors who may need help to step back in the workforce, a two-day Employability Camp will be available. <br><br>The
               Labour Movement said the camp will equip seniors with "soft skills" to 
              return to the workforce. Mainly for rank-and-file-workers, it could 
              potentially benefit some 186,000 unemployed seniors. The Labour Movement
               said that classes will start once enough people sign up for them.<br> <br>Mr
               Heng adds: "We are looking at the employability camp and customising it
               more to the needs of our seniors - both in terms of the methods of 
              instruction when they go for the training, as well as the particular 
              skills that they would probably find more valuable in helping them to 
              land that job and also to work with people of all ages."<br><br>The 
              programme will help senior job seekers acquire positive and resilient 
              attitudes and also manage inter-generational communication.<br><br>-CNA/wk/ac</span> </span></p>
