              <p>IT and banks in private sectors offer contracts I can understand that, but even the government is following suit. hospitals, schools, government agencies like LTA, etc, even our local universities like NUS, NTU and SMU are offering contracts for employment. I wonder if cleaners also need to sign contracts or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know the rationale for offering contracts like in a recession, if companies need to retrench people, contracts personel are the ones asked to leave first. if you are in your 40s and 50s, and this happens, you are being farked man. how to find your next job at this age and you have a family to feed and mortgage to pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dunno why the government need to follow the private sectors in adopting contracts. private sector pay 6 months bonus, does it mean government also need to pay 6 months bonus to civil servants?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>those companies that are good to work for, wont implement such sucky clauses in their employment contract. because they know, if your heart is not with the company, whats the point of retaining you if you decide to leave them. your position is also not management position. by the way, managers who are to quit, have to serve 3 months notice or pay 3 months pay at your company.</p>

              <p>well they have their own lawyers to deal with this matter, see if they want to pursue or not. if they do, you can seek help from MOM or you hire your own laywer. Alternatively you can seek help from your own MP. your MP can direct help to you or even write a letter to your company for mediation. mostly likely your MP will ask you to approach MOM for help lor.</p>

              <p>more often that not, contracts are used in the banking and finance industry. although other industries also offer jobs on a contractual basis, banking and finance have more contractors than others.</p>
              <p>i think that it's fine to be a contracted staff.. if you are really showing good performance and good team work, you'll have a higher chance of being converted to perm. it also allows the company to evaluate your performance, before deciding if they should extend your contract, converting to perm or letting you go after the contract runs out.</p>

              <p>Quite a bad idea to be in a company that just renew your contract every 2 years. By the time you reach 40. Its the end. They wont renew your contract and you are DEAD. That is my opinion. Contract till 28 probably is still okay. Above 28 its quite scary, given you are probably going to have a family on your own and you risk losing your job any time. =X</p>

              <p>well they have their own lawyers to deal with this matter, see if they want to pursue or not. if they do, you can seek help from MOM or you hire your own laywer. Alternatively you can seek help from your own MP. your MP can direct help to you or even write a letter to your company for mediation. mostly likely your MP will ask you to approach MOM for help lor.</p>
