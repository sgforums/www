              to me , bangla workers are definitely better than cheena man, they can speak english , which cheena cannot. they seldom live in hdb unlike cheena and they dont make so much noise like cheena. they stick to their own groups n dont linger arnd singaporeans too much, also unlike cheena. the fool around with singapore maid is fine wif me coz i don have maid. And banglaâ€™s are very respectful to singaporean, like if theyâ€™re working beside the road, and i have to walk through (im a student btw) theyâ€™ll stop their work and let me walk through without the dust flying around, iâ€™ll normally smile at them and theyâ€™ll smile back. the cheena people sometimes ignore us or even scold me for walking past. then i feel like punching them . a**holes. Also if u notice the coffeeshops, all the cheenas are working at the drink stall, then all the banglas are washing the cups and dishes at the back. of coz the cheenas earn more, i dont understand why ! they all also foreign workers, its nt fair for cheenas to get better job. and im sure banglas would be nicer if they were selling drinks. and even with th langauge barrier, im sure they can pick up one.
              
              i would like your opinions on why cheena workers are treated better by possibly the govt policies and the construction companies that employ them.  why i bring the govt into this is coz govt indirectly have control over the construction companies.
              
              thanks [:

              <p>that time i go woodlands 888 plaza coffeeshop and bought drinks at the counter myself.</p>
              <p>I said "auntie i wan 2 coke pls...."</p>
              <p>She (from cheena) said "Take it yourself ok? its beside u"</p>
              <p>she was pointing to the ones places outside which was not cold. I assumed those placed outside are for the aunties who deliver the drinks to the customers. So since i buy it at the counter myself, I have the right to choose, right?</p>
              <p>She was just lazy to turn 180 degree to open the damm fridge to get the damm coke for me. zzz.....</p>
              <p>I replied "i wan the cold one from the fridge"</p>
              <p>her face change and become attitude.</p>

              i can tell you blangadesh worker is worst than the china worker.
              
              I had seen them with my own eyes.  They like to follow we singapore single mum or ladies even maids when no one is accompany them.
              
              I had so far sent 3 of the worker back to blangadesh which they try to disturb singaporean girl and maids.  I had asked them what the fuck are you trying to do while talking to the maids mdm while the others try to wink at her maids.
              
              I immediate shout at them they know their motive is being exposed. They carry their leg as fast as they could disappear from my spots.
              
              Friend, i shall wait till your family, maids  get rape or molested then you tell me they are the good guy that you support them whatever bad thing they did.

              <p>they are all equally bad.</p>
              <p>some forumers would know my family's backyard and kitchen got totally reworked a little while back. For a few months we had to tah bao everyday and we had a mixed squad of banglas and ah tiongs in the backyard working under a couple of johorean in-charges. </p>
              <p>At least the ah tiongs pretended to work. The banglas, they did not even pretend to work when the boss is not around, they'd lean on one arm against the wall or by the fence with towels on their heads texting and calling on their hps non-stop, you'd think they were conducting bigger businesses than their boss. They'd come asking for water and soft-drinks in english, but when the johor supervisors gave them any instructions in simple english they'd wag their heads and pretend not to understand. So after a while they wer reduced to being gofers and cleaning up jobs. The renovation work on our house was completed two months late, not surprisingly.</p>
              <p>And the goverment wonders about falling productivity, in particular, in the construction industry ? *snorts ....</p>
              <p>And now that work's started on the circle line there are hordes of banglas squatting in the public park behind my house every night. Last time young ladies and school girls used to take the short cut through this park to the next estate in the evenings, but now most of them would take the longer route along the main road instead. With the banglas come the shoals of maids too, I've seen bangla-pinay couples making out at the kid's playground in the park. Some family's gonna lose their MOM deposits soon ....</p>

              i saw the stomp video. you see bangla rape charbo in a  video doesnt mean CHeena doesnt rape charbo what. they probably do too. just u never see or never catch.
              
              If you don't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. aiya its sad la. if u were posted as a construction worker to another country that has very few females of your kind, and you're not allowed to bring any, and you haf to work for years. you have to find pleasure somewhere what. don't blame the workers, blame the government
