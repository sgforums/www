              <p>Well, why not change your point of view? instead of thinking of reasonable or not, just think that since you are quite happy then accept it?</p>
              <p>it depends on situation and the job in future actually.</p>

              <p>What I am trying to explain is that remember you are only starting and you are asking people to give you a chance. If you want to try for another job or wait for the $3k job by all means reject the offer but you will never know if you can ever get it. Everyone is different. Some are lucky, some are not.</p>
              <p>My advice take the job first and wait for another year to jump.</p>

              <p>engineer earn so little meh? i always hear some people say "engineering is the worst course, cos kena cheated by govt, and foreigners take jobs", then also hear others say "engineers get snapped up by banking and a lot of other jobs because they have analytical background, considered smart"</p>

              <p>Usually when your peers start working, they don't mind sharing their start pay with each other because they want to check out the market rate. It is only when you work more than 5 years, people start to be more secretive of their pay because everybody branch out into different pay rates due to company doing better, promotion and better performance. So you may want to ask your peers in the same line what is their start pay. Get an average or mean salary. Don't try to compare to the one who earn the highest. Let say A earns 3k, B earns 2.5k and C earns 2.1k then the average is 2.53k.</p>
              <p>Secondly, pay is not the most important thing. Question you should ask is the following:</p>
              <p>1) Is MNC very reputable company? Is company doing well?</p>
              <p>2) What is their work culture like? Are the colleagues friendly?</p>
              <p>3) Work fits you? Too stress? You like stressful and challenging job?</p>
              <p>4) Increments and bonus? Is company performing well to be giving you increment. What is the industrial increment and bonus?</p>
              <p>5) Find out from peers how your future boss is like? Is he or she autocratic or the free and easy type?</p>
              <p>6) How much leave do you get?</p>
              <p>7) Other fringe benefits? Insurance? Mobile phone? Company car? Finance your part time education?</p>
              <p>8) Location - is the work place too far from where you live. Do you drive? Are you required to travel a lot in the course of your work (If so, do you like to travel?)</p>
              <p>9) Nature of work - do you like the nature of work? Do you want to pursue a career in this line of work? Do you think you can progress far and get promotion somewhere in the future?</p>

              <p>Good thing the mnc never stated below 2.3k for you.</p>
              <p>If you feel happy with the salary, take it.</p>
              <p>What matter most is whether you are happy or not. (salary, the work and the environment)? You need to ask yourself this 3 questions.</p>

              <p>I remember when I started I only could get $1600 per month as an
              assistant engineer as an uni grad.</p>
              <p>What I am trying to explain is that remember you are only
              starting and you are asking people to give you a chance. If you
              want to try for another job or wait for the $3k job by all means
              reject the offer but you will never know if you can ever get it.
              Everyone is different. Some are lucky, some are not.</p>
              <p>My advice take the job first and wait for another year to
              jump.</p>
