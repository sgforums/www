              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Singapore Employers Fire More Workers Than Initially Estimated </span></strong><br> <br> By Shamim Adam<br> <br> June 15 (Bloomberg) -- <span style="color: red;"><strong>Singapore employers
              fired more workers than initially estimated last quarter and total
              employment contracted for the first time in almost six years as
              slumping production and exports led manufacturers to cut jobs.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The Southeast Asian nation’s seasonally adjusted
              unemployment rate rose to 3.3 percent from 2.5 percent in the previous
              quarter, the Ministry of Manpower said today. </strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A record 12,760 were made redundant last quarter, more than an April 30 estimate of 12,600 workers.</span><br> </strong></span> <br> Singapore’s government said last month the nation may have “hit the
              bottom” of its deepest recession since independence in 1965.
              Manufacturers have cut jobs as the island’s exports dropped for 12
              consecutive months in an economy forecast by the International Monetary
              Fund to be Asia’s weakest this year.<br> <br> “Falling external demand has severely affected the manufacturing
              sector,” the government said. “The cutback in the manufacturing
              industry, along with employment losses in the external-oriented
              services industries, more than offset gains in the domestic-oriented
              services and construction sectors.”<br> <br> Employers fired 10,900 workers, and another 1,860 were released from their contracts early between January and March. <span style="color: red;"><strong>The jobless rate is the highest in more than three years,</strong></span> and economists in a central bank survey published last week predict <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>unemployment will reach 4.2 percent at the end of 2009.</strong></span></span><br> <br> The manufacturing industry lost 22,100 jobs, while service industries
              added 7,500 new positions last quarter, the report showed. Construction
              companies hired 8,300 new workers, resulting in a total net loss of
              6,200 jobs in the first three months of 2009, the report said.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Average wages before adjusting for inflation fell 3.7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,</strong></span></span> the ministry said, after rising 2.4 percent in the previous three-month
              period. That was the first decline in 6 1/2 years, the ministry said. <br> <br> ------------------------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>More at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
