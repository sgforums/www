              <p>I am  a 51-year-old unemployed male Singaporean holding a degree in Bachelor of Arts in English Language &amp; Literature.</p>
              <p>I made a serious error of judgment in life and quit my job 
              impulsively in Dec last year without thinking through the consequences 
              and I am now paying a hefty price for the folly. The experience was 
              painful and since that fateful day, the thought of getting a job and 
              putting bread and butter on the table again has been weighing heavily on
               my mind.</p>
              <p>On some nights, I would suddenly woke up breaking out in cold sweat and worrying about my future.</p>
              <p>I am a practical and realistic person. I knew that given my current 
              age and circumstances, I can never expect to find another job which will
               pay me my last drawn salary of $4K again. Recently, I thought of 
              venturing into the social service sector since I am already in the last 
              lap of my working life. However, society was cruel and the doors were 
              all shut on me.</p>
              <p>My greatest disappointment was not being able to get a teaching job 
              with Pathlight School last week. I had applied for an Assistant teacher 
              position with them and after going through a comprehensive interview and
               selection test, my hopes were completely dashed. On the day of 
              receiving the rejection e-mail, my heart really sank to the bottomless 
              pit.</p>
              <p>I knew the husband of my spouse’s church mate who works in the 
              security line after he stopped helping his family in the baking 
              business. This is despite the fact that he has a diploma qualification 
              and is much younger than me.</p>
              <p>I wonder whether if I should do the same and put my tertiary 
              qualification aside. If I decide on this move, I have to conceal my 
              actual qualification, otherwise employers will never want to take me in.
               Morally and ethically I know I would be dishonest.</p>
              <p>So, I am really in a dilemma.</p>
              <p>Regds,</p>
              <p>.</p>

              <p>Just to share what I know from the job market. Alot has been 
              mentioned that the foreigners are here to take away our jobs because 
              they are willing to take lower pay is not true. I know of a certain MNC 
              here who are paying their filipino IT support exec at 4K and their 
              indian FT as HOD IT dept at more than 10K. So do not be fooled by our 
              papies gomin that natives are too choosy in their job hunt, you guys out
               there were all being fooled by the gomin. The reason behind is someone 
              has already planned to buy out all our natives by indirectly forcing 
              them out of this island so their newly created citizens would not only 
              support them but also do not know all the dirty deeds of the past by the
               same gomin. They are just repeating the process to kick out those who 
              knew too much of their background. This is very dirty underhand tactics 
              to destroy its very own citizens just to cling on to power with a new 
              set of citizens.</p>

              <p>You are still lucky to have a job till you decided to quit for 
              whatever reasons. Many of my friends in their mid 30’s and early 40’s 
              are without jobs for long long time. Doing part time or piece rate jobs 
              and surviving on piece rate income.</p>
              <p>Worse on the resume as time go by dont know what to add in. Employer 
              see what is your current jobs and will only consider to offer you a job 
              that is related to what you are doing now or in the same industry over 
              here. This is the fact, as I learned from a guy at e2i, he mentioned in 
              Singapore you need to have a job before you could move to another new 
              offer/job. For FT is the reverse, they are accepted base on without a 
              job.</p>
              <p>Just sharing for the last tens years I have been looking for a 
              permament job, till todate still hunting and writing. But keep asking is
               this wasting time, effort and preservance. Above 50’s the reply are 
              closed to zero. Provided you got contacts. Even SMRT, Hospital, NTUC 
              will not consider you as a full time staff. No doubt much emphasis on 
              reemployment of senior citizen, this are all “air talk” or good 
              publicity campaign. Those HR personnel has not experience and understand
               they will be old someday too.</p>
              <p>Ageism is in all industry and sectors in Singapore. HR likes FT 
              better than local and this true to an extend as they are much cheaper, 
              inline with HR budget as well as they are the innocent baby learning the
               culture, lifestyle and system.</p>
              <p>Now woke up too late and give up looking for jobs</p>

              <p>Hi Patrick</p>
              <p>I am 47. I was previously employed as executive earning gross income 
              of S$4800. But venture into own business and things doesn’t turn out as 
              expected. Try going back but position was being replaced by FT.</p>
              <p>At the meantime, work as security guard and looking for another job.<br> However, the pay hardly can substaintiate my family with all the high 
              costs of living. In order to earn a little more, has been working OT. 
              day and night and now only return home twice or once a week to see my 
              family.</p>
              <p>Do you think those who hired their personal chef to fly in the fresh seafoods from Japan will understand the people’s plights.</p>
              <p>Patrick, if no other jobs avaliable, maybe can temporary take up the security job, whilst hunt for a suitable one.</p>
              <p>I am not worry about myself, I am very worry for my children.</p>
              <p>Good Luck to you and God bless you</p>

              at the many zeros in my bank statement and felt similarly rich.<br> Due to some bad decisions, my business collapsed and I found the many zeros in my bank statement really became zero.<br> I love my industry and work and wanted to look for a salaried job but 
              guess what? Even with 20 over years of experiences; nobody is willing to
               pay me $5K (half of what I used to have ); when they can employ a FT 
              professional for only $2K. And $2k is what I used to earned back in the 
              1980s.<br> After much deliberations and reluctance; I went for a TVL course this 
              year and will be a full fledged Taxi Driver soon. And I’m going to be a 
              Professional Taxi Driver for that matter.<br> Patrick; let’s lift our head high ! We’re not in our 70s yet.<br> It’s never the end of the world and the future can be as bright as we want it to be.<br> Let’s encourage each other to make the ‘impossible’ possible.</p>

              <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
              <p>You need to move on, get over the set back.  I was a Engineer working
               for MNC.  I too was retrenched back in 2005.  Went for interviews, 
              applied for jobs in JobDB.com but interviews after interviews was 
              jobless for 9 months.</p>
              <p>I have a dad, mom, wife and son to feed.  It was a very stressful 9 
              months. Then one of my friend introduced me a job as an Engineer in 
              Indonesia.  I am still working in Indonesia.  I don’t think you’ll be 
              able to find jobs in sinkee land.  Move overseas for better 
              opportunities. Singapore is for foreigners.  Good Luck bro.  Remember 
              next GE no more PAP.</p>

              <p>Patrick,</p>
              <p>I was a lecturer in a private school for more than 10 years.<br> Just like you 8 years ago, I was retrenched and was jobless for about 10 months. I hold a Master in Business Administration.</p>
              <p>I had no choice but work as a Security officer without revealing my 
              qualification for 3 months. My salary was $1,200 pm with OT $1,500 pm</p>
              <p>A good friend introduced me a teaching job in China – Shanghai.<br> I was paid 10,000 yuan per mth with accomodation. I took the challenge, cos I could not survive on $1,500 pm with a kid.</p>
              <p>I am still in China, now a 30% partnership with a Language School and
               happy working here, although my written and oral Chinese is not that 
              good. I go back to Singapore every 3 – 4 months.</p>
              <p>Patrick, You have to be strong ….. move away from Singapore, and work overseas.</p>
              <p>Remember to return to vote out the PAPies in 2016.</p>

              <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
              <p>I’m 53 and kinda did what you did. I got very tired of my job and 
              decided to retire from it. I was in a middle management position making 
              about 70K per annum.</p>
              <p>The difference between you and I is that I did not aggressively hunt for a new job. I knew I would be disappointed and hurt.</p>
              <p>I am now a cabby and had been for 5 years. Not that I am putting it 
              down but I think you are better off driving a cab than being a security 
              guard. First of all, you will be making more. Nett earnings of at least 
              $100 per day is assured if you put in a minimum of 10 hours. In 
              addition, you will have freedom and need not have to take crappy 
              instructions from incompetent superiors. Unlike other vocations where 
              you need to gain the acceptance of your peers, you just do your thing 
              without having to interact with other cabbies at all. Being on the road 
              and listening and engaging in conversations with people from all walks 
              of life, you are also keeping yourself updated all the time.</p>
              <p>Think about it. Let me know if you want to know more. You can contact TRE for my email address.</p>

              <div>Hi Gilbert,</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I am  a fresh graduate with a foreign university honours degree. I 
              have  just finished a 2-month  social work internship (unpaid) and  
              looking for a full time job in social services.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> So far, I have applied to more than 40 jobs and was only shortlisted for 1 interview and 1 programme preview. Sigh…</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>It seems like even a short internship is so hard to obtain here! I 
              also find that MCYS is very biased towards local and Ivy League 
              graduates. From what I know, they seldom hire anyone with a distance 
              learning or overseas degree. Even for positions which do not mind 
              applications from fresh graduates!</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>As I was a private home tutor for many years, my job experience is minimal and previous pay was in the low $1000s only.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I find it so hard to secure an internship, let alone a job! All I asked for was $2000 starting pay. ..</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>My mom will be retiring by next year end the latest and I need at 
              least $2k to support her and myself. My dad is still working as a taxi 
              driver so it is still ok for the time being.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I feel like quitting the social services sector and look for a job in the private sector instead.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I mean, I spent 4 years studying for a honours degree and in the 
              end I cannot secure any permanent job because 99.9% of social services 
              jobs require 1-3 years work experiences in social services, or a social 
              work degree!</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I am so frustrated and angry. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I will also be applying to the Professional Conversion Programme 
              for Social Workers’ Graduate Diploma in Social Work. Hopefully I will 
              get sponsorship and gain employment and a certificate simultaneously.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I will also be applying to NUS for entry into their Graduate Diploma in Social Work.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Hopefully I get employed soon. I am getting tired of applying for jobs and filling up so many job application forms online.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Regards,</div>

              <div><a href="http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/depression-1_3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-20277" title="depression-1_3" src="http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/depression-1_3.jpg" alt="" width="358" height="335"></a>I
               came across your article on hardwarezone forum today….the one on Thomas
               who is doing a $1.6k technician job despite  having a NTU degree.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>First of all, kudos to you for creating this transitioning.org website for the unemployed.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Let me introduce myself…..</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I’m 39 Male Chinese Singapore Citizen. 2.5 years NS and 10 years ICT for the boot…..<img src="http://mail.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo13.gif" alt="X( angry"></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I graduated from Nanyang Technological University in July 1997 with a Bachelor’s degree in Materials Engineering.</div>
              <p>After graduation, my working experience has always  been in the 
              failure analysis and inspection of IC components in various companies.</p>
              <p>I was retrenched in 2010 due to company closure. Ever since,  I have  trouble getting full time jobs.</p>
              <p>I  applied  for diploma entry level   jobs even though  the skillsets required were below those  described in  my resume. </p>
              <p>Yet…I was not called up for interview.</p>
              <p>I’m willing to take a lower diploma pay but yet……forget it.</p>
              <p>My foray  into temp jobs didnt bode well either….I did worked part 
              time in a library  before but I found the pay too low ($4/hour)….so I 
              quit after five  months.</p>
              <p>Imagine a NTU engineering graduate having to go down to such a level 
              is frankly beyond me especially when I started  to study engineering 
              almost two  decades  ago with much optimism.</p>
              <p>What is happening to our country?</p>
              <div>Moreover, the government  won’t be bothered about people like us.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We are the losers.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>WDA and  e2i called up when I was doing part time in the 
              library…..and they assumed I’m fully employed after I told them my part 
              time job! What a joke!</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Subsequently my name was removed from the list  and I guess that’s 
              why unemployment figures are low…. I also heard that those who are out 
              of work for more 6 months are considered retired!</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>How can the unemployment figure be just 2%? Its beyond comprehension…</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When I was working in the library, I chatted with the 
              aunties working there  and  a lot of them told me their sons/daughters 
              also got trouble finding jobs even with a professional degree.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>You might have wondered why those aunties are willing to stick to 
              the library job despite such low pay ($4/hour)? It is only because they 
              can’t find relevant companies  willing  to employ them.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>$4 /hour? It is totally ridiculous and almost like a cleaner’s pay.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>If you think it is an easy job (which many think it is)….try doing it for 5-8 hours standing most of the time.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>According to them…..the agency submitted the lowest bid to 
              NLB…naturally the project was awarded to them because the government 
               always go for the lowest bidder.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Hence…..the low rates.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I guess this also explains why cleaners wages are low too.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We are in serious trouble and yet many people think Singapore is still ok….that’s because they still have cushy jobs.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The influx of FTs in every area has  depressed wages for low income workers and   also deprive our local graduates of good jobs.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The government always say FTs are here to do jobs which Singaporeans don’t wish to do……but what about jobs which we want to do?</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>If you are wondering why I can still survive until now….it is 
              because I have  been frugal all along and I’m still single. If I’m 
              married with kids, most likely I would have ended  up in Bedok 
              Reservoir.</div>
              <p>Anyway, I got a slight favor to ask of you….is it possible to get in 
              touch with Thomas regarding the company particulars for which he is 
              working in?</p>
              <p>I’m more than willing to do a technician job for $1.6k.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much…..and have a nice day!</p>
              <p>Louis</p>

              <p>Thomas came in to see me all perspiring after visiting Caliberlink at Brash Basah Road two hours earlier.</p>
              <p>He also has to return to work at 2.15pm for the second shift of his 
              3-month-old technician job with a MNC. The second shift ends at 11pm but
               Thomas is not complaining.</p>
              <p>It was something that he desperately took up as he didn’t want to go 
              jobless for too long  after he was  retrenched from a lucrative 
              $60,000/year IT engineering position earlier this year.</p>
              <p>He has worked there for six years and was fortunate to come out with a reasonable severance package.</p>
              <p>However, his wife is a home maker and it would be disastrous for two adult family members to go unemployed at the same time.</p>
              <p>He has two primary school-going boys and it was a challenge to make 
              ends meet  if there is no income for a prolonged period  -  to him the 
              technician position was a God-sent.</p>
              <p>“It was also something that kept me going even though the pay is 1/3 
              of what I earned,” he told me when I offered him a drink and tissue to 
              wipe off his perspiration.</p>
              <p>Its true that jobless PMETs who continue working  at lower-end jobs 
              after retrenchment often feel energised and positive than those who 
              simply apply for jobs and wait at home for the phone calls.</p>
              <p>Looking younger than his mid-40s age, Thomas earned his engineering 
              degree from NTU and life was rosy then as the lucrative semi-con 
              industry has just took off and work was plentiful.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, all good things have to come to an end and he was soon retrenched from his engineering job early this year.</p>
              <p>He has sent out numerous job applications as an  angineer but none 
              came back  favourably so when the employment agent advertised for a 
              technician position at $1600/month, he jumped at the offer even though 
              the entry level is only a  diploma.</p>
              <p>“Its more like a production operator job and even below that of a diploma holder,” Thomas told me.</p>
              <p>How long do you want to continue in the job?  I asked.</p>
              <p>“As long as I am still looking for a a permanent  enginnering position,” he replied.</p>
              <p>He knew that his biggest competitiors are cheap thrid-world engineers
               from India, Philippines and India who will flock to our country for as 
              little as $2000/month.</p>
              <p>His current company also hires many technicians  but they are all 
              permanent residents – mostly from India, Philippines and PRC China. They
               all earn around $1600 and below.</p>
              <p>There are also many local diploma holders who just served out their 
              national service working there but the turn over is high as the job is 
              monotonous and does not require  much technical skills.</p>
              <p>Thomas  has tried to request for upgrading courses from a few 
              government aid bodies   in the  nursing and therapist profession but 
              when he was told that the starting entry pay is not more than $1500,  he
               hesitated.</p>
              <p>“I wanted to switch to another  line but it has got to be viable,” Thomas told me.</p>
              <p>After studying full time for more than a year, the entry pay for many
               niche in-demand  fields such as nursing is not attractive enough to 
              convince past high-income engineers like Thomas to make the switch.</p>
              <p>He will continue  to look for engineering jobs but so far the 
              response has being discouraging. as he has being rather selective in the
               positions that he applied for.</p>
              <p>After speaking with Thomas  for about an hour, I must say that I was 
              inspired by his zeal to survive even though he could onlty take  home 
              less than $1200 for his efforts.</p>
              <p>Transitioning has seen close to 500 clients of which at least half are with engineering background.</p>
              <p>Some ended up driving cabs or become property agents even though they
               have engineering degrees from our prestigious local universities.</p>
              <p>The semi-con shut down has truly affected the rice bowls of many of 
              our engineers who took the cue from our government two decades ago to 
              study engineering courses.</p>
              <p>Now, they face the onslaught  of competition from many cheap young 
              engineers hailed from third world countries who could ply their 
              trade here   due to the ease in getting them work permits.</p>
              <p>Looking at Thomas case, I feel that it will be a tall order for him 
              to secure any engineering job despite his qualification and years of 
              relevant experience and even if he manages to find one, the pay will not
               be anywhere near to his previous salary before he was retrenched.</p>
              <p>Unless  the government drastically reduces foreign talents soon, we will see more Thomas running around – jobless and desperate.</p>
              <p>We will also see more undergraduates opting to study the arts and 
              social sciences in universities as this is the best way to gain entry to
               the secured  civil service sector.</p>
              <p>Singapore will  in future face the unpleasant situation of not having
               enough local experienced engineers as currently most of the engineering
               positions are occupied  by foreigners. </p>
              <p>The profession may also be cheapened by foreign hirings who may one 
              day take their experience with them to other developed countries who 
              will treasure their skills more.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hi Gilbert</p>
              <p>Thanks for your time. I’m glad that there’s a place – 
              transitioning.org for the unemployed to get support during this dire 
              period. It’s a fantastic and noble project you’ve started.</p>
              <p>I’m currently in my late 20s and working as a financial consultant with an insurance company.</p>
              <p>I am an Arts graduate from NUS and have been in the finance industry 
              for the past 4 years. Previously,  I  worked with a bank  also as a 
              financial consultant.</p>
              <p>I would not consider myself doing well  in the career and I am seriously considering changing to another job, reasons being:-</p>
              <p>1) This is a fully commission-based job. I am not bringing in enough sales and thus am  not doing well financially</p>
              <p>2) My dad has been feeling frustrated and insecure. He  complained 
              that he has been working his whole entire life and questions when he 
              would get to retire if we are not able to contribute to the household. 
              It’s been a couple of months since I gave my parents any allowance and 
              this irked me alot.</p>
              <p>I have thought through my career options alot lately and  think I can
               understand why I can’t seem to perform in my current job. Then again, 
              appearing to hold a job is better than being unemployed. </p>
              <p>To continue  keeping my job experience relevant, I should head back to the banking and finance industry. </p>
              <p>I worry that my skills and experience would not be viewed favorably 
              by the bank if I continue to stay but still do badly in my current job.</p>
              <p>It seems that looking for a perm banking position is tough nowadays.  </p>
              <p>Then again, I am not sure if I should just take up a temp or contract
               banking position and end up jobless when the contract ends. I would 
              appreciate if I can speak with a career coach on this as I think I need 
              some direction in my career.</p>
              <p>Thanks Gilbert. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
              <p>Yours Sincerely</p>
              <p> Denise</p>

              <p>Mr Fadil was happy when he managed to secure a senior engineer 
              position at a MNC – UGL Services Premas Operations  Ltd late last year.</p>
              <p>He was the engineer in charge of facility management at ITE College West.</p>
              <p>The job  was also paying well  and when  he signed up on the dotted 
              line, he felt confident as the job scope was within his capabilities.</p>
              <p>However, six months later, he was given the sack and his last day was
               on 2 May after failing to clear an extended probationary period on 31 
              March.</p>
              <p>The signs were already ominous when he first stepped into the office.
               Three quarter of the 50-strong workforce are foreigners –  mostly from 
              Philippines, India and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>80% of the technical staff are foreigners.</p>
              <p>They also tend to clique together according to nationality and it is difficult to penetrate into their inner circle.</p>
              <p>Moreover,  two Filipino technical staff who are supposed to assist  
              him are also loaded with their own duties and he was told not to disturb
               them. The Filipinos were so unskilled that they could not even fix a 
              simple aircon problem.</p>
              <p>He ended up carrying out most of the technical  tasks  himself 
              whereas he was under the impression during the interview that he has two
               staff  assisting him. He felt cheated.</p>
              <p>Mr Fadil brought this matter up to his American boss but every time he was told to carry on working alone.</p>
              <p>He was later shocked to be informed  that he was ill-suited for the 
              position of senior engineer after working for a few months and that he 
              would be reassigned.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless,  he was given the merry go round by the respective 
              department heads and realised that the reassignment plan  was just a 
              plot to get him out.</p>
              <p>Feeling chided, Mr Fadil later had  a stormy meeting with the HR 
              manager – ironically a friend who has brought him into the company but 
              who proved to be very unhelpful when he is in need of wise counsel.</p>
              <p>As Singapore struggles with integration in the workforce with many 
              locals fighting to survive in our own country, more can be done to 
              better protect the livelihood of local Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singapore is probably the only ountry in the world that allows 
              foreigners to control the top and middle management echelon at the work 
              place.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are often sandwiched  at the  middle management level 
              and report to a foreigner  boss who often is suspect in his work and 
              qualification.</p>
              <p>Transitioning envisages that stressors at the workplace will boil 
              over in the future with ugly consequences if the ministry does  not look
               into the local-foreigner quota soon.</p>
              <p>Many of the jobs now performed by foreigners can also be carried out by local Singaporeans who are currently jobless.</p>
              <p>Already, many locals have questioned the hiring bias of foreign 
              bosses who tend to hire their own kind and even make things difficult 
              for the local staff so that they will resign on their own.</p>
              <p>Our ministry probably may need to send in spies to the private sector
               to better understand the seriousness of the manpower staffing issue.</p>
              <p>If not, they will end up not knowing what is the real situation on 
              the ground  if they continue to sit in comfort at the their ivory tower.</p>
              <p><strong>Editor’s Note: This interview was conducted last month when 
              the engineer  is still working. He is now no longer  a staff with the 
              company and wish to put the matter behind him. </strong></p>

              <p>i dont think gov is goin to reduce foreign workers unless spore $$$ devaluates to lesser value as to the foreign workers coming to spore.that would be akin to saying unless spore grows to size of indonesia or malaysia....never goin to happen unless a more drastic approach is set by every single sporean.not sure all have that kinda stomach for that type of new drastic change.</p>
              <p>they already done the professionals goin to elsewhere.most indians from inda went to spore..got interview to australia in spore,now earnin big $$$$$ in oz using spore as a stepping stone.indians look like ang mo so they will be much blended in apart from the badly sun burnt ang mo in oz.</p>

              <p>You are still lucky to have a job till you decided to quit for whatever reasons. Many of my friends in their mid 30’s and early 40’s are without jobs for long long time. Doing part time or piece rate jobs and surviving on piece rate income.</p>
              <p>Worse on the resume as time go by dont know what to add in. Employer see what is your current jobs and will only consider to offer you a job that is related to what you are doing now or in the same industry over here. This is the fact, as I learned from a guy at e2i, he mentioned in Singapore you need to have a job before you could move to another new offer/job. For FT is the reverse, they are accepted base on without a job.</p>
              <p>Just sharing for the last tens years I have been looking for a permament job, till todate still hunting and writing. But keep asking is this wasting time, effort and preservance. Above 50’s the reply are closed to zero. Provided you got contacts. Even SMRT, Hospital, NTUC will not consider you as a full time staff. No doubt much emphasis on reemployment of senior citizen, this are all “air talk” or good publicity campaign. Those HR personnel has not experience and understand they will be old someday too.</p>
              <p>Ageism is in all industry and sectors in Singapore. HR likes FT better than local and this true to an extend as they are much cheaper, inline with HR budget as well as they are the innocent baby learning the culture, lifestyle and system.</p>
              <p>Now woke up too late and give up looking for jobs</p>
