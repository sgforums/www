              <p>So many foreigners these days, is your job safe? These are some interesting qns that you may want to ask yourself:</p>
              <p>1) Can a cheapo foreigner do your job?</p>
              <p>2) What is your competitive advantage that makes you hard to replace? If not, what have you done to up your market value?</p>
              <p>3) If your pay is above 5k, are you justifying your salary? If you work for example as an investment banker in a big bank, then chances are your employers will not easily go for cheapo foreigners. If engineering, then good luck.</p>
              <p>4) What happens if one day your salary reaches 10k? What makes you think a younger and hungrier grad will not replace you? Unless you are in professions where old is gold, for eg: pilot</p>
              <p>5) To invalidate all of the above, join the civil service. You are free from foreign competition, or if not, most of it.</p>

              <p>Hmmm I never saw it that way. It was more like a presentation of viewpoints from various angles. Not selling anything either. This having worked in the civil service for a year. Some morons stay on for years with fat pay but contribute little. And $$ is not a factor since the govt bankrolls it. In the private sector, if your pay gets too high, your bosses will be looking to cut costs. It's very different in civil service.</p>

              <p>1) it depends. Like when I stayed in Australia, I hated those stupid migrant indians from india (in contrast to msian n sporean indians), they are rude and don't know how to do their job. My family and I was vacationing there, we had big lugagges so we specifically engaged a taxi that is a hatchback. The stupid indian driver never even bother to help us with the luggage - lazy. Just stood there while we struggled with our bags. Then I boarded a tram but took the wrong one, I ask the indian driver where is this street, he say he don't know, then I got off and he sped off. After I got off, I looked at the tram sign and found out the street is within his tram route, Stupid indian driver. No wonder the Aussies hated the indians there and beat them up. Sorry to say, some of my best friends are indian msians and sporeans, and i like to work and hang out with them, but those educated indian migrants from india that came to Australia, they are lazy and unfriendly.</p>
              <p>2) Sporeans are much more hardworking than anybody in SEA. So that's your competitive advantage. Have you work with malays in malaysia? You should then you can see the vast difference.</p>
              <p>3) If your pay is above 5k, you better be a long service staff. Not a job hopper. The only way you can justify that is by promotion. There are pay ranges for executives and managers. To job hop is to exclude yourself for any any potential promotion. Companies only promote long service staffs.</p>
              <p>4) If your salary reach 10k, be prepared to be seconded overseas. usually employers won't keep you here if your salary is high. You may be asked to lead an office overseas. Be ready to go to under-develop countries. However China is always the best alternative for singaporeans.</p>
              <p>5) Civil service? If you are qualified.</p>

              <p>med oil is right!only a few old timer jobs are not affected.currently those spore jobs that cant be modernised and uses a nut a bolt type of jobs that even the edcuated foreigners shun due to lack of future and prospects.</p>
              <p>most foreigners who are educated normally go for top notch high end technology sectors.</p>
              <p>such equipment they usedaily would be lasers,ion implanters,ion genearators,motor ENCODERS,advanced manufacturing systems and designs which accounts for most countries rewARDING high reaping GDP sectors.those nut n bolt sai kang or welding jobs dont give much value to any economy even in the darkest parts of africa.</p>
