              <p><br>Job hunters are often told they should never 
              settle for less than what they want. We hear the mantra again and again:
               Go after your dreams! If you don't absolutely love a job, it's not 
              worth your time. No compromises!</p>
              <p>The problem is that in today's 
              economy, any job, even one that's less than ideal, is a scarce 
              commodity. And the dream-job imperative puts a lot of pressure on people
               who don't yet know what their dream job is. That's why some job seekers
               are now rejecting that wisdom and singing a different tune:  Get a job 
              as soon as possible, and look for the dream job later.</p>
              <p>If you find yourself in this predicament, trying to decide whether to accept a less-than-perfect opportunity, <strong>here are several reasons why (temporarily) settling can be a good move for your career:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Settling can build confidence.</strong> Working at a job you don't particularly love is difficult. But here's 
              the good news: Discovering, in a hands-on, five-days-a-week way, that 
              you are capable of doing difficult tasks--and maybe even doing them 
              well--is a tremendous confidence booster.</p>
              <p>[See <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=13578di18/**http%3A//money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2010/10/08/cant-find-work-get-a-survival-job.html">Can't Find Work? Get a "Survival Job"</a>.]</p>
              <p><strong>Settling keeps your options open.</strong> It's important to maintain the distinction between giving up on your 
              dreams and taking a job to pay your bills. Paying bills is important. 
              Debt is one of the biggest dream-killers around. Debt boxes you in, and 
              may even make you less employable. So look at taking a job to pay your 
              bills as another way to work toward your goals.</p>
              <p><strong>Settling makes you better at whatever you do.</strong> Even a position that seems light years away from your dream job is an 
              opportunity to learn important transferable skills. Look for those 
              opportunities, because those skills will come in handy later. If you're 
              new to the work world, chances are your "how to work" skills like 
              functioning in a team, meeting deadlines, and following through could 
              use polishing.</p>
              <p><strong>Settling allows you to be flexible.</strong> The 
              problem with the no-compromise approach to careers is that it doesn't 
              take into account shifting priorities, setbacks, time outs, acts of God,
               and the economy--in other words, the fluid nature of life. When faced 
              with the unexpected, the last thing you need is to struggle with the 
              "thou must not swerve" mantra.</p>
              <p>[See <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=13t73g6qp/**http%3A//money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/11/01/5-reasons-your-co-worker-makes-more-money-than-you">5 Reasons Your Co-Worker Makes More Money Than You</a>.]</p>
              <p><strong>Settling puts you in a position of strength.</strong> It's cliche, but true: Finding a job is easier when you have a job. 
              Accepting a "lesser" opportunity while continuing to search for "the 
              one" may be challenge, but it can be smart, too.</p>
              <p><strong>Settling is only bad when you allow it to kill your dream.</strong> If you look at each job as a stepping stone, as a strategic move 
              designed to enhance your employability, expand your network, fine-tune 
              your skills, and pay your bills, it may just turn out to be the smartest
               career move you've ever made.</p>

              <p>Let's
               face it: every life path involves a detour or two. Or three. While it's
               useful to have a road map, we can't predict at the beginning of our 
              journey exactly how we're going to get to where we want to go. All we 
              know for sure is that there will be wrong turns, flat tires, bumpy 
              roads, happy accidents, lucky breaks, and triumphs. Use flexibility and 
              resilience to your advantage. And who knows? Someday, looking back, you 
              may realize that "getting there" was the best part.</p>
              <p>Besides, is 
              there really such a thing as a dream job, one that makes you jump out of
               bed every morning singing tra-la-la? Most of us find that every job is a
               crazy mixture of what we love, what we like, and a few undesirable 
              tasks that remind us what's really important for our next job hunt.</p>
