            <div class='col-md body'>basically we had a first serious talk in years, abt my future path. for some reason we started talking abt where i wanna go in life and what i wanna do.<br><br>he started off by rambling abt if i wanna drive ferraris, lamborghinis...porsches...i must go marketing. if i am happy with taking bus everyday and squeezing with others in the bus, go ahead with my own choice.<br><br>he says marketing can make lots of money. reminds me of waht he said abt biotech and shares. he was 'spot on'.  then i replied with my choice and why i didnt wanna do those choices he made etc. and it hit some raw nerves. both of us/<br><br>i mean, measure everything by money ? i rather die.<br><br>my dad has this uncanny ability to make sure i lose confidence in my decisions, no matter how well thought out it is. nothing unusual, throughout my life, i've nvr been given decision making. all ruthlessly stifled. the choice to place biotech at poly was his, not mine and now he makes it look as if he's the victim<br><br>he always tells me he's ahead of me in life. true. but he always say if i dont follow his decisions, i will regret it. and he always chooses the ugly side of the choices i made and the beautiful side of his choices.<br><br>from aeronautical engineering to chemistry at poly lvl to psychology at degree lvl. all knocked out by his so called ' suggestions". i too, arrived at the same conclusion for some choices, albeit with different reasons.<br>i wont list the reasons out here because i am afraid it will hurt some of the forumites here who are taking or is working in relevant fields.<br><br>he concluded with the statement that he said it once and will not be saying it again. up to me to choose.<br><br>technically this is throwing the ball into my court or throwing me the hot potato and walking away. but truely, this is the case in life.<br><br>i am not say, confused over whether shld i go forensics which is my strong choice or take his suggested path, rather it's waht he said.<br><br>ppl tell me, hang on to yr choices and dont give a sh|t abt others' suggestions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Ah bis,<br><br>After reading your post, I seem to be able to draw some parallels with you, yet not totally the same.<br><br>Our parents may already have certain mis-conceptions, or otherwise known as mindset, of certain degrees and vocations, may it be due to personal experiences, or from talk with friends and relatives. It sure is good to listen to what he has to offer, but in the end, the work/field you are going into should rightfully be your own choice.<br><br>Talk is cheap, actions speak louder than words.<br><br>What do I mean by that? Do communicate with your parents (I suppose you do, otherwise you won't post that entry <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) more and listen to what they feel/think about certain degrees/courses/fields which you are interested in. If they have negative views, learn more about the fields you are interested in, and sell the good points to them.<br><br>In the end, the choice should be up to you to make, as, the future is yours to decide. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Regards,<br>Ah Death <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
