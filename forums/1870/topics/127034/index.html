And when you are not ready to commit, you could end up regretting it<br><br>SOMETIMES, timing rather than love decides who we end up being with - or without.<br><br>Only some lucky people marry the loves of their lives. The rest marry the most suitable person who comes along when they are ready to settle down.<br><br>A friend in his 20s came to this conclusion after confiding in me that he had recently met a woman who is more attractive than his wife, and so occupies his thoughts more often than his wife does.<br><br>'If only I had met her before I got married,' he said wistfully.<br><br>But I think even if the love of one's life appears when one is single, one may not be in the right frame of mind to recognise him or her as such.<br><br>And then love passes by.<br><br>Life is littered with near misses and lost opportunities.<br><br>I attended my ex-boyfriend's wedding last month, which triggered many memories.<br><br>We met five years ago when I was 23 and he 31. It was love at first sight.<br><br>He had an established career, was down-to-earth and steadfastly religious.<br><br>I was then working as an air stewardess and my head was - literally and metaphorically - in the clouds.<br><br>I was also - well, let's put it this way - not religious.<br><br>Despite our differences, we were soulmates. We had the same quirky sense of humour and shared long, intense overnight conversations.<br><br>But human nature is perverse. When someone is excessively nice to us, we start taking things for granted, instead of appreciating them even more.<br><br>He had everything I could want in a husband - except that I was not looking for one at that moment. A boyfriend was all I could cope with then.<br><br>I loved fast cars, danced wildly at Zouk and took off on shopping holidays at a whim. My life revolved around I, me and myself.<br><br>In the six months that we were together, he popped the question several times and talked ad nauseam about having children. He wanted us to enrol for a Christian marriage preparation course.<br><br>Yes, I did often fantasise about a Vera Wang wedding gown, but I was at that stage of my life when I was more interested in Guess than Baby Guess.<br><br>And where - dare I admit it? - I still wanted to meet other men.<br><br>So I was a 23-year-old with the emotional maturity of a 13-year-old. Responsibility? Wasn't that for adults?<br><br>In short, I met Mr Right at the wrong time.<br><br>The more he talked about marriage and religion, the more I felt pressured and the more pressured I felt, the more irritable I became.<br><br>The calls stopped finally after a year. Now and then, we say 'Hi' via e-mail.<br><br>I had a few painful relationships after that. Served me right, i think.<br><br>I missed the tenderness of my ex and began having second thoughts.<br><br>Perhaps I also felt more urgency to find someone marriageable before my biological clock reached zero hour. It dawned on me that I am not a pixie like Peter Pan who can flit around forever. One day, I'd wake up sick and alone when my fair weather friends flit away.<br><br>But I was too proud and too unsure of my ex's reaction to call him until last year.<br><br>The first thing he told me excitedly was that he had found The One. My heart tumbled to my feet. So, that's Fate.<br><br>If only I could turn back time. If only I had met him later. If only... what feeble words.<br><br>Sometimes, when the nights get lonely, I toy with the idea of marrying a platonic friend of mine, who often assures me earnestly that, if the worst comes to the worst, he'd be willing to marry me.<br><br>I have already made one mistake. I should not make another by settling for second best merely for the sake of getting hitched - only to regret it soon after.<br><br>Hopefully, the best is not over but yet to be.<br><br></div>

You did not see wrongly. In fact, many people would find the above statement absurd. How can anyone continue to love that somebody after the betrayal? More than once somemore. *Faint*<br><br>Fact is, I would do so too. Being a true-blue Scorpio, a betrayal would amount to me hating you for the rest of our lives (depending on who gets to live longer). Therefore, I'll be the last person on earth to forgive anybody who did me wrong, let alone agreeing with Ms Huang. However, I'll have to agree with her on this statement.<br><br>If you were to truly love someone, you will be able to accommodate his / her every fault. Even though infidelity is considered the ultimate betrayal, you will still be able to forgive that person somehow or another. This is not being noble. This is being blind in the face of love. This is the<br>epitome of <span style="color: red;">True Love</span>.<br><br>Of course, true love does not exist for most people. Therefore, many would choose the easiest way out - leave the party at fault.<br>On the other hand, one could also argue that you should not betray someone you love right?<br><br>However, the question is not whether should you betray your lover in the first place or not. The question is whether will you forgive someone who has betrayed you before. Therefore, I feel that people will be blind enough to accommodate every faults of their lovers, if they truly love them.<br><br>In the end, there are only so much a person can tolerate. If your partner did you wrong once and again, it may not be worth your while to stay with them any longer. No matter how much you love them, the love is surely not being reciprocate. This will be the view of a third party.<br><br>For the lovelorn, all is forgiven regardless of what has happened.<br>Haha. This is life for you. Nothing is really fair in this world. So there is no need to complain.<br><br>Me? I'm not mere mortal. These sort of things do not bother me at all<br></div>
