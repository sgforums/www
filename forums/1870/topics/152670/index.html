            <div class='col-md body'>Yea...learnt it the hard way...<br><br>Realised that another guy had feelings for this girl I liked, and actually had a headstart in letting her know his feelings, even though he came into the picture later, whilst I was still wondering whether I really liked her or was it just friendliness towards me. I had even suspected of him liking her for some time, and I did tell her...but never did I tell her my true feelings. Now, he's in the picture, I'm not.<br><br>And the revealation...hurts.<br><br>And she said that we'll still be friends even though it has become like this, even though you won't know what happens in the future.<br><br>He was faster in declaring, whilst I was not. There's something between them, which I did not know.<br><br>But deep down inside, I felt hurt and a pang of jealousy strike through me. Could not entertain the thought of her holding hands with another guy. Yet, this is the outcome.<br><br>Felt really stupid, really lousy, and really angry with myself (that's why I'm posting here)<br><br>I guess we do learn from life, we learn from expressing our true feelings, yet, I've been hurt. I resisted myself from telling her my true feelings as I felt I needed to know her more, but I guess I was <strong>wrong</strong>. Whoever says it first, gets the higher rank of being chosen.<br><br>And I'm now down to 2nd fiddle. Yea.<br><br>I'll be hurt for a couple of days, months, but I guess I'll be alright. School is a place to heal wounds? Would it? Or would it just leave me more stressed and re-open the wound in my heart?<br><br>~ah Death<br></div>
