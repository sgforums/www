            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Aries Employee Profile</span><br>==================<br><br>Aries employees make excellent troubleshooters.<br><br>They'll usually want to be out in the field at a variety of<br>different<br>work sites fixing things. They certainly won't be happy for very<br>long behind a desk in a 9 to 5 schedule.<br><br>The bored Aries employee who has been forced into a square<br>hole will typically be restless, angry, and careless with details.<br>No amount of money would compensate for being stuck in a<br>routine job. Money in fact isn't why they are working at all.<br>They do want to be paid fairly and need a status position to<br>satisfy their competitive tendencies--<br>but even more importantly, they'll want challenging new<br>projects. They typically like to have a sense of responsibility<br>and need to feel needed. In return, they'll give their all and<br>provide detailed, consistent work. They will literally work<br>themselves to exhaustion to prove themselves.<br><br>If you want to keep your Aries co-worker productive and happy,<br>you'll want to give them the opportunity to work independently<br>or let them help and lead less experienced workers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Libra Employee Profile<br>==================</span><br><br>Libra employees are detailed, dedicated workers with<br>sensitive natures. Managers and co-workers sometimes<br>find them difficult to get a handle on. They pick up the<br>energy of the office and are unable to prevent it from<br>affecting them. Loud noise, flashy colors, and discordant<br>vibrations will put them off so much that they will have<br>difficulty fulfilling their obligations at work.<br><br>One day they may seem like the most bright, hardworking,<br>ambitious employee around. The next day they might be<br>down, irritated, and unable to produce. Co-workers<br>shouldn't fret when Libra employees are in a dark mood.<br>It really won't last, as a happy state of mind can come over<br>them just as quickly. When Libra employees are in a<br>balanced frame of mind, they can be a powerful presence<br>at work-they have a way of gracing everything they touch.<br>Underneath that mess of moods, they really are basically<br>happy and stable people. They are capable of profound<br>logical thought and evaluate all sides of a situation before<br>acting. They are one of the most intelligent Signs around.<br><br>They are expert researchers and mediators. And their<br>sensitivity to their environment makes them naturals at<br>keeping things looking great.

Managers and co-workers sometimes<br>find them difficult to get a handle on. They pick up the<br>energy of the office and are unable to prevent it from<br>affecting them. Loud noise, flashy colors, and discordant<br>vibrations will put them off so much that they will have<br>difficulty fulfilling their obligations at work.</strong><br><br>One day they may seem like the most bright, hardworking,<br>ambitious employee around. The next day they might be<br>down, irritated, and unable to produce. Co-workers<br>shouldn't fret when Libra employees are in a dark mood.<br>It really won't last, as a happy state of mind can come over<br>them just as quickly. When Libra employees are in a<br>balanced frame of mind, they can be a powerful presence<br>at work-they have a way of gracing everything they touch.<br>Underneath that mess of moods, they really are basically<br>happy and stable people. They are capable of profound<br>logical thought and evaluate all sides of a situation before<br>acting. They are one of the most intelligent Signs around.<br><br>They are expert researchers and mediators.
