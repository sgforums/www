But cannot control the actions others. A person would expect others not to accost him with an annoyance. And vice versa.<br>And therefore this Do-On-To-Others philosophy, is preached by sages through out the ages of humanity.<br><br>And you are right, there are people who do not play by the rules. Or have a "misguided" intrepretation of the philosophy. Thats their choice. They are never happy people to begin with, thats why they spread the discomfort. These people are to be avoided.<br><br>As for other aspects of living, like career advancement, this rule still apply as to interpersonal transactions. And this of course is to be weighed against strategy and politics of the work place.<br><br>This mantra is to help in getting along with others in society. It is not a magic capsule to a perfect life.<br><br>As for accumulating wealth, another philosophy is required.<br><br>You need to compile them as they come to you.<br><br>Thats er.......<br><br>philosophy.</div>
