You have already made up ur your mind that my philosophy is wrong. Isn't improving yourself a learning process? We all need a good philosophy in life no doubt , but like i said . Environment and also the intelligence of a person is a factor. How do you even show or teach him a good philosophy when he doesn't have the experience or that level of intelligence to comprehend. You speak of trying to dry yourself in the pool. Now which intelligent person doesn't know you cant dry urself  while in water.<br><br>You too assume too much about the lack of wisdom , intelligence ,  experience and comprehension of maybe me for example to come to that conclusion.<br><br>Anyways . . Its tiring and tedious to explain or share my views when you have no intention of reading in more detail or understanding my point of view. You have already made your decision.</div>

Then people reading will be able to see the advantages and disadvantages of having a philosophy like yours.<br><br>Sure, experience and level of intelligence play a part but his thread is not discussing level of intelligence and experience.<br><br>The whole point of this thread is to consider the various philosophies that people have and hopefully people can pick up some tips.</div>

But its what that made me more successful in all areas . Like i am willing to go low to succeed. If you want to point flaws which i dont mind, then direct the pointing to my philosophy rather then my personal character as a whole -<br><br>If you truly have the heart to want to help and give tips, you do so not only just a philosophy but as how it came about based on the circumstances , reasons , choices, character , intelligence , experience etc etc. As a whole . Does.nt it help people more when there are more information given out to be considered and a better understanding of why people make the choices tuidy make hence a certain kind of philosophy adopted in life?<br><br>Anyways . . I end my thoughts here.  If i am rm wrong please point out and i will read and think about it at my leisure. : )</div>
