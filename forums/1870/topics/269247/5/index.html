But cannot control the actions others. A person would expect others not to accost him with an annoyance. And vice versa.<br>And therefore this Do-On-To-Others philosophy, is preached by sages through out the ages of humanity.<br><br>And you are right, there are people who do not play by the rules. Or have a "misguided" intrepretation of the philosophy. Thats their choice. They are never happy people to begin with, thats why they spread the discomfort. These people are to be avoided.<br><br>As for other aspects of living, like career advancement, this rule still apply as to interpersonal transactions. And this of course is to be weighed against strategy and politics of the work place.<br><br>This mantra is to help in getting along with others in society. It is not a magic capsule to a perfect life.<br><br>As for accumulating wealth, another philosophy is required.<br><br>You need to compile them as they come to you.<br><br>Thats er....... philosophy.</div></blockquote>I see that you have simply gloss over the issues of "people who do not play by the rules. Or have a "misguided" intrepretation of the philosophy."<br><br>I guess that is one way to do it, simply gloss over it... that is how delusions starts in people's mind, IMHO  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It is better to confront issues head on, and find the answers.<br><br>Another thing about this "philosophy" of doing unto others....<br><br>If I would like others to give me a million dollars to me for no reasons (that would make me really happy), then I should give a million dollars to others? Therefore if I do not want to give away a million dollars, I should also not want people to give me a million dollars?<br><br>This type of "philosophy" is too lose to be of use. There are too many unanswered questions and too many open interpretations. Try again bah....</div>

What happens when your faith comes into conflict with "work smart"?<br><br>For example, when you are asked to negotiate on behalf of the company and you "manage" your boss as well as "manage the other party". By manage I mean, you might for example hide certain things from your own boss and "lie" to your opposite party that your boss said somethings when it was you that said it so that both parties come to an agreement and both think that they won!<br><br>Actually it was all your doing and you were simply working smart.<br><br>Many "Faiths" frown at this type of "sheninigans" and expect "honesty" "openness" and the like. Whereas if you do not put yourself under any beliefs, you can do the necessary according to your rational analysis of how best you should handle the situation (work smart).<br><br>So basically two questions: Why put yourself under certain beliefs system for dubious gains and what do you do when your faith comes into conflict with "work smart"?</div>

Be able to control.. maybe we are not yet able to totally comprehend it. Thats why , dont you want to go there ? If you are able to.

You talk about "right living", "repentance" and "fighting temptations".<br><br>In which case maybe you can answer this question I asked in response to another post.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">What do you say to people that says "having a Faith" is just putting yourself under a system of beliefs and restrict your personal freedom for dubious rewards?<br><br>What happens when your Faith comes in conflict with reality? What happens when your faith comes into conflict with "work smart"?<br><br>For example, when you are asked to negotiate on behalf of the company and you "manage" your boss as well as "manage the other party". By manage I mean, you might for example hide certain things from your own boss and "lie" to your opposite party that your boss said somethings when it was you that said it so that both parties come to an agreement and both think that they won!<br><br>Actually it was all your doing and you were simply working smart.<br><br>Many "Faiths" frown at this type of "sheninigans" and expect "honesty" "openness" and the like. Whereas if you do not put yourself under any beliefs, you can do the necessary according to your rational analysis of how best you should handle the situation (work smart).<br><br>So basically two questions: Why put yourself under certain beliefs system for dubious gains and what do you do when your faith comes into conflict with "work smart"?</div></blockquote></div>
