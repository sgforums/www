            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Guilmon1987,<br><br>You should be aware that this thing has been going on for almost 4 1/2 years already. Whatever sparks that the both of you may have initially may be gone, since none of you made any move during that period. She may even be sick of you not making any moves till now. There is no reason to wait for you right? Given that both of you are eligible....and single.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh no! This is very bad! I remembered just before I called her I SMSed her. It went like that,<br><br>Me: Sleep Already?<br><br>Then no reply... After a while, I also thought she wouldn't reply, since I tried that before, so I...<br><br>Me: Blah... Nevermind... Go Sleep lah...<br><br>Then immediately got reply,<br><br>She: Nope.. Why..?<br><br>Then I called her...<br><br>But, I just remembered if she is on another line, it wouldn't be possible to type an SMS and be on another line at the same time... There's only a few senarios...<br><br>1 ) She doesn't want to talk to me.<br><br>2 ) She is angry I sounded so childish.<br><br>3 ) She is using another phone.<br><br>4 ) She hang up, to entertain me for a while.<br><br>5 ) 1st time, I called her... didn't know what to say.<br><br>Die die die... I dunno... what if she angry? I really dunno how she thinks... The week before, when I bid her good night... She even send back a friendly message saying she missed me... then the week b4 that... She even send me a message saying how I was special in her heart.... Why she like to keep entertaining me? And her MSN nick suggests that she has some love problems... I dunno if its due to me... or some other guy... but if its some other guy shouldn't they be dating happily already... since there's nothing I can really do to stop them?<br><br>Oh ya, I need to make sure she is free, so that I can call her the next time, any tips to do that?</div>
