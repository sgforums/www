            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Halls of horror ...report taken from Sunday times 06/03/05.</span><br><br>What lurks in darkened cinemas? Plenty of ghost tales, as LifeStyle finds out<br>By Karl Ho<br><br>IT IS the last show of the night and all is quiet inside the cinema hall save for the steady drone of dialogue emanating from the screen.<br><br>WHO'S THAT GIRL?: Among the wild tales of cinema 'ghosts' is that of a 'little girl' and the toys she leaves behind.<br><br>A little girl sits in the front row of the hall, alone. All of a sudden, she giggles wildly.<br><br>Her features are indistinct, shrouded by the darkness.<br><br>But when the lights come on later, the little girl has disappeared. The only evidence of her existence? A clutch of toys left behind on the seat.<br><br>Or so the story goes.<br><br>Cinemas, it seems, are not just favourite haunts of the living, but also the dead.<br><br>Any movie-goer worth the salt in his popcorn would have heard of the myriad supernatural tales revolving around Singapore's cinemas.<br><br>One of the more prevalent legends currently being circulated in Internet chatrooms like forum.aiomobile.com is of the 'little girl' in Golden Village Plaza's multiplex at Plaza Singapura.<br><br>Apparently, she has been spotted sitting in the front row of cinema halls 7 and 10 during the first and last shows of the day.<br><br>Story has it that cinema staff would find toys in these two halls. When they leave the toys by the exits at the end of the night, the toys would be gone the next morning - yet reappear in the front seat after the last show the same night.<br><br>Like any other urban myth, this one changes with every retelling.<br><br>Movie industry insiders LifeStyle spoke to gave differing takes on the creepy tale and its origins.<br><br>One version has it that gynaecological and paediatric clinics once occupied the space where the halls now stand.<br><br>Abortions were said to have taken place there, hence stories about patrons hearing sounds of children playing in the background during screenings.<br><br>In fact, taller tales have it that priests have performed cleansing rituals in the hall.<br><br>Armed with this information, LifeStyle set out to investigate.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Our own ghosthunt</strong></span><br><br>SO, IS the ghost of a little girl really lurking in GV Plaza Singapura?<br><br>For the final leg of our investigation, LifeStyle went ghosthunting on Feb 15 and 16, watching the first and last shows of both cinemas 7 and 10.<br><br>I sat in the third row of both halls hoping to spot anything unusual in front.<br><br>But, sorry folks, there was no little girl, no toys, no giggles, nothing.<br><br>In fact, movie-goers on those two days might have been spooked by me instead: Seated in front and turning my head back and forth frequently, I must have looked like Linda Blair in The Exorcist.<br><br>What scared me was not the prospect of chancing upon the elusive young apparition, but the fact that up to 40 people - mostly couples - had actually paid to watch the 9.50 pm screening of the atrociously bad movie Racing Stripes at cinema 10 on Feb 15.<br><br>The movie features talking animals and revolves around a zebra which aspires to be a racehorse.<br><br>Movie patrons interviewed at those screenings also dismissed the urban legend as rubbish.<br><br>'I'm still going to watch movies in 7 and 10,' said make-up artist Rosalind Foo.<br><br>Indeed, even supernatural buffs like writer Lim doubted the GV ghost story.<br><br>'I don't think ghosts can leave tangible things like toys behind. And how can the sighting times be so accurate?' he said.<br><br>'It's one thing to have a weird feeling that you've seen something. But when you can say for sure that it's a girl but still not pinpoint any further details about her, then the story's suspect.'<br><br>On Feb 18, LifeStyle invited the Singapore Paranormal Investigators' Mr Goh to watch the 2.10am screening of action movie Flight Of The Phoenix at cinema 7.<br><br>Again, there was no close encounter with the spiritual kind, though Mr Goh told us he enjoyed his free movie.<br><br>'I was looking around and counting the number of people going in or out of the theatre and there wasn't any extra girl or anything,' he said.<br><br>'Maybe she'll turn up when the cinema shows a horror movie,' he quipped<br><br><span style="color: black;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GOLDEN Village's theatres are not the only ones subjected to urban legends.<br><br>Film-maker Kelvin Tong recalled how there were stories about Shaw Organisation's now-defunct Capitol cinema in Stamford Road.<br><br>'Women who were menstruating were warned not to use its female toilet because the smell of blood would attract an old pontianak,' he said. Pontianak refers to a female vampire in Malay.<br><br>A former Cathay Organisation employee who declined to be named said that the old Cathay cinema and The Picturehouse at Handy Road gave her the creeps.<br><br>'No matter how many lights they put there, the corridors and walkways at the cinemas were always very gloomy. I found myself dashing out of the place whenever I was the last one at work,' she said.<br><br>Cathay, Singapore's first air-conditioned cinema, opened in 1939. It closed in July 2000 together with the adjoining art-house theatre Picturehouse.<br><br>During World War II, the old Cathay housed Japanese military propaganda offices. Heads of beheaded looters were also displayed in nearby Dhoby Ghaut by the Japanese during the Occupation.<br><br>Spokesmen for both Shaw and Cathay laughed out loud at the stories.<br><br>Mr Mark Shaw, senior manager of Shaw Organisation, said that he had not seen anything out of the ordinary at the old Capitol.<br><br>A spokesman for Cathay said it was rubbish that the old Cathay cinema was spooked.<br><br>Other tales haunt other cinemas.<br><br>Freelance projectionist Nicholas Joseph, who has been in the business since 1968, said that he spotted a 'shadow of a young girl' in the projection room of a movie theatre in Tanjong Katong where a friend was working. The theatre has since closed.<br><br>'I won't say if I believe in such things or not. But if such things do exist, you don't disturb them, they don't disturb you,' he added.<br><br>Mr Charles Goh, the co-founder of Singapore Paranormal Investigators (SPI), said that another popular myth is of cinemas saving theatre seats for 'hiah di'.<br><br>'Hiah Di' is Hokkien for brothers, but can also be used as a term of respect for spirits.<br><br>'The ticket auntie at old theatres had floor plans and would mark out the seats we chose in blue crayon. But there would be seats marked in red,' he said. 'And when I sat close to these seats, I would find them chained up.'<br><br>The SPI is a group that researches into the supernatural.<br><br>Cinema operators explained to LifeStyle that, yes, some seats are 'reserved' in their multiplexes.<br><br>But there's a simple and down-to-earth reason for this: The seats are for last-minute emergencies, such as relocating patrons - living ones - who discover they have faulty seats, or when one seat has been assigned to two people.<br><br>This was especially common in the past when seat allocation was done using paper plans and pens instead of being computerised, as they are today.<br><br>Added Mr Shaw: 'I sure hope there are no ghosts in them because I use these 'house seats' sometimes.'<br><br></div>
