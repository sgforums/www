            <div class='col-md body'>He met her on a party, she was so outstanding, many guys chasing after her,while he was so normal, nobody paid attention to him.<br><br>At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him, she was surprised, but due to polite, she promised.<br><br>They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything, She felt uncomfortable, she thought, please, let me back home..s<br><br>Suddenly he asked the waiter: "Would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee."<br><br>Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red, but, still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it.<br><br>She asked him curiously: "Why you have this hobby?"<br><br>He replied: "When I was a little boy, I was living near the sea, I like playing in the sea, I could felt the taste of the sea, salty and bite, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee. I will think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who still living there." Saying that, tears filled his eyes.<br><br>She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell out his homesick, he must be a man loves home, cares about home, has responsibility of home..<br><br>Then she also started to talk, talked about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story.<br><br>They continue to date. She found actually he was a man who meets all her demands: he was tolerance, kind hearted, warm, careful...he was such a good guy but she almost missed him!<br><br>Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story: "The princess married to the prince, then they were living the happy life..." And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as she knew that's the way he liked.<br><br>After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter which said:<br>"My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my whole life lie. This was the only lie I said to you----the salty coffee.<br><br>Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It's hard for me to change so I just go ahead.<br><br>I never thought that could be the start of our communication! I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything..<br><br>Now I'm dying, I afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee, what a strange bad taste but I have the salty coffee for my whole life since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you.<br><br>Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for the second time, I still want to know you and have you as my whole life wife, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again."<br><br>Her tears made the letter totally wet.<br><br>Someday, someone asked her: what's the taste of salty<br>coffee?<br><br>"<span style="color: cyan;">It's sweet</span>."<br>She replied.</div>
