            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Just wanna share my experience in Yoshi to everyone.<br><br>i would say that the food quality is not bad. but the SERVICE is VERY VERY VERY BAD...<br><br>1) it took nearly 30 mins for the first dish to be served on the table<br><br>2) After 45 mins, i asked the waiter when is my salmon sashimi coming, he denies taking any order for the salmon sashimi. but in the first place when i ordered, he nod and wrote it down.<br><br>3) the chef came into the room to "explain" the situation .... his explanation is that the food turned bad this morning and that there is a shortage of food.and also one of the chef is on MC so he tried calling my mom to let her know that. but was told that the number was invaild. thus the number was wrong. so he says he is the one taking the reservation of seats and he is a very careful man. so it couldnt be him that hear the wrong number... so in a way saying that my mom gave her own number wrongly....<br><br>4) then we asked how come when we reach the door of the rest, no one told us anything about the food is spoilt and one of the chef is on MC.at least in doing so we can decide whether to continue to dine over there or we can actually change another location.  so he says maybe his staff never conveys the msg<br><br>5) so we complaine to him how come the food took so long. he deny about the long waiting for the food. saying that all our food has already been served. and he dont understand why we ordered so little. from our point of view is that we wanna give the dishes a try so we never ordered alot of things... and also.. since we ordered only a few dishes and it already took so long... then what if we ordered more? isnt that going to let us wait even more?<br><br>6) when they took away our used plates, they didnt even replace one for us. my uncle had to go out and get himself the plates.<br><br>7) when we only ate like a few dishes, then the waitress came over and says last order for today. and it is not that we ate slowly or we never ordered. but it is the waiting time that took up all the time.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> And there is alot of dishes that we ordered but was not even served.<br><br>so this is the bad experience i had with yoshi japaness resturant at 12 queens st in hotel royal @ queens<br><br>any similiar experiences? please do share?<br><br>thanks.. sorry for the long post.... as i am really angry with the service over there.<br><br></div>
