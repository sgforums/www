              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Do your body (and the Earth) a favor—and eat at places that offer healthy and tasty food. By <strong>Belinda Wan</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/455/12-13-DiningFeat.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Admit it: How often have you guiltily craved for an oh-so-sinful plate of char kway teow? As the old adage goes, forbidden food is often the yummiest, but also the worst for you. Maybe it’s high time to take your overall well-being and health into account (what with recent food scares and all) by making a conscious effort to eat more healthily. And yup, healthy food <em>can</em> be tasty, as our sessions at these healthy, new hangouts have proven. Check these out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Fresh Origin </strong><br><strong>Where: </strong>#01-01 and 5/F, One George, 1 George St., 6536-5669. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>At first glimpse, the first-floor Fresh Origin looks much like any other café with its bright interior and busy vibe. But on the fifth floor, there’s a gleaming pool and a charming alfresco space with greenery and a lovely view of the skyscrapers in the vicinity. <br><strong>Health pitch: </strong>The menu comprises breakfast items, soups, paninis, pastas, pizzas, desserts, salads, ice-creams and even sorbets. All ingredients are fresh and the food isn’t prepared far in advance—hence the tagline “Naturally Tasty.” And certain items stand out from the menu for their healthy properties. <br><strong>Taste test: </strong>The caprese salad (buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes with basil pesto, $9) is a great choice to start your meal. Proceed to the not-too-tomatoey penne Arrabbiata with tomatoes, fresh chili, garlic and herbs ($7) or the super healthy ciabatta with grilled eggplant, tomato, zucchini and mozzarella ($7), which is extremely light and subtle, yet filling. The fruit salad ($3), with watermelon, pineapple and grapes is a lovely substitute for a sinful dessert, with its sweet-sour taste and lovely blend of flavors. <br><strong>In 10 words: </strong>Serves unpretentious but good food—with a view to boot. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Naïve <br>Where:</strong> 99 East Coast Rd., 6348-0668. <br><strong>The vibe: </strong>Two month-old Naïve is an unexpected find in the long stretch of eateries opposite Katong Mall. Cleanly furnished, with neutral shades of brown and beige, quirky graphics, and long benches and tables made from real wood, Naïve is a soothing oasis amid the bustle of the area. <br><strong>Health pitch:</strong> Co-owner Phyllis Ong explains that the concept behind Naïve is healthy, flavorful food with a positive and an uplifting attitude to boot. Oil is used sparingly in the meatless menu (that includes some organic dishes), and there are plenty of greens and mushrooms. Ong says, “These days, people don’t just look for good food—they also want food that uplifts the spirit, and that is something we try to achieve at Naïve.” <br><strong>Taste test: </strong>Serving “modern Asian food” (with Thai, Japanese and Malaysian dishes) with starters, mains, sides, and rice and noodles, the star ingredient here is the monkeyhead mushroom—which enhances one’s memory, is low in cholesterol and extremely tasty. There are six dishes with the monkeyhead mushroom, in fact. Soup lovers will love the eye-enhancing wolfberry soup ($3.80) for starters. The robust Enchanted Forest ($12.80, monkeyhead mushrooms braised with wolfberries, Chinese “tang gui” herbs and broccoli), monkeyhead fried rice ($8.80) and an awesome side dish, battered organic oyster mushrooms ($9.80), will make mushroom maniacs very happy. Don’t miss the delicious tamarind tofu cake ($13.80) and the super refreshing Sour Power drink ($3.50). <br><strong>In 10 words:</strong> Healthy, tasty food chockfull of mushrooms and feel good vibes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Oomphatico’s <br>Where: </strong>#01-35 Tanglin Mall, 163 Tanglin Rd., 6733-9088. <br><strong>The vibe:</strong> With its quirky, colorful, feminine furniture and feel (think stylishly mismatched sofas, bright, eye-catching tables and whimsical cutlery), Oomphatico’s is a café that funky ladies will dig on first sight. It’s pretty, attractive and a lovely place to sit down and have a relaxing meal. <br><strong>Health pitch: </strong>The menu here has been revamped completely—and now head chef Akhil Prabhu serves modern European grub; bringing a new twist to classics. Menu items highlighted in green signify vegetarian dishes, and gluten- and dairy-free options can be prepared upon request. The menu is brimming with entrées, salads, pizzas, soups, pastas, risottos, sandwiches, desserts, fish and seafood, and meat and poultry—plus a vegetarian section. Many menu items feature a generous use of greens and healthy additions like beetroot, artichokes, Sakura free-range chicken, and even organic quinoa. <br><strong>Taste test: </strong>The feta spinach pie in crispy pyllo, served on almond gazpacho and crème friache ($14) makes a fab entrée with its good blend of soft and crispy textures; and delicate balance of flavors. The salad Nicoise with blackened yellow fin tuna ($20) makes a nice alternative to a normal salad, and another intriguing dish is the salad pizza topped with tomatoes, rucola, avocado, feta cheese and balsamic glaze ($16). And vegetarians will instantly dig the vegetarian stack of grilled tofu, sweet and sour shiitake, Portobello and oyster mushrooms, Fontina cheese baked ($17)—it’s light, delicious and healthy. For something more robust, the herb and vegetable risotto with coriander and pistachio vinaigrette ($16) is a healthy, tasty and not too heavy bet. <br><strong>In 10 words: </strong>Reasonable prices, inviting ambiance, truly delicious food and slightly offbeat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Skinny Pizza<br>Where: </strong>#01-002 Suntec City Galleria, 3 Temasek Blvd., 6333-9774. <br><strong>The vibe:</strong> Small, busy but cozy, Skinny Pizza, in case you haven’t heard, is by the smart folks at Spa Esprit. This serves a large selection of Skinny Pizzas, soups, desserts and drinks. The space is imbued with the trademark funky décor, chirpy, helpful service, and wry socially-conscious humor characteristic of the Spa Esprit Group. <br><strong>Health pitch: </strong>Skinny Pizza is a crackly, airy and super crispy version of the thin-crust pizza most of us are acquainted with. As such, that means less carbs—something that we can definitely do with. With its inspired, fun, fresh and tasty toppings (vegetarian flavors included), this is the best place to visit when you’re on a diet but have a mad craving for pizza. <br><strong>Taste test: </strong>The star here is the pizza—but the soups are pretty wholesome too. Two soups are available every day, so what you get depends on when you go, but expect yummy flavors like butternut pumpkin, watercress and spinach, green lentil, cauliflower and parsley, and classic leek and potato vichyssoise (all $5.50). As for the 12” pizzas, they’re so light that you can comfortably wolf down a few slices before even feeling vaguely full. In fact, the more veggie ones also feel more like salads than pizzas! Check out the yummy and healthy Chorizo Almond ($18), Classic Caesar ($16), Macadamia Roasted Pumpkin ($16) and Wild Truffled Mushroom ($18) flavors—which particularly caught our fancy with their inventiveness. <br><strong>In 10 words: </strong>Tasty soups, guilt-free pizzas, friendly service and good prices. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Old Timers </strong><br>Just can’t get enough? Here are more places where you can fill up on healthy grub. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>The Garden</strong> (The Sentosa Resort and Spa, Sentosa, 2 Bukit Manis Rd., 6371-1130)—Boasting a concept called “conscious dining,” The Garden is a lovely, chic restaurant that’s big on health and taste too. Organic and bio-dynamic ingredients are incorporated into dishes like the watermelon-organic daikon roll, “chicken rice,” organic soy milk pannacotta, and DIY salads and juices. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>KO Japanese Restaurant</strong> (G/F, InterContinental Singapore, 80 Middle Rd., 6825-1064)—Yes, Japanese chow may already be healthy, but in the hands of Kobe-born head chef Hideto Setomoto, macrobiotic cooking almost trumps normal Japanese method of cooking. Try the maguro steak and the lobster ebi miso yaki (charcoal-grilled lobster with savory prawn sauce). </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Original Sin</strong> (#01-62 Chip Bee Gardens, Blk. 43 Jalan Merah Saga, 6475-5605)—This Mediterranean vegetarian is an institution in Holland V. Don’t miss their top selling items, the Principessa salad (with avocado, pumpkin, asparagus and much more), Magic Mushroom (Portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese, spinach, pesto and pine nuts) and Bosco Misto (spinach, feta and tofu patties) here. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Whole Earth Vegetarian Restaurant </strong>(593 Geylang Rd., 6841-3319)—<br>Serving Thai, Peranakan and vegetarian food, Whole Earth shows you that vegetarian Asian food need not be about mock meats. Their inventive menu includes dishes like Szechuan monkeyhead mushrooms, nonya curry and assam pedas.</span></p>
