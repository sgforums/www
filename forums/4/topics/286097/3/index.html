It will be able to house 165 stalls, including 48 cooked food stalls.<br><br>The operators were given this assurance when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visited the stall holders on Saturday.<br><br>Since a fire razed the market's 232 stalls three weeks ago, 124 wet market stall vendors have been operating out of two large white tents that were set up in a nearby carpark a week later to help them continue operating.<br><br>The tents, however, did not have the facilities to house cooked food stalls. This was one of the problems a stall owner raised with Mr Lee.<br><br>Madam Lai Sun Choo, 50, a fish seller, said her business had dropped by half since the move.<br><br>'Fewer customers come because there are no cooked food stalls for them to eat at,' she told The Sunday Times.<br><br>As Mr Lee shook hands and vendors waved back, he assured them that he would do what he could to improve the situation.<br><br>He also took the opportunity to remind vendors that fire insurance was a vital form of protection that should not be neglected.<br><br>It was discovered after the fire that most of the vendors in the market did not have a fire insurance policy.<br><br>Yio Chu Kang MP Seng Han Thong later said that only about 20 per cent of the stall vendors had insurance coverage.<br><br>'We can use this to remind people that they should always have insurance,' he said.<br><br>Meanwhile, the National Environment Agency said that plans for a new market have started and the new facility will be complete in about two years.<br><br>Vegetable seller Yan Fu Tian, 52, is hoping that the new market will bring back business.<br><br>'Here, there's no parking and no cooked food stalls. My business has dropped by more than 50 per cent,' he said.<br><br>'Hopefully, when the new building is up, my customers will come back.'<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings</div>
