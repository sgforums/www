I tried to gave the cashier small change but could only find 90 cts instead of 80cts. Upon receiving my money, the cashier just threw it into the till without checking, then insisted it was 80 cts when I asked her whether she had checked or not.<br><br>At the one beside big M, there is a popular bak chor mee stall. I once ordered a $3 dollar bowl and paid with a $5 dollar note. The cashier just put it into the till and pretended to forget about it. I waited and waited silently for the change, and when the mee was really, she attempted to pass the mee to me, as though everything is settled.
