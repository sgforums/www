            <div class='col-md body'>I was on taking a lift down going back from work today. A few guys (about 40's old executive management) came in and start to discuss about their unhappiness about colour differentiation in Hotel Restaurants, Pubs and Cafe. During a short exchange the temperature starts to rise about the disgust with local F&amp;B industry bias towards Asian.<br><br>I remember reading in Straits Time Forum within the last few days about someone complains about bias Â“colourÂ” attitude from Ritz Carlton Hotel restaurant.<br><br>I open the discussion in Food Forum, since it mostly is F&amp;B/Service industry related. Most of us would have tasted 101 restaurants in Singapore and would have witness this kind of treatment either to ourselves or our related friends.<br><br>Please provide your experiences on the above subject and let all forumers know which restaurants is having double standards or even restaurant that stand up to the non-Asian whims.<br><br>Welcome comments from the so-called restaurateurs, restaurant owners or managers or those in F&amp;B/Service industry why are they/management have double standard when dealing with Asian and our Non-Asian bros/Sis ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br></div>
