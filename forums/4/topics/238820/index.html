            <div class='col-md body'>I went to Sumo House at Clementi Central (Beside NTUC). The service there sucks man.<br><br>The tables and chars there are so closed together, you can't move around easily. The waitress there throws the food onto the table too with a frown, like not happy to serve like that, face black black one.<br><br>I asked for sauce, she point me at the counter there, ask me go take myself. I gotta squeeze between the tables to get there. Then I reached for the saucer, and the waitress there smacked my hand away roughly, saying that the saucers for us are on the table beside... (Wah lao, can just tell me mah, no need to smack/shove my hand away right?)<br><br>Then I go to the counter look for manager. The person at the casher there ignore me. I ask again, he again ignore me. I go ask the waitress wheres the manager, she gimme that kinda blur look, and direct me to the cashier. Apparently the cashier is 2nd in-charge or something. I ask him who's the manager and where he is. He questioned me "Why am I looking for the manager". I replied that I wanted to give feedback. Then he ignored me again.<br><br>In the end, I found the manager myself, and told him about the incident. He asked me who's the waitress, and I said that everyone here had an attitude problem. I told him the service was horrendous and you know what he said?<br><br>"We don't provide customer service because we don't have service charge"<br><br>I told him that Macdonalds, KFC, Pizza Hut, Burger King etc etc all don't charge service charges yet their customer service is 100000X better than them.<br><br>No wonder the staff there damn lousy. The management is even worse. Like they say "Once rotten in the core, the whole thing is spoilt"<br><br></div>
