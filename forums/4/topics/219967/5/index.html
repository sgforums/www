            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by browniebaobao:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: indigo;">Anybody ever went to The Chicken Rice Shop at Vivocity?<br><br>I went there for dinner with my mum and sis.<br><br>We looked thru their menu and decided to order the set B for 2 pax, which includes 2 plates of rice, one dish of honey chicken, one dish of choice of chicken (we chose roasted chicken), 2 bowls of soup, 2 small cups of drinks, one dish of pai tee and a dish of bean sprouts.  And we ordered an extra plate of rice, and a side dish of tao hu.  When we asked whether we can change the soft drinks to soya bean drink, we were told that we have to top up $1.  So we decided to make do with the soft drink.  Even more expensive than KFC hor.<br><br>The rice and the chicken came first.  But we did not start eating, coz we were waiting for the other dishes to be served.  The portion was very small.  Chicken very little, rice very little.  One waitress came to our table and seemed puzzled.  Then suddenly one very fat woman in black (im not discriminating fat woman, coz im also fat) came over and checked her order form, and took away the two plates of chicken on our table.  Then I looked at her, and asked "what's wrong?"  She IGNORED me and gave the two plates to another table.  Then she asked the waitress to replace another two plates, and the portion was even smaller!  I understand that they could have made a mistake with the orders, but she din even have the courtesy to say SORRY!  She abruptly took 2 plates of chicken over to the other table and ignored me when I asked her what's wrong.  Luckily we have not started eating lor.  If we started eating, would she still do the same?  And what if the customers at the other table found out?  Would they still accept the 2 plates of chicken?<br><br>I was very angry already, I stared at her, and my mum was puzzled, she asked her whether our order was correct.  She said yes.  Then my sis also not happy already, she asked her 'correct hor? we ordered 1 extra plate of rice and 1 tao hu."  She said "yes yes."  My sis asked again "So CAN WE EAT NOW?"  She said "YES YES YES."  And still no apology.  When she walked away, I said loudly "this kind of service still got service charge?"<br><br>We were about to finish our food already and the tao hu was still not served, while other tables which ordered later then us got theirs.   One staff said she go in the kitchen and check when we asked her.  Then the tao hu came.  The waitress did not even bother to shift the dishes on the table for us, and she Left the plate of tao hu ON TOP of the other dishes.  Where got ple like that serve food wan?  Put the dish on top of other dishes when we have not even finished eating?  And it's not that there was no space left on our table.<br><br>We start eating the tao hu then realize it's with oyster sauce de, but actually we ordered one that is without oyster sauce.  One steamed tao hu with oyster sauce cost $5 ok.  Lagi expensive.<br><br>I totally did not enjoy the food at all.  Really not worth it.  If the service was good, then I wun make noise.  But hell, the food was so so and the service sucks!  Although they are selling chicken rice, but hey, since they want to open a restaurant and charge customers for their service, then make sure they provide good service!  Oh ya, they only accept CASH.  No cards.  Our bill was $22.80 and I thought we might as well go next door to eat kolo mee.  I was looking for feedback form, but they dun have it at their cashier.<br><br>People who are thinking of going there to eat, I advise you not to, unless you dun mind paying for a dinner that wun make u full but make u walk out of the restaurant feeling angry instead.  </span><br><br></div></blockquote>I am not sure if you should make a big fuss over the services of these poor girls and boys, they are all pretty in-experienced. Look at the amount of Resturants in VivoCity.<br><br>Anyway if you have tried "BOSS" aka "HEI SHER HUI", the amount I paid is almost 3 times the chicken rice and the waiting time definately beat yours. We waited 1hour to get our steamboat served. 20mins to get our tea served. It's actually quite interesting watching such a posh resturant getting screwed up, and looking around people leaving after taking their drinks and NOT WANTING TO PAY FOR IT. Everyone was so pissed off that one of the customer even threaten to beat up the waiter, cursing while walking out of the resturant. "LIM PEH WAITED 40 MINS TO GET MY DRINKS, EAT WHAT EAT? EAT YOUR FATHER LAH" - abstract from pissed off customer.<br><br>Anyway we waited and finally got our dinner, luckily the food's not bad. And the Captain assured us that give them 3 week , these kinda of service will not happen again. Anyone tried ?<br><br>And, anyone tried the stall beside the chicken rice? I tried the noodle and think its not bad lah but its not cheap and the service quite lousy (because newbie mah). Is there a thread for VivoCity Resturants, give feedbacks to diners at VivoCity</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went down VVC a few times during Dec.  And i was shock to see that this chicken rice shop is 90% filled up at 4pm in the afternoon.<br><br>4pm so many people eat chicken rice? Somemore it is not cheap and standard is low.  Majority of the customer are Malays and i guess it is Halai plays a big part to it. The noodle store next to it is only 2 tables full, same as Superdog which is opposite.<br><br>With this kind of money coming in, i doubt they will bother to do anything to improve.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by browniebaobao:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: indigo;">Anybody ever went to The Chicken Rice Shop at Vivocity?<br><br>I went there for dinner with my mum and sis.<br><br>We looked thru their menu and decided to order the set B for 2 pax, which includes 2 plates of rice, one dish of honey chicken, one dish of choice of chicken (we chose roasted chicken), 2 bowls of soup, 2 small cups of drinks, one dish of pai tee and a dish of bean sprouts.  And we ordered an extra plate of rice, and a side dish of tao hu.  When we asked whether we can change the soft drinks to soya bean drink, we were told that we have to top up $1.  So we decided to make do with the soft drink.  Even more expensive than KFC hor.<br><br>The rice and the chicken came first.  But we did not start eating, coz we were waiting for the other dishes to be served.  The portion was very small.  Chicken very little, rice very little.  One waitress came to our table and seemed puzzled.  Then suddenly one very fat woman in black (im not discriminating fat woman, coz im also fat) came over and checked her order form, and took away the two plates of chicken on our table.  Then I looked at her, and asked "what's wrong?"  She IGNORED me and gave the two plates to another table.  Then she asked the waitress to replace another two plates, and the portion was even smaller!  I understand that they could have made a mistake with the orders, but she din even have the courtesy to say SORRY!  She abruptly took 2 plates of chicken over to the other table and ignored me when I asked her what's wrong.  Luckily we have not started eating lor.  If we started eating, would she still do the same?  And what if the customers at the other table found out?  Would they still accept the 2 plates of chicken?<br><br>I was very angry already, I stared at her, and my mum was puzzled, she asked her whether our order was correct.  She said yes.  Then my sis also not happy already, she asked her 'correct hor? we ordered 1 extra plate of rice and 1 tao hu."  She said "yes yes."  My sis asked again "So CAN WE EAT NOW?"  She said "YES YES YES."  And still no apology.  When she walked away, I said loudly "this kind of service still got service charge?"<br><br>We were about to finish our food already and the tao hu was still not served, while other tables which ordered later then us got theirs.   One staff said she go in the kitchen and check when we asked her.  Then the tao hu came.  The waitress did not even bother to shift the dishes on the table for us, and she Left the plate of tao hu ON TOP of the other dishes.  Where got ple like that serve food wan?  Put the dish on top of other dishes when we have not even finished eating?  And it's not that there was no space left on our table.<br><br>We start eating the tao hu then realize it's with oyster sauce de, but actually we ordered one that is without oyster sauce.  One steamed tao hu with oyster sauce cost $5 ok.  Lagi expensive.<br><br>I totally did not enjoy the food at all.  Really not worth it.  If the service was good, then I wun make noise.  But hell, the food was so so and the service sucks!  Although they are selling chicken rice, but hey, since they want to open a restaurant and charge customers for their service, then make sure they provide good service!  Oh ya, they only accept CASH.  No cards.  Our bill was $22.80 and I thought we might as well go next door to eat kolo mee.  I was looking for feedback form, but they dun have it at their cashier.<br><br>People who are thinking of going there to eat, I advise you not to, unless you dun mind paying for a dinner that wun make u full but make u walk out of the restaurant feeling angry instead.  </span><br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Save yr trouble eat chicken rice at other places lah.  If you want posch place, go Mandarin Chatterbox for the chicken rice lor!  I passed by the chicken rice shop yesterday.  There were very few people in there and by the look of it I am not convinced I wanna eat there.</div>
