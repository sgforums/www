            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">I can't wait to recommend this chinese restaurant to all of you!<br><br>Juz come back from dinner at Xiao Xuan Feng @ Tiong Bahru Plaza #01-15 (along the stretch at KFC, facing the road).<br><br>*rub rub tummy* very satisfying!<br><br>The restaurant has a nice ambience, when the antique clock strike 8, it cried 8 times also.  There are 3 bird cages, one old aircon/radio on the wall.. and very oriental wooden tables and chairs..<br><br>I never had a good impression of Chinese (those from China lah).<br><br>But the Chinese at this restaurant are really very polite and attentive!  They cleared our plates, refilled our cups from our teapot, and when they saw me having problem cutting the Ramien, they even took a pair of scissors and cut for us!  Service was excellent!<br><br>Come to the main point.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The food was great.. especially the breaded Durian Puffs.. omgggggggg you will definitely ask for more.. see the durian oozing out when u bite the puff.. the crisp, the fragrance.. heavenly!<br><br>We also ordered..<br><br>1. Fried Beancurd Roll (very crispy!)<br><br>2. Golden Crispy Chicken (crispy, with a different kind of taste.. dip with the sauce.. and it's really yummy)<br><br>3. Fried Ribs Ramien (very big bowl.. one person cannot finish.. nice and big ribs, nice and tangy ramien)<br><br>4. Sichuan Soup (I dun really like sour soup.. so I din finish it.. but the soup is thick, and really sour and a bit spicy)<br><br>2 persons ate up to $40++.  I even da bao 6 durian puffs home for my family.<br><br>They sell a variety of fried rice, ramien, side dishes, a bit of dim sum and desserts.  I'll bring my family there next time.  Do give it a try. </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tried it just now when I passed by Tiong Bahru. Had the crispy chicken, broccoli with prawns, signature breaded durian and the egg with shredded scallops. Overall taste wise was not too bad, but everything was extremely oily. Felt very sick after eating. The sauce for the crispy chicken was merely a blander version of the prawn paste used in rojak. The breaded durian was quite good though, but the filling could be thicker. Portions are also quite small. Won't be back soon, unless its for the breaded durian. Service is quite good though.</div>

Even the egg white with scallops, which is steamed, had a layer of oil at the bottom. The sauce for the crispy chicken tasted like prawn paste to me because it was reeking of Hare Bi.

Are you sure the skin is made from glutinous rice? It seemed to be made more from starch. Actually it kinda reminded me of the round sesame coated balls with red bean in them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
