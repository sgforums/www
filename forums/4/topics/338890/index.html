              <p>there is another such concept restaurant in the basement of chinatown point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the workers there are all volunteers and the raw materials are usually donated by some companies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the ambience is really good, decor is beautiful but since its a indian vegetarian restaurant, you wont eat meat there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the monies collected are used to donate to charities and maybe just pay some bills.</p>

              <p>Such food stalls are rare...therefore, when eating at such food stall, pay the amount that other stalls charge...that should keep them going to do good for those really who cannot afford much for food</p>
              <p>In India, the poor line up outside restaurants to eat leftovers by customers.....we are lucky enough to be singaporeans..dont have to be like them</p>
