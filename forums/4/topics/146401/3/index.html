Too little lemon butter sauce is poured over the fish, and its thin consistency dampens the crispy batter, making it soggy. No tartare, chilli or ketchup is offered unless you ask. The fries are good, though.<br><br></div>

Served with tartare and Thai chilli sauce, two chunky pieces of fresh John Dory fish are placed over a bed of fries and an elegant salad tower. The batter coat is thin, light and crispy, showcasing the true flavour of the fish. A version using New Zealand white fish costs only $9.50 if you order takeaway.<br><br></div>

The shell looks hard, but it yields wonderfully to the bite. It comes with two types of fries - plain and spiced - which are crispy on the outside, powdery on the inside. The downside is the meagre, sad batch of lettuce and yellowed apples on the side.<br></div>
