The bits of chilli padi add a refreshing mix in the texture of the dish.<br><br>Specialities:<br>Garlic and olive oil have long been known for their health benefits and healing properties. It is no wonder that the foundations of this restaurant rest on these two health-promoting spices. Â‘AglioÂ’, in Italian, means garlic, and Â‘olioÂ’ means olive. Being the first restaurant to localise pasta, the Italian fare served at Aglio Olio comes with a Singapore twist Â– the use of chilli padi as a substitute for the usual chilli flakes Â–culminating in the birth of a dish to call SingaporeÂ’s very own. Try their Seafood Olio or Bacon Cream for a truly unique blend of east and west all in one mouthful. You get a choice of four different levels of spiciness, depending on how strong a palate you have. One bite and you will see that Aglio Olio is the epitome of SingaporeÂ’s culinary creativity.<br><br>Ambience:<br>The dÃ©cor of the restaurantÂ’s interior shows off a thoughtfully chosen colour scheme, where the light wood tables and glass wall features evoke a sense of tranquillity.

It struck gold in the 1990s with its roti prata, which still remains one of the best you can get in an air-conditioned eatery.<br><br>It was voted one of the top five favourite dishes in a public poll in 1996 held in conjunction with the Singapore Food Festival that year.<br><br>The roti prata, served with chicken and mutton curries, is available as part of its daily international buffet.<br><br>But over the years, the buffet has been beefed up with even more signature items. The chicken rice is another staple that appears in the spread every day.<br><br>Then there are other items such as laksa and mee siam that alternate with each other. Laid out for self-service, you decide what toppings to add.<br><br>For the laksa, for example, you can add pieces of poached chicken from the chicken-rice counter or prawns and salmon from the seafood section.<br><br>And for dessert, what is destined to be another classic attraction is the durian mousse cake. Moist and rich with durian pulp, each mouthful is almost as good as eating the fruit itself.<br><br>Adding variety to the buffet is an array of salads, soups and hot dishes which are changed daily. But it's the staples that have made the cafe the place to go for good local fare.<br><br>PHOENIX GARDEN CAFE<br>Hotel Phoenix Singapore,<br>277 Orchard Road,<br>Tel: 6737-8666<br><br>Price: $23.80 for adults and $16.80 for children (weekday lunch), $25.80 for adults and $17.80 for children (weekend lunch and daily dinner)<br></div>
