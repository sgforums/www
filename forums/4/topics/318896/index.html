              <h1 class="clr">Saving Singapore's cuisine one laksa at a time</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, May 27 - Food critic KF Seetoh is on a mission to keep
              Singapore's unique cuisine alive -- one laksa, chicken rice and chilli
              crab dish at a time.</p>
              <p>Seetoh fears Singapore's signature dishes, and the street hawkers
              who make them, are losing out to fast food, imported cuisines and an
              uninspired younger generation.</p>
              <p>The self-styled food guru has made
              it his business to preserve this slice of Singaporean heritage through
              Makansutra , a company dedicated to promoting indigenous Asian food
              through a street food guide book, TV shows, Internet reviews and a
              restaurant consultancy.</p>
              <p>"Makan" means eating in Bahasa and
              "sutra" is Sanskrit for guide, reflecting two of the main traditions --
              Indonesian and Indian -- that have influenced Singaporean cuisine.</p>
              <p>The
              guide is published once a year and its 7th edition is out soon.
              Makansutra has launched a guide for Malaysia and Indoneisa and is
              planning more editions for the region, including Beijing.</p>
              <p>Reuters spoke to Seetoh about the business of food and why eating is such an important part of being Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Q: Singapore's hawker food centres, basically street food courts, are world famous. Are we about to lose them?</p>
              <p>A:
              "Hawker food is the last bastion of our culture but now we're seeing
              Japanese, German and even French hawker stalls cropping up. This
              internationalisation of our organic food culture signals its death.
              There are still enough old masters, but they're passing away soon and
              many have disdain for their own food and haven't passed it on to their
              Harvard-educated sons. Many Singaporeans look down on hawker fare, they
              consider it grandfather food made by ex-cons. Hawker food is the
              heartbeat of our culinary culture. And we're losing our heritage.</p>
              <p>Q: How do you think Makansutra can help?</p>
              <p>A:
              About 10 years ago, I realised our great food culture was not being
              celebrated so I launched the first hawker food guide in 1998 as a
              wake-up call for the locals to tell them: wake up and smell the laksa .
              I got a lot of people telling me 'you don't have to tell me where to
              get the best char kway teow , I already know' but despite that, it sold
              out and now we average 30,000 copies a year, often selling out.</p>
              <p>Q: A lot of foreigners also use your guide. So this wasn't intended as a tourism-boosting venture?</p>
              <p>A:
              "I didn't do this deliberately for foreigners, but the new generation,
              they've got money and they love to travel, and they're after the local
              food culture. About 20 to 30 percent of of the guides are bought by
              foreigners now. After all, why come to Singapore to eat French food? By
              eating the local food, you digest the local culture.</p>
              <p>Q: What's so special about Singaporean cuisine? And why is food such a big deal in this country?</p>
              <p>A:
              Our food is a bastardisation of the three motherland food nations of
              Asia -- China, India and Indonesia. It's fusion food born out of the
              factors that created the country. For example, here, curry rice isn't
              an Indian dish, its Hainanese Chinese. The food offerings here are very
              diverse, which makes eating a national pastime, up there with shopping.
              There is no mass appeal thing to do here other than eat. Everybody can
              afford to do it.</p>
              <p>Q: Hawker centres are often hot, crowded, loud, messy -- and bewildering if you're not Singaporean. Any tips?</p>
              <p>A:
              There is an art to enjoying a hawker centre. First, go with your local
              friends. Find a cool corner and eat one dish at a time and take a break
              to talk. Conversation is the best palate cleanser. If you can't find a
              cool place, then get in and get out quickly then go for coffee and a
              chat somewhere else.</p>
              <p>Q: What's considered comfort food here?</p>
              <p>A:
              Chicken rice. When you've got an extra buck or two, it's chilli crab or
              laksa, but when you don't know what you want, its got to be chicken
              rice.</p>
              <p>Seetoh's top five Singapore hawker centres:</p>
