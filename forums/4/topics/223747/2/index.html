Some daily specials they have inc bak kut teh, Korean bibimbab, Hakka lei cha, and 8-treasure rice.<br><br>Vegetarian - there are 2 stalls on level 2, one directly opp. the organic food shop and the other to the side of it (this one has quite tasty zhi zha noodles, lor mee, fish beehoon, and Heng Hwa lor mee &amp; Heng Hwa beehoon, etc.).  There's also a more "gourmet-ish" (in presentation) vegetarian foodcourt on the ground level facing the main road  which has nice food, but maybe has a tad more MSG (as commented by some).<br><br>Other the the foodcourt, the rest are small shops, so don't expect much ambience, and sorry I didn't take note of the shop names.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
