I also watch alot of foodie show as well.<br><br>But then, Alaskan king crab is not really wide spread in Sg coz its so expensive. I went Hokkaido eat and its like 200bucks a crab. Don't think Singaporeans got stomach to eat such a expensive crab at kopitiam. The crab is Sg is not even near halfway the size of the Alaskan King Crab. Even then, the crab there also never use as much rope as the one I saw in the newspaper.<br><br>Using 350gm of rope for a 400gm crab is also hell of alot. I think 350gm of raffian string can tie a normal person up really well. One entire roll of raffian also not so heavy. Unless the Alaskan king crab is stronger than a human then I nothing to say.</div>

I also watch alot of foodie show as well.<br><br>But then, Alaskan king crab is not really wide spread in Sg coz its so expensive. I went Hokkaido eat and its like 200bucks a crab. Don't think Singaporeans got stomach to eat such a expensive crab at kopitiam. The crab is Sg is not even near halfway the size of the Alaskan King Crab. Even then, the crab there also never use as much rope as the one I saw in the newspaper.<br><br>Using 350gm of rope for a 400gm crab is also hell of alot. I think 350gm of raffian string can tie a normal person up really well. One entire roll of raffian also not so heavy. Unless the Alaskan king crab is stronger than a human then I nothing to say.</div></blockquote>all i am saying is, blame the right party, don't blame the restaruant</div>
