              <p>Restaurant food tastes mediocre at best with unduly marked up prices.</p>
              <p>Given the obscene food quality (and quantity) to price ratio, it's arguable that no customer service or ambience, however good, can make dining out a pleasant experience.</p>
              <p>Even then, customer service is plain shit nowadays. Everyone still pays a 10% service charge to be treated like shit.</p>
              <p>Last week, I had a traumatic experience (which I won't describe in detail) at Asian Kitchen involving a rude waiter who was basically bitter about everyone getting ahead of him in life while he had to work a dead-end, shitty job with no prospects whatsoever for slave wage on a Sunday afternoon just to pay for his next installment of handphone bill, comic book rental fees and game arcade escapades because he was too obtuse and thus unmotivated to improve himself.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, I had a plate of nasi padang with fish fillet and potatoes at the NUS canteen for a grand total of $1.80.</p>
              <p>Guess which meal spoilt my mood for the rest of the week, gave me diarrhoea and made me feel almost as stupid as said waiter inherently is.</p>

              <p>you can try 2 good restaurants (that also have great service) @ mohamed sultan rd / near river valley rd. walkable from douby god mrt. average price per person $100.</p>
              <p>The Tavern. Rated 8.4/10 average, 8 reviews. suggested meal: lobster bisque ($18) or oysters, pan fried foie gras ($27), roasted rack of baby lamb ($40) , cherry jubilee ($26). they have nice cocktails like kamikaze ($18) too. The grilled Wagyu beef has a nice smokey taste but $90 for 200grams.</p>
              <p>The 2nd place nearby is called Sage. Rated 8/10, 57 reviews. suggested meal: ... set lunches. quite a lot of choices. we had tomato and crab claw salad, cappuccino of wild mushroom, foie gras on crumble, cod, duck confit.</p>

              <p>To TS, imo customer service in sg restaurants is still very good, i cant remember any close to 'plain shit' experiences. asian kitchen is a cafe not restaurant though. most restaurants all wait staff are always polite, courteous and professional, places like st pierre will brush bread crumbs off your table into a silver platter too</p>

              <p>Obviously your choice of restaurants suck and you are no food connoisseur (though I'm not either lol).</p>
              <p>As for your preferred choice of "restaurants" to eat out at,</p>
              <p>I think if you were to consider "Asian Kitchen" worthy as a "restaurant", you were simply stupid. Get over it.<br><br>As for the proper restaurants,</p>
              <p>all of which are considered to be "fine dining", as opposed to something as pathetic as "Jack's Place", which counts as one of the lousiest restaurants in Singapore from all that I have seen,<br><br>all of which most definitely do not have waiters like you have just complained about; such service is simply unheard of,</p>
              <p>and all of which have simply ridiculously high prices,</p>
              <p>so obviously, the only reason people "eat out" at proper restaurants that are completely unlike what you described, is for the status, flaunting their wealth and perhaps their strange taste for certain kinds of foods.</p>
              <p>As for me,</p>
              <p>I eat out simply to enjoy some time with family or friends, regardless of how crappy the service is, regardless of how outrageous the prices are and regardless of obscene food quality.</p>
              <p>Though if you are actually going to a proper "restaurant", you wouldn't be facing any of the three problems stated above.</p>
              <p>Then again, who the hell has time and money for a proper "restaurant", moreover one that we can't even pronounce its name properly?<br><br>Settle for something like what GOF mentioned above, or maybe simple meal @ The Astons? Asian Kitchen doesn't count as a restaurant already imho.</p>

              <p>it's cheaper and much more convenient to eat out in Singapore. I could spend as little as $12 for 2 people at the local food court or probably less than $10 at the local food centers.</p>
              <p>I'd spent at least $30 everytime i make a meal for 2 people.  Given $30, I could easily spend it on steamboat buffet for 2 people although all but not as delicious as what I could get for $12.</p>
              <p>Food is cheap in Singapore. A meal for 2 in the country that i come from could amount to $50.</p>

              <p>Wawawa.....like this huh....</p>
              <p>Well....mi is think, it is your own particular bad experience, but you cannot generalize like that.....</p>
              <p>Anyways I have some good experiences eating in small restaurants.....such as those in Upper Bukit Timah areas near the Coronation stretch there....lots of small restaurants....Tanjong Pagar area.....and also West Coast area.....especially the Japanese restaurants, home-cooked style......I think it's also weird now I remember it....coz they have comic books/ manga there......</p>
              <p>But dont ask me the names coz I forgot....those were when I was young....</p>
              <p>But mi is think cooking is good also....</p>
              <p>I can buy beef, chicken, vegetables, and cook....and I think good thing about cooking is that you can determine and control the outcome as you like...more freedom and more choices.....</p>
              <p>And my skills are good.....</p>
              <p>But of course the bad thing is that it takes a lot of time.......</p>

              <p>Actually, frankly speaking, unless if you cook everday or twice a day, then maybe you will save more than eating outside, cos the ingredients and some foods you buy can be stored up and use often. But if you only cook during a weekend day, surely you will have to spend more than outside, u may not have the ingredients and have to buy a lot or packet of it but use only a tespoon, that will be a waste, better eat outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But having said that, eating at home can be healthier and it is good to have some fun in cooking, especially the shopping part.</p>
