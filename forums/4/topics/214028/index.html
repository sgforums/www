Walk all the way up until you saw an old deserted entertainment building and walk all the way up until u see an old hawker centre.<br><br>If I go there I will eat dumplings (guo tei) and craypot rice.</div>

Other than that, the rice is decent and the chicken worthwhile.<br><br>Those i think are worth the try apart from Xin Ji include:<br><br>1. Chicken House (Thomson Road, near DINO's pastry)<br>2. Wee Nam Kee (Opp Novena Church)<br>3. Bugis St Chicken Rice (Longhouse at Thomson Road)<br>4. Boon Tong Kee (if you have cash to spend)<br>5. Meiling St Chicken Rice (Ex-margaret drive)<br><br>In my opinion, Wee Nam Kee has overtaken Boon Tong Kee as the #1 best chicken rice in SG.<br><br>Loy Kee Best is very ordinary and not worth my money.<br><br>Ex Mr Chatterbox outlet at downtown east: Having previously worked at the chatterbox coffeehouse myself, the one thing i like about his style is his fragrant rice. I think he really scores on this one. It would indeed be the best rice i've tasted of all the chicken rice stalls in SG, partly also because he seems to prefer half-grain over full-grain.<br><br>I have not personally tried the Kampung Chicken at Outram but tks to your review, i will definitely give it a try.<br><br>I used to eat from the Ming Kee stall during sec sch days. Haven't been there in a while. During those days, it was indeed good...so good i used to whack a half chicken all by myself!<br><br>Yee Cheong Yuen is new to me. Will 'stomp' by one of these days to try it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking chicken rice, I took pics of Downtown East, Mr chicken Rice, Ming Kee at Bishan - the one Bryan Wong did his show on recently, Kampung Chicken House, the current favourite amongst my group of makan kakis and Yee Cheong Yuen.<br><br>My take.  Yee Cheong Yuen at Holland V has the best chicken!  The flesh is so tasty you wonder if they soak the chicken in brine before cooking.  Their chilli is the shiokest of the lot. BUT it is not a chicken rice shop, they sell hor fun.<br><br>Those interested can see the various pics here:<br><br>http://ieatishootipost.blogspot.com/search/label/Chicken%20Rice<br><br>Now other contenders are:<br><br>1.  Tian Tian Chicken at Maxwell Road FC - the one Anthony Bourdain went to<br>2.  Tong Fatt - several branches.  I tried the one at ABC FC - quite nice but not the best<br>3.  Five Star - Various - previous fav amongst my group of kakis<br>4.  Yet Con - at Purvis street - for those who like Steamed Chicken, looks ugly but tastes real "nostalgic" ie tastes as original as the coffee shop it is housed in.</div>

Not really tasty but for healthy people, it's decent. Steamboat is nice though it is rather squeezy.<br><br>Tian Tian is forever closed when i go and they never open for late nights! Heard they sell out their chicken in record time and close shop after. Queues are long too.<br><br>I have generally no comment on 5 star, smacks of a franchise outlet with exhorbitantly priced chicken rice. Boon Tong Kee used to be great, after they franchised, standard seriously dropped. Only their chilli remains good.</div>
