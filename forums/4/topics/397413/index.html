              <p>This stall is faces the main road and is near the end towards the further carpark away from Harbourfront.  It is a middle aged Chinese couple selling fried oysters with egg and hokkien mee.</p>
              <p>Had an unpleasant experience just tonight.  Told the man doing the frying I wanted a plate of hokkien mee.  Within about 5 seconds, I changed my mind and told them I didn't want.  The guy had not started cooking the mee yet, and they did not say anything about having cooked the mee.</p>
              <p>I ordered fried rice from a Muslim stall from the other end and brought near to this side where I was originally sitting.  The fried rice was not very good, so I decided this time to order the hokkien mee.</p>
              <p>Imagine my surprise when the couple reacted very violently.  The man scolded me and said he will not sell to me.  Reason is because he said had to throw the mee that he cooked earlier.  But as I mentioned, I had changed my mind in an instant previously (how long do you need), but he had not cooked the mee yet.  (Unless you can cook mee without moving your arms!)</p>
              <p>The woman also scolded me and when I said they could not refuse to sell to anyone in particular, she reacted more violently.  I was tired after a hard day's work so I walked away and went to sit down at my table to decide what other food I can order instead.</p>
              <p>Imagine my surprise when the woman continued berating me and told passers-by that I was a bad guy or something.  Totally uncalled for and frankly speaking when I said I didn't want the mee - the man had not cooked it yet and he also did not tell me there and then that he had already cooked it, otherwise I would have taken it.</p>
              <p>But I certainly find the couple's behaviour really unpleasant and will not order from their stall in future.</p>

              <p>Whether he started cooking or not, and whether its 5 seconds or not its your side of the story against theirs.</p>
              <p>Sure you had a long day at work, but so had they, unless your work is the same as theirs, standing in front of a hot wok, cooking all day.</p>
              <p>Frankly, if I were the hawker, I'll be pissed with you too.</p>

              <p>You have insulted them and yet you have the audacity to come here to complain. Shame on you.</p>
              <p>You think your couple of bucks very big ah ? Grow up ok.</p>
              <p>They may be food sellers, but they take pride in the food they cook.</p>
              <p>Hawkers has the right to refuse any customer. So you truly deserved it.</p>
              <p>Next time you want to be treated like a emperor, don't go hawker center.. go expensive restaurants .  What a cheapskate you are.</p>
              <p>Really, it's the hawker having a bad experience with idiots like you.</p>
