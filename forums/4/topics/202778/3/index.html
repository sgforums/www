Lastnight, I went to this Singha Inn for buffet dinner with my colleagues as it is quite near to my office. Actually i was the one suggested to go there cos been there a couple of times on weekend. They usually serve u lobster &amp; drunken prawn (1 serving per table) as well as some bbq items like chicken wings, hotdogs &amp; etc. But heck man, last night, there were no lobster, no bbq. Worst of all, three of us were early so we makan first. The waitress brought us the usual stuff which include crab, scallop but got no pork, no liver for the three of us. At the later part, 2 more colleagues joined us so we ask to waitress to bring on more food. Bloody hell, the waitress just simply serve us with so yong tau hu &amp; some cuttlefish. We ask for the crab, she said no more. We ask for scallop, she also said no more. I nearly blew my top &amp; shouted at her what she has. She said those things lor, have one already take out (some beef &amp; fish). Nabei... there were only three table with less than 15 customers &amp; they have the cheek to say no more. Phui...

Are you wearing all white on Friday? I was there. Food wise not bad but the variety a bit limited though. I was there quite early (around 6:40pm) &amp; the food were all frozen.
