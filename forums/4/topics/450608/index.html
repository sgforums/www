              <p>By <span class="fn">Melissa Aw</span> | <span class="provider org">Yahoo! Newsroom</span> – <abbr title="2012-04-13T02:15:21Z">1 hour 58 minutes ago</abbr></p>
              <p>Marine photographer Michael Aw has a bold dream -- for Singapore to ban shark’s fin by the end of 2013.<br><br>The 56-year-old, who will be launching a “No Shark Fins Singapore” nationwide campaign at Asia Dive Expo on Marina Bay Sands
               on Friday, hopes to convince all Chinese restaurants to remove shark’s 
              fin from their menus. He also hopes to convince 50 companies -- hotels 
              and major corporations -- to support the cause.  <br><br>Speaking to <em>Yahoo! Singapore </em>earlier this week, he said, “We can do it. Let it be a Singaporean initiative and let us be the first Asian country to do this.”<br><br>Asked
               why he feels so strongly about the issue, Aw related his experiences as
               an underwater photographer and scuba diving instructor where he had 
              personally witnessed the depletion of sharks through the years.<br><br>“When I first started diving in 1981, there were plenty of sharks -- in Malaysian waters, Tioman and even around Raffles Lighthouse in Singapore,” he said. “But in the late ‘80s, there were no more sharks.”<br><br>“Sharks
               reproduce very, very slowly… it’s just not possible to sustain the kind
               of demand that we have for shark’s fin,” he added.<br><br>Aw described 
              the way that sharks were being culled for their fins and then discarded 
              back into the waters alive as “cruel” and “wastage”.<br><br>“There is 
              absolutely no nutritional value in the fin, and it’s basically just 
              ‘fashion’ more than food. [Actually], it’s not even food.”<br><br>Aw 
              also stressed that since sharks are already regionally extinct, more 
              effort needs to be pumped into encouraging the conservation of sharks, 
              especially with hundreds being culled daily for their fins.<br><br>“They’ve very important in the ocean because like the lion or the cheetah of the Savannah, they keep nature in balance”.<br><br><strong>Strong online support</strong><br><br>It seems Aw is not the only one who feels so strongly about the issue.<br><br>In
               January, he started an online petition to encourage Singaporeans to 
              pledge their support for banning shark’s fin by next year. Within two 
              weeks, the online effort had garnered an impressive 80,000 supporters.<br><br>When supermarket giants NTUC and Carrefour made the decision to take shark’s fin off their shelves earlier this year, Aw realised “that was the moment” to create an online petition to “take it to the next level”.<br><br>“And we went viral within the week,” he added, with a hint of unmistakable pride.<br><br>In the time since, Aw has recruited MediaCorp actress and Miss Singapore Universe 2009 Jessica Tan to be the face of his “No shark’s fin by 2013” campaign.<br><br>Underwater photographs of the actress posing with at least 50 sharks at the Bahamas taken earlier this year will be unveiled on Friday.<br><br><strong>Progressive action plan</strong><br><br>Aw,
               who hasn’t eaten shark’s fin for more than 20 years, stressed that the 
              campaign needs to follow a “progressive action plan” with specific 
              targets.<br><br>Once he has managed to convince Chinese restaurants and 
              at least 50 companies to support his cause, he plans to petition openly 
              for the government to ban shark’s fin by 2013.<br><br>Part of he and five-member team’s effort involves educating the young about sharks.<br><br>He plans to recruit 1,000 kids from the ages of 7 to 14 to assemble at Resorts World Sentosa in November to pledge: “I am the future, I won’t eat shark’s fin”.<br><br>Explained
               Aw: “The younger generation is the future. If we educate them, 
              hopefully … we will [soon] have a generation of non shark’s fin 
              consumers.”<br><br>Although he proclaimed that he was “101 per cent” 
              confident of his campaign’s success, he admitted that it would not be 
              easy convincing the relevant authorities to completely ban shark’s fin 
              in Singapore’s consumerist market.<br><br>“Sharks do not have a very 
              good reputation. You can’t protect an animal if you don’t understand it.
               We have to promote the true image of sharks -- they're not man-eaters.”</p>

              <p>What kind of bullshit is this?</p>
              <p>There is so many species of sharks, the guy just wan to ban all sharks fins! The depletion of the sharks is due to global warming. And do he know that sharks is the predator of all the other fishes, capping the amount of fishes in the water. Killing more sharks means more fishes for humans.</p>
              <p>Shark fin is full of collagens and it has anti-aging properties. Eat more of it can help to mantain your youth and give you healthy joints.</p>
              <p>We should promote the campaign of eating shark fins. First, eating shark fin keep you young and beautiful. Second, it make you safer when you do diving. Third, we have more fishes for our future generations. Is it good?</p>

              <p>Michael Aw is arrogant to launch this campaign. His campaign must be defeated.</p>
