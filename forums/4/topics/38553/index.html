            <div class='col-md body'>was looking for a online version for the book but couldn't, so i type this personally.<br>this is taken from david french's "Everything is bad for you : An A-Z Guide to What You Never Knew Could Kill You"<br><br>this book can be found in MPH bookstore<br><br>_____________________________________________________<br><br><strong>Bread</strong><br>Sliced bread doesn't deserve its great reputation. If you're sensitive to gluten, eating bread can give you headaches or loss of coordination. Scientists from the U.S. and Australia have theorized that the refined starches in bread could increase insulin levels, which might make your eyeballs too long and lead to shortsightedness.<br><br><strong>Carrots</strong><br>Having good night vision may not be worth it: smokers who eat carrots increase their chances of lung cancer.<br><br><strong>Cheeses, Soft</strong><br>The spoonfuls of fat and thousands of calories may not be the only threat lurking in that Brie (Brand). The bacterium listeria monocytogenes can contaminate soft cheeses ( even if theyÂ’re refridgerated), causing flu-like symptons. When the bacterium infects pregnant women, it can lead to miscarriages or mental and physical damage to their fetuses.<br><br><strong>Charcoal Grills</strong><br>Those funny-looking hot dogs your brother-in-law always brings arenÂ’t the only danger at the family barbeque. In 1996, ninteen people in the U.S. died of poisoning by carbon monoxide from charcoal grills.<br><br><strong>Chocolate, Eating</strong><br>Eating chocolate is bad for you(surprise, surprise): itÂ’s low in fiber and high in calories, fat, and sugar.<br><br><strong>Chocolate, Not eating</strong><br>Chocolate contains antioxidant flavonoids that may help protect arteries and prevent heart disease- so not eating it is bad for you.(If youÂ’re premenstrual, not eating chocolate can also be bad for anyone near you.)<br><br><strong>Cholesterol, Too Little</strong><br>Have a hamburger. The death rate doubles for people with too little cholesterol.<br><br><strong>Cholesterol, Too much</strong><br>Put that hamburger down. The death rate doubles for people with too much cholesterol.<br><br><strong>Coffee, Drinking</strong><br>Drinking coffee can make anxiety and panic disorders worse, and itÂ’s been shown to harm the aorta. It also increases your risk of miscarriages and developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Drinking unfiltered coffee can increase cholesterol levels. Smokers who drinks coffee increase their risk of lung cancer. How has our society survived this long?<br><br><strong>Coffee, Not Drinking</strong><br>People who donÂ’t drink  are more likely to contract ParkinsonÂ’s are more likely to contract ParkinsonÂ’s disease and, especially if they smoke, cancer of the bladder.<br><br>_____________________________________________________<br><br>i personally think each individual react differently to different kinds of foods, and not everyone suffers or die from eating them.<br><br>enough for today, time for rest</div>

Low-carbohydrate diets may lead to ketosis, which can cause bad breath, nausea, and a nasty taste in the mouth. And low-fat diets can give you a whole variety of health problems.<br><br><strong>Dish Cloths</strong><br>More proof that CLEANLINESS is bad for you:the cloths you use to dry dishes can serve as breeding grounds for the organisms that causes salmonella, campylobacter, and viral infections.<br><br><strong>Dollar bills </strong><br>Bill gates probably wouldnÂ’t agree, but money is bad for you. A study found that one dollar bill in fourteen was contaminated by microbes that could cause serious illness, while 90 percent carried germs, including the notorious Â“flesh eating bugÂ”.<br><br><strong>Drinking</strong><br>For young people, drinking can lead to violence(90 percent of all rapes on college campuses involve alcohol) or serious accidents (alcohol-related accidents are the leading causes of death amonmg fifteen-to-twenty-four-year-olds). Children born to drinking mothers can suffer from fetal alcohol syndromes, whose symptoms include low birthrate, distorted facial features, stunted growth, and mental retardation that may be irreversible. In a study of accidents in wilderness area, alcohol played a significant role in one-half of all fatalities. Alcohol abusers are at particular risk of developing conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome and hypertension. Even moderate drinking may make you more likely to suffer brain atrophy, which is associated with reduced neurological and cognitive function. Now put that traffic cone back where you got it.<br><br><strong>Drinking, Not</strong><br>Great Excuse of the Day: if you donÂ’t drink, youÂ’re more likely to get diabetes, heart disease, and cancer(if itÂ’s red wine that youÂ’re not drinking) than people who do. Not drinking may also make you more likely than moderate drinkers to suffer white matter infarcts, which are associated with reduced neurological and cognitive function.<br><br><strong>Drinks, Hot</strong><br>Drinking hot beverages increase your risk of esophageal cancer. If you think reaching for something iced gets you off the hook, though, youÂ’re wrong.<br><br>Cancer:Abnormal cell growth<br>_____________________________________________________<br><br>typing 135 pages of the book is going to kill me, last post <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
