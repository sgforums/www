            <div class='col-md body'>Le P'tit Breton in the news (SunDay Times) today.<br><br>Customer forced out of restaurant after spat with chef<br><br>She had 'complained loudly' when told drinks from outside were not allowed<br><br>By Sarah Ng<br>Sep 10, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>A QUIET dinner at a quiet restaurant in Upper Thomson Road turned ugly on Friday night when a spat broke out between the chef and a customer.<br>Teacher Ang Ai Min, 43, claims she was left with bruises on both her arms after the chef at the Le P'tit Breton, a French crepe restaurant at Thomson Imperial Court, physically forced her from the premises during an argument.<br><br>The problem started because Mrs Ang's two sons had brought a drink into the restaurant.<br><br>The co-owner of the two-year-old restaurant, Ms Sabrina Tan, 42, told her that drinks bought outside were not allowed in the eatery.<br><br>Ms Tan said: 'She told me off and said that I was picky.<br><br>'She also said that her sons did not drink in the restaurant. Then she stood up and said loudly that she was not eating at our restaurant anymore.'<br><br>Ms Tan said that Mrs Ang was still complaining loudly when she walked past the open-concept kitchen in the middle of the restaurant.<br><br>'Our chef told her to keep quiet, but she continued with her complaining and was taking her time to leave the restaurant,' said Ms Tan.<br><br>Mrs Ang alleges that the chef then grabbed her and forced her out.<br><br>She told The Sunday Times yesterday: 'We were leaving when the chef waved a spatula at me and told me that I can't talk so loudly in his restaurant. He also told me to get out.<br><br>'So I asked him why I can't talk loudly, and before I knew it he grabbed my arms from behind and yanked me out of the door,' she said.<br><br>'It all happened so quickly. I was so shocked that I didn't even scream for help.'<br><br>She called the police while outside the restaurant and later went to see a doctor for her bruises.<br><br>'I want people to know that such behaviour is unacceptable. How can anyone lay his hands on another person, not to mention using brute force on a customer?' she said.<br><br>Ms Tan said: 'The chef probably grabbed her arms, but it was not for no reason.'<br><br>She said that Mrs Ang had created a scene by complaining so loudly inside the quiet, 24-seater restaurant while making her way out.<br><br>She added: 'Our restaurant is a small and cosy place with a quiet ambience and we have to consider how other diners might feel about the noise.'<br><br>The police confirmed that they received a call from Mrs Ang at 7.35pm on Friday.<br><br>They will be following up with the case.</div>
