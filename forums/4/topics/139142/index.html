Among Europeans they are some of the worst bigots i encountered. Rome never warmed up and thankfully i only spent 3 nights there...better to take off to greece, nicer people, better surroundings, more gracious.<br><br>There are ice-cream outlets all over the place. But the outlet i went to was closest to the Trevi Fountain. Can't miss it. Place is a tourist magnet. And yes there were sit-in tables outside the joint.<br><br></div>
