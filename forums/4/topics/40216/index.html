            <div class='col-md body'>The news said yesterday that the cause of the SARS virus is suspected to be from a wild game animal(s) which a chef in China has been in contact with.<br><br>Now what can be learnt from this incident?<br>What God has not given us for food (in the Jewish dietary law), we better not eat. One of the reasons why the animals forbidden to the Jews were forbidden was that they are not suitable for human consumption.<br><br>Eg: the pig. The pig eats whatever kind of food it can eat (including shit, refuse or whatever filthy stuff). And do you think this kind of food will make it a healthy animal? Do you know that the average pig has many diseases? Do you know that the pig has excretion outlets for the toxins it accumulates in its body, namely greenish discharges on its feet? Do you know that the pig is a host of numerous parasites? Do you know that farm animals that were given pork products instead of some other food they are usually fed on can die from food poisoning? Do you know that the pig is FAT?<br><br>Other stuff that we should not eat include:<br>-Organs and offal. I havenÂ’t found scientific basis for this, but to be safe, donÂ’t eat them.<br>-Fat, especially "fat that covereth the inwards" (Chinese: ban(3) you(2), literally "board fat"). Used for some types of Tim Sum. Some research show that this kind of fat is different biochemically from subcutaneous fat.<br>-Blood. Blood carries diseases and other harmful substances. When you are suspected of a serious disease, which part of the body do you check? ItÂ’s the blood!<br><br>Creatures that are Clean and may be eaten<br>-Animals that part the hoof, cloven footed and chews the cud namely:<br>-Cow, Deer, Lamb, Caribou, Buffalo, Elk, Goat, Moose.<br>-Fish that have fins and scales namely:<br>-Bass, Bluefish, Crappie, Perch, Pike, Salmon, Sunfish, Trout.<br>-Birds that are clean namely: Chicken, Turkey, Pheasant, Grouse, Quail<br>-Clean creeping animals namely: Locusts, Cricket, Grasshopper<br><br>Creatures that are not clean and may not be eaten<br>-Animals that do not do all of these: part the hoof, cloven footed and chews cud namely: Pig (pork), Rabbit, Raccoon, Squirrel, Monkey, Dog, Coyote, Fox, Wolf, Lion, Tiger, Horse, Mule, Zebra, Bear, Camel, Elephant, Llama, Hippo, Kangaroo<br>-Water creatures that do not have fins and scales: Catfish, Eel, Marlin, Shark, Abalone, Clam, Crab, Crayfish, Lobster, Oyster, Shrimp, Jellyfish, Squid, Dolphin, Seal, Whale<br>-Unclean Birds: Bat, Eagle, Osprey, Raven, Duck, Swan, Vulture<br>-Unclean creeping animals: Frog, Toad, Crocodile, Lizard, Snake, Turtle, Salamander, Newt, Snail<br><br>The point is that some animals were given for man to be eaten, some were not. Those that are not meant to be eaten have some other purpose in the ecosystem, like cleaning up the environment for the pig. If we try to defy nature by eating whatever we like, we are going to ruin our health. To preserve our health, follow the natural way, eat whatever God  has given man to eat and be content. Do you know that Jews who follow strictly the Jewish dietary law have one of the lowest incidence of cancer and other dreaded diseases?<br><br>Note that I am not trying to instill anger or hatred to non-Christians or non-Jews or whoever eats the unclean foods defined by the Jewish dietary law, I am just concerned about the health of the general public. I am stating this not from a religious point of view, but from a scientific point of view.<br><br>Cheers.<br>Herman<br><br>References:<br>http://www.giveshare.org/Health/porkeatdanger.html<br>http://www.ellenwhite.org/contra2.htm<br>http://www.zoomnet.net/~bbratt/udonteat.html<br>http://www.geocities.com/porkfatal/<br>http://www.homesteadingtoday.com/homestead/Countryside/Wc5e0734120a82.htm<br><br>God's Key to Health &amp; Happiness, ELMER A JOSEPHSON http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800750187/heartofwisdompub/102-9041211-5763318<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>circumcision is a mark of the jews, given by God. of course now its a circumcision of the heart. an inward obedience not just an outward obedience. wats wrong with the jews anyway?<br><br>and its true. the bible did say that certain animals should be avoided for health sake. of course eating them is nothing wrong spiritually. but for health sake lor. its nothing wrong to eat them, and nothing wrong not to eat them. just take it with a pinch of salt. pun intended,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
