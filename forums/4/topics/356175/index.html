              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Great breakfasts in the CBD that give you a reason to rise and shine.<br>By Belinda Wan, photography by Richard Lee</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/454/10-dining.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">You know what they say—breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But for most of us, breakfast (if we have it at all, that is) is a hurried affair that we rush in the midst of our early morning stupor. Which explains why loads of folks choose to leave home without breakfast, reach work early and then grab breakfast near their workplace in a more leisurely fashion. We’ve singled out some nice breakfasts in the CBD at hidden haunts where you can grab a bite quickly and easily. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Breakfast Stall </strong><br><strong>Where:</strong> Central area, Lau Pa Sat, 18 Raffles Quay. <br><strong>What: </strong>A large stall right smack in the middle of the decidedly hot and humid Lau Pa Sat. <br><strong>The morning vibe: </strong>There is seemingly no stall number at this place (yes, we did ask). But anyway, you won’t be able to miss it—it’s right in the middle of Lau Pa Sat. Selling a large selection of breakfast items, hot beverages and freshly-made fruit juices, this is a one-stop stall for the busy yuppie. But beware—when we dropped by, the breakfast queue was already snaking round the stall. The vibe is busy, brisk and fuss-free. Line up, order, pay and get your items. <br><strong>The grub: </strong>The stall is quite savvy in promoting itself—its menu is in English, Japanese and Malay. We picked set D—comprising two slices of French toast and a cup of kopi or teh for only $2.50. Now that’s a fab deal. The freshly-made French toast pieces were yummy, with a salty-sweet taste. We liked that the toast was not too soggy or eggy, and not too burnt either. The coffee arrived in the familiar green-patterned, old school cup and saucer, and tasted just as old school. It was comforting, flavorful and not too sour—just the way we like it. <br><strong>In an eggshell: </strong>With its cheap prices and great old school breakfast, this one is worth visiting in the morning. But roll up your sleeves, sit near one of the ceiling fans and be prepared to wait for a while. Or just da pao (takeaway). </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Fou de FaFa </strong><br><strong>Where: </strong>#01-05 Capitol Tower, 168 Robinson Rd., 6327-9418. <br><strong>What: </strong>A funky, individualistic café that calls to you the minute you walk by with its loud, proud shop front, bright colors and inspiring philosophy. A large banner outside reads “Welcome to a New Year of Possibilities.” <br><strong>The morning vibe:</strong> Helmed by Lara Jay Hequet (a holistic nutritionist), everything about Fou de FaFa is larger than life and designed to shock, or just perk you up. An inverted clock peeps over the counter, a large gilt mirror looms out of you from nowhere, there are quirky knick-knacks everywhere; and the menu is huge and witty (a line there reads “variances are subject to moods and tantrums”). They serve cocoa brews, herbal teas, “magic potions,” single-note juices, zero degrees (iced, snowed and “funfilled” drinks), sandwiches, desserts and, yes, breakfast specials. If you’re feeling nutty (appropriately “Fou” means “crazy” and the shop’s name means “to just be crazy”), feel free to ask the staff for other services—like a hug, or “an intelligent conversation”—all humorously listed on the menu hanging over the counter. It’s all zany, kooky and inspiring, and you’ll be smiling to yourself at all the good, happy vibes coming your way. <br><strong>The grub: </strong>Although there are special breakfast items, we settled on the tomato mozzarella quiche with a side salad ($8.50) and the Fou’s Lifeline (beetroot, lemon and cucumber, $7)—both of which easily make up a breakfast. The quiche was the yummiest we’d had in yonks; and we wolfed it down in a jiffy. All the ingredients were obviously fresh and blended nicely together to form a delicious, flaky (but not soggy) quiche. The drink was not too bad too—you’ll instantly feel healthier after you drink it, but if you’re not into the raw taste of beetroot, you might want to try something else. <br><strong>In an eggshell:</strong> Drop by and take time to decide on what you want from the extensive menu. Dishes can be modified to suit your dietary preferences too. And although the prices here are slightly higher here than the ubiquitous kopitiam, this is really a one-of-a-kind place worth checking out. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Sööma Coffeehouse<br>Where:</strong> #01-04 China Square Central, 3 Pickering St., 6224-2559. <br><strong>What:</strong> A small, inconspicuous café tucked away in China Square specializing in coffee and breakfast items. <br><strong>The morning vibe: </strong>Tiny but cozy, this café means “to taste with pleasure” in Estonian (look out for the full definition printed on the right hand bottom of the wall filled with autographs). A large number of expats frequent this year-old café, taking away well-brewed cups of espressos, lattes and cappuccinos. Filled with a sofa seat at the back, and mostly small tables and high stools in front, funny posters like “GOD” (“Grind On Demand”) adorn the black and red shop, and one side of the wall is filled with scrawls from happy patrons, avid coffee lovers and random MediaCorp artistes. The service is also extremely chirpy and friendly too. And oh, the jazz music they play is pretty relaxing. And what’s more, there is no GST or service charge here—but feel free to tip. There’s even a delivery service for office folks chained to their desks. <br><strong>The grub:</strong> There are loads of breakfast items on the menu, especially bagels; but we felt inclined toward the breakfast set consisting of scrambled eggs, ham and toast ($4.90), as well as a Café Latte ($4.60) that came imbued with a cute leaf coffee design on the froth. The scrambled eggs were the right consistency but could have been a little saltier. The ham was pretty alright and the toast, which arrived sprinkled with herbs, was crispy and tasty enough. The latte wasn’t exactly cheap, but it did not disappoint: It was suitably fragrant, slightly bitter and frothy. And yes, it did live up to its tagline of “Simply Good Coffee.” <br><strong>In an eggshell: </strong>This little hideaway is a fab place to get some reprieve and start your morning, before reality kicks in. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Zest Salad and Juice Bar </strong><br><strong>Where:</strong> #B1-18, 8 Shenton Way Building, 8 Shenton Way, 6220-9036. <br><strong>What: </strong>A salad and juice joint hidden in the basement of an office block. <br><strong>The morning vibe: </strong>With a distinct Aussie vibe and liberal use of green, the year-old Zest does look somewhat fresh, but would do better to brighten its basement lighting a little. You can get a sandwich or salad made for you at the counter. Loads of breakfast sets featuring eggs Benedict, toasties, pancakes, scrambled eggs and more are available too. Add $1 to upgrade to a juice, coffee or tea. Come lunchtime, you can grab pre-prepared salads (choices include the Nicoise, Bushranger and the popular Chicken G.I.) and sandwiches, but for breakfast, everything is made à la minute. <br><strong>The grub: </strong>We went for one of the sets—the pancakes with maple syrup and brewed coffee ($4). The pancakes were a bit like roti pratas and could definitely have done with being browner, fluffier and sweeter; while the coffee was alright, if a bit hard-tasting. We suspect that pancakes are probably not their strong point, and they fare better with their yogurt pots, salads, juices and sandwiches. Coffee addicts take note: There are no lattes, cappuccinos or espressos here—only regular coffee—which was a bit of a pity. But the chicken and mushroom pie ($4.90) we tried was something else. The crust was just firm enough and the filling was delicious: Juicy chicken chunks and large bits of mushrooms. <br><strong>In an eggshell: </strong>Zest is a better breakfast choice if you like pies, salads, sandwiches and juices, rather than traditional breakfast.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Chain Offerings</strong><br>Many major coffee and kopitiam chains, and even fast food outlets have good grub to help you start your day. Here are some more. </span></p>
