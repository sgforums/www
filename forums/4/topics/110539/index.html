            <div class='col-md body'>not me<br><br><blockquote>Many people believe they are allergic or sensitive to MSG, and it has been blamed for causing a wide variety of physical symptoms such as migraines, nausea, digestive upsets, drowsiness, heart palpitations, asthma and a myriad of other complaints all the way up to anaphylactic shock. Symptoms that have sometimes been mistaken for heart attacks or allergic reactions are sometimes called "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome". A considerable amount of research and testing into MSG allergies has been performed over the past few decades, and the vast majority of controlled studies show no link at all between glutamate in food and any allergic reaction. Critics of the testing believe that the tests were unfairly biased towards finding no result. In particular, they consider flawed a 1993 study in which aspartame was used in the placebo, because aspartame itself has been accused of causing many of the same symptoms as MSG sensitivity in susceptible people, and also because volunteers with asthma, allergies, migraines or other symptoms of potential susceptibility were automatically excluded from the test group. Some researchers have suggested that specific individuals might be hypersensitive to MSG while others are entirely unaffected by it, but no conclusive results have emerged along those lines.<br><br>Alternatively, some (especially those in alternative medicine) consider MSG to be a potent neurotoxin which is yielding mass neurological retardation in affected populations.<br><br>The United States Food and Drug Administration lists monosodium glutamate as "generally recognized as safe", along with salt, vinegar, baking powder, and sodium tripolyphosphate. In East Asia, it is sometimes included in nutritional supplements.<br><br>Despite this, many American Chinese restaurants have taken to advertising "No MSG" menus. More traditional establishments both in Western countries and in China make no such efforts, but gourmet chefs tend to view the excessive usage of MSG as cheating and some of the more opinionated ones eschew it entirely.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The misconception is that MSG is always an added ingredient to make food tastier. BUT MSG is actually already present in alot of food and I dun mean added MSG.  Like for Chicken, when you cook or boil it, itself contains MSG. When those restaurants or food items that says No MSG, they are actually breaking a regulation here in Singapore but in here Singapore, most probably you would see is no ADDED MSG, which means other than the natural MSG that comes from the food itself, they do not add in those "POWDER" or "FLAKES" or "AJINOMOTO"  which we generically call MSG.</div>
