              <p>i think there should be more regulations regarding land zoning and rental cost.</p>
              <p>depending on industry, you can't expect everyone to earn a equal amount of money every month.</p>
              <p>e.g. an eatery would earn far less than let say, a mechanic workshop, a law firm, a clinic etc.</p>
              <p>an eatery is more labour intensive, where the owner only earns a few cents for every plate of dish he sells. compare this to a lawyer where he makes hundreds of dollar every hour simply doing paperwork.</p>
              <p>even though both might be located in a prime location, it does not justify the need to raise the eatery's rent to be on par with that of a law firm.</p>
              <p>and shopkeepers requires location with high traffic flow, in prime locations. thus, it is not by their choice to choose atas locations to do business.</p>
              <p>i.e. would you frequent a shop located inside kaki bukit industrial park, where the rent is cheaper compared to malls etc?</p>
              <p>it is very unfair to penalise low-earning industries with high rental, which effectively drives up cost of living, since some of these industries are "necessities". i.e. without your eatery, where would you have lunch if your working far away from home?</p>
              <p>can you imagine working in a CBD where there are no foodcourts, eateries, etc? you would end up starving everyday at work.</p>

              <p>it has already happened long ago....  examples like SIM, SMU and schools that opened after 2005. <br><br>Some newer secondary schools already have food selling $2 and above... and their portion is like 1/3 less than the food u eat outside (hawker centre/food court).. which makes it about close to $3.</p>

              <p>but now, other than a small group of people who pay cheap rents to NEA, most are paying $2-4K/mnth for a tiny shop space to private landlords.</p>
              <p>for dry market,  its worse. i found out from a butcher that he has to pay $5k rent every month just for his tiny counter within the shop. he has to share it with the groccer, fruit seller, poultry seller and the fishmonger, and each have to pay 5k.</p>

              <p>raw produce is cheaper than ready made meals..</p>
              <p>else the stalls cannot make money enough to pay the rent, much less make a living..</p>
