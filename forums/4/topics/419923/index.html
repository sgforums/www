              <p><strong>The growing number of corporate-run air-conditioned food 
              courts that sell higher quality food may portend the start of a more 
              lavish, materialistic lifestyle.</strong></p>
              <p>The deepening trend of price increases in Singapore appears to be 
              laying siege to the remaining bastion of cheap eating – the small food 
              stall.</p>
              <p>I am referring to the thousands of small eating places in 
              neighbourhood coffee shops and hawker centres that traditionally provide
               cheap meals for the masses.</p>
              <p>It is an institution that makes life in one of the most expensive cities in the world more livable.</p>
              <p>Mostly run by families or individuals, these stalls dish out, for 
              only a few dollars, some of the most exotic Asian dishes, with diversity
               unmatched in many other countries.</p>
              <p>Even as the cost of living soars, the Singaporean’s daily meal 
              remains within reach of most workers and students – thanks to these 
              hawkers and a system.</p>
              <p>For as little as S$3-S$5 (RM7-RM12) a dish, the average Singa­porean 
              can have a simple meal quickly every day – and at prices less than in 
              most advanced Western cities.</p>
              <p>Recently, a spate of reports indicated that this last bastion of 
              cheap food is under siege by forces trying to push prices higher.</p>
              <p>So far, the wall has largely stood firm – and Singaporeans can still 
              have a meal for S$5 or S$6 (RM14) – but parts of it may have been 
              breached.</p>
              <p>The first threat is the growing number of corporate-run 
              air-conditioned food courts that sell higher quality food at S$7-$10, 
              (RM17-RM24) and eating into the hawkers’ profits.</p>
              <p>These are pulling away professionals and white-collar workers so 
              successfully that a few vendors are tempted to be a little too ambitious
               – selling food at restaurant prices.</p>
              <p>A great deal of anger recently arose following reports that one stall was charging S$17 (RM40) for a bowl of <em>laksa </em>that normally costs S$3.</p>
              <p>In exuberant mood, some other stalls have joined in – selling <em>nasi padang</em> at S$13 (RM31) and prawn noodle at S$11 (RM26), all unheard of until now.</p>
              <p>The practice is being pushed in a few cases into the heartland hawker centres.</p>
              <p>A Bedok stall reportedly charges S$6.60 (RM15.60) for a packet of <em>nasi lemak</em>, something that Bangladeshi workers perfunctorily pick up for S$1-S$1.20 (RM2.40-RM2.60) to bring to the worksite.</p>
              <p>“I hope this is not trend-setting,” exclaimed a nurse, who almost has all her meals out.</p>
              <p>“The day our hawkers start charging S$10 (RM24) for chicken rice, I’m done for!”</p>
              <p>So far, not too many are following suit.</p>
              <p>Most are level-headedly holding to their charges for fear of losing customers.</p>
              <p>In perspective, most suburban food-stalls and coffeeshops are still selling chicken rice or <em>laksa</em> for S$3, and a cup of coffee for S$1.</p>
              <p>This battle to draw the line is being watched with concern by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The food stalls have been a government triumph from many years ago, 
              started to replace an army of street vendors selling food house to 
              house.</p>
              <p>That Singapore could provide a worker’s meal for S$5 is really a bit 
              of a wonder – considering the country imports 90% of its food needs.</p>
              <p>But with the government’s preoccupation of maximising gross domestic 
              product (GDP) growth, few are prepared to predict the future direction 
              of the hawker stall and cheap meals.</p>
              <p>At last count, some 13,500 licences had been granted to run 
              shop-stalls (at privately-owned coffeeshops) and a further 14,100 given 
              out to food stalls at 30 government-operated food centres.</p>
              <p>A general fear is that, given the govt’s corporate-mindedness, it may
               one day transfer the whole food business to the private sector, and 
              that could spell an end to the era of the S$3-S$5 meal.</p>
              <p>One major threat is imported inflation. In recent weeks, a cup of 
              coffee had risen by 10 to 20 cents, thanks to the global price hikes of 
              sugar and coffee as well as oil.</p>
              <p>Vendors, however, complain their woes are also largely caused by high rentals due to government policies.</p>
              <p>Take my estate, where I have lived for 26 years.</p>
              <p>In six months’ time, it will lose the third of its five coffeeshops, to make way for more profitable ventures.</p>
              <p>Two others had closed their doors in as many years, one replaced by a
               bank and the other by a mini-mart, both of which had offered the owners
               higher rentals.</p>
              <p>There has been little survey, and so it is not known how many of the 
              2,000 coffee shops in the republic have shared – or will share – this 
              fate. In the corporate world, few people see these places as an 
              important way of Singapore life.</p>
              <p>To me, the coffeeshop is a Singapore institution for social bonding 
              of residents – especially for retirees to meet and chat without costing 
              an arm and a leg.</p>
              <p>I don’t think it will ever become extinct, but what will disappear 
              will be the simple creatures that offer cheap food for people with a 
              modest income.</p>
              <p>Many of these smaller food stalls, which have helped keep costs down 
              for residents, are being ousted by bigger, stronger competitors who are 
              not too shy about raising prices.</p>
              <p>It is not just the slow passing of an era but the start of another – 
              of a more lavish, materialistic lifestyle that has fuelled America’s 
              financial woes.</p>
              <p>A financially well-off friend told me this could not be avoided 
              because higher prices are an indication of progress. But, I am not sure 
              many Singaporeans judge things this way – definitely not for their daily
               meals, anyway.</p>

              <p>Govt leases the land at high price to the developers. So they collect back in terms of high rental. Then tenants charge high prices and peasants suffer.</p>
              <p>11 years ago I was at clementi swimming complex. Went to the canteen for a coffee and chatted with the owner. He told me the rental was $9,000 a month! He makes about $10,000 plus net revenue. Looking from a business point of view, he has to work for free for $9000 before he even earns anything. And those of you who swim know how expensive their things are. Who benefits? SSC and of course the govt eventually.</p>
