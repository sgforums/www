            <div class='col-md body'>Got this from my email... For you food lovers..<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">MEET THE LEGENDS</span><br><br><strong>Haji Kadir &amp; M Baharudeen Sup Tulang </strong><br>#B1-13/15 Golden Mile Food Centre<br>Opens: 12.30pm to 1.30am, closed on alternate Wednesdays<br>The father of 44-year-old Mohd Iqbal is said to have invented sup tulang - mutton bone with marrow stewed in an explosive sauce of chillies, tomatoes and mutton stock - in the early 1950s.<br><br>In those days, his father threw in a free mutton bone with every order of mee kuah (spicy noodles). Slowly, customers started asking for only the mutton bone - and the dish was born.<br><br>This Indian-Muslim stall stands out from other tulang vendors for serving big bones packed with marrow and meat.<br><br><strong>Shukor Stall</strong><br>Stall 30, Serangoon Garden Market<br>Opens: 9.30am to 9.30pm, closed once a month on Thursday<br>Norhayati Shukor's father invented roti john in 1975 when the stall was located in Taman Serasi hawker centre, opposite the Botanic Gardens.<br><br>The idea was to attract expatriates who lived in the nearby Cluny Road area, by pan-frying slices of French loaf with eggs and onions. But locals grew to love it instead.<br><br>Since then, Norhayati, 37, and her brother have introduced chicken, beef and cheese to the dish to make it a more satisfying bite.<br><br><strong>Inspirasi Stall</strong><br>Block 207 New Upper Changi Road, #01-11<br><br>Opens: 12.30 to 9pm daily<br>Sermi Karjiwalawi, 75, has been selling soto ayam for several decades, using her late husband's Indonesian-style recipe.<br><br>There is no stinting of ingredients. The deliciously rich soup is made with bones, coconut milk and secret spices. The chicken pieces are hand-shredded - not cut - to retain their juicy texture. And the sambal chilli is made fresh at the stall.<br><br>Every day, a queue forms at her stall even before she raises the shutters at 12.30pm.<br><br><strong>Warong Sudir Mampir </strong><br>Block 14 Haig Road, #01-19<br>Opens: 10am to 7pm (weekdays), 10am to 5pm (weekends); closed on Wednesdays and Thursdays<br>Gunawan Baajoan, 49, and his four siblings uphold a family recipe that has been passed down from their grandfather, a street hawker in the 1940s.<br><br>Their satay follows the Indonesian style, which has bigger chunks of meat than the average variety.<br><br>The meats are carefully chosen, which contributes to their juicy texture. They are grilled over charcoal to a perfect charred-ness.<br><br>Their peanut gravy is robust, nutty and wonderfully thick. When you dig a stick in, the sauce stays on top of the meat and doesn't drip.<br><br><strong>Garden Street Kway Chap</strong><br>Stall 21, Serangoon Garden Market<br>Opens: 8am to 3pm, closed on Mondays<br>After arching over his chopping board for half a century, 67-year-old Koh Ah Soon is now hunchbacked.<br><br>He started selling kway chap with his father when he was just 12, in the now non-existent Garden Street in the Beach Road area. After he moved the stall to Blanco Court in 1980, it became commonly, but erroneously, called 'Blanco Court kway chap'. It attracted 30-minute queues and spawned copycat stalls.<br><br>Many have tried, but few have achieved, his cleaning and stewing techniques. Pork innards are stripped of their offensive odour and coaxed into a super smooth and tender consistency.<br><br>He took a short hiatus in 2002 and re-opened in Serangoon Gardens food centre in 2003. His son, Jason, 32, helps out.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nam Sing Hokkien Fried Mee </strong><br>Block 51 Old Airport Road, #01-155J<br>Opens: 11.30am to 8pm daily<br>Ng Hock Wah learnt his skills from his father when he was 12 and set up his own stall in Hougang when he was 17.<br><br>Now 58, he says the secret to his noodle dish is the attention he pays to the stock and his control over the fire.<br><br>Ingredients like prawn shells, ikan bilis, clams and garlic are added one by one at accorded times. The result is a taste so rich that he does not need lard, the short cut used by lesser hawkers.<br><br><strong>Ah Chuan Oyster Omelette</strong><br>TWO IN ONE: Ah Chuan Oyster Omelette boasts both crispy and mushy textures in one fabulous dish -- PHOTOS: MAKANSUTRA and DESMOND FOO<br><br>Block 22 Toa Payoh 7 #01-25<br>Opens: 3 to 9pm, closed on Tuesdays<br>Tan Hun Chua, 59, is the hawker whom other oyster omelette sellers admit is the one to beat.<br><br>Since learning the recipe from his brother more than 30 years ago, he has perfected a dish that boasts both crispy and mushy textures in one fabulous dish.<br><br>He laces his sweet potato flour mixture with a secret ingredient. He also uses only fat, juicy Korean oysters, and makes his own chilli sauce.<br><br><strong>Hai Sing Ah Balling</strong><br>Block 335 Smith Street, #02-90<br>Opens: Noon to 6pm, closed on Sundays<br>Loh Yeow Seng, 59, started helping at his father's stall in the now-demo- lished Ellenborough market, near Clarke Quay, more than 30 years ago.<br><br>The average waiting time was one hour because every glutinous rice ball was hand-made upon each order.<br><br>Eschewing machine-made convenience, he still makes them by hand today, and the difference is clear. The texture of the rice ball is so smooth that your lips could clamp down on one and it wouldn't stick to you.<br><br><strong>Ah Kow Mushroom Minced Pork Mee</strong><br>Block 531A Upper Cross Street, #02-43<br>Opens: 9am to 7pm daily<br>Cher Hang Peng, 59, has helped his father dish out this Teochew recipe since he was 10.<br><br>His expertise in noodle-blanching is awe- inspiring. It's so perfectly cooked that even if you let the bowl sit for a few minutes, the noodles would not clump up. Dig them up with your chopsticks and they will unravel beautifully.<br><br>Unlike other stalls that go heavy with the vinegar, he dashes just enough - he uses the same brand from China's Tianjin which his father used - for a balanced taste of savoury, spicy and sour.<br><br><strong>Hill Street Fried Kway Teow</strong><br>Block 16 Bedok South Road, #01-187<br>Opens: 10.30am to 7.30pm, closed on Mondays<br>Along with his sister, Ng Chang Siang, 60, helped his father run the stall when he was 16.<br><br>After moving from Hill Street hawker centre to Bedok South a few years ago, he still draws huge crowds every day with delicious noodles that boast an impeccable consistency that is neither too moist nor too dry.<br><br>It is achieved through his mastery over the flame. Using a custom-made flat wok which distributes heat evenly to the noodles, he is able to inject all the flavours of Chinese sausages, lard and chives into the noodles.<br><br></div>

As a result, her rice is plump, velvety and not too oily.<br><br>She only uses chickens heavier than 2kg, to ensure the texture is smooth and tender.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>PS: I'm not related to any of the stated stalls above... In fact I haven't even eat in some of the stalls stated, though I will be making a trip down to find out how good they really are...<br>But I figured it will be better to try these accaimed stalls than to waste $$ at F-up restaurants like S@k@e Sushi...</strong></span></div>
