              <h1>Campaign against bottled water borders on sheer idiocy</h1>
              <p>July 15, 2009 by admin</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Why is there no mention
              of soft drinks, the manufacture and disposal of which poses the same or
              even greater environmental risks as bottled water, and which, unlike
              bottled water, is genuinely unhealthy to the human body?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Also, shouldn’t the
              campaign be FOR water coolers to be installed all throughout the island
              and for people to bring their own reusable containers?<br> </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 15 July 2009</strong></p>
              <p>It was reported in the Straits Times article “<strong><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Singapore/Story/STIStory_402746.html?sunwMethod=GET">Bottled water: People should be told the facts</a></strong>”
              that the Australian town of Bundanoon, south of Sydney, voted to ban
              bottled water last Wednesday, and that<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> two individuals here are keen on
              campaigning for a similar move in Singapore. I was nothing short of
              flabbergasted when I read this.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Ms Leong Ching, a PhD student at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public
              Policy, and Professor Tommy Koh, chairman of the Governing Council of
              the Asia-Pacific Water Forum, are reportedly planning to lobby all
              ministries, statutory boards, Temasek-linked companies, and educational
              institutions to consider stopping the practice of serving bottled
              water, on the basis that bottled water wastes resources and harms the
              environment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Leong, a former journalist, said: “I can understand why they
              drink bottled water in countries where they have no choice. But it is
              senseless when the (tap) water is fit for drinking (as is the case for
              Singapore).”</p>
              <p>First off the bat, I have absolutely no objections to Government
              departments, statutory boards, and dining establishments such as
              restaurants providing only tap water as opposed to bottled water.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But if the campaign is also targetted at bottled water sold to the general public, it is nothing short of sheer idiocy.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Bottled water is an extremely hygenic, convenient and healthy means
              of hydrating the body when one is in public and is in need of a thirst
              quencher.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If bottled water is banned, wouldn’t that mean that people will
              instead have to opt for beverages like soft drinks, which are unhealthy
              as they tend to contain loads of sugar and other preservatives?</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I personally rely heavily on bottled water while not at home, as a
              source of hydration throughout the day and after exercise. Perhaps Ms
              Leong Ching and Professor Tommy Koh would rather that I spend even more
              money loading up on expensive soft drinks or caffeinated beverages
              instead.</p>
              <p>Without bottled water, if there is no water cooler nearby, I would
              have to go to the toilet to drink from the tap. Given the overall
              unhygienic state of public toilets in Singapore, I find that notion
              repulsive. Imagine calling ourselves a first world nation and then
              having to drink from a public toilet!</p>
              <p>Concerns over the environmental impact of bottled water are most
              probably misplaced as well. The greatest threat to the environment
              comes from carbon and toxic emissions from heavy industries. It is true
              that non-biodegradable plastics such as those used in bottled water
              also hurt the environment, but if so, shouldn’t the emphasis <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>be on soft
              drinks instead, as soft drinks are genuinely unhealthy to the human
              body and use <strong>both</strong></strong> metals and plastics for containers?</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>Rather than campaign to ban bottled water, Ms Leong Ching
              and Professor Tommy Koh should instead be campaigning for water coolers
              to be installed throughout the island and for people to bring their own
              reusable containers.</strong></p>
              <p>I simply do not understand why a campaign has to be directed against
              something so innocent as bottled water, when there are far greater
              environmental threats, when there are far unhealthier products in the
              marketplace, and when bottled water is of such convenience to people on
              the move.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I also take offence at the notion of individuals going around trying
              to ban something just because they dislike it.</strong></span></span> It infringes upon the
              right of others to make informed choices and insensitively disregards
              the fact that those choices may be an important part of the lifestyles
              of others.</p>
              <p>As reported in the Straits Times, the bottled water industry is
              extremely lucrative. Perhaps some soft drink manufacturers are feeling
              the heat as a result of people like myelf opting to drink bottled water
              as opposed to their sugar-laden concoctions.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Access to clean, healthy bottled water is to me a basic right. </strong></span></span>If Ms
              Leong Ching and Professor Tommy Koh insist on encroaching on my right
              to enjoy this magnificent product, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I will oppose them come hell or high
              water.</strong></span></span></p>
