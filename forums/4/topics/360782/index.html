            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have always wanted to try it but it was always crowded when it first opened. When I pass by yesterday during peak dinner time, I was initially surprised why it was so empty. So i decided to give it a try. There is one offer going on, where you order a first set meal (from $6.90 to $8.90) including a drink plus a minestrone soup, or salad, or somekind of mashed pumpkin dish.<br><br>When we first sat down, we have barely started looking at the menu and the waitress is already standing there asking for our orders. We ordered a pork cutlet curry rice with traditional curry, and a chicken cutlet with "healthy" curry where it was said to be cooked with milk instead of coconut milk. <br><br>We were served the soup first, and the minestrone was okay i would say (I mean what can go wrong with minestrone?). And when the main dish came, we got a shock. The pork cutlet is about 13cm x 6cm x 1cm. The chicken cutlet? it was 11cm x 5cm x 1.5cm. The taste was good, but it was totally, I MEAN TOTALLY, destroyed by the taste of the curry. The traditional curry has no curry taste, not salty, not sweet, no coconut flavour, only lots of pepper. It is like curry-looking pepper gravy. And the "healthy curry"? DON"T EVER TRY TAT!!! It taste like un-processed milk, and yes, with LOTS of PEPPER as well.....And? No curry taste AT ALL.<br><br>We wanted to ask for a refund after the first taste. But we saw that all the staff at the restaurant are chinese, and non of them seems to be the "Person-In-Charge". So we decided to let it go. But we did advise a lady looking at the menu to go to other stalls.<br><br>One plus point though....Ambience is good cos there was not much patrons, not crowded. Peaceful.........</p></div>
