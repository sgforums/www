As I already highlighted in my blog, there were supply issues with the beef.  So last weekend was really awful. He just got the new supplier in today and I was really happy to see a proper piece of ribeye.<br><br>As you can see the marbling is not that great.  Maybe a 4.  But it tastes alright and a great alternative to Jack's Place and Hans.<br><br>But if you are a real steak lover, do ask Bryan about the steak and let him know that you realise he had problems and if the meat that day is good.  Also because they are still having grill problems, during peak periods, your steak may not arrive the way you want it.  Give him a bit of slack yah?  He should be steady after a month.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah liquidShadow, as I said the supply problem has been fixed.  But please when you all eat the steak treat it as you would when you eat Jack's Place set lunch steak then you will be very happy.  If you treat it like Black Angus steak house you will be dissappointed.  But the fish and chips, I compare with Fish and Co and damm happy.<br><br>Now when you look at the feedback so far, most people have bee complaining about the steak not be good quality.  This was due to supply problem  Most people quite happy with the fish and chicken.  So the overall review so far is very mixed.  I have been there 3 times already and can say that fish and chip consistent.  the meat is still in the process of getting to steady state.  Since the owner is working hard at imporving the food, we should not just shoot him down.  Rather, keep updating on improvments because at the end of the day, if he finally settles on a really nice Chilled Ribeye for even $14, we would all be the beneficiaries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't be expecting Black Angus definitely, but what I had was really way belo acceptible.  As I mentioned in my blog, Bryan did mention the issue with the supplier, so we have that problem nailed from your updates.  Bedok South is quite out of the way for me, so I just don't feel that I will make the effort anytime soon.<br><br>I wouldn't say as far as me shooting him.  I just simply called my experience what it was and in the fairness of things, also included his reasons for such an occurance.  I really do not benefit from putting him in disfavor in anyway.  Like you said, if his business quality improves, we all benefit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem at eBlackBoard is not fixed yet!  I have added a special prelude today to warn everyone.  When I first ate the steak, imagine how happy I was to get  that piece of meat in the picture for $11!  And the first batch was actually quite good.   I didn't have to wait too long for my food like yummy3, cos I sample all my food during the off peak period in the afternoons so I did not experience the workflow problems.  Aside from the supplier problems, he also had problems with the grill which is fixed by the time yummy3 got there (Judging from the grill lines)   He has changed supplier again but unable to find someone who can give him what he wants.  FYI, the steak is no longer $11 but $12.90 and it is 250g instead of 300g as I highlighted in my update, this is because they changed from frozen beef to chilled beef which costs about 40% more.  I will continue to update when I get news.<br><br>This is the most controversial blog I have written in my sort life span of blogging, so I am also learning many things as I go along.  My sincere apologies for those who read the blog, went there and were dissapointed.</div>
