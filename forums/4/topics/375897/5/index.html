              <p>Hainanese chicken rice is neither originated from Malaysia nor
              Singapore. The recipe is inherited from a city named Wen Chang in the
              China Hainan island. But Hainanese chicken ball rice was invented
              either in Muar or may be in Melaka.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bak Kut Teh is truly a Malaysian dish, originated from Klang. Singapore is hijacking from Malaysia and claim theirs.</span></p>

              <p>But to me it is like locking the stable doors after the horses have

              has identified and wants to label as Malaysian has already been stamped

              all thought was unique to this kopitiam in Malacca is 'discovered' to
              be a Singaporean original), nasi lemak, laksa. <span style="color: #ff0000;">As
              usual our super efficient neighbours have been hard at work identifying
              what is worth taking, taken and stamped everything before we even
              realise Eh! What happened ah?<br> </span><br> And it has already past the stage where if we were now to make claims
              over these food dishes we'd just be another butt of jokes on the global
              hawker centre.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">While we were busy being Truly Asia our smarter
              neighbours have been busy identifying what is worth plundering and
              taken the loot. </span>We should have learned our lessons a long time ago<span style="color: #ff0000;">.
              After all, they plunder our schools and universities every year for

              <p>Smart Singaporean has already claimed Singapore Cherry as their own

              <blockquote>
              <p>Why is Ng Yen Yen being laughed at all over because she wants to protect the intellectual rights to Malaysian food or their names? Patrick “Niamah” Teoh and his visitors, Malaysiakini subscribers, HartalMSM, to name just a few, think she’s quite a joke. Doesn’t she have a point? Why not support it?<br><br>What is uniquely Malaysian should be protected, whether for tourism marketing or, more importantly, for our own pride. What’s wrong with that?<br><br>Only wine from Champagne can be called "Champagne"<br><br>An American company "patented" basmati rice. India fought backFrance protects its stuff, too, ferociously — “Champagne” cannot come from California, it only be called a “sparkling wine”.<br><br>Should we laugh at that?<br><br>India went to court to protect “basmati” rice — because a sharp American company broke down the DNA of basmati rice and a stupid American judge allowed them to “patent” it. Don’t laugh.<br><br>The pushcart kueh man. He's a national heritage, tooIf something is unique to us, let’s protect it. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bak kut teh, yee sang, mee goreng mamak, roti canai, murtabak, roti jala, nasi kandar, Curry Kapitan, inchi kabin, pulut inti, kueh kochi santan, kueh talam, Penang laksa (assam and lemak), pasembor (called “rojak” by stupid KLites), rojak (called “rojak buah” by stupid KLites), Hainanese Chicken Rice (because made by Hainanese), roti bakar (with Planta margarine and kaya), kaya, Ampang yong tau foo, lemang, ulam, sambal belacan, cincalok…Best eaten hot on a stool next to the roadside stall</span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hey there’s a long list of Malaysian stuff that’s unique to Malaysia or adapted by Malaysians. Let’s do something to reclaim our shared heritage.</span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">True, those bloody Singaporeans have masterfully hijacked a boatload of our stuff over 50 years to claim as their own. That doesn’t mean Malaysians should just roll over and let them get away with it.</span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">The problem is of course partly because we have a shared immigrant Chinese and immigrant Indian culture and a shared, but unique, Straits Chinese culture which the Singaporeans trumpet in their tourism and national literature as their own Peranakan culture while quietly ignoring the Nyonya culture of Malacca and Penang.</span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Isn't Penang assam laksa a Malaysian dish?And the Malaysian authorities have similarly quietly ignored whatever wasn’t completely “Malay” in the officially-recognised “national culture”.</span><br><br>Ng Yen Yen’s problem, and the problem shared by MCA, Gerakan, DAP, et al, is that Umno’s bullies have insisted that “Malaysian culture” — defined at a so-called “national” congress headed by the bullying Ghazali Shafie after the 1969 riots — must be defined as being based on “Malay” culture.They call this a "prata" down South.<br><br>To Umno, the word “national” means “Malay”. National Chamber of Commerce = Malay Chamber. Etc.<br><br>Straits culture, unique to the MalSing area.

Even though Ampang yong tau foo, for one, cuts across all cultures and is enjoyed by all at food courts everywhere.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chingay, almost unique to Penang Hokkiens, has been hijacked by sharp Singaporean Hokkiens and Teochews for tourism purposes in their Chinese New Year parades. Did the Malaysian authorities make any attempt to protect that? Or to promote it?<br></span><br>If Ng Yen Yen is now making a belated attempt to recapture our shared heritage, she should be given support. Not laughed at.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Or do we want to remain second-class to uppity thieving Singaporeans all the time?</span></p>

              <p>These aren't the ramblings of politicians. This is the feeling at the grassroots level across the causeway. Singaporeans often make the mistake that it is just the Malaysian government which despises us. One of these days we will pay for our naivete.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>It’s about time! I know I haven’t lived in Malaysia long enough to
              dwell in the presence of heavy rivalry between Singapore and Malaysia
              but I do know 1 thing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">They stole our food…and they do a bad job of
              stealing it cuz it aint’ that good.</span> Finally we start letting people
              know where this originated from because its the truth. Our Tourism
              Minister really grew some balls saying what she said but I’m with her
              100%.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We cannot continue to let other
              countries hijack our food. Chilli crab is Malaysian. Hainanese chicken
              rice is Malaysian. We have to lay claim to our food,” Malaysian Tourism
              Minister Dr Ng Yen Yen told reporters after launching the Malaysia
              International Gourmet Festival yesterday.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The festival, which runs throughout
              October, is part of the Fabulous Food 1Malaysia campaign. November’s
              part of the campaign will centre around shopping mall food, while
              street and heritage food will be the highlight in December.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“In the three months, we will identify certain key dishes (to declare as Malaysian). We have identified<strong> laksa</strong> … all types of <strong>laksa, nasi lemak</strong> and <strong>bak kut teh</strong>,” she said.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">When asked how the ministry would go
              about labelling the dishes Malaysian after identifying them, Dr Ng said
              she would reveal her strategy at a later stage.</p>
              <p>But to be fair to the Singaporeans, their government is a marketing
              machine and they do have to sell something so I guess it was a matter
              of who says what first. But I think its about time that we finally let
              the rest of the world know that coming out to Malaysia for food is a
              must! (Check out 15Malaysia’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHXG2tfevwY">Rojak</a> to truly understand what it is about our food that brings us together)<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Although the food is relatively regional, we must remember that
              Singapore used to be part of Malaysia until Johorian pirates got rid of
              it (doh!) </span>and Lee Kwan Yew progressed it to new heights.  Don’t get me
              wrong tho – I think Singapore has done amazingly well as a country but
              when it comes to food. We rock.</p>
              <p>THANK YOU TO DR. NG YEN YEN FOR BRINGING OUR BRAGGING RIGHTS BACK TO THIS COUNTRY!</p>

              win it.</p>

              <p>Win what?</p>
              <p>They want to play this game, let them play. It is a game that only fools play. Playing the same game with them and trying to win just makes us equally foolish.</p>
              <p>As for me, I'd rather just sit by the sidelines and watch morons claim that <em>Hainanese</em> chicken rice belongs to Malaysia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, from what I've seen so far, it seems that the Malaysians who agree with their tourism minister are in the minority. The majority of them ridicule and mock her for saying such things and can agree that we share a common heritage.</p>
