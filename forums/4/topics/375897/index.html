              <p>Not content with robbing Indonesia blind of its cultural heritage, it appears the goons in Malingsia have set their sights on us.</p>
              <p><a title="Straits Times" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_431009.html?vgnmr=1">http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_431009.html?vgnmr=1</a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR - <span style="color: #ff0000;">MALAYSIA will lay claim to its signature dishes like
              laksa and chicken rice which are being 'hijacked' by other countries,
              the tourism minister said according to a report on Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Those on the list include the fragrant coconut milk rice 'nasi
              lemak', spicy soup noodle 'laksa' and pork ribs herbal soup 'bak kut
              teh', Tourism Minister Ng Yen Yen said according to The Star newspaper. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'We cannot continue to let other countries hijack our food. Chili
              crab is Malaysian. Hainanese chicken rice is Malaysian. We have to lay
              claim to our food,' she was quoted as saying. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'In the next three months, we will identify certain key dishes (to
              declare as Malaysian). We have identified laksa... all types of laksa,
              nasi lemak and bak kut teh,' she added. </span></p>
              <p>Ms Ng said her ministry will announce a strategy on how to brand the dishes as Malaysian.</p>
              <p>'That is Part Two. We cannot reveal it yet, but we will let you know soon,' she reportedly said.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ms Ng did not name which countries were hijacking the dishes, which
              are popular around the world and particularly in neighbouring Singapore
              and Indonesia. </span></p>
              <p>Her comments came amid a diplomatic row with Indonesia, where
              protesters have accused Malaysia of stealing its cultural heritage.</p>
              <p>The dispute erupted in Indonesia in August after erroneous reports
              emerged that Malaysia had screened tourism advertiseme nts featuring the
              traditional 'pendet' dance of Indonesia's Hindu-majority Bali island.</p>
              <p>The ad was actually a promotion for a Discovery Channel programme,
              but despite an apology from the network, protesters vowing to 'crush
              Malaysia' have burned national flags and thrown rotten eggs at the
              embassy in Jakarta.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman will meet his Indonesian
              counterpart Hassan Wirajuda in Jakarta on Thursday in a bid to cool the
              tensions which Malaysia has described as a 'grave concern'.</p>
              <p>Ties between the two countries are regularly punctuated by rows
              over cultural issues as well as the welfare of Indonesian labourers and
              maids working in Malaysia. -- AF</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And what does your average Malaysian think of the matter? Does he acknowledge Singapore's equal claim to our shared heritage?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>dear mat indogsia,(typo there,seriusly)<br> <br> it's really immature to claim arts that our ancestors shared as solely
              theirs.i mean,look at malaysia and singapore<span style="color: #ff0000;">.singapore basically
              inherit every single traditional culture from malaysia and yet they
              claimed that it's originally comes from singapore-the best proof is a
              travelling program at Asian Food channel.It's clearly written at the
              signboard "ampang something2"(dont remember la,somekind of food),yet
              they dare to 'say only in singapore'.this is only one of the many
              things singapore claim to own when it's actually known to come from
              malaysia.</span><br> <br> and did Malaysia call bad names to singapore?NO! it's such a waste of
              time.arts and cultures are universal,just because it comes from your
              land,that doesnt give us the least of right to enjoy it as well.<br> if you want to say that we stole your batik,then why not claim that to hawaii too?<br> and about addressing your country indon.indon doesnt even mean
              anything,so why would you get offended by that?and what makes you all
              mightier than thou to demand us adding 'n' to that?<br> <br> no wonder you guys steal,rob,rape,kill,fight among yourselves and harassing our peace in here.<br> turns out that your definition of maling is 'to share arts and culture'.<br> oohh..patutlah</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Are we going to take this lying down? Wake up, Singapore. Malaysians have and will always regard us as their inferiors. It is folly to think that this mentality is only in their government, and that the average Malaysian has any particular love for us, when in fact he despises us as kiasu, arrogant and expects us to give deference to him  as the abang. </p>

              <p><br>is Ng Yen Yen descendents from Yunnan? ex-PM Aquino also have Chinese roots and I wonder what the Philippinos would be qualified to claim from China.</p>
              <p>for that matter, all Chinese in Malaysia, Thailand, ....who came from China , or whose roots are traced to China, can also make a claim, at anything.</p>
              <p>I guess it doesn't cost anything to make a claim, but when you lose it to the original owner, you lose your face. The Hainanese from Hainan haven't spoken yet.</p>
