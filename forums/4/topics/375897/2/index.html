              <p><br>The "Ng" will probably indicate that she is a "Hokkien" from Fuchien.</p>
              <p>It is the Malays that are descendants from Yunnan Province as claimed by ex-PM Mahathir in his book The Malay Dilemma.</p>
              <p>Seriously, the cuisines between Peninsular Malaya and Singapore may have similar names but they definitely do not taste the same.</p>
              <p>To claim that theirs is the original cuisine from Malaysia and all other similar named dish are copies - would be a complete fallacy that serves the vanity of a small minded person.</p>
              <p>If they claim that Malacca Laksa or Penang Laksa is Malaysian it is quite alright, and that the Katong Laksa is unique to Singapore - all are the creations from a mix of Chinese with Malay recipes by the Babas, can any one be considered the original when they developed on their own and feature different tastes ?</p>
              <p>Even the Malacca "Popiah" is different from Singapore's; and the KL "chee cheong fun" is served cold - when the same is served piping hot in Singapore and Hongkong; and between Singapore and Hongkong the sauce is different too.</p>
              <p>The Philippine "Lechon" is almost similar to our Roast Pig in taste and texture and presentation - except that there is the accompanying sauces and the accompanying dishes are different.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, the Hainanese on Hainan Island are confused as they have no clue about this famous dish that was developed by the culinary skills of the Hainanese that migrated to Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The Hainanese Chicken Rice different in taste and with different style of the all important chilli sauce being prepared - some with grounded garlic mixed into it, some offer thick black sauce, and some with a onions in the rice, while others place yellow ginger when the rice is steamed.</p>
              <p>Is there any purpose to claim that any dish is the national dish of any one Country ?</p>
              <p>It tantamount to asserting a false claim that the Chinese landed first in Peninsular Malaya, and the Malaysian Chinese are the original migrant that left China.</p>
              <p>Is there any purpose to such a childish and mindless claim ?</p>

              <p>In Hainan today, the chicken dish is known as Wen Chang Chicken æ–‡æ˜Œé¸¡ã€‚It is different from other chicken dishes in that the chicken is boiled, rather than braised or roosted, the cantonese call it ç™½æ–©é¸¡ã€‚this is what the hainanese brought with them out of Hainan to other countries.</p>
              <p>the rice that comes with it, whether in bowl, in rice balls as small as golf ball as seen in Malacca, or the big ball we see in Toa Payoh, and the different sauce, are all local variations. </p>
              <p>Obviously the claim serves the Malaysia tourism minister a purpose, after losing the ownership to the heritage of a dance to the Indonesian. Like many Malaysian politicians, taking on Singapore is deemed an easy way to gain some points.  But we all know it is childish and mindless to use any issue as such for political reasons.</p>
