              <p>here is a list of nice food i tried from food centres and kopitiam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) beach road market (near to lavendar mrt)- thick freshly made belgian waffle with delicious chocolate sauce. the store is located on the upper level of the food centre near to one of the extreme end staircase.</p>
              <p>2) beach road market (near to lavendar mrt)- pork rib noodles. its near to the waffle store and they are famous for their 'chilli' noodle. nice!the store is located on the upper level of the food centre near to one of the extreme end staircase.</p>
              <p>3) alexandra food village (opp queensway shopping centre)-famous for their nice bbq food. go try their avocado juice and other fruit juice smoothies. smooth and thick fresh juices.</p>
              <p>4) changi Village food centre - famous for their nasi lemak. the best is the most corner store.</p>
              <p>5) changi Village food centre- red tea longan dessert. very rare and special dessert u wont find in most food centres. it consists of this red tea jelly with ice carvings and longan topped with carnation milk. the red tea jelly exudes a subtle sweet taste.</p>
              <p>6) changi Village food centre- there are 2 stores selling bak chor mee side by side. i tired one of the stores and find it not bad.</p>
              <p>7) yishun ave 5 kopitiam - it is located right next to the famous 7-11 for toto and 4D betting (chong pang).they have this hup lee been hoon store. if u noticed they have branches all ard singapore in food centres. this is the main branch ( i think) and its been hoon is really tasty. do try the fried chicken wings. yummy~. this store has been around for like 10 plus years liao. the nasi lemak also not bad.</p>
              <p>8) chong pang nasi lemak - located opp khatib camp in one of the shophouses. it is the corner unit. the food is good but i find it rather ex.</p>
              <p>9) maxwell food centre - the hum chim peng is famous. its run by a father and daughter pair. the interesting thing is u have to fry ur own hum chim peng. definitely one of the best hum chim pengs around. sells 7pieces for 1 dollar. 2 basic flavours - sweet or salty</p>
              <p>10)  maxwell food centre - there is this porridge store that is only opened in the wee hours like 2am i think. maxwell should have other nice food as well but i have yet to try</p>
              <p>11) serangoon garden food centre(near to chomp chomp) - there is this char kway teow store owned by an elderly couple. need to Q quite long though.</p>
              <p>12) Parkway parade food centre- wet char kway teow with lots of garlic. expect to Q a while. the char kway teow doesnt look very appealing cos its not the usual dark char kway teow. however the flavours are locked into the noodles. hygiene wise i dun feel too good about the store.</p>
              <p>13) amk S-11 (next to jubiliee building) - famous for their 'rasa sayang' western food. the food is definitely above avg but the prices have been gg up quite a bit over the years.</p>
              <p>14) amk central food centre - there is this vincent western food stall. not famous but it serves decent food fare.</p>
              <p>15) bugis food centre (near to si ma lu guan yin temple) - there is this store with freshly fried carrot cake. the frying skills are so-so cos if u order black carrot cake, the colour is not consistent. however the carrot cake is freshly prepared and gives a springy feel when popped into the mouth.</p>
              <p>16) bugis food centre - there is this porridge store somewhere in the middle. smooth porridge served with crispy you tiao.</p>
              <p>17) tiong bahru market - roasted meat store very near to the famous lor mee store. the char siew they have is juicy and tender. yummy~. there are other nice food stores in this market but i have yet to try out. the market is famous for its pau and roasted meat stores.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>others</p>
              <p>18) liang seah street - there is this traditional dessert store with chinese stools and marble tables. the dessert they serve is fantastic.</p>
              <p>19) liang seah street - taiwan eatery called lai lai. food is nice and very affordable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>these r the stores that i can think of at the moment. do u guys have any stores that u wanna reccommend? </p>

              <p>Whampoa Food Centre. (note that there are 2 food centres)</p>
              <p>If you view it from the 7-11, the market on the right is the one im talkin bout.<br><br>Theres this China Ban Mian stall located at far right of the food centre thats very very popular. Their signboard is yellow in color. Their you mian soup i can eat every day during my days of attachment around there. <br>Usually i eat clam + fish you mian. These 2 flavors are the popular ones.</p>
              <p>They also do sell their own chilli and i tell you their chilli is sibei shiok (very spicy). I bought a bottle of chilli from them last time. Their ikan bilis is also very nice and they also sell it. Sometimes you have to wait 30 minutes. They close quite early.... so it's better to go before 2pm?</p>
