            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>From ST Forums</strong><br><br>I AM an ang moh who has been living in Singapore for about eight years now and wonder if I am the only one who has noticed the increasingly selective deafness of Singapore waiters in conversations concerning ice water.<br><br>Me: Dear waiter, can I have lots of food and maybe wine at whatever price you want, plus ice water?<br><br>Waiter: Still or sparkling, sir?<br><br>Me: Ice water.<br><br>Waiter: Would you like ice in your mineral water, sir?<br><br>Me: No - regular ice water.<br><br>Waiter: We have still and sparkling mineral water, sir.<br><br>I notice some are now even refusing point blank to serve regular ice water. On top of the basic food charges there may well be service charge, cover charge and all the other add-ons.<br><br>I always find those add-ons in themselves irritating. (Why not just say that a dish cost $10 or $100 instead of saying $9 +++) Mineral water is simply becoming another Plus Plus Plus Plus Plus and it is very clear that waiting staff are under firm orders to push the stuff, in many cases beyond the point of customer irritation.<br><br>The real reason, of course, is the fat margins. We are all well aware of what mineral water is. We know that restaurants have it and that we can have it if we want to - along with Dom Perignon '55 if we want that!<br><br>Personally, I actively dislike sparkling water and even with very fine wine and cuisine I have never really appreciated fancy still mineral water over water from the Singapore tap.<br><br>My objection is that this unnecessary verbal fencing match with every waiter in Singapore is a gross disservice and, frankly, rude. I am very unlikely to have chosen a restaurant on the basis that the total bill without add-ons will come to 'X' and that with mineral water it will exceed my budget by a couple of dollars and therefore I go to McDonald's. The restaurateur can charge more for the meal if he wants.<br><br>I do object to the verbal fencing and someone who is supposed to be providing a polite service opening an irritating fencing contest trying to get me to buy something I do not want and not taking 'no' for an answer. This is especially irritating when you are with a client or other guest.<br><br>Moreover, we are becoming more and more environmentally aware and there is virtually nothing for me that seems more ecologically silly and unnecessary than offering plastic, or worse, heavy glass bottles that have been transported half way round the world and leaves a plastic or bottle to be buried in a land fill. A restaurant can for just a few cents a week further filter tap water if it feels there is still some 'public water taste' that needs to be got rid of.<br><br>I do not really want to interfere with the enjoyment of those who like a $25 fancy bottle of mineral water with their meal but I do believe we should resist the pushy waiters and take management to task when we are pressured in this way.<br><br>I often say: 'Look, stop trying to shove environmentally dirty brown fancy mineral water down my throat - give me good honest Singapore ice water. If you cannot make a profit without forcing me to buy mineral water - then increase the price of the food!'<br><br>Gordon Anderson</div>

Not so bad if the place doesn't charge service charge. If the establishment cannot or refuses to serve iced water from the tap, does that establishment come across as "cheapskate" then?<br><br>Then again its the consumer culture here. If patrons will not dine in places that make you pay inflated prices for bottled water, establishments will be driven to change.<br><br>I mean common really, I order food, which the establishment already profits from. Let me have some iced water as a form of service.
