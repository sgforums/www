              <p>ok.<br>Get some fruits, must be fresh one. Wash it and let the surface dry.<br>Cut them into pieces, mix with å†°ç‰‡ç³– at 3 to 1 ratio, put it to a glass or ceramic container and cover it, away from sunlight.<br>Then 2 weeks later, if the whole thing got a bit alcohol smell, then it is done. If not, pour it to your toilet bowl and flush it.<br>Extract the juice, put it in a clean container, it should last for a long time.<br><br>For me, I don't add yeast, so you get the benefit of enzyme but not the harm of alcohol.<br>Pls take note that whatever ingredients and tool you use must be very clean and dry, if any pieces of fruit drop on table, don't use it.</p>

              <p>It is called brown candy. Can buy at most TCM shop. Don't put white sugar. Look like this.<img src="http://www.21food.cn/userImages/dtzq/dtzq%24122135147.jpg" alt="" width="400"></p>
              <p>Yes 3:1 for fruit : sugar. Use manual way to extract.</p>

But most important is the quality of the fermentation process.<br>Guava is good, coz you can use the seeds of guava, coz it comes with the pulp as well, so it is good to make it into enzyme or wine instead of throwing it away.</p></div>

              <p>Quality of fermentation process means anything you use must be clean inside out and dry outside. If got a bit alcohol smell, means it is safe to drink, coz bacteria can't survive in alcohol. If you want to ferment grapes, I think it is cheaper to buy red wine, haha.<br>Fresh grapes in singapore is expensive than the country producing it. I tried fermenting grapes before, but the color is not as dark, somehow the process is a bit different.</p>

              <p>You quite lucky. I made a few times mostly become vinegar, lol.<br>Maybe the natural yeast in your home is strong enough to fight with the harmful bacteria, that's why it succeed.<br>There are many types of yeast for making beer, wine, bread or making the final liquid crystal clear, or make it more creamy and contribute to different taste and nutritions. Last time I use those common one from TCM shop, now I don't use yeast already.</p>

My mum says its jiu bing $0.40 and i bought one , then i go another tcm shop and saw yeast for making rice wine $3 then i bought 1 also . Can tell me which is the one to be used or rather you used ? Cos the price different for both is pretty big .</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>   Managed to buy a book that touch on making vinegar and wines . Basically its a book that teach you hw to make healthy drinks . Need to buy more glass or ceramic container to try them out . It did mention that to make vinegars , the steps are the same except you add bing tang or cube sugar instead of the bing pian tang. But the receipt in this book all need to store for abt 3 to 4 months type . My mum will kill me if i were to put more then 3 container on my kitchen cabinet . Sometime i grow impatient to taste my creation also .</p></div>
