              <p>By Lisa Collier Cool <br>Oct 24, 2012 - Yahoo! Health</p>
              <p>While
              seafood is usually touted as a health food high in omega-3 fatty acids helping
              boost brain and heart health, recent scathing reports paint a less desirable
              picture of America’s fish tainted with waste, chemicals, and antibiotics. Supermarket
              cases and restaurants make our seafood look presentable, but is it really safe
              to eat?</p>
              <p>A recent <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> story reports
              unsanitary conditions for many Asian seafood exporters, along with government
              lagging in its ability to clean it up.</p>
              <p>The 13 Worst U.S. Foodborne Illness Outbreaks </p>
              <h3><strong>A Closer Look at Aquaculture</strong></h3>
              <p>About 86 percent of our seafood is
              imported, and half of that is from aquaculture—fish farms. Most aquaculture
              imports are shrimp, tilapia, Atlantic salmon, and shellfish, according to the National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
              <p>In Vietnam, shrimp is stored in
              dirty plastic tubs, covered in ice made from tap water that could be
              contaminated with bacteria. Vietnam ships more than 100 million pounds of
              shrimp to the United States each year or about 8 percent of all the shrimp we
              eat.  </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In China, many fish farms reportedly
              use pig manure as feed</span></strong></span>, which contains salmonella and makes tilapia more
              susceptible to disease.</p>
              <p>In
              addition, “shrimp farms in South and Southeast Asia are
              essentially factory farms, with all that implies—including antibiotic
              overuse,” according to a <em>Wired</em> piece published earlier this year. Many of the antibiotics in
              these fish farms are banned for use in the U.S.</p>
              <p>The 10 Worst Disease Outbreaks in U.S. History</p>
              <h3><strong>FDA Only Tests Small Sample of Imports<br></strong></h3>
              <p>While the U.S. Food and Drug
              Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the safety of our seafood, they
              may not be bringing their A-game to the task: Bloomberg reports that only 2.7
              percent of all seafood imports are inspected by the FDA.</p>
              <p>In 2008, FDA Deputy Director of Food
              Safety, Don Kraemer testified before Congress, summarizing the issue:</p>
              <p><em>As the
              aquaculture industry continues to grow, concern about the use of unapproved
              drugs and unsafe chemicals in aquaculture operations has increased
              significantly. There is clear scientific evidence that the use of unapproved
              antibiotics and other drugs and chemicals, such as malachite green,
              nitrofurans, fluoroquinolones, and gentian violet, can result in the presence
              of residues in the edible portions of aquacultured seafood.</em> </p>
              <p>Even after
              this testimony, a 2011 GOA report found that
              the FDA tested about 0.1 percent of all imported seafood products for drug
              residues. To put this in perspective: out of 2.5 million metric tons of
              imported shrimp, the FDA tested only 34 samples for nitrofurans. Even worse:
              six of these samples came back positive.</p>
              <p>The FDA also
              inspects processing facilities overseas, but that program too seems halfhearted
              at best. Only 1.5 percent of seafood facilities had been inspected, according
              to the GOA report.</p>
              <p>Here’s a closer look at what it
              means for seafood-lovers.</p>
              <h3><strong>The Impact of Tainted Fish And What to Do</strong></h3>
              <p>A recent study by The Centers for Disease Control
              and Prevention said a quarter of the food-borne illness outbreaks from imported
              food involved seafood. That’s significantly more than the next food type on the
              list.</p>
              <p>That doesn’t
              mean you should avoid seafood altogether. There are some steps you can take now
              to continue to enjoy safe, healthy fish and shrimp. Here are some tips:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The best course of action for consumers could be to avoid farmed
              fish. Look for sustainable seafood, wild caught, or eco-labeled. </li>
              <li>Don’t be afraid to ask your local seafood provider questions and
              create dialogue. </li>
              <li>Use seafood guides to stay informed and make smart choices in your
              area.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Check
              out these organizations:</p>
              <p>The INCOFISH Project has a summary
              of international seafood guides and a searchable database to look up seafood by
              name, country or continent.</p>
              <p>The Seafood Choices Alliance works with
              conservation groups worldwide and offers seafood recommendation guides,
              aquaculture and fisheries resources and links to conservation organizations
              working on seafood and other issues.</p>
              <p>The National
              Resources Defense Council offers a Sustainable Seafood Guide with tips for making smarter
              seafood choices.  </p>
