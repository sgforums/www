            <div class='col-md body'>i know what you mean i guess. tts why i'm not an evangelist. an evangelist just wanna see u converted. but their job is not to get into your personal life. yr cell does though. so must understand la. also. quoting out of context is irritating. i experience that also. was talking to an idiot one time about love as in bgr cuz i hving a little problem with that then suddenly he ask me "how do you measure God's love?", then quote me bible verses. i was so irritated cuz it was so out of context and we weren't even talking about God's love. He just suddenly pop out. its like i'm asking "how's the food" and he replies "nice weather". of course i decide to do a little "sharing" lor, and trash him upside down. heh then he said "brb" until now still hvn tok to me.. so i can say i understand wat u mean and how u feel.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>as for your part, i think you're a little too critical... there are many good ppl, as well as bad... dun mix them up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehehe...last time o/s Tampines MRT, I was approached by this plump salesman looking guy. Look like just after work. Came up to me and said "Brother, do you have a minute?" In my heart I said, "Since when was I your brother?!!!!' Anyway, he just continued to talk and talk and talk then start asking questions bla bla bla. After he finally mentioned JC and all that, he asked me if I want to be saved! WAH! MAGGI MEE GOD SALESMAN! I told him that the whole concept of JC was an interesting OPTION and he looked SO shocked. Started countering me by saying that it is not an option! There is no other way bla bla bla.<br><br>The I put my palm up and asked him if JC was the only one and true God...his face turn into a smile as he said yes. I said, "That's what ALL the other religions also say...and I left him hanging there with his mouth open.<br><br>There was this one other time, also os Tampines MRT when an Indonesian guy approached me. He was dressed simply and spoke humbly. Since he was so nice, I started to talk WITH him. We ended up talking about everything under the sun, and his life up some hill or mountain where his village was in Indonesia - we talked about everything EXCEPT religion. The only thing I can say is that that was the ONLY person, ever, to have reached out to me.<br><br>Told the storey to some church friends (yes, I did go to church a long time ago) nd my Ang Mo pastor said that that was exactly what JC did; he went into a new town, mingled with people, ate at theoir tables and talked about their lives and situations. He got to know then as HUMAN BEINGS first instead of Religious Sales Targets!<br><br>OK...I dun think I want to get into this anymore. Like I said, I left organised religion a LONG time ago and that's that. Cheers!</div>
