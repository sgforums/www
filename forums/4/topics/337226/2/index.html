                  but as long as got halal sign can already ba. now i pay more attention to it because one of my close fren is muslim. but mostly malays are muslims wat. i guess it's a misconception but i guess maybe because i  have not met any other malays that are not muslims actually.

              <p>manufacturers hire halal certifiers to certify their products so
              that they can sell to muslim consumer, in other words manufactures
              pay halal certifiers to inspect their production to ensure that
              there is no "haram" substance. after inspection halal certifiers
              label the products halal. manufacturers do this to make sure that
              they expand their consumer market to include muslims.</p>
              <p>halal is a requirement for muslims which means that halal food

              <p>The Halal certification is strictly voluntary... Like ISO for instance. Its a essentially a "quality mark" to assure muslims that the meat products that are being sold under the brand, or by the establishment, meets the standards required by their religion.</p>

              <p>i think that you are simply crazy actually. it's up to them whether they want to apply for halal certification a not. they want to apply for it, n get certified, they open up the muslim market for their products, that is all. there is no favouritism at all.</p>
              <p>actually i for one think that those products who get halal certified is gd because the muslims and practically everyone can buy those products. for example like 'banquet'</p>
              <p>oh just a side note, i think that 'banquet' is nicer than 'kopitiam'</p>
