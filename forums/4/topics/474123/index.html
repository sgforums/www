              Shangrila is a bit too far. My customers very lazy always insist on scotts or newton area.
                      
              But that aside, been to the line at shangrila at least 5 times. It is good spread of buffet, the staff friendly and they clear table often. But can be quite packed during lunches.
                      
              I need info on 
              Goodwood Park Hotel buffet 
              Sojubang 2D1N korean Buffet
              Buffets around Newton
                      
              If anybody needs any info, my personal reviews on other buffets I've been to
                      
              --Japanese cuisine
              Irodori - Riverview hotel - twice (alacart buffet) good spread
              Shin Minori - UE SQ - 4 times   (alacart buffet) good spread
              Kiseki - Heeren/Orchard Turn - Total 8 times (normal buffet) good spread
              momiji - Iras Building - Once (normal buffet) *free beer, excellent spread, food quality is high
                      
              --Indian cuisine
              Riverwalk Tandoori - Clark Quay - twice (normal buffet) so so spread $15/head what to expect?
              shah imaharani - Raffles City - Once - (normal buffet) good spread
                      
              --International cuisine
              Carousel - Royal Plaza Scotts - 4 times (normal buffet) good spread except this place is *halal there no pork/alcohol served
              Mariott Cafe - Mariott Hotel - Once (normal buffet) ok spread
              The line - Shangrila - 5 times (normal buffet) good spread
              The Melt - Marina Oriental - Once (normal buffet) I find the spread ok food is soso but nice decor if you like going to buffets to look at the decor
              Intercontinental - Olivetree - 2 times (normal buffet) spread is ok, food quality is high value for money.
                      
              --Korean cuisine
              Korean all-you-can-eat-bbq at novena - once - ok spread. food is good, well marinated, packed with students who obviously know a good deal.
                      
              --Peranakan/Taiwan porridge
              Straits Kitchen - Hyatt - twice (normal buffet)  ok spread all malay pernakan food *non-halal
              
              chinese Porridge - Quality Hotel - once (normal buffet) simple spread ard $15/head what to expect?
                      
              chinese cuisine
              River Palace - Riverwalk - (alacart buffet) wide spread, they brought us the steam kim ba lor fish 7 times even when we told them after third time it was wrong order. We really cleaned them out this place.

              <p>2D1N not appropriate for business dinner/lunch. U'll leave the place smelling like BBQ. Extremely not appropriate especially with ladies.</p>
              <p>Besides, they dun do reservation. For walk-in, due to the cheap price, u'll have to compete with alot alot alot of ppl, mainly students. Food's not bad, though spread isn't much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>momiji still surviving??? Good to know. Gotta go back check it out someday...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Straits Kitchen should be Halal. you wrote non-halal in ur post above.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kiseiki has shifted to Orchard Central for a very very very long time already and Heeren is no longer there. And the new Kiseiki is very disappointing in terms of spread, though the old one was extremely bad with quality &gt;___&gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personal Favourite is still Minori. Ala-carte buffet at 140 different items is no joke (though order mix up is rather common, you cant fault them when they are busy &gt;__&gt;). I like the fact the boss used to call me every now and then to let me know when they are bringing in special seasonal dishes. Though the calls stop becoz I also quite long no go back Minori le (recently did went back once though)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other alternative to try:</p>
              <p>1) Buffet Town - Raffles City</p>
              <p>2) Some Shabu Shabu place outside Kiseiki. heard from friends not bad but personally no try b4 yet.</p>

              Thx for the tip on 2D1N I think is the same as Novena(Goldhill) korean bbq packed with students.
              
              straits kitchen is malay cuisine but I feel is not halal cuz I remember I saw something labelled "babi" leh
              
              kiseki I've been to both heeren and orchard turn with friends colleagues and customers. Personally prefer the old one at heeren is much bigger place lesser people hence more elbow room :) you notice the newer one is a smaller place hence a long waiting queue outside the restaurant, long queue to the sashimi. 
              
              Momoji is still around, the free beer is only for dinner or at least I went dinner they were serving beer between 6:30p - 8:30p. Limited to 2 small bottles per person each time but there's a way of getting around that. I find buffets that serve beer is a bit of gimmick, beer is like carbo If you drink too much you will feel full can't eat and vice versa eat too much you can't drink. I normally control and take at most 2 bottles only.
