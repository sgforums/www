              <p>A recent article found at <a title="meat and 
              environmentalism" href="http://experts.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/06/03/meat_the_slavery_of_our_time"><em>The
               New Foreign Policy</em></a> argues that, like it or not, the vegetarian 
              revolution is upon us and it is arriving by force.  The article centers 
              not on the moral or ethical debate for an animal-free diet but rather 
              supports the logical conclusion to a meat filled world, <a title="meat and environmentalism" href="http://meatsnotgreen.org/">total environmental destruction</a>.  
              Here’s a sample:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The numbers suggest that we won’t stop eating meat simply because 
              it’s “the right thing to do.” People love it too much. Instead, we’ll be
               forced to stop. By 2025, we simply won’t have the resources to keep up 
              the habit. According to the FAO report, 33 percent of the world’s arable
               land is devoted to growing crops for animal feed, and grazing is a 
              major factor in deforestation around the world. It’s also incredibly 
              water-intensive. The average U.S. diet requires twice the daily amount 
              of water as does an equally nutritious vegetarian diet, reports the 
              Worldwatch Institute. Meanwhile, there will be more than 8 billion 
              people on this earth, and two-thirds of the world’s population will live
               in water-stressed regions.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I agree fully with the author of this article.  Many people will 
              never care how brutal or unhealthy meat consumption is but they may 
              someday care to have clean water to drink and fresh air to breathe.  The
               vegetarian/vegan revolution will arrive by force, I can almost 
              guarantee it. </p>

              <p><strong>How
               the coming vegetarian revolution will arrive by force. </strong></p>
              <p><em>By Jim Motavalli </em></p>
              <p>I have a prediction: Sooner than you might think, this will
              be a vegetarian world. Future generations will find the idea of eating 
              meat
              both morally absurd and logistically impossible. Of course, one need 
              only look
              at the booming meat industry, the climbing rates of meat consumption in 
              the
              developing world, and the menu of just about any restaurant to call me 
              crazy. But
              already, most people know that eating red meat is bad for their health 
              and
              harmful for the planet. It's getting them to actually change their diet 
              that's
              the hard part -- and that's exactly why it won't happen by choice.</p>
              <p>Going by the numbers, eating meat is pretty hard to justify
              for the even moderately health-conscious. A National Cancer Institute 
              report
              released last March found that people who ate the most red meat were, as
               the <a href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/eating-meat-may-increase-risk-of-death-study-finds/"><em>New
              York
               Times</em></a> put it, "most likely to die from cancer, heart disease 
              and
              other causes." The biggest abstainers "were least likely to die."  Those
               who eat five ounces of meat daily, (the <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/nah/index.htm">equivalent of</a> one and a 
              half
              Quarter Pounders or Big Macs) increase their risk from cancer or heart 
              disease
              by 30 percent compared to those who eat two-thirds of an ounce daily -- a
               stark
              difference.</p>
              <p>The environmental impact is also crystal clear -- and similarly
              appalling. "<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM">Livestock's
              Long Shadow</a>," a 2006 report by the United Nations' Food and 
              Agriculture
              Organzation (FAO), found that livestock is a major player in climate 
              change,
              accounting for 18 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions (measured in 
              carbon
              dioxide equivalents), or more than the entire global transportation 
              system.</p>
              <p>The obvious solution to both health and environmental disasters
              is to stop eating meat altogether. But this is easier said than done. 
              Even the
              studies addressing the impact of meat on the planet downplay 
              vegetarianism, as
              if the authors are nervous to press it on people. Going veggie is not 
              even proposed
              as one of the FAO's "mitigation options" (which instead include 
              conservation
              tillage, organic farming, and better
              nutrition for livestock to reduce methane gas production). Nor is it 
              emphasized
              in "<a href="http://www.wellfedworld.org/PDF/WorldWatch%20Happier%20Meals.pdf">Happier
               Meals: Rethinking the Global Meat
              Industry</a>," a report by
              Danielle Nierenberg at the Worldwatch Institute. The study's author is 
              herself
              a vegan, but she told me, "Food choices are a very personal decision for
               most
              people. We are only now convincing them that this is a tool at their 
              disposal
              if they care about the environment."</p>
              <p>She has a point: Giving up meat is tough, and arguing people
              into it is probably a losing proposition. Even with all the statistics 
              out
              there about the dangers of meat, there are fewer vegetarians in the 
              world than
              you'd think. <a href="http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2006issue4/vj2006issue4poll.htm">A 
              Harris
              poll conducted in 2006 for the Vegetarian Resource Group</a> found that 
              only
              2.3 percent of American adults 18 or older claim never to eat meat, 
              fish, or
              fowl. A larger group, 6.7 percent, say they "never eat meat," but often 
              that means
              they only avoid the red kind. Worldwide, local vegetarian societies 
              report high
              participation in just a few places - for example, 40 percent in India, 
              10
              percent in Italy, 9 percent in Germany, 8.5. percent in Israel, and 6 
              percent
              in Britain.</p>
              <p>So how will we become a vegetarian planet? The numbers
              suggest that we won't stop eating meat simply because it's "the right 
              thing to
              do." People love it too much. Instead, we'll be forced to stop. By 2025,
               we
              simply won't have the resources to keep up the habit. According to the 
              FAO
              report, 33 percent of the world's arable land is devoted to growing 
              crops for
              animal feed, and grazing is a major factor in deforestation around the 
              world.
              It's also incredibly water-intensive. The average U.S. diet requires 
              twice the
              daily amount of water as does an equally nutritious vegetarian diet, 
              reports
              the Worldwatch Institute. Meanwhile, there will be more than 8 billion 
              people
              on this earth, and two-thirds of the world's population will live in
              water-stressed regions.</p>
              <p>Sounds like a mess -- and one that doesn't bode well for our cattle
              cravings. Meat will disappear -- except as a luxury available to few -- 
              and the
              ethical issues will evolve, too. In the way that slavery, once a broad 
              social
              norm, later became an unthinkable crime, we can expect to see a similar 
              shift once
              meat-eating disappears from our planet. Perhaps, some day, the very idea
               of
              eating animal flesh will seem as remote as the idea of owning humans 
              does now. So
              if you're a carnivore, enjoy now -- before the inevitable vegetarian 
              revolution begins.</p>
