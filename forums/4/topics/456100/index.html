              <p>Singapore clinches the Guinness world record for the most fish heads served at a single dinner – 2012 fish head curries to 2012 people – but to what end?</p>
              <p><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/epBzi23AO8DG4GWw9XpD2g--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_SG/News/Makansutra/The-crowd-at-Seafood-Mela-2012-s.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="473"></p>
              <p>The record was achieved last Saturday night, July 14th, at the Seafood Mela 2012, a big festival extravaganza at the open field at Race Course Road with 15 restaurants serving a buffet feast of Indian food, and a constant stream of live entertainment from local and Indian celebrities.</p>
              <p>However, the record is not too big of a news if you look at the Singapore Food Festival’s (SFF) history as a whole.</p>
              <p><img src="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/rtSiGPkFxPe8pV0NSz279A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_SG/News/Makansutra/Serving-the-fish-heads-to-the-crowd-s.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="473"></p>
              <p>The SFF has always had a long-standing obsession with breaking records. Almost every SFF in recent years has featured one record breaking attempt.</p>
              <p>Last year, it was all about breaking the Guinness record for the longest single dining table, the year before, the largest kueh lapis (layered cake) for the Singapore book of records. In 2009, it was about the longest Peranakan buffet line with over 100 dishes on offer. In 2007, it was about the longest satay line at 140m and 2006 featured the longest multi-cultural wedding cake.</p>
              <p>2004 SFF’s Guinness World record attempt was also a longest satay line theme at 111m.</p>
              <p>Curiously enough, SFFs before 2004 never featured record-breaking feats at all. It simply celebrated all kinds of food, local and international.</p>
              <p><img src="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/mglKajM655ClSsqUQbV7kg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_SG/News/Makansutra/Transferring-the-fish-heads-to-trays-to-be-taken-to-the-event-s.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="473"></p>
              <p>However, the SFF including record breaking events in its line-up is not without logic. A nation-wide fad, Singapore as a whole was obsessed about breaking records during the early to mid-2000s. It reached a point that in 2006, it was reported in the news that Singapore held an impressive 38 Guinness World Records.</p>
              <p>This year’s SFF organiser, Mr Luke Lee explained that “a World Guinness Record naturally draws attention and interest from a worldwide audience as a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and this helps to throw the spotlight onto Singapore as a dining destination.”</p>
              <p>The SFF also says that previous record attempts have helped “showcase Singapore’s much–loved local cuisine to a wider audience,” with increasing attendance to their events.</p>
              <p>But tourist arrival figures were already rising due to the buzz generated by the Integrated Resorts (Resorts World Singapore and Marina Bay Sands). So quite naturally, tourists already here would make a beeline for the SFF.</p>
              <p><img src="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/yRdOAXWDbvQk6NNF85TShg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_SG/News/Makansutra/Frantically-dishing-out-the-fish-head-curries-s.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="473"></p>
              <p>So the question is how much a yearly world record-breaking event helps out the SFF’s aims. Or should the SFF be about food, not feats. Its about time this famous event be about what it really should be – the reputation of Singapore food. Who knows, the figures on attendance may double. It’s about time they tried.</p>

              </span></p><p>The first story is about the massacre of the Sakya clansmen by the Crystal King (Virudhaka).</p>
              <p>Before the advent of Sakyamuni Buddha, there was near Kapila town a village inhabited by fishermen, and in it was a big pond. It happened that because of a great drought, the pond ran dry and all the fish were caught and eaten by the villagers. The last fish taken was a big one and before it was killed, a boy who never ate fish, played with it and thrice knocked its head. Later, after Sakyamuni Buddha's appearance in this world, King Prasenajit who believed in the Buddha-dharma, married a Sakya girl who then gave birth to a prince called Crsytal. When he was young, Crystal had his schooling in Kapila which was then inhabited by the Sakya clansmen. One day while playing, the boy ascended to the Buddha's seat and was reprimanded by others who dragged him down. The boy cherished a grudge against the men and when he became king, he led his soldiers to attack Kapila, killing all its inhabitants.</p>
              <p>At the same time, the Buddha suffered from a headache which lasted three days. When His disciples asked Him to rescue the poor inhabitants, the Buddha replied that a fixed Karma could not be changed. By means of his miraculous powers, Maudgalyayana rescued five hundred Sakya clansmen and thought he could give them refuge in his own bowl which was raised up in the air. When the bowl was brought down, all the men had been turned into blood.</p>
              <p>When asked by His chief disciples, the Buddha related the story (kung an) of the villagers who in days gone by had killed all the fish (in their pond); King Crystal had been the big fish and his soldiers the other fish in the pond; the inhabitants of Kapila who were now killed had been those who ate the fish; and the Buddha Himself had been the boy who thrice knocked the head of the big fish. (Karma was) now causing Him to suffer from a headache for three days in retribution for his previous act. Since there colud be no escape from the effects of a fixed Karma, the five hundred Sakya clansmen, although rescued by Maudgalyayana, shared the same fate. Later, King Crystal was reborn in a hell. (As cause produces effect which in turn becomes a new cause) the retribution (theory) is inexhaustible. The law of causality is really very dreadful.</p>
