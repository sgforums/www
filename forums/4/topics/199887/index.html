            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I just wanted to share our experience with all food lovers (especially to all Japanese BBQ buffet lovers) about this Japanese BBQ restaurant at Beach Road.<br><br>Tonight was the 2nd time we went to this restaurant because we find the quality of food to be reasonably good in our first visit.<br><br>This time round, we've decided to go for the BBQ buffet, at $58 per pax. Before we placed our order for the buffet, we saw rules written on the menu stating the buffet has a 2 hours time limit and any leftover will be charged. I felt the 2 hours time limit practice a little unusual but otherwise did not really take note of the leftover food rule, as I thought this is a standard practice with all buffets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Shortly after we ordered our buffet, the waitress came and pasted a note next to our table. She has written clearly on the note the exact time we started the buffet. I reckon she wanted to remind us the 2 hours time limit.<br><br>We got started and signalled for the waitress to order Beef Loin, Pork Loin, Scallops, soups and a small serving of a bowl of garlic rice for our baby son.<br><br>It took us about 15 minutes to finish the meat and soup in our 1st order, and when the waitress came to refill our tea, she started to remind us not to waste food, and she mentioned any extra food left on the table will be charged accordingly. I was appalled as the only food left on our table was the bowl of garlic rice my wife was still feeding to our son.<br><br>When we placed our 2nd order for more meat and prawns, the waitress reiterated any extra food will be charged, and she suggested we should order smaller portions to avoid any waste of food. 20 minutes later, I asked the waitresses to clear our empty plates, and as my baby son could not finish the garlic rice, I asked them to clear his bowl as well. To my displeasure, they deliberately cleared everything on our table except for his half-empty bowl of garlic rice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> Moreover, I was very annoyed the waitresses took turns to "monitor" the food on our table when we were eating our meals, and I could sense their eyes were looking for any extra leftovers we might be trying to hide.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>With all these episodes, we could no longer eat our meals in peace and they have succeeded in making us think twice before ordering any food (without thinking if we can finish it). Both myself and my wife were clearly upset by their behavior. We finished whatever food was left on the table and decided to call for the bill. We finished our buffet under in 45 minutes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>When the waitress was waiting for me to sign the bill ($130 including service charge), she reitarted for the 4th time that we should not order too much food in the future to avoid any waste. For goodness sake, the only food we could not finish was the bowl of garlic rice for our son. That was the last straw for my wife and she gave the waitress a piece of her mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In my life, I never had such a bad experience with having a buffet. I felt the restaurant should treat its customers with more courtesy and respect. Tonight would be the last time we are going back to this restaurant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

IMO, their menu price is not cheap in view of their location, but with the horrible experience they have given me, I definitely won't go back there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gee..thats quite bad..like that any other additional outlets at any other locations will also suffer, coz of bad service at just 1 of their many outlets. For 58 bucks im sure i can eat a much better buffet in hotels or i can bring my money and buy other good stuff<br><br>P.S: if i were you..i would have told the waitress to put a sock in her mouth and tell her to shut up, we aint that dumb ya knoe..</div>
