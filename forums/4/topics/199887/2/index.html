            <div class='col-md body'>August 21, 2006<br><br>Greetings from Yakiniku Daidomon!<br><br>I would like to thank you for the visits you made to the restaurant and it was such a privilege for us to know your present standing on the service of Daidomon.<br><br>Firstly, I would like to apologize for the inconvenience and embarrassment our restaurant caused you. Any amount of excuse is not acceptable in terms of any discomfort a service sector could create to anyone irregardless of their status quo.<br><br>I have always believed that CUSTOMER IS KING. This has been practiced all over the world and will still be applied no matter what the circumstances are. Again, it is with the restaurantÂ’s deepest regret to give you the outmost ineptness experience we rendered. I would make sure that this will never transpire again in your next visit in the restaurant.<br><br>Daidomon has been the pioneer in the YAKINIKU Restaurants in Singapore. And with this reputation, we always make it a point to improve our service in terms of Dining Operations and Kitchen Operations. It is important that we give the best service in terms of Quality Of Food And Customer Service. This has been reiterated countless times and a regular training is always conducted for these goals. The menu is always monitored and customized to guestÂ’s needs and catered to their highest satisfaction. And these priorities will always be looked at.<br><br>Recently updated was our buffet menu which is not a typical laid out menu where customers can line up and take the food, ours is a different type and which I believe is the only self serving buffet to customers so the quality and control of the food is being screened and double checked before being served to the customers. And due to customers waiting in line we had come up with the standard of reminding the customers that buffet time is only up to 2 hours. This is mainly for the purpose of giving way to other customers, but of course this does not mean that the restaurant will send out the customers just so we can have another customer. This is a standard procedure that everyone follows. The buffet price is set at $58++ and this comes with a wide variety of selection, more than 50 choices and we would really want our customers to try everything in the menu and enjoy the food.<br><br>Service staff is always briefed about refilling the tea and changing the net and checking out the customerÂ’s needs and they have been informed of clearing the tables with empty plates so the customers can order more. If this was not the case, we are truly sorry for the uneasiness you felt when you had your buffet at the restaurant. I would exactly feel the same way of being pressured and watched over. This was uncalled for and deserves the sincerest apology our restaurant can offer.<br><br>This is indeed, a learning lesson for all of us. A good one and a reminder that the service sector (the food and beverage industry specifically) is here to satisfy the customerÂ’s needs and wants to the highest level. And with that, once again, in behalf of Daidomon, I am greatly sorry for the inconvenience we have caused you.<br><br>If I would be given a chance to meet you and recover the damage done, I would really appreciate it.<br>I am hoping for the best of results as I send out this letter of apology to you and to the others who felt inconvenienced by the restaurant. Rest assured that this matter is being looked out now and will not happen again.<br><br>Thank you very much and I would appreciate if a feedback will be given.<br><br>More power and Have a Good Day!<br><br>Sincerely yours,<br>The Management of Daidomon<br>YAKINIKU DAIDOMON<br>371 Beach Road, 01-07 Keypoint Building<br>Singapore 199597<br></div>
