            <div class='col-md body'>Okay! I've went today paying for a table of 9.<br>$64.10 per person +++ is included in the 64<br>Got Musicians to play beside your table, good ambience.<br>Quite a nice place, can see the pool, service is alright.<br><br>Now the Food.<br>Varieties not a lot, but more then enough to be full if you try something of everything.<br>Lobsters are free flow, but got to order them.<br>Lobsters doesn't taste fantastic.<br>*WARNING* Ask for garlic sauce and not crayfish sauce for lobsters! It really sucks!<br>Oysters are super fresh. Very Good!<br>I'm not into eating Japanese raw food, so I find that the raw sweet prawns not very nice.<br>Raw fish are okay.<br><br>I didn't eat the salads section.<br><br>Turkey, Ham, Beef, they taste good.<br>Pasta some say nice... but i think it's... maybe it's me la...<br>Crispy Soft shell crabs are nice. But too much you'll get sick of it.<br>The whole row of covered food other than Herbal Chicken and Duck which sucks, they are alright.<br><br>Chocolate SoufflÃ© is very nice, Raspberry SoufflÃ© I think it's the opposite... It's very sour... and I hate sour things...<br>Ice-cream is alright. Tiramisu cake as dreamy as usual.<br>The cups of yogurt mousse thing? The one in a long version of shot glass, whole thing red one is damm sour! ItÂ’s hell! The other one in mini wine glass thing one is nice.<br>The mango one is heaven!<br>Chocolate fountain is still as fun.<br>The round cake which looks very "chocolate" is not very good, too much alcohol.<br>The one that is cut into slim pieces, look like cheese cake one taste very cinnamon. I don't like it.<br>The black-forest is alright. Custard is nice. The chocolate white colour, rectangle one is my favorite.<br>Rice cake thing sucks. Barley Â“tian tangÂ” is crap. Yellow upside down bowl shape small cake sucks.<br>ThereÂ’s one yellow melted marsh mellow thing is very special. A bit sour, got alcohol taste, sweet, but it comes one after another. Slowly eat to enjoy, eat whole thing youÂ’ll get face cramp.<br><br>OverallÂ… itÂ’s good!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i went 2 weeks ago<br>paying $109 for 2 pax after the UOB credit card discount of i think 15% if i am not wrong.<br><br>anyway..the varieties were really not alot<br>in fact they were quite little..<br>i had expected more..<br>yup.. lobsters are free flow but have to place order for them when you are seated.<br>the lobsters were good.. i had 2.. cooked in different style..<br>one with those sweet and sour kind of sauce..<br>the other was just served with garlic<br><br>oysters are very good<br>japanese food variety is very little<br>only a few types of sushi and a few types of sashimi available.<br>they are just ok. not fantastic<br><br>there's the salad section which i didnt try as well.<br><br>pasta section..<br>i thot the pasta was good..<br>but the pizza was bad<br>i didnt like it<br>it was soggy<br><br>various types of bread and loaf available but i didnt really like those funny flavours.. i opted for plain ones<br>dessert section was great..<br>that was the only section with the most varieties..<br>with cakes, pies, and the chinese sweet longan syrup etc..<br>i cant really remember but it was really good<br><br>for the souffle and the ice cream section.<br>souffle is a must try<br>it melts in your mouth~~~ woah..<br>but the ice cream u can just forget about it<br>they melted when i just scooped them up from the wooden container.. and then i gave up<br>i think if i bring the ice cream back to my table, it would have become only a pool of ice cream liquid.<br><br>there's not much of local food.. i dun even remember seeing any..<br>mainly it's international<br><br>honestly, it was ok.. but i felt the buffet at The Line (Shangri-La) was more worth it even though it cost about $140 after taxes with no discount.<br><br>Next I am going to try the buffet at Melt The World Cafe over at the Oriental Hotel.<br>That will be some time in dec I hope.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Triple III is definitely worth it for the price you pay, a mix of western and eastern dishes, roast lamb, beef, lobsters, sashimi delights, continental desserts, the occasional musician band etc.<br><br>Still, last time went was 2-3 years ago? price was 50+++ then. oops now it's gone to 64.10+++? Sheez...prices just keep going up.<br><br>I personally haven't tried The Line at Shang, but i have heard rave reviews abt it, then again regulars also say the standard has dropped, so it's really to each his own.<br><br>Trader's hotel also had a good international buffet before they closed for renovations. Dunno the standard now though...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hihi iori8888,<br><br>some tips on camera,<br><br>1). Try setting to a higher rate, like 1/4 to 1/20 or 1/25  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>2). Use macro when taking close up view, normal seen as a picture of a flower in the cameras.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>3).
