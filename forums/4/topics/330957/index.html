              <p><strong>AVA orders removal of "Yili" brand yoghurt as precaution</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has
              advised importers and retailers to remove the "Yili brand" Natural
              Choice Yogurt Flavoured Ice Bar With Real Fruit from the market.
              <br> <br> In a statement, it said this was a precautionary measure, pending the result of its investigation and tests.
              <br> <br>The Hong Kong Centre for Food Safety had issued a recall of the
              product made by Shanghai Yili AB Foods Company, as a sample of the
              product was found to contain low level of melamine.
              <br> <br>Melamine, a chemical normally used to make plastics and glues,
              appeared to have been added to make the products seem richer in
              protein.
              <br> <br> AVA advises consumers who have bought the implicated product not to consume them.
              <br> <br> In addition, AVA is conducting tests on other imported milk and dairy products from China for melamine contamination.
              <br> <br>A check with local supermarkets on Wednesday, before AVA released
              its advisory to the media, found that NTUC FairPrice and Giant
              Hypermarket had already taken measures to withdraw all Yili ice cream
              and yogurt products from their stores.
              <br> <br> Cold Storage, on the other hand, does not carry the affected dairy items.
              <br> <br>Melamine, blamed for the deaths of three infants in China, has also
              been found in baby milk products from 22 Chinese companies. More than
              6,000 others had fallen ill.
              <br> <br> China promises a sweeping check of every dairy producer across the country.

              <p><strong>AVA stops import &amp; sale of milk and dairy products from China</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE - The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has
              suspended the import and sale of all milk and dairy products from China
              with immediate effect, after tests found melamine contamination in two
              brands of China-made milk products.
              <br> <br>Two days ago, AVA issued an advisory about the recall of Yili brand
              "Choice Dairy Fruit Bar Yogurt Flavoured Ice Confection" based on Hong
              Kong's findings of melamine contamination in such products.
              <br> <br>Subsequently, AVA took samples of the product for testing and found
              two samples to be contaminated with melamine. All stocks of the
              affected product have been removed from market shelves since 17
              September and will be destroyed, said an AVA statement on Friday.
              <br> <br>"Our tests also found that the "Dutch Lady" brand of strawberry
              flavoured milk manufactured in China to be contaminated with melamine.
              These products have also been recalled and will be destroyed. Other
              "Dutch Lady" brand milk products which are not manufactured in China
              are unaffected," said the statement.
              <br> <br>"As a precautionary measure, AVA is also suspending the import and
              sale of all milk and milk products from China with immediate effect,"
              added the statement.
              <br> <br>Consumers who have bought Yili brand "Choice Dairy Fruit Bar Yogurt
              Flavoured Ice Confection" and "Dutch Lady" brand of strawberry
              flavoured milk (manufactured in China) are advised not to consume them.
              <br> <br>AVA said retailers and importers have also been instructed to
              recall these products and these products will be withheld from sale
              until they have cleared the necessary tests.
              <br> <br>AVA has also instructed local food manufacturers to stop the use of
              milk and milk products from China as ingredients until the completion
              of its investigations. Consignments which have just arrived or are on
              the way will also be withheld from sale.
              <br> <br>As regards infant formula, AVA reassures the public that there is
              no such import from China. Infant formulas sold in Singapore are safe
              for consumption, it said.
