              <p><strong>AVA orders all Malaysia-made Julie's brand biscuits taken off shelves</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has
              instructed importers and retailers to withdraw all Malaysia-made
              Julie's brand biscuits from the shelves.
              <br> <br> This comes after AVA detected the industrial chemical melamine in 12 Julie's biscuit products imported from Malaysia.
              <br> <br>AVA says there are 25 types of Julie's biscuits sold in Singapore,
              but as a precaution, it decides to recall all Julie's biscuits.
              <br> <br>Five other Malaysia-made biscuits are also affected. They are
              "Khong Guan Assorted Biscuits", "Khian Guan Biscuit Osborne", "Leo Gold
              Finger Choco", "Santa Chocolate Gold Fingers" and "Swan Chocolate
              Fingers". <br> <br> AVA advises consumers who have bought affected biscuits not to eat them.
              <br> <br> AVA's tests also included various types of biscuits under the major
              brands of "Khong Guan" and "Meiji" as well as other traditional
              biscuits that are manufactured in Singapore. Melamine has not been
              detected in these products.
              <br> <br>Three more China-made products have also been found to contain
              melamine. They are "Lotte Koala's March Cocoa Chocolate Biscuit",
              "Hello Kitty Strawberry Cream Filled Biscuit", and an unbranded
              industrial pack non-dairy creamer which is not available in the retail
              market as it is meant for re-export.
              <br> <br>AVA says "Lotte Koala's March Cocoa Chocolate Biscuit" and "Hello
              Kitty Strawberry Cream Filled Biscuit" have been recalled since 19
              September.
              <br> <br> The tainted products will be destroyed under AVA's supervision.
              <br> <br> The latest detection brings the total number of affected products to 33.
              <br> <br>As of 24 October, 3,200 types of milk and milk products,
              chocolates, biscuits, non-dairy creamers and other products imported
              from more than 40 countries have been taken for laboratory analysis to
              check for melamine.

              <p><strong> Julie's biscuits banned</strong></p>
              <p>EVERY day since last Saturday, trucks packed with cartons of recalled
              stock have been rolling up at a 10,000 sq ft warehouse in Tuas already
              nearly filled to the brim.</p>
              <p>Mr Simon Lim, owner of Li Ann Foodstuff, is trying to be optimistic, but it is difficult.</p>
              <p>As the sole importer of well-known Malaysian biscuit brand
              Julie's, the company is now facing a loss of up to half a million
              dollars, after the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) announced
              last Friday that 12 Julie's confectionery items were contaminated with
              melamine.</p>
              <p>As a precaution, the food safety authority immediately banned all Julie's products.</p>
              <p>The brand makes up nearly 80 per cent of Li Ann's range.</p>
              <p>'It's painful. After all, the brand's been in Singapore for so
              many years. We apologise to all our affected customers,' Mr Lim, 65,
              told The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>All the products, even those that are not contaminated, will
              be gradually destroyed over the next few weeks. Mr Lim was unable to
              give an estimate of the total volume, but the 10,000 sq ft warehouse is
              holding just half of the recalled stock, and he needs more space fast.</p>
              <p>Along with five other biscuit products from Malaysia, the 12
              affected Julie's products form the first batch of non-China goods found
              tainted with melamine in Singapore since the worldwide food scandal
              started last month.</p>
              <p>While the furore previously centred on melamine-tainted milk,
              it appears that the potentially harmful chemical has now worked its way
              into other substances.</p>
              <p>The AVA said that the contamination in the Malaysian biscuits
              seems to have stemmed from tainted ammonium bicarbonate, which is used
              as a raising agent in confectionery.</p>
              <p>According to Li Ann, nearly 90 per cent of Malaysian biscuit
              manufacturers use this raising agent, sometimes sourced from China, as
              an ingredient.</p>
              <p>Julie's Malaysian manufacturer Perfect Food is now rushing
              out new batches made with leavening agents from Germany and Japan, and
              the new products may be available as soon as in five weeks' time.</p>
              <p>The AVA confirmed it would allow the import of Julie's biscuits once it is sure they are safe.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim acknowledged that customers might turn to other brands
              in the meantime, but said he was confident they would return to
              Julie's.</p>
              <p>'We're not worried. We've been on the market for so long and our products are delicious,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim started importing the biscuits in 1980 under their former name PFI. In 1987, it was rebranded as Julie's.</p>
              <p>Since the AVA's latest announcement, manufacturers and
              importers have been scrambling to check whether their products contain
              leavening agents from China.</p>
              <p>Kraft Foods said it used ammonium bicarbonate from many
              countries, including China, but its tests on the ingredient have proved
              it is clean.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Yamakawa Trading, which brings in popular Japanese
              food brands such as Morinaga, said it had certified with its suppliers
              that all their ingredients are from Japan.</p>
              <p>Other manufacturers, like Mars, which makes products such as
              Snickers, Mars and M&amp;Ms, have confirmed that they do not use any
              raising agents at all. -- ST</p>
