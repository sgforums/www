For animal rights and against cruelty to animals.<br><br>2. not difficult to make transition. Score = 2.<br><br>a bit difficult to stick to it because of family and accessibility to meatless food in school back then (15 yrs ago) Score = 5.<br><br>3. Roti + jam, instant noodes, vegetarian noodles, abt 5 mins. Otherwise I pick only the vege from the food prepared at home. If I eat out I also tend to conciously choose food that is healthier but not always. Vegetarian food has a tendency to be oily and fried.<br>4. Once in a while.<br><br>5. breakfast - bread + coffee/vegetarian noodles; lunch - noodles minus meat, fish/prawns etc. I remembered ordering charsiew rice without char siew because i like the side dish - pickled vege. Dinner, whatever is available on dining table minus the meat. If none available, I ate plain rice with pickled vege or fried shallots (small onions).<br><br>6. As a strict religious vegetarian, yes. My deceased grandma was a vegetarian to the end and ofthen had to eat at home or at shops where our family knows they don't add garlic and eggs. As animal rights vegetarian, not much problem. Just get some commented, stared at or encouragements when ordering food to be without meat.<br><br>7. Peace of mind. Vegetarians are not necessarily healthier coz of high carbohydrate diet, often oily as well as deficiency of vitamin Bs which need to be supplemented  (of course from non-animal source).</div>

Taste and quality is inmaterial. I eat anything that is convenient, like bread and biscuits. If I have to prepare a meal, instant noodles will be fine. When eating in hawker centre, I won't be fussy about oily or healthier food but usually more green veges.<br><br>4) During the initial practise stage, yes. After about 6 months, I don't crave anymore. In fact, after 1 year, I'll experience nausea and sometimes puke if I accidentally consume "unclean" meat stuff.<br><br>5) Breakfast - Coffee/tea with bread. Lunch - hawker centre vegetarian food, rice and veges, toufu. Dinner - home cook rice with veges and bean-soup with seaweed.<br><br>6) Vegetarian is becoming more convenient today, you find them in most hawker centres. In the 80s and early 90s, it is a little difficult to locate vegetarian food stalls.<br><br>7) I am very much healthier, I had never fall sick since 1990. Never get a chance to go on MC. I don't loose my temper compared to my younger days.</div>
