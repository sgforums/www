              <h1 class="clr">Brunch in your pyjamas at novelty Singapore cafe</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, July 8 - A Singaporean restaurant is trying to break into
              the competitive brunch scene by tapping into the wild side of this
              conservative city-state, hosting pyjama parties and cross-dressing
              events for Sunday breakfast.</p>
              <p>The six-month old Oomphatico's,
              which describes itself as a health-conscious eatery, offers its
              customers an extensive menu and sofas to relax on, as well as the
              chance to show up in clothes they normally wouldn't be seen in on the
              streets.</p>
              <p>Last month, it was the pyjama brunch, where patrons were
              invited to turn up in their sleeping finery. As if to lead by example,
              the staff wore loungewear while owner Jay Hequet took orders in a
              pyjama top, a sleep mask pulled back into her hair.</p>
              <p>Other themes on the calendar include a latino brunch, a skating boarding event and a pirate breakfast.</p>
              <p>Hequet says holding themed parties is aimed at giving Oomphatico's an edge in a crowded market -- and having fun.</p>
              <p>"As
              competitive as brunch may be, people still move towards concepts that
              they are familiar with," she told Reuters. "They will come because of
              what they like at Oomphatico's. The entertainment is a part of what
              they get to experience."</p>
              <p>Eating out, whether at the ubiquitous
              hawker centres that cook up budget meals or gourmet restaurants, is an
              integral part of life in this small island where food -- and shopping
              -- are considered the national pastimes.</p>
              <p>Sunday brunches are
              popular, especially with the legions of expatriates, as a form of
              weekend entertainment in a country where the heat, humidity and
              frequent tropical downpours drive many people into the air-conditioning
              indoors.</p>
              <p>All major hotels and scores of cafes and restaurants
              offer them and there are also at least two websites,
              www.singaporesundaybrunch.com and http://brunchclub.meetup.com, that
              are dedicated to showcasing what's on offer.</p>
              <p>Champagne brunches,
              with their all-you-can-eat-and-drink buffets, are sought-after and
              bookings must be made long in advance. Healthier options, such as those
              offered by Oomphatico's and other eateries, also draw the crowds.</p>
              <p>Oomphatico's,
              located at a shopping mall frequented by expatriates, gets its share of
              patrons, but on the pyjama-themed Sunday, hardly any one dressed down
              for the occasion.</p>
              <p>But Hequet remains undeterred, saying it may take time for customers to move off the sidelines.</p>
              <p>"Our guests may not wear their pyjamas, but they love to be a part of what we do," she explained.</p>
              <p>"My
              team members are conservative too. Even if they start off doing things
              like this because they've been asked to, eventually, they start to
              throw away their inhibitions."</p>
