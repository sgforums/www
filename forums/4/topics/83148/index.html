            <div class='col-md body'>Victorial Market. Their are lots of fresh fruits which they sell in kilograms. The Oranges are really sweet and juicy. You can get your groceries there. Like sauages, cheese, bread, fish, tomatoes, pickles etc. And they do sell cook food like fish n chips, hot-dog, burgers etc. Interesting place where the locals do their marketing.</div>
