            <div class='col-md body'>Well...for u guys who are craving pork ribs...the best place that i can recommend is 'Tony Roma's' at suntec city...for u guys who ain't sure where it is....it is at the basement..just downstairs watson's.<br><br>Anyway...i worked that b4 for a few months...hmmm...workwise...it was quite crap but no doubt a good experience..anyway in my honest opinion...the ribs are really good. The sauce is yummy!!<br><br>How i know?...Cos i kapo food b4 mah.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ..hehe...<br>Dun worry about food cleanliness..hygiene standards are good.....most of the time. Below is a list of recommended items plus items which i dun think is very nice.....here goes<br><br>Highly Recommended:<br>St Louis style ribs (Comes in 3 flavours)<br>All the flavours taste quite similar...just varying levels of sweetness and spicyness...but still good!<br><br>Southern Smoky Beef Ribs( Oh-So-Good)<br><br>French Onion Soup (MmmmMmmm)<br><br>Baked Potato Soup (Slurp!!)<br><br>Onion Loaf ( Quite yummy but some may not like cos it makes mouth smelly and is oily)<br>Giant hand-cut Spanish onions, breaded, deep fried, and served with RomaÂ’s Original Sauce. Half loaf/Full loaf.<br><br>Side dishes( Comes with all main course)<br>Baked Potato(No need explain...u all should know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br>Ranch style beans( Pinto beans...which is larger than normal beans...very nice)<br>Rice(Fragrantly cooked, quite like chicken rice...got taste one..its yummy!)<br><br>Desserts<br>Apple Crisp (Bloody good!)<br>Tart Jonathan apples blended with crumb topping and baked. Topped with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.<br><br>Skillet Brownie Sundae (As yummy as shit!)<br>A warm, chewy brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and crushed OREOÂ® cookies. Served in a cast iron skillet.<br><br>P.S The desserts are quite large portion....so for those with lil appetit left...might not be able to finish<br><br>Not Recommended:<br>BBQ Half Chicken ( very dry on the inside...only outside got sauce)<br>Basted in Original Sauce and charbroiled. Served with French Fries and Cole Slaw. White meat only extra.<br><br>OKIE...thats about all...of cos i couldn't manage to cover the entire menu...but hope that this lil review can give u all a good idea of the food at Tony Roma's.....and to add on...the ambience is nice too....really 70's american deco...plus a wall mural painting of the twin towers...which i think they should paint over.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So do any of u guys have other places to recommend for pork ribs?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reply to both healthy88 and deathscythe99<br><br>attached map of Buckaroo BBQ and Grill...<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/b4byb34r/BuckarooMap.jpg"><br><br>healthy88 ... they have combo meals perfect for 2 to share. usually we will order a combo meal as the main then appetiser is the onion rings or buffalo wings or soup. It all depends how many of us are dining there. If more then we can order all 3 items for appetizer.<br><br>enjoy...</div>
