            <div class='col-md body'>In India, rice is considered "the foundation of all nourishment. It is given to both the ill and the healthy, because it's easily assimilated into our bodily tissues."<br><br>While many health-conscious Westerners value brown rice for its high bran and fiber content, Ayurveda, which means "knowledge of life," has been practiced for 5,000 years, it embraces white rice, particularly long-grained, fragrant basmati rice, because it is lighter and easier to digest. White basmati rice is also sattvic (pure) and balances the three doshas mind-body types: pitta, vata, and kapha.<br><br>Kapha is composed of water and earth. In most people, one predominates, influencing health, appearance, personality and character. People who are vata, which is space and air, tend to have cold extremities and dry, thin skin. People who are pitta, which is fire and water, have oily skin that's warm to the touch.<br><br>Basmati rice builds body tissue and is very high in prana [vital life energy]. Basmati rice fills many roles in Ayurvedic nutrition. Its rasa, or quality of taste, is sweet and offers a deep satisfaction. As the body digests it, its virya (energetic impact on the digestive fire) is cooling. Finally, its vipaka (post-digestion effect) is also sweet and provides a sense of satisfaction and comfort.<br><br><img src="http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/5365/basmatiricelu3.png"><br>Adapted from The New York Times<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stuck with a hangover? While your Western doctor might suggest drinking more water, a visit to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine might yield advice along the lines of toufu, watermelon, green tea and even lemons.<br><br>Overindulging in alcoholic beverages is harmful to the human body, but many people place their hopes in products touted as being able to break down alcohol, or even in patent medicines to increase their capacity for drink. Doctors emphasize that there is no product capable of mitigating the harm alcohol wreaks on the body, and the ones that are available today are not useful either for breaking down alcohol or bringing the penitent drinker a clearer head. Less in the glass, they say, is the only solution.<br><br>The problems alcohol brings are not limited to cirrhosis of the liver, a condition most people are aware of. Alcohol can also cause hardening of the liver and nervous disorders. Su Yingfu, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, says that studies show drinking too much alcohol can lead to bone damage or even bone death rates in about 5 percent of cases. Each week, any intake over 400 cc of alcohol means more bone that is held without oxygen and perishes as a result.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not the fat in the foods we eat but, far more, the excess carbohydrates from our starch- and sugar-loaded diet that is making people fat and unhealthy, and leading to epidemic levels of a host of diseases such as diabetes.<br><br>If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, chances are very good that the excess carbohydrates in your body are, in part or whole, to blame:<br><br>Excess weight<br>Fatigue and frequent sleepiness<br>Depression<br>Brain fogginess<br>Bloating<br>Low blood sugar<br>High blood pressure<br>High triglycerides<br><br>We all need a certain amount of carbohydrates, of course, but, through our addiction to grains, potatoes, sweets and other starchy and sugary foods, we are consuming far too many. The body's storage capacity for carbohydrates is quite limited, though, so here's what happens to all the excess: they are converted, via insulin, into fat and stored in the adipose, or fatty, tissue.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moderation is the key....<br><br>B/W The proven way to increase your metabolism is to build muscle. We lose muscle as we age and with weight loss, and as a result, our metabolism slows down. The good news is that it's never too late to build muscle, so regardless of how old you are or how much muscle you have lost you can still speed up your metabolism. The best way to begin is to work with a qualified trainer to help you design a plan that meets your needs. Be sure to speak with your doctor before beginning.<br><br></div>
