            <div class='col-md body'><br>Waited 35 min for food, then...<br><br>The New Paper<br>13 January 2006<br><br>MY fiance and I had a bad experience at the PastaMania restaurant in Parco Bugis recently.<br><br>When we placed our orders, the counter staff was dour and impatient. It was 3pm.<br><br>While waiting, my fiance noticed that the cutlery was a bit dirty. There were also hardened pasta bits stuck on a fork.<br><br>We told a staff member and to my disbelief, she walked away without replacing the fork.<br><br>Next, I noticed two separate tables of customers who arrived about 15 minutes after us.<br><br>After 20 minutes, our food had not been served while the two other tables of customers were already having their meal.<br><br>It was now about 3.35pm. Frustrated, my fiance told a staff member that if our food was not served within five minutes, we would want a refund.<br><br>To our shock, moments later, she returned our money! 'Ouick casual dining'? I don't think so.<br><br>- Evelyn Ho<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously i wouldn't wanna work in F&amp;B even if they pay me 5000 a month.<br><br>First hand experience, I've worked in a restraunt before during my holidays, those pasta mania..  jacks place.. swensens type. Its pretty shitty. Cos pay sucks compared to other countries, secondly, singaporeans are not the friendly (we have to admit).. you welcome them with a smile and some of them ignore you, only a handful bother to retun that smile. And yes, waiter and customers alike.. we complain complain and complain. I'm rather lucky to avoid being complained<br><br>Even with all the ongoing service improvement crap, its not going to change unless singaporean change their general attitude. Again, waiters and customers alike<br><br>Forgive me for being such an arsehole but i really enjoy serving foreign customers than locals seriously. They are more polite, treat you with respect and even if they do complain, they do it discreetly and politely, YES even if they are angry.<br><br>But than again waiters too need to improve on their service. Most of them are foreign students studying and working at the same time. My general advice is if you can't cope doing both at the same time, don't work if you can help it. Cos after lessons the whole day and you're really shagged out. You report for your shift feeling shitty and moody. Thats when all the complains comes in about poor service attitude.<br><br>Restraunts are to be blamed too, my sibling who used to work overseas at a local restraunt there had went through a short orientation/training program before starting work, in order to familiarise with customer service. The restraunt took effort to ensure that the service level is there and that tips received by each individual need not be shared among others.<br><br>In singapore, there is no such thing. When you report for work not knowing anything, they just leave you with some simple instructions and the rest is up to you to learn by yourself. And tips received are collected and shared among all waiters and waitresses, which is not really fair to those who did their part, as some of them actually skive off for a cigarette or extra long toilet break.<br><br>Btw, i really pity managers at restraunts outlets. They work almost everyday and even on off days, they have to come back to check on things and do up the tons of paperwork. People work they work, people not working they also work, public holiday=work even harded. They pay is high, but so is the workload and stress to meet sales quota. Such a boring and lifeless job, from what i observe, they really lack social life, other than interacting with customers.<br><br></div>

When you report for work not knowing anything, they just leave you with some simple instructions and the rest is up to you to learn by yourself. And tips received are collected and shared among all waiters and waitresses, which is not really fair to those who did their part, as some of them actually skive off for a cigarette or extra long toilet break.<br><br>Btw, i really pity managers at restraunts outlets. They work almost everyday and even on off days, they have to come back to check on things and do up the tons of paperwork. People work they work, people not working they also work, public holiday=work even harded. They pay is high, but so is the workload and stress to meet sales quota. Such a boring and lifeless job, from what i observe, they really lack social life, other than interacting with customers.<br><br></div></blockquote>good tips given to waiter n waitress.<br>mine restaurant give to boss  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
