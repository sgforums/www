              Cow's milk is homogenized and pasteurized -- you've read the labels. What does that process entail? Well, apparently not enough. The current standards for pasteurization do NOT kill all of the harmful bacteria in milk. <strong>Not to mention the blood and feces found in milk -- drink up!</strong> Please follow this link for more information: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.suite101.com/external_link.cfm?elink=http://www.notmilk.com/k.html">http://www.notmilk.com/k.html</a><p></p>

              <p>Actually there is some truth in what TS had said.</p>
              <p>When i was younger, i was a fan of milk. I would drink at least 2 glasses a day. However, this caused me to suffer from a flu-like syndrome every morning when i wake up, regardless of the weather.</p>
              <p>So, i went to this doctor and he told me to stop drinking milk for a period of time. After i did, my illness stopped. I no longer experience a sniffy nose every morning. From then on, I had limited my dairy comsumption and no longer consume milk directly. I do occasionally pamper myself with products which contains milk like teh and kopi.</p>
              <p>Actually the best evidence to the whether milk is good is by personal experience. If you find that consuming milk actually allow you to live healthily, by all means go ahead. But if you find milk to be affecting your health in a negative way, like me, then why don't you just stop consuming milk for a period of time and see whether that medical condition becomes better.</p>
              <p>It doesn't kill to stop drinking milk for a week :D</p>

              <p>Lets tackle these one by one rather than just saying 'you're wrong'...</p>
              <p>Obesity - of course milk can lead to obesity - it's full of lipids. You eat too much streaky bacon you'll get fat too. This is also your link to diabetes, as obesity is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes. However the intake of lipids and other triglycerides are important when kept in moderation as they have been shown to prevent heart attacks and strokes among other things.</p>
              <p>'Adult humans cannot digest milk' - this statement is categorically WRONG. What it should say is 'Most adult humans cannot digest lactose' - and indeed in many adult humans it can result in diarrhea or constipation due to mild-severe allergic reactions - and continued IBS with no treatment or control has been linked to the development of cancers such as colorectal cancer. HOWEVER, this is by far not the case for all people and in fact many who are allergic can still tolerate varying amounts of lactose without an allergic reaction - so basically as far as this goes we're saying if it gives you diarrhea or constipation don't drink as much... seems pretty logical doesn't it? (Points less obviously covered here: Crohns disease, Colon cancer, autoimmune disease, diarrhea &amp; constipation)</p>
              <p> Asthma is caused by excess mucus production in the lungs and the ingestion of dairy products is linked to increased mucus production... HOWEVER... this is not the case in all asthma sufferers and you'll find that the vast majority of asthma sufferers won't find this shocking news at all and already regulate their dairy intake (and will have done from a very early age). It is also unproven to say that milk CAUSES asthma - there are theorys that development of asthma could be related to a milk allergy but the majority consensus is that it is related to genetic mutation of goblet cells in the lungs. I have found not a shred of credible research to support the suggestion that milk causes asthma. (Also covers 'sinuses')</p>
              <p>Early sexual maturation/Early breast growth - I'm at a loss to explain this, again I've found no evidence whatsoever to support this. In fact, apart from your quotes I've found no suggestion of it either. Both of these when caused environmentally are due to exposure to oestrogen... as far as I'm aware (throw in here, breast cancer)</p>
              <p>Leukemia... hmm... ok... firstly may I make a point here? Leukemia is an umbrella name, it actually refers to a number of similar cancers but with varying causes - which are you linking milk to? Anyway, prove me wrong, but it is my understanding that this myth started because a number of types of Leukemia are caused by viruses and these viruses can be passed by milk. HOWEVER the Bovine Leukemia Virus' only effect on humans is succeptibility that dreaded...rhinovirus.</p>
              <p>ADHD - up to 80percent of cases of ADHD are thought to be genetic. Of the rest there's a lot of theorys but I'm yet to hear a milk related one (Well done on being a first) - diet control is common in management of ADHD however it's usually the removal of E numbers...</p>
              <p>Osteoperosis -  I can sort of see where this is coming from - excess calcium in the blood can cause bone reabsorption and ultimately bone loss when levents of PTH are too high due to vitamin D deficiency, however it goes both ways. You do need a certain amount of calcium as calcium deficiency can also cause osteoperosis. I'm lacking in evidence to support your theory again but even in this case it requires a vitamin D deficiency which most of us don't have. And you could argue it's not really milk that's doing it anyway.</p>
              <p>Arthritis - this is a very interesting one... actually the most damning to your claim. If you hadn't included this one it could be excusable. See, your anti milk people claim that there's a 'collosal amount of evidence linking milk to arthritis' however I happen to believe the people who have more of a vested interest in arthritis. The people to whom the outcome for milk doesn't matter - the people who need real, honest results to help prevent and cure something that can ruin lives. And those people say that milk can help prevent arthritis as it contains CLA - a fatty acid we can't produce and one that has been shown to block enzymes that trigger inflammation and can eventually lead to joint damage and... arthritis. Boom.</p>
              <p>Anaemia  - milk doesn't cause this... infant amaemia can be caused by keeping a child on a milk diet for too long - it's caused because there's no iron in the diet, not because the kid's drinking milk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So for me... it might not be the wonder drink some people try to make it out to be but as far as I'm concerned if I'm gonna cross the busy road every day to get to college, I might as well enjoy a splash of milk on my cereal... I'm not expecting health benefits - I just find it goes well with the cereal...</p>

              <p>What your are talking about is lactose tolerance or lactose intolerance (2 sides of the same coin). Lactose tolerance is genetic and therefore racial. Lactose tolerance is the ability of individuals to metabolize lactose in adulthood. It runs from a high percentage among whites (with the peak occuring in Sweden-95% lactose tolerant people) and lowest among East Asians (5% among Chinese, Japanese etc).</p>
              <p>Check out a wiki site for the complete table of peoples against lactose tolerance.</p>
              <p>As for osteophorosis, calcium ( which is found in copius amounts in milk) actually prevents it. There's anothet condition where too much calcium (doesnt necessarily translate to too much milk) causes brittle bones.</p>

              <p>I used to drink freah cow's milk (pasteurized of course) until I was about 10. That's when the government took away the dairy land from the few dairy farmers in Singapore. I still remember the milk walla coming to my house in his German type motocycle with the carraige at his side, full of freashly milked milk. Great times!</p>
