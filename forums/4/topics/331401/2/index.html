              <p class="MsoBodyText2">Before I begin to discuss the importance of not drinking 
                  cow’s milk, I ask that if anyone believes that this article is in anyway false, 
                  please fell free to do your own research and challenge this issue. I guarantee 
                  that you will not only find information that supports this article, but you 
                  will think twice before drinking milk again.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal;">Asked what single change in the American diet would produce the
              greatest health benefit, Washington DC based pediatrician Russell Bunai, says
              “Eliminating dairy products out of the diet.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal;">We were raised to think of cow’s milk as a perfect food. The
              National Dairy Council advertises that “milk is natural” and If you don’t drink
              milk, the council will tell you that your bones will become brittle and your
              strength will fade due to a lack of calcium. Many Americans out of fear make
              dairy products a staple of their diets. Knowledge is a killer of fear. The more
              you know the less you fear. Drinking milk will not make you big and strong, nor
              will it prevent osteoporosis. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal;">Cows do not drink cow’s milk. Calves stop drinking cow’s milk between 
                  the ages of six to eight months. Humans are the only species that drink the 
                  milk of another animal. You will never see a kitten drink milk from a goat, 
                  or a doe drink milk from a bear. However, we have been conditioned to think 
                  that we must drink milk from cows. We are told that we must drink milk from 
                  cows. We are told that we must drink cow’s milk for the rest of our lives. 
                  No adult animal continues to drink milk after they are weaned. We, as humans, 
                  drink milk from an adult animal that do not drink their own milk after they 
                  reach 7 months of age. Would you drink milk from lactating women? To my surprise 
                  when I ask this question, many people frown in disgust. Human milk is made 
                  for human consumption for a specific period of time. It has the appropriate 
                  nutrients dedicated to building and maintaining our bodies. After 22-24 months, 
                  humans no longer need their mother’s milk. So why are we still drinking cow’s 
                  milk as adults? Not to mention giving it to our children. Cow’s milk is meant 
                  to turn a 200-puound calf in to a 2,000-pound cow. This reason alone is why 
                  America is the leading country in the world of obesity. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal;">The Biggest problem with cow’s milk is that the protein in the
              cow’s milk damages the human immune system. Amino acids, the units that make up
              proteins, are building blocks for all living cells. When amino acids in our
              food are properly broken down by the digestive system into protein, it does no
              harm to the immune system. Protein from milk, however, is absorbed into the
              blood fully indigested, provoking an immune response. Repeated exposure to
              these proteins disrupts normal immune functions and may eventually lead to
              diseases. </span></p>

                  Children who are breast fed only do not have ear infections. Also know that 
                  antibiotic does not cure ear infections. The average American drinks milk 
                  and eat cheese containing new strains of bacteria, immune to the 52 different 
                  antibiotics, which are also, present in milk.<span>  </span>Therefore, no matter how many painful shots you subject your child

In those poor and undeveloped country or in my grandparents time, people's health is rather good, they never even hear about disease related to low density of bone structure like osteoporosis.<br>But now, everywhere I go I can see young people carry a tongkat to support him to walk.<br>I can list down another 10 disadvantages of drinking milk, but just excessive protein and osteoporosis are 2 reasons good enough for adult to stop drinking milk.<br><br>I think if there is one who managed to overcome money attack from dairy company and convince the world to stop drinking milk, he deserve nobel prize.

              <p>If you grew up in North America, chances are your mother fed you cow's
              milk from the time you were a toddler until you graduated from high
              school. We've all seen the advertisements of the diary industry for
              milk and cheese on television and in magazines. In fact, the current
              milk moustache campaign is on billboards and magazines all over the
              U.S. with some of the best known television stars, supermodels and
              movie stars wearing that white stuff on their upper lip. Wonder why the
              cows need such heavy duty P.R.? I think the dairy industry might be
              afraid that the word could get out: Milk does NOT do anybody that much
              good. Now before you dismiss this as another one of my paranoid rants,

              <p>Milk is a substance produced by the body of the mama cow to provide
              nutrition for her baby calves as they grow in one year from a little
              baby into a 300 pound beast. That's some serious fat and protein packed
              into a drink. Proteins intended for baby cows to digest.</p>
              <p>Recombinent
              Bovine Growth Hormone is in the milk you drink unless you buy organic
              or buy from a local farmer who does not use rbGH on his cows. RbGH is
              passed through the body of the cow and into the secreted milk and then
              consumed by children and adults everywhere. Ever wonder why girls are
              developing more rapidly and at an earlier age? Just a thought. For more

              <p>Cow's
              milk is homogenized and pasteurized -- you've read the labels. What
              does that process entail? Well, apparently not enough. The current
              standards for pasteurization do NOT kill all of the harmful bacteria in
              milk. Not to mention the blood and feces found in milk -- drink up!

              <p>Some
              children who suffer from recurrent ear infections have responded very
              well to the removal of cow's milk from their diets, often resulting in
              complete recovery and no recurrence of ear infections the entire time
              they remain dairy-free. Coincidence? I think not. Please follow this

              <p>Milk
              may leach calcium from our bones, therefore exacerbating osteoparosis
              and osteoarthritis. Both of these degenerative bone diseases are most
              prevalent in the milk-drinking societies of the western cultures,
              especially the United States and Canada where the big money dairy
              industry has hypnotic powers over the consumer. Look at this

              <p>Are you feeding cow's milk to your children? Maybe it's time to
              re-think that decision. I know I did. I have never given milk or dairy
              to my daughter and don't plan to. The occasional enjoyment of an
              ice-cream cone on vacation is not out of the question -- but it will
              not be a part of her daily diet. I recently cut milk from my own diet.
              My husband is lactose intolerant (and may also have a milk-protein
              allergy related to inflammatory bowel disease) so cutting dairy was not
              a tough decision for him either. The point is - it's possible to live
              and eat well without dairy. You can even enjoy rich desserts without
              milk. Look in any vegetarian cookbook and you'll find a recipe for
              Tofu-chocolate-silk pie -- and I'm telling you it's DELICIOUS! You can
              substitute soy milk, rice milk or nut milks like almond milk for cow's
              milk in some recipes and on cereal if you enjoy cereal in the morning.
              We choose soy milk for our cereal. It's important to try lots of
              different brands until you find the one that tastes best to you because
              they are all a little bit different to taste. Here are some sites for
              soymilk and ricemilk:</p>

              Soy Products: This company is a well-established soy producing company

              beverage as it was reported to have contained undeclared cow's milk as
              an ingredient. I have friends who prefer the tast of WhiteWave Silk
              plain flavor over all other brands. Try it and see.

                            Second Disproves Dairy-Weight Loss Claims</span></p>
              <p>Washington, D.C.—Two 
                            recent studies are souring milk's image among health authorities. 
                            One, published in the November issue of the <em>American Journal 
                            of Clinical Nutrition</em>, shows that women who consume two or 
                            more glasses of milk a day have twice the risk of a certain form 
                            of ovarian cancer than those who rarely or never consume milk.</p>
              <p>Headed by Susanna Larsson 
                            at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, researchers conducted a prospective 
                            <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/5/1353">study</a> of more than 60,000 women and concluded that "intakes of lactose 
                            and dairy products, particularly milk, were significantly associated 
                            with the risk of serous ovarian cancer." (Serous epithelial cancer 
                            is the most common type of ovarian cancer.)</p>
              <p>The second study, presented 
                            last month at the North American Association for the Study of Obesity 
                            Conference, shows that high dairy consumption does not help dieters 
                            lose weight, refuting the findings of an earlier and smaller study 
                            that the dairy industry has aggressively publicized through major 
                            advertising campaigns, including a prominent one featuring talk 
                            show host Dr. Phil. The new study was conducted by Jean Harvey-Berino, 
                            Ph.D., a professor at the University of Vermont.</p>
              <p>The original study-which 
                            had seemed to suggest that dairy products might help weight loss-had 
                            only 11 participants in the dairy group, and required a 500-calorie 
                            per day diet deficit. Its findings do not appear to hold, in light 
                            of the new study which used a similar method in a larger sample.</p>
              <p>"Milk's biological purpose 
                            is to promote rapid growth in infant cows," says Amy Joy Lanou, 
                            Ph.D. "It makes biological sense that its nutrients and hormonal 
                            effects might also promote the growth of cancer cells."</p>
              <p>As to the Harvey-Berino study, 
                            Dr. Lanou says, "It reminds us that the dairy industry's health 
                            claims are often based on thin scientific evidence." Dr. Lanou's 
                            letter challenging the dairy industry's weight-loss claims is scheduled 
                            for publication in the January issue of <em>Obesity Research. </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Swedish study is one 
                            of several published in the past few years suggesting a link between 
                            dairy consumption and ovarian cancer. The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9883790%20">Iowa

                            showed that the highest consumers of lactose (milk sugar) had a 
                            60 percent increased risk of ovarian cancer as compared to those

                            was associated with a 20 percent increase in serous ovarian cancers. 
                            Researchers hypothesize that galactose, a component of the milk 
                            sugar lactose, may damage ovarian cells, making them more susceptible 
                            to cancer.</p>
