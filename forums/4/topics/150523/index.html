            <div class='col-md body'>Dear SgForums members,<br><br>I'm Kenny and currently taking my O' levels in 2 months time. I'm in a dillemma of my future education path after my O's. I am very interested in taking up a course for a Diploma in Culinary Crafts/Skills but there are some problems i have encountered and I hope to get some advice from the people experienced in this aspect.<br><br>I have searched the internet for culinary schools in Singapore and have only managed to find two schools providing such diplomas (Diploma in Culinary Crafts/Skills).<br><br>Shatec<br>This is a popular school in Singapore for students planning to take the path of becoming a chef or work in the tourism industry (hospitality/hotel management). It has also been around for more than 20 years thus, having a strong reputation for a culinary school.<br><br>at-sunrice<br>At-sunrice has only been around for a few years (2001 if I am not wrong). It focuses on training chefs to work globally(at least 3 countries) by the age of 30 and follows a work &amp; study system (Apprenticeship).<br><br>Now, I am in a dilemma of what school to choose. I have thought about the pros and cons of both schools for me.<br><br>If I were to choose at-sunrice, I would have a problem in paying the tuition fees. The tuition fees is really steep compared to Shatec (SGD$15000 for diploma course + SGD$3600 for Culinary and Service Excellence certificate course for unexperienced students). There's also other cost to consider; a laptop is compulsory for all students taking the DCC course, uniforms and etc. The minimum age requirement is 18 which means I will have 1 year to work for my tuition fees and get my CSE certificate (or 3 months kitchen experience and a certificate in cooking). The school doesn't have a strong reputation and it would be a problem in approaching my family for support. At-sunrice concentrates more on imparting culinary skills compared to Shatec which sysllabus includes food cost control, kitchen organisation and even pastry and baking &amp; etc. at sunrice's syllabus includes<br><br>Cookery Craft 101<br>Food safety and sanitation<br>Kitchen structure and Equipment<br>Storeroom management.<br><br>Cut &amp; Create 101<br>Food preparation and fabrication<br>Kitchen tools and knives skills<br>Asian &amp; Western cooking techniques<br><br>Culinary Crafting 101<br>Asian &amp; Western Herbs &amp; Spices<br>Asian &amp; Western soups, stocks, sauces<br>Western Specialties: Garde Manager, cold food preparation, salads, canapÃ©s and h'ors d'oeuvres<br>Asian Specialties: Curries, Herb &amp; Spice Blends<br>Asian &amp; Western - Noodles &amp; Bread<br>Asian &amp; Western - Tim Sum &amp; Dumplings<br><br>Carve and Create<br>Professional Crafter and Culture<br>Fruit &amp; Vegetable Carving<br>Plating &amp; Presentation<br>Cuisine Trends<br><br>Culinary Cutting Edge<br>Five Senses &amp; Six Flavours<br>Effective Performances &amp; Presentations<br>Mastering recipes<br>English for Culinarians<br><br>For Shatec, its tuition fees is around SGD$6000 including insurance, uniforms, textbooks and etc. Its minimum requirements will allow me start the course by July next year without needing any other certificates. There will be a much lighter financial burden on my family. It offers a 2 year programme including 9 months of working experience. It is also much nearer to my residence compared to at-sunrice which is located at Fort Canning. Its diversed sysllabus includes:<br><br>Beverages<br>Menu Planning and Pricing<br>Cooking Practical (Asian and Western)<br>Principles of Cooking (Asian and Western)<br>Catering Science<br>Pastry and Baking<br>Food Cost Control Foods<br>Event Catering<br>Communication Skills<br>Introduction to F&amp;B Operations<br>English<br>Kitchen Organisation<br>Information Technology<br>Principles of Supervision<br><br>Please give me some advice on what I should do to start my career in culinary and what other alternatives do I have? What job opportunities will I have after i graduate? What other things about taking the culinary path should I be aware of? Does the any of thediplomas earn me a credit in Universities if I were to further my studies? Is there any tuition grant I can apply for?<br><br>I must thank you for taking time in reading my post.<br><br>Best Regards,<br>Kenny<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there mate, looks like you beed help on your school selections. Ask yourself, will you want to work overseas ? Places like Europe, Canada, Us, etc etc ? I would thats why i'm in Canada now doing my Culinary dip..<br><br>If you need to choose between those two schools ? I'll go with @sunrise ! They're dip &amp; degree certs are from the US so job placing wise in the future will be much better then what shatec can offer.. Yes the school fees are higher but think long term !<br><br>You're still 1 year short of enrolling with @sunrise ? Well, it's good in a way ! It gives you a year to get exp working in kitchens ! It's not like what you see on tv.. Like Jamie Oilver, etc etc. It's hell working in a kitchen esp when you are new ! You get picked on everyday, shouted @ everyday, etc etc.. Try it out 1st before planning for your future. Hours are long and tiring !<br><br>Here's a good read up on becoming a chef..<br><br><a href="http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/becoming_a_chef.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/becoming_a_chef.htm</a><br><br>All the best mate !

O levels that is. You'll need to show proof of funds to the canadian high commission in sg. Like show how much your folks have in their bank and must be at least $20k CAD to apply for a student visa. Fees in a way would hit up to $10k CAD for the course but of course u'll learn more here..<br><br>The chefs in my school are all quite high profiled so its good in a way. The school also has the the hotel management school of swiss backing and job placements here in Canada are much easier to find when u grad from the school. The school will help get a job for u..<br><br>Now u know the reason why i didnt go to either shatec or @sunrise ? No point spending so much to learn culinary and it's not even french ! In all big hotel's you'll need to know the fundamentals of french culinary !</div>
