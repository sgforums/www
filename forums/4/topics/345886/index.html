              <p>I was at the FoodFare beside Admiralty MRT and I ordered a chicken claypot rice. I decided to try it since it was listed as "chef's recommendation". But when the food was ready, the outlook cannot make it, and the taste sux when I ate it. I left immediatedly.</p>

              <p>Below are some scenarios that can make me refuse to pay:</p>
              <p>1) give too little dish (if i eat mixed rice, they give too little and still dare to charge me the money)</p>
              <p>2) forget to add sauce for me (if the food comes with it without the need to remind them)</p>
              <p>3) food outlook sux (the appearance totally different from the menu, a bit different is ok for me)</p>
              <p>4) overcharge items ( imagine u have to pay $5 for nasi lemak, rice + 2 dish.</p>

              <p>they don't. but i think i'm gracious enough to not kick up an infantile fuss, probably sneak a photo and post in stomp and risk getting into a fist fight, and to tolerate and then to chalk it up as an experience not to go back there again.</p>

              <p>apparently it's stated clearly. i nv noticed it though until i went back again to bind some notes.</p>
              <p>true, the world system teaches that you either makan others, or be makaned.</p>
              <p>the world system also teaches that to get ahead in this world, you have to do whatever it takes, by hook or by crook.</p>
              <p>and that to get back your honour, you have to take revenge</p>
              <p>a stab in the back isn't enough, add two more knife wounds in the front as well.</p>
              <p>some believes an eye for an eye, but it's ok to claim 2 eyes for an eye.</p>

              <p>I share my exp first...</p>
              <p>I was at the FoodFare beside Admiralty MRT and I ordered a
              chicken claypot rice. I decided to try it since it was listed as
              "chef's recommendation". But when the food was ready, the outlook
              cannot make it, and the taste sux when I ate it. I left
              immediatedly.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, they got the cheek to call that claypot
              rice their "chef's recommendation". I must give them a pat
              seriously.</p>
              <p>Back to the topic, I think next time if I dont get the food I
              deserve, even if they had prepared it, i wont pay them a single
              cent.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Below are some scenarios that can make me refuse to pay:</span></p>
              <p>1) give too little dish (if i eat mixed rice, they give too
              little and still dare to charge me the money)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) forget to add sauce for me (if the food comes with it without
              the need to remind them)</span></p>
              <p>3) food outlook sux (the appearance totally different from the
              menu, a bit different is ok for me)</p>
              <p>4) overcharge items ( imagine u have to pay $5 for nasi lemak,
              rice + 2 dish.</p>
