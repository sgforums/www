              <p>5 Reasons Why <strong>WE SHOULD NOT CLEAR</strong> tables at fastfood restaurants.<br><br>1) Fastfood in Singapore is not like other countries. It is slow and expensive, more expensive than Pizza Hut, Delifrance and Cafe Cartel on Weekdays. Certainly, we expect some service. Already, we are being chased off at Macdonalds after paying up for our meals and made to stand at the side like a stupid idiot. Even chilli and ketchup sauce is now available in a bin for you to squeeze it yourself.<br><br>2) Aunties and uncles who are clearing the tables now will get retrenched, as they no longer need to station a single staff to clear tables. while fastfood chains earn more, and their CEOs earn more. Middle line to line staff do not earn more, nor the customers benefit. These aunties and uncles are low wage income holders, and they may have to beg on the streets without a low-skilled job.<br><br>3) With the clearing of the tables, leftovers will be left to rot by minority inconsiderate patrons while there are no cleaners to clean up spillages and leftovers. Think of the cockroaches, lizards and ants sharing a meal with you on the same table.<br><br>4)  Its meant to be fast - I have to queue up for the food, wait for my food to be cooked, squeeze my own ketchup, eat my own food, clear my own table, HOW CAN IT BE FAST?<br><br>5) Any add ons?</p>

              <p>At the risk of lowering my intelligence to your pathetic level, I'll reply to you ONE last time.</p>
              <p>You getting told off means that the auntie is lacking in social graces. If she feels that her livelihood is threatened by that, so be it; she's not thinking straight. Like I said, there are 1001 things for her to do besides clearing your food for you.</p>
              <p>It does not give you the right to be lacking in social graces. It does NOT give you the right to just leave your food on your table.</p>
              <p>Now answer this question, you doofus: by your reasoning, should we litter our estates indiscriminately so that the cleaning aunties will have work to do?</p>
              <p>Pathetic. I think my IQ level has just dropped a few points by talking to you.</p>

              <p>now.. try going to a place where people leave a mess.. you want to sit down also damned TL right? ask the old woman to come and clean?</p>
              <p>writing all this shit down, took a lot of effort... just clear up your stuff.. put the stuff in the bin.. is it too hard?</p>
              <p>btw.. i've heard the same goddamned argument from a lot of people whose characters are such that they'll never ever clean up unless yelled at by others... so they clean up and get scolded? it's BS... they'll never clean up in the first place...</p>
              <p>they probably got scolded for NOT cleaning up and then in a fit of spite, went to make up some BS on the interweb to rationalise their lack of courtesy...</p>
              <p>anyway, fast food restaurant? go read the signs... also what are the bins for? what are the tray liners for? what are the disposable wrappers and cups and everything for?</p>

              <p>So if you hate stepping on litter, would you instead enjoy sitting down to someone else's chicken bones or used napkins? Think of the person who's taking over your crummy ketchup-stained counter.</p>
              <p>If it bothers you so much, what's stopping you from clearing your table <em>and</em> handing your tray <em>to</em> the janitor?</p>
