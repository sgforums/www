            <div class='col-md body'><p>5 Reasons Why <strong>WE SHOULD NOT CLEAR</strong> tables at fastfood restaurants. <br><br>1) Fastfood in Singapore is not like other countries. It is slow and expensive, more expensive than Pizza Hut, Delifrance and Cafe Cartel on Weekdays. Certainly, we expect some service. Already, we are being chased off at Macdonalds after paying up for our meals and made to stand at the side like a stupid idiot. Even chilli and ketchup sauce is now available in a bin for you to squeeze it yourself.<br><br>2) Aunties and uncles who are clearing the tables now will get retrenched, as they no longer need to station a single staff to clear tables. while fastfood chains earn more, and their CEOs earn more. Middle line to line staff do not earn more, nor the customers benefit. These aunties and uncles are low wage income holders, and they may have to beg on the streets without a low-skilled job.<br><br>3) With the clearing of the tables, leftovers will be left to rot by minority inconsiderate patrons while there are no cleaners to clean up spillages and leftovers. Think of the cockroaches, lizards and ants sharing a meal with you on the same table.<br><br>4)  Its meant to be fast - I have to queue up for the food, wait for my food to be cooked, squeeze my own ketchup, eat my own food, clear my own table, HOW CAN IT BE FAST?<br><br>5) Any add ons?</p></div>

              <p>Hong Kong, Thailand and China is also cheaper than us. Probably Australia too. Notice one Mac Meal nowadays cost like $7, apart from KFC $5.50 value meal and Mac's $4.50 lunch deal.<br><br>They can hire less staff. Cut down at least 1 staff to 2. Notice in the fastfood restaurant, there is at least one uncle or auntie standing there waiting to clear your tables?<br><br>RETRENCHED because of your good deed. <br><br>I personally experience this. I bought a burger and wanted to clear it since its only a sandwich. Auntie shout and say "Let me do it". Reason me and her know. She does not clear, she is redundant.</p>

              <p>Aren't these social graces something desirable to have? Would there even be a need for these reminders if we had them all the long? Would there be any costs to cut if extra services weren't needed in the first place? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>
              <p>Animals leave carrion to other creatures to clean up when they can't do it themselves. So why can't you clean up after yourself when you are perfectly able to do so? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>5 Reasons Why <strong>WE SHOULD NOT CLEAR</strong> tables at fastfood restaurants.<br><br>1) Fastfood in Singapore is not like other countries. It is slow and expensive, more expensive than Pizza Hut, Delifrance and Cafe Cartel on Weekdays. Certainly, we expect some service. Already, we are being chased off at Macdonalds after paying up for our meals and made to stand at the side like a stupid idiot. Even chilli and ketchup sauce is now available in a bin for you to squeeze it yourself.<br><br>2) Aunties and uncles who are clearing the tables now will get retrenched, as they no longer need to station a single staff to clear tables. while fastfood chains earn more, and their CEOs earn more. Middle line to line staff do not earn more, nor the customers benefit. These aunties and uncles are low wage income holders, and they may have to beg on the streets without a low-skilled job.<br><br>3) With the clearing of the tables, leftovers will be left to rot by minority inconsiderate patrons while there are no cleaners to clean up spillages and leftovers. Think of the cockroaches, lizards and ants sharing a meal with you on the same table.<br><br>4)  Its meant to be fast - I have to queue up for the food, wait for my food to be cooked, squeeze my own ketchup, eat my own food, clear my own table, HOW CAN IT BE FAST?<br><br>5) Any add ons?</p>

              <p>Clearing trays was strongly encouraged by the pee mmmm with small mind who can only think of such trivial matter to tell Singaporeans while receiving a world class salary.  </p>
              <p>Clear or no clearing of trays is no issue at all.   What is the problem?</p>
              <p>I will do it selectively not at the expense of the rice bowls of the cleaners.</p>

              <p>Hong Kong, Thailand and China is also cheaper than us. Probably Australia too. Notice one Mac Meal nowadays cost like $7, apart from KFC $5.50 value meal and Mac's $4.50 lunch deal.<br><br>They can hire less staff. Cut down at least 1 staff to 2. Notice in the fastfood restaurant, there is at least one uncle or auntie standing there waiting to clear your tables?<br><br>RETRENCHED because of your good deed.<br><br>I personally experience this. I bought a burger and wanted to clear it since its only a sandwich. Auntie shout and say "Let me do it". Reason me and her know. She does not clear, she is redundant.</p>
