            <div class='col-md body'>Had dinner at Tung Lok Noble House Restaurant last night.<br><br>Had the following:<br>Sharks' fin soup<br>Spicy Clams/Sotong with Broccoli<br>Chinese Spinach with Shredded Dried Scallops and Mushrooms<br>Roasted Chicken<br>Herbal Prawns<br><br>Verdict:<br>The sharks fin soup is so-so<br>Spicy Clams/Sotong is good. The spice was just right, with clams tender and sotong really tender<br>Chinese Spinach so-so. Spinach tasted overcooked.<br>Roasted Chicken so-so. Nothing special.<br>Herbal Prawns so-so. Nothing special.<br><br>A far cry from the Noble House of the old days, when I brought my wife there many times for their food.<br><br>Plus, I din like the idea that they still open their restaurant to walk-ins/reservations when there was a wedding that day. Imagine us seated on the side of the main dining hall, while the centre is for the wedding. I thought it wasn't really nice.<br><br>Food: 6/10<br>Value-for-money: 5/10<br>Ambience: 4/10 (I give a fail point coz I think it is not reasonable to open their restaurant for walk-ins and reservations, when there is a wedding going on. Its a little awkward when you come out of the lift, and got mistaken to be coming for the wedding.)<br><br>Overall: 5/10<br><br>Won't go back there again</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stryker17:</div><div class="quote_body">i tot the ala carte buffet is very good. =)</div></blockquote>used to be. I used to go there 6 years back. Went there multiple times coz the buffet was good.<br><br>Then, I started seeing the no. of dishes shrinking, the costs going up, the quality no longer as good.<br><br>During the restaurant's earlier days, it was really GOOD quality buffet. I would say it beats a lot of other restaurants ala-carte dishes even.<br><br>But as I was a regular then, started noting the decline in the quality, and the variety.<br><br>Also, in the past, the waitresses were young ladies that were refined and polite, nowadays when I went there, it was all old ladies. I don't have much objections to that, but just that, it ain't so attractive anymore in terms of everything<br><br>Maybe, if you compare the CURRENT standards of all buffets in Singapore, then yes, Noble House is still very good. But I miss the standards of the past, and would rather now pay good money for good quality things.<br><br>As I said, its just my view, and my expectations are probably higher than some rude poster who posted here.</div>

The spice was just right, with clams tender and sotong really tender<br>Chinese Spinach so-so. Spinach tasted overcooked.<br>Roasted Chicken so-so. Nothing special.<br>Herbal Prawns so-so. Nothing special.<br><br>A far cry from the Noble House of the old days, when I brought my wife there many times for their food.<br><br>Plus, I din like the idea that they still open their restaurant to walk-ins/reservations when there was a wedding that day. Imagine us seated on the side of the main dining hall, while the centre is for the wedding.

Its a little awkward when you come out of the lift, and got mistaken to be coming for the wedding.)<br><br>Overall: 5/10<br><br>Won't go back there again</div></blockquote>what is wrong with eating when theres a wedding going on? too noisy for u?<br><br>please dont be selfish.</div>
