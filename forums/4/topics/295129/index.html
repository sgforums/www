They tested positive for Salmonella Enteritidis.<br><br>The onset of illness for the last case was on 26 November. The effects are felt usually six to 72 hours after eating contaminated food.<br><br>The MOH was first notified of a food poisoning incident on 23 November.<br><br>As more cases of food poisoning were reported, investigations showed that the common food item in the various incidents were Prima Deli chocolate cakes bought as early as 19 November.<br><br>MOH and AVA conducted joint inspections of Prima Food Pte Ltd which produces the chocolate cakes for all Prima Deli retail outlets.<br><br>Food and environmental samples were taken for laboratory analysis.<br><br>Preliminary results suggest Salmonella is the likely culprit.<br><br>Prima Food has been told to stop the production of all chocolate cakes and to recall all these cakes from distribution and sale.<br><br>Meanwhile, food handlers are being screened and investigations going on to determine the source of the contamination.<br><br>MOH says that illnesses from Salmonella poisoning usually last four to seven days and most patients recover with no longÂ—term health effects. Severe cases may require hospitalisation for reÂ—hydration and/or antibiotic treatment.<br><br>Anyone with symptoms after consuming these cakes should seek immediate medical attention.<br><br>For any enquiries, you can contact MOH at 1800Â—2254122 or AVA at 1800Â—2262250.<br><br>For further information on salmonellosis, you can visit MOH website at www.moh.gov.sg.

Tentatively, retail operations are expected to resume on 11 December.<br><br>Prima Food also said it "regrets" that 106 people were taken ill after eating its contaminated chocolate cakes. It said the entire bakery processing facility is undergoing disinfection.<br><br>Initial investigations had found that one of its workers could have been a carrier of the Salmonella bacteria. However, he had shown no symptoms.<br><br>Salmonella is a group of bacteria that can cause fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain.<br><br>Of the 106 cases of food poisoning, six tested positive for Salmonella.<br><br>Some of the victims bought the cakes as early as 19 November and the latest case was reported on 26 November. Six were hospitalised but all have since been discharged.<br><br>This prompted the Health Ministry and AVA to issue an advisory on Monday, asking the public to throw away any unconsumed chocolate cakes bought from PrimaDeli.<br><br>Prima Food said 50 of its food handlers went for health screening last week to make sure they are medically fit and not carriers of any bacteriaÂ—borne conditions.<br><br>PrimaDeli has also recalled and discarded 400 chocolate cakes and is cooperating with the Health Ministry and AVA in their investigations.<br><br>However, with the disinfection and recall, PrimaDeli cakes are now in short supply. One franchisee said customers were quick to adapt. Many switched to vanilla sponge cakes and only a couple of customers have cancelled their orders.<br><br>For Jeffrey Voon, whose family of six suffered food poisoning after eating his motherÂ’s birthday cake bought from PrimaDeli, he wants an explanation and compensation for what they went through.<br><br>PrimaDeli has set up a hotline Â— 62777171 Â— to address the publicÂ’s concerns.

It was also very difficult to breathe.'<br><br>She and her relatives were among 109 people here who, over the last two weeks, have come down with food poisoning from contaminated chocolate cakes baked by Prima Deli.<br><br>Of these, eight people were hospitalised, but have since been discharged.<br><br>Two of the bakery's workers have tested positive for the salmonella strain that infected over 100 customers.<br><br>The authorities have since ordered a recall of all its products, and shut down its manufacturing facility until it is shown to have cleaned up its act.<br><br>The 39 franchises selling its cakes and bread will also be shut down for at least a week.<br><br>The cakes appear to have been contaminated, probably through poor hygiene, by a type of bacteria known as salmonella enteritidis.<br><br>It is usually spread through food made from infected animals, or food which has been exposed to the stool of infected people.<br><br>Those infected experience symptoms such as fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach pains, usually over four to seven days.<br><br>So far this year, 1,088 people here, including the latest victims, have been afflicted by food poisoning, caused by various bacteria and viruses such as norovirus and campylobacter. None has died.<br><br>This latest incident came to light when an affected family contacted the National Environment Agency, which regulates food handling hygiene, on Nov 23.<br><br>The agency informed the Health Ministry, which began investigations after more complaints of the cakes surfaced.<br><br>Investigations are still ongoing, but evidence suggests that food handlers may have spread the bacteria to the cakes.<br><br>Consumers should throw away any food from Prima Deli.<br><br>People should also wash their hands before preparing food, cook food thoroughly before eating it, and avoid mixing or storing raw food with cooked food.<br><br>Those with enquiries can call the Health Ministry on 1800-225-4122 or the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority on 1800-226-2250.<br><br>Miss Anizah said her family members are all back on their feet, and are now looking to see if they can get some compensation.<br><br>She called Prima Deli yesterday, and has been asked to submit the receipts of their medical treatment for consideration.<br><br><img src="http://img472.imageshack.us/img472/2997/picture2pn5.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Recall extended to bread and other cakes; Prima initiates disinfection of factory premises</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Home, Pg H2<br>December 5, 2007<br>Author: Diana Othman &amp; Maria Almenoar</span><br><br>TWO food handlers from Prima Food have tested positive for the bacteria which infected at least 109 people in the latest food poisoning episode here.<br><br>The cases have been traced to chocolate cakes from the company's Prima Deli bakery outlets, and the authorities have broadened an initial recall on such cakes to include all bread, pastries and cakes made by Prima, sold at 39 outlets islandwide.<br><br>The company has also been ordered to stop operations at its Keppel Road factory pending investigations, and its franchises will shut for at least a week.<br><br>Prima had to 'stop all production as a precautionary measure as investigations are still ongoing to establish the source of contamination', said the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) yesterday.<br><br>At Prima's factory yesterday, its 100 workers were sent home as operation 'disinfect and sanitise' swung into action. The process, which involves stripping away all surface materials and wiping all surfaces such as ceilings, floors, walls and production equipment with sanitiser concentrate, is likely to take two days, said a Prima spokesman.<br><br>AVA said, however, that the production facility will be allowed to reopen only when its inspectors have given it the thumbs up. AVA oversees food safety for both primary and processed food sold in Singapore.<br><br>With the Prima Deli outlets left with empty shelves, its management said it will close them from today until Tuesday.<br><br>Investigations into the food poisoning are continuing as the Ministry of Health (MOH) is still conducting tests on various samples from the factory.<br><br>The outbreak, first reported to MOH on Nov 23, eventually saw 109 people falling ill after eating Prima Deli's chocolate cakes.<br><br>Eight were hospitalised but have since been discharged. They tested positive for salmonella enteritidis, which causes symptoms such as fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain.<br><br>Initial tests showed that the salmonella bacteria was a likely culprit.<br><br>Preliminary results singled out an employee who was discovered to be a carrier of the salmonella bacteria. Carriers show no symptoms of food poisoning, but can pass it on through stool.<br><br>The employee had handled butter cream, an ingredient used as a layer of cream in between sponges of the cakes. The cream is not cooked, unlike the cake itself, where baking kills the bacteria.<br><br>About 400 chocolate cakes have been recalled and disposed of since last Friday.<br><br>Ms Pansy Wong, deputy general manager of Prima Food, said this was the first such incident in the company's largely clean history.<br><br>Its workers have to wear a standard suit consisting of a long-sleeved shirt and trousers, a long plastic tunic, plastic gloves, a face mask and even a cloth headgear.<br><br>They also have to disinfect their hands by washing, scrubbing their nails and applying hand sanitisers.<br><br>The company is sending all its workers for salmonella testing, including the 50 involved in cake-making.<br><br>It has also created a hotline on 6277-7171 for affected customers.<br><br>The 39 Prima Deli franchises were told last night that they would be shut for at least a week.<br><br>Miss Serene Oon, manager at a Clementi West outlet estimated that she would lose more than $5,000.<br><br>'What to do? We have nothing to sell. We have no choice but to close,' she said.<br><br>The owner of the Centrepoint outlet, Mr Pal Singh, said he would only lose a 'few hundred dollars', as most of his sales were through cake orders.<br><br>He said he would try to stay open so that he can explain the situation to customers.<br><br>'It's not something I'm going to lose a night's sleep over,' he said.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

AVA still needs to audit the factoryÂ’s Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan, which it said would take at least a week, to ensure that measures are in place to avoid a similar outbreak.
