Some 15 people were hospitalised, among them was a 11 month-old toddler who was fed some of the cake during a family birthday bash.<br><br>Investigations conducted by the AVA pinpointed salmonella-contaminated ingredients - such as hazelnut paste and chocolate cream - as the culprits of the outbreak.<br><br>Through its checks, the Health Ministry also found that 14 food handlers from the factory and outlets tested positive for the bacteria.<br><br>Since then, the factory has undergone extensive and intensive cleaning and disinfection. AVA officers have also been keeping an eagle eye on the outfit- collecting some 75 swab samples for microbiological testing.<br><br>PrimaDeli is also trying to take greater precautions to prevent a recurrence. Besides sending samples from their ingredients for more extensive and frequent testing, it is rehauling the way it tracks its cakes.<br><br>From the batches of ingredients used, right up to where the cake was delivered to and sold, all this will be captured in the new system.<br><br>Its staff also have to go for regular salmonella tests.<br><br>Now, workers also have to record their sick days on a new log card system - so that the company can see at a glance who's been sick and who should go for check ups.<br><br>Prima food handlers from the factory and retail stores have also gone for a refresher course on food and personal hygiene training.<br><br>Read the full report in Monday's edition of The Straits Times.</div>

              <p>SINGAPORE : Prima Food, which owns Prima Deli, was fined $5,000 on Friday for selling contaminated food.</p>
              <p>A company representative, Kenneth Chew, pleaded guilty to having hazelnut paste which contained the salmonella bacteria.</p>
              <p>The
              Agri—Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) had found the
              bacteria at Prima Food’s factory at Keppel Road last year.</p>
              <p>The
              court heard that AVA had inspected the factory, collected samples from
              the ingredients used to make the cakes and sent them for laboratory
              analysis.</p>
              <p>The hazelnut paste was used to make its chocolate cakes sold in Prima Deli’s 38 outlets.</p>
              <p>Over 200 people suffered from food poisoning after eating the contaminated cakes.</p>
              <p>The food poisoning outbreak is believed to be Singapore’s largest in recent years.</p>
              <p>The
              Health Ministry’s investigations showed that 14 factory food handlers
              and some of the outlets tested positive for the salmonella bug. — CNA/ch</p>
