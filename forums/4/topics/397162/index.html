              <p>seriously i have no issues with people who advocates movements against animal cruelty and I for one is against killing animals inhumanely for the sake of eating them. But before we protest against all these things, think about do we really understand what we are protesting about. The next time you eat a chicken, think about how its head was cut off while it was still alive and blood drained off: is that cruelty? If yes, why no protest against chicken cruelty? The next time you eat a crab, think about how a chopstick was cruelly pierced into it so it will slowly die. Is that cruelty? If yes, why no protest against crab cruelty?</p>
              <p>My point was not to say that we should not be aware of such issues but most of the time from what I see, people are just jumping on bandwagons without understanding and really emphatizing with the issue.</p>

But before we protest against all these things, think about do we really understand what we are protesting about. The next time you eat a chicken, think about how its head was cut off while it was still alive and blood drained off: is that cruelty? If yes, why no protest against chicken cruelty? The next time you eat a crab, think about how a chopstick was cruelly pierced into it so it will slowly die. Is that cruelty? If yes, why no protest against crab cruelty?</p>
              <p>My point was not to say that we should not be aware of such issues but most of the time from what I see, people are just jumping on bandwagons without understanding and really emphatizing with the issue.</p>

              <p>Yeah it is supposed to but in actual fact, after you do that, although everybody claims it has already died, you still see it moving for some time, so interpret how you want to interpret it. Is that cruelty? If that picture above is cruel, then killing a crab that way is cruel too. Those people who protest against such things cannot just choose their battles. All animals are equal.</p>

              <p>at least u are honest about it. I am irritated by those who eat meat their whole life then suddenly when they see a chicken being killed, they go "oh so cruel", then continue eating the chicken chop.</p>
