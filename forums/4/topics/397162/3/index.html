              <p>at least you don't chew them alive like the koreans do. personally I think this method of eating is considered "okay". It is considered fast already. don't tell me to get sliced because of that. what i meant is there are more cruel things, that we never see.</p>
              <p>eg:  peeling out their skin while they are alive (racoon), or electrocute them alive and leave them to bleed to death (cattle and pig). or sliting their throat and leave them to bleed to death (dolphins, whales, shark). or cut off the fins and throw back to the sea (shark). or being chew alive (otopi)</p>

              Everybody judges one another by their own set of rules.  More often than not, ignorance is bliss.  Go to a wetmarket one day and see how the fish monger kills fish. More often than not he takes a wooden stick and bashes the fish a few times on the head.  This doesnt kill the fish, only stuns it. He then chops the fish up into pieces alive.  Now some people may say "Oh thats so cruel!" Well, naturally if we all opted for humane measures to kill the fish, which would probably cost more than the price of a simple wooden stick, would you be willing to pay more for the fish to die more peacefully?
              
              People will always find ways to feel morally superior over others.  The vegetarians will call meat eaters "Uncultured barbarians, with no sympathy for living creatures".  Meat eaters call people who eat shark fins "Uncaring people who dont care about endangered species" and people who eat shark fins say "But our ancestors did it and its part of our traditions!"
              
              Now what about eating fish whilst they are still alive? Is it cruel? Then again would it be more cruel than bashing the fish a few times on the head with a wooden stick and disembowelling it whilst it is still alive? Or what about chopping the fins off a shark and throwing it back alive into the sea to die because it can no longer swim?
              
              At the end of the day, everybody has their own comfort zone of morality.  As it stands, for me personally, I say pass me that bowl of shark fin soup, and dont forget to pass the vinegar as well.

              <p>but the fact is those meat that are selling in the wet market are from the farms. less demand means less supply. we can't stop the carnivores from preying on other animals but we can reason with humans, that is the main difference between animals and humans. humans have logical thinking.</p>
              <p>there is a report which says instead of feeding the animals and we in turn eat the animals, humans can consume the food directly instead of through the animals. this will cut down world food shortages.</p>

              <p>With better standard of living, it is only human to demand more</p>

              <p>Just look at the sharks, sturgeons etc. These are not farmed. What happens? They are hunted till extinction.</p>

              <p><br>yeah, our diet cause their extinction. there will be a time, most likely when we are at middle age, we will tend to eat more vegetables because of doctors' advise. some of my relatives who were against eating vegetables during their younger days now turn to eating more vegetables because doctors advise them to.</p>

              <p><br>yeah, i understand it is because doctors and scientists believe cancer cells feed on animals' protein. they also advise those who have high blood pressure and other illnesses related to old age.</p>

              <p>i read about cancer cells feed on animals protein somewhere but could not remember where i read it. there are many reports say that vegetarians have lower chance of having cancer. but of course eat vegetables, don't eat mock meat which have a lot of colouring, eating mock meat is bad for health</p>
