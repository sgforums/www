They are further divided into red, white, ruby, tawny and tawny port. U can look for more informations in the WWW.</div>

Tannin gives that bitter taste which white wine does not have becos it has been filtered off during the process. If you drink tea, you will taste what Tannin is like, dry and slightly bitter.<br><br>Generally, red wines are meant to be kept for some time before it reaches its peak before consumption. Peak meaning, when the Tannin mellowed and it integrates into the other ingredients of red wine and thus giving a perfect mix. However, nowadays red wine are drank in short term, they are rarely kept for long, thats why u see alot of red wine on the shop that is meant for short term consumption and they are made WITHOUT Tannin, thus of cos then it makes it less bitter.<br><br>Yeah u are right, california makes arguably the best chardonnay and sauvignon blanc (not france.) France makes better red wine classics like Bordeaux and Burgundy....<br><br>LIke what u say, to be frank, most of us just drink, to be i cant really tell the difference, if i like it, i like it..dun like, tell me it is from where, how it is made, i also wun like it heheheh...<br><br>anyway, just had a glass of 1996 Chardonnay not from california bt from Italy, not bad not bad...</div>
