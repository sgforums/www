            <div class='col-md body'>Ever tried asking for a glass of water, a serviette or even a spoon in a crowded restaurant.  They take forever to come to you.  I think that the service in restaurants have suffered greatly ever since the service tax was imposed.  It should be abolished, and let the waiters and waitresses work on tips instead.  This way there is more motivation for them to provide better service.</div>

One waiter or waitress will be assign to your table, which means waiters will have a few tables under their care.  They come round once in a while to see to your needs, then you just tip that one waiter in the end according to how well you think he or she served you instead of paying a flat 10% service tax, so if you feel that you haven't been served well, you can just choose to leave a small tip</div>

I don't mean to say you are a bad waiter, but you have to admit there are some really crappy ones around.  Surely if you did a better job than they did, don't you think you deserve to be paid more than they???</div>
