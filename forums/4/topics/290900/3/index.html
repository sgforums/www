After that experience, I find the Indian food here to be... just curry based, nothing to umm about. The butter rice I had there, was heavenly, just eating it on its own.<br>Just goes to show how taking pains to prepare a dish could go towards making it a memorable one, as against a run of the mill one.<br><br>As for price, the establishment counts, say a set of chicken rice, that cost $8 - $12 in up market places, same set would cost about $4 - $5 at hawker centres.<br></div></blockquote>What I am trying explain is on the part where u express ur concern on noobs not putting effort in making gd food nowadays compare to the olden days. I found that even a place as far as america can taste better food than in sg, dun u find it absurd? This brings me to realise that I cant find a good asian food here does not come without a price of below 10USD. Why is this happening? Imo, this is because its business we are talking abt, $$ attracts talent. At least $$ attracts better quality. With globalisation spreading across the world, talents move ard to get the greener pasture. If u want good food, perhaps u may want to pay a higher price for it??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans will pay for good food.<br>There is one cze char in Geylang, Sin Huat, charges restaurant prices. Dinner for four persons can easily cost $120, and it is at a dingy kopitiam at Lor 36. The owner takes his time to prepare, and do not skimp on the ingredients. All  his dishes are worth waiting for. His sea food stock are all live. Crabs, prawns, sea shells, lobsters, crayfish, and all sorts of fishes. He has no shortage of customers. Singaporeans will pay.<br><br>But for the average Singaporean,  who would have his daily meal outside, he should expect better for what he is paying. But it is increasingly getting to be not the case. He is paying more for not much better. Increase in rentals and operating cost is blamed for the rising prices. True, but the food fare must also improve with the price, it only business sense. Good food attract people.<br>But run of the mill stalls are getting away with poor food, because the young people here don't know better.<br>The dessert here are now all artifical colouring and sugar, and corn starch. Pulot Hitam, should be black beans boiled until it is a thick broth, with squeezed coconut milk. and not something that has black beans and thicken with starch, with coconut milk that comes from a packet. Singaporeans would queue and pay more for the original stuff.<br>I only hope  for market forces to quickly eliminate the lemons.<br><br>Singapore is not a place where Asian food ingredients are difficult to come by, as in the US. My cousin in London would say that anything I can find in Singapore she can find in London, and more at that. Good pizza, or steak here would be a surprise just as good Asian food would be in the US. Its not impossible, it only needs dedication.<br><br></div>

There are reasonable numbers of places in Singapore which serve really good food, but it all depends on your quality of "good".<br><br>Only SOME people "eat food like machines". Some enjoy every single bite. It just depends on where you see those people. If you go to a regular McDonald's outlet, of course you'll see people like that. But if you go somewhere like, maybe a restaurant at Traders Hotel. You'd see people really enjoying their meal.<br><br>In my opinion, all this is because of the cost of the food.<br>Compare Macs and an expensive restaurant - where would you enjoy your food more ? Obviously the more expensive restaurant, because everyone wants to make their money worth. If you go to a cheap fast food joint, the price of a set meal is measly compared to an expensive restaurant, so people don't really care about "enjoying their food", probably because it's also a very common place to eat.<br><br>So no, I don't think the food in Singapore sucks. Good food comes at a price (literally), and Singaporeans pay particular attention to their money, which affects the quality of the food they eat.</div>
