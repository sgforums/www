The reason new world wines beat old world wines is because they are manufactured to have all the winning characteristics that wines should have. I know im generalising, but theres strength to both new and old world wines. I like both, but old world wines are better for appreciation, while new world wines are excellent for quality drinking.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gasband:</div><div class="quote_body">Just drink lah.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its all in the mind i think. I once went to a vineyard in France and the person in charge brought as on a tour and gave us a short talk. He said, there was once a few sommeliers were given 3 glasses of red wine. They were told that one of the glasses contained a more expensive red wine than the other 2, while the other 2 is the same kind of wine. In the end, of cos all the sommeliers drank and chose the wine they think is the more expensive one. That was then the answer was revealed to them that actually all 3 glasses are the same red wine.....and it is to prove that sometimes we think a certain wine is better becos we are told, of its price or etc....the true quality of a red wine is when the person who drinks it enjoys it. Some people dun like certain US wine cos it got oaky taste. So no matter u say how good it is, if the person dun like it, to that person, does it still have any value?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Between New world and Old world, its not a matter of price, more of style (varietals vs blends). Its not a matter of better or worse, its a matter of difference(consistency vs character).<br><br>The high price of old world wines is due to the limited quantities each estate can produce, vs the australian wine conglomerates which own hundreds of miles of vineyards all over australia, and can network and source them efficiently.<br><br>Due to the old world wines mostly being blends, the flavors on individual grape varietals are more integrated together. A person new to wine can start out anywhere, but it would be better to start on new world wines sold by varietal format, so they can understand the taste of the main grapes, and hopefully pick them out in a blend such as a Bordeaux.<br><br>Of course, that comes under wine appreciation already. You can drink wine like any other drink, but if Im paying for wine I would want to appreciate it more instead of gulping it down. The best way to enjoy wine is to half appreciate it and half drink for fun. Drinking for fun part is how much you like the wine no matter how much people say, and the appreciation part comes from understanding it. Good to have both, to see it from a dual perspective.<br><br>In no where did I claim Old World wines are superior. The tasters in question were given unfair expectations in saying that one wine is superior, thus they perceive it to be. In a blind test, wines are picked based on characteristics percieved to be superior, thus new world wines win easily.<br><br>Its like that "perfect guy" in class, who may be the most boring schmuck you ever know, vs that under-achiever with lots of personality.</div>
