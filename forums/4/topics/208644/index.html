Been there twice &amp; served by 2 dufferent waitress &amp; their attitude all the same. Keep recommending food to you. Keep telling u to order, their crab, lobster, bamboo clam, prawns &amp; all the more expensive stuff. I told them to let me go thru the menu first but they just simply yak yak like machine gun non stop untill to a point I told them: "i order or you order? talk some more i don't eat" then they lan lan keep quite.<br><br>Anyone here got this experience.<br><br>Cheers, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Btw, i was with my wife. Only two person how to eat so many thing.

What is the price like? In fact, I had been eating frog leg continuously from Friday to Sunday cos my wife crave for it before she go for operation. Saturday ate at the Jackson Food Centre opposite the tim sum stall called the "Dong Sheng". Lousy &amp; expensive as compared to Lor 3. $19 for 3 frogs + $2 for the porridge.<br><br>At least the Lor 3 porridge comes free.<br><br>Cheers,</div>
