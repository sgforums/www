              <p>and 2ndly, have you ever went to malaysia to see stars, it's really different from seeing stars in singapore. that's why i recommended so.</p>

              <p>@ dumbdumb - I agree that good food doesn't have to be expensive, but at a dining location as such, I expected food prices to not be as I hope for. And my criterias are for a rough guide - in hope for such lobang. IF you have not of such knowledge then it's only fine because I only asked so as to create a range to choose from.</p>
