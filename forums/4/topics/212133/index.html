Thanks.</div></blockquote>I can't blame people being lousy at physics and chemistry, but trying to imitate food cooked by the professionals is a darn difficult task. What you are mentioning is the texture of the food which is determined by the formation of the coating protein. Of course, that is determined by the temperature of the food being cooked. Firstly, did you seperate the cooking of the meat and the sauce? The meat is deep-fried and sauce stir-fried. Make sure temp of the deep fry is 175 to 190 degrees centigrade, while the stir-fry is 100 deg cent thereabouts. Slide the battered meat into the deep fry for 2 mins or thereabouts. Scoop up and note this, dump them on top of a oil strainer with ice cubes. This allows the protein to form to a bigger amount and hence greater texture and crunchiness. Serve up with the sauce. Hope you don't need me to provide the sauce recipe.  If you prefer a lighter taste, use potatoe starch flour for the batter mix.</div>

You claim that I'm copy the chefs, I copy for what? It's not as though I'm going to open a stall to sell this dish. Why do you have to get so worked up for?
