              <p>WHENEVER Bishan resident Paul Crinis greeted his neighbours with a
              boisterous: 'Hello, how you doing?' they would mutter in Hokkien, 'Siow
              ang mo'.<br> <br> So he's gone and named his Western food stall what they call him: Crazy Ang Mo.<br> The three-week-old stall, located in a bright, clean,
              recently-refurbished coffee shop in Bishan Street 24, has been packing
              them in with its Australian-style menu.<br> <img src="http://wineanddine.asiaone.com/A1MEDIA/wdu/10Oct07/20071024.101349_st_crazyangmo1_250x177.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> There's sausages and chips, chicken schnitzel and chips, fish and chips, steak and chips and burger and chips.<br> <br> A word about the chips: Unless you order the steak, which comes with proper steak chips, you get crinkle cut fries.<br> <br> Forget crinkle. Add $1 to the main meal and get the steak chips
              instead. They are the most crisp-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside
              thick cut potato chips ever to emerge from a deep fryer. You can also
              order a basket of them for $2.50. I urge you to do it.<br> The steak ($11.90) was overdone when I had it and the chicken schnitzel
              ($6.90) was dry and hard, but I'm still going back there.<br> <br> For one, the fish and chips ($6.50) is delicious. Dory fillets are
              encased in a thin, very crisp shell that manages not to be oil-logged.
              The tartar sauce tastes pretty good, although I'd prefer a more
              vinegary kick.<br> <br> And instead of the obligatory Western food stall scoop of dodgy
              coleslaw, I got a proper salad with tomatoes and upmarket radicchio, a
              red-leafed, slightly bitter vegetable.<br> <img src="http://wineanddine.asiaone.com/A1MEDIA/wdu/10Oct07/20071024.101349_st_crazyangmo2_250x388.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> Mr Crinis, 34, who is also a tennis coach, came here from Wollongong in New South Wales, Australia, about seven years ago.<br> <br> Now a Singapore permanent resident, he is married to Singaporean Ong
              Bee Ling, 33. They have a five-year-old daughter, La-Mia, who sometimes
              shouts out to customers when their orders are ready.<br> <br> He says: 'I miss eating Aussie food and I knew there was a market for
              it. If people will eat McDonald's burgers, they'll eat mine.'<br> <br> They should order the Crazy Burger With The Lot ($7.90), the best item on the menu.<br> The 'burger with the lot' is practically an Australian institution,
              with a beef patty, bacon, a fried egg, lettuce, tomato, cheese and -
              here's what makes it so fun to eat - slices of canned beetroot and a
              pineapple ring.<br> <br> I like Crazy's juicy patty, made in-house with Aussie beef. Everything
              comes together perfectly - the beetroot provides a zingy footnote, and
              the pineapple ring, with cheese melted into it, some sweetness.<br> <br> Don't leave without ordering the Banana Pudding ($3.90), which is
              light, full of ripe bananas and crunchy walnut pieces and topped with
              gooey caramel.<br> <br> This dessert is served with some sliced kiwi fruit and the biggest scoop of vanilla ice <br> cream I've ever seen.<br> <br> It is literally the size of a tennis ball. And it is sprinkled with crunchy chocolate pieces. You'd be crazy to miss it.<br> <strong><br> Crazy Ang Mo<br> </strong>Block 279,<br> Bishan Street 24,<br> 01-62/64,<br> (S) 570279<br> Open: 11am to 10pm on Mondays to Thurdays, 11am to 11pm on Fridays, 8am to midnight on Saturdays and 8am to 9pm on Sundays.</p>

              <p>The batter used for the fish is nice. Shame that it's dory fillet. The lamb is pretty good too.</p>
