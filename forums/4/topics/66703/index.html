I do put tea bags in my car though to absorb any bad smell, doesnt work all the tea esp when it reaches its saturation hehehehe<br><br>And of cos you dun drink tea exposed to the elements. Tea is super absorbent unless you do not mind the stinko kind of tea.  If you do not believe, drink a cup of tea from your freshly bought tea bags then leave the rest for ard 6 months in the cupboard. then drink it, you will realise there is a difference.  Thats what make tea so expensive at times with tea from places like Assam can go up to US$1000/kg while sometimes it can go to as low as US$1/kg for tea from Indonesia.<br><br>As for cocktails, no famous one yet but I do noe some bartenders in some hotels in Singapore are comtemplating as they try new stuff...</div>
