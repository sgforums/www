            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1) Adam Road Hawker Centre<br>=====================<br>a.. Famous for celebrity spotting. Try the<br>roti prata and soup kambing. Teh tarik for drinks and you'll be awake the whole night. Open till around 3am<br>b.. Yes! Adam Road Hawker center is very much alive and kicking. It also serves one of the best ROTI JOHN in town! Also through the BBQ STINGRAY...you'll simply love the sambal chilli that goes along with it. Furthermore, you can get a healthy LARGE<br>glass of FRUIT JUICE for only $1.50. I usually order from the stall on the left. The CHENG TENG from the third stall of the extreme right is also pretty good and<br>you can even custom order it with more of your favourite ingredients and less of those you utterly detest! This stall sells cheap and delicious CHICKEN RICE during the day. Also check out the NASI GORENG PUTEH IKAN BILLIS from the fifth stall (I think) starting from the extreme left. Basically, this literally means Rice Fried White (without the red dye) with IkanBillis<br>.2) Balestiar Road ========================================<br>a.. For food after 12.one can often head down to Balestiar Road.. There, prawn mee, Bak Kut Teh can be found..and in not just one coffeeshop but a few others..<br>b.. Bak Kut Teh: Balestier has an awesome  selection..<br>3) Bedok North Avenue 4 (Fengshen) Food Centre =============================================<br>Highly recommended!!<br>"Must Try" for porridge lovers..."Chai Chee<br>Porridge" Stall,where you can choose and specify the amount of the ingredients. The consistency of the porridge is impeccable. Whilst there try the B.B.Q.stall and the Fried Hokkien Mee stalls back to back to<br>"Chai Chee Porridge" and you"ll go back for more.Then there is the juicy chunky and big sticks of Satay from the stall in the middle of the row in front of "Chai Chee Porridge", facing the same direction. They are not only utterly delicious but real value-for-money. Cannot find another satay stall elsewhere<br>serving satay with chunks of meat instead of the normal tiny scraps of fat and meat clinging sheepishly to the sticks.<br>4) Bedok North Road food center<br>===========================<br>Have you tried the meat ball noodles?? It's<br>got really tasty soup, bouncy meat balls and is served with some minced pork. I think it's open all night but it's quite crowded from 11pm till about 1am when most people have just come out from the 9 o'clock movies at Bedok. There are two stalls selling meat<br>ball noodles, choose the one on the left as you are facing the stall,but you usually have to wait about 20 mins to half an hour and you have to remind them of your order at least once. If you want some entertainment,<br>watch out for people sitting in front of the fish ball noodles seller. This old couple will scold whoever sitting in front of their stall without ordering from them.<br>5) Bencoolen Street - 24 hr roti prata stall<br>==========================================<br>Meet those backpackers who travel for months and come for the 50 cent(?) roti prata.<br>6) Bishan St 22, around Blk 284. Kopitiam<br>========================================<br>Opens till about 3am. Sells good kway chap,wan ton  mee (Hong Kong style)and mushroom mee (also very good).<br>7) Boat Quay - Pasta Fresca(at Boat Quay)<br>=======================================<br>It'as really not half bad - even if prices have gone up, and the quality's dropped slightly.And you have to sit with dubious denizens of the dark.Seafood and Mushroom pizza (half-and half, add chillies too!) hits home at 4 in the morning.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Boon Lay<br>=========<br>Well...I used to supp alot. There is this<br>beef hor fun at the only coffee shop which is open past 2am on the ground floor of Boon Lay Shopping Centre.Although I'm not sure if people still wants to eat beef with the mad cow disease. But my friends and I have been wondering out aloud how the hawker can cook<br>the beef until it's so soft and yummy. Go try it!<br>9) Boulevard Hotel Cafe<br>===================<br>u can try boulevardhotel cafe  It operate 24 hrs<br>10) Brighton Crescent<br>====================<br>Nasi Lemak at Brighton Crescent, which is in Serangoon Gardens estate, but before the Serangoon Gardens circus. Good nasi lemak with lots of dishes to choose from, used to be at Tampines Way, opp Hougang Oriental.<br>11) Bukit Gombak<br>===============<br>There's this 24-hour Teochew porridge store in a coffee shop somewhere near Bt Gombak MRT station. It is definitely open after 12 midnight.Around the place is also my favorite hangout-where my friends go to right after watching midnight movie. Also  somewhere near Bt Gombak MRT, near a McDonald's, the coffeeshop are famous for its Roti Prata and the car and the motor cycles parked there are unbelievable, especially on Fri and Sat nights.         12) Changi Airport Terminal II<br>============================<br>There's this great place at Changi Airport  T-2 which opens 24 hours. It's got great stuff like Nasi Lemak and quite a variety of local stuff like currychicken and the likes. The price is pretty fair and a great hangout for hungry couples if you're at the airport. And ya know what's best ? It's airconditioned! - Hah!                     13) China Town                       =============                                a.... the famous Mount Faber Nasi Lemak, formerly at Prince Charles Lane serves up to 6 a.m. or later. It is located I think it's Sago Lane, just in front of the Indian temple, behind the theatre and the Chinatown Market. Driving access is from Maxell Road or South Bridge Road.               b...coffee shop at the corner next to Chinatown Plaza? - Fish porridge. Further down the street there's another 24 hr roti prata restaurant.<br>14) Chomp Chomp food center at Serangoon<br>=======================================<br>Gardens "CHOMP CHOMP" meaning chomp as in<br>eat!! my own personal opinion of this place: an outdoor, often crowded, night hawker centre. u can find a wide variety of food there (ie. 2 stalls of fried carrot cake, 3 stalls of dessert-ice kachang etc, fishball stall, western food-chicken chop, satay stall, satay bee hoon, chicken rice, fishball<br>noodle, wantan mee, porridge, grilled chicken wings, seafood-all of a sudden, i could not remember the name of the fish that is square?? ) that about covers much of it. am i making u hungry?<br>15) Circular Road<br>================<br>Here's another great makan place .... SHAH<br>ALAM. It's behind Boat Quay. Opp a pub "BUZZ". One of their unlisted specialities is Vegetarian Murtabak, be sure to ask for more potatoes. By the way, it<br>depends on luck to get the right chef to dish out the right combination. While u r<br>there, try the following too....Nasi Goreng Puteh with Ikan Billis Beehoon Goreng Puteh with Ikan Billis Mee Goreng (remember to get yourself a cold drink) "Plaster"(Prata with a whole egg)<br>16) Clementi Interchange<br>=======================<br>There's a coffeeshop at one end of Clementi<br>Interchange which has MUCHO food to eat after<br>12. There are teocheow Mui, wan ton mee, nasi<br>lemak stalls, a dim sum stall and, IMHO, the best chee cheong fun this side of the island. Opens well after the midnite. Many Patrons park in the interchange itself but watch ur cars... spot checks though rare,do occur and the car park behind is season<br>parking onli... so, park at ur own risk!!!!! (from someone who's been there.)<br>17) Clementi Road<br>================<br>a.. Freshly prepared Nasi Lemak wrapped in<br>banana leaf available at around midnight. The 24 hour shop is located along Clementi Rd beside the Kent Ridge Bus Terminal, near NUS. A favourite for NUS hall affilates and taxi drivers, night patrol policemen,etc.<br>b.. The Clementi Road Nasi Lemak place is called Fong Seng Nasi Lemak. And it's best to go there after 11pm each night as they<br>start serving small standard packets of NASI LEMAK for only 90 cents...but you have to go behind to the kitchen to ask for it...have that with a stick of superbly fried SOTONG<br>BALLS and ICE MILO and you're sure to rest a satisfied person for the entire night!<br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Dunman Road Food Centre<br>==========================<br>Great place to catch Charsiew-Wanton Mee<br>after 12!!!! Can't remember the name of the store,but there's a little guy with a hunch who serves the noodles to the tables... be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes, as<br>there is usually a huge queue - specially<br>after 1am!!the wanton mee is "Siouk-City"!!! Chilli only hits you when you're halfway through the bowl - when you finish, make sure you have a long cold drink close by - otherwise "teroksion"!! Try it... you'll like it - guaranteed!!<br>19) East Coast Lagoon Hawker Centre<br>==================================<br>For those beach goers/lovers/moonlighters...<br>check out the Lagoon Hawker Center. It's the largest hawker center along East Coast Parkway. The CHAR SIEW NOODLES  there constantly has a que outside it's stall and if you don't care about dying early from a heart  attack try the OYSTER OMELET toooooo!<br>20) Frankel Avenue<br>=================<br>Roti Prata at Frankel Avenue<br>21) Geylang<br>=========<br>From lorong 3 onwards. Lots of choices,<br>prata,muay, tim sum etc.<br>b.. Geylang Lorong 8/9 is a good bet for<br>midnite makan- I doubt if Mad Cow disease has had any effect on my fav Beef Hor Fun Stall there (they whip up other stuff as well) Or if U feel like having something<br>lite, there's always the 24 hour Tau Huay<br>(Beancurd) shop just next door - ask for a side dish of the Tau Sar flaky pastry - best eaten hot! Bon Apetit!<br>c.. 24hr you-tiao coffeeshop(Taiwan-brand<br>dian xin) at Geylang, don't know lor what but it is directly opposite a small little mosque, on the right side of the road. Serves great carrot-shredded cake,sao bing, dou hua. Good services from the dish-clearing<br>aunties too. The shop has been there for the past 10 years?<br>22) Havelock Road<br>================<br>a. For Teochew mui lovers, i recommend that<br>you check out the store in Havelock Rd near Blk 22(i forgot the name, but it has a yellow signboard). They even have a picture of Andy Lau dining there. I think its open throughout the night. The price is reasonable<br>and they serve great 'lor' pig intestines!<br>b.. Hi there! I have been to this one place<br>at midnight which is at Havelock Road. The very first stall of the shops(can't remember the shop's name though). They sell teochew porridge, a variety of dishes and even duck meat. I can see alot of people ging there after midnight. The foods' not bad, but prices are a bit steep. Worth giving it a<br>try, the food is really quite good!!! There are also few shops selling Bah Kut Teh, but i have not tried it yet.<br>23) Henderson Hawker Centre<br>==========================<br>Yong Tau Fu Stall located opposite Henderson<br>Sec School. If you are looking for shiok, fresh and cheapYong Tau Fu, this stall is at the Henderon Market&gt; Hawker Centre. Operates only from about 10pm to 1am.You can't miss the stall as it operates quite solitary during this time of the night by the wet<br>market.<br>24) Holland Village<br>==================<br>Recently i found out that the Ipoh Hor Fan at<br>Holland Village (Lor. Liput,the non air-con coffee hop) open till 3.00am in the morning on Friday, Saturday nite and eve of public holiday. And they have introduced new dishes<br>like Assam Crayfish($5.50),sharksfin Noodle ($9 plus)and Sharksfin Rice (???). i ordered the crayfish, my wife says it's good,cos it's sourness  is just right. So for those late night stalkers you may want to give it a try.<br>25) Hyatt Hotel<br>==============<br>The Hyatt Cafe is great for desserts especially the goreng pisang with ice cream. Open 24hrs. The asian food is quite good. stay till 6am when they have the buffet breakfast.<br>26) Jalan Bukit Merah<br>====================<br>ABC market's hawker centre along Jalan Bukit<br>Merah (nnear BM Safra)..the fried prawn mee is great. (opened from evening till past midnite into small hours)<br>27) Jalan Kayu<br>=============<br>a.. to all prata enthusiasts try the shop in<br>jalan kayu.. not the "famous" one... its the one a little further down near some traffic lights and opp. A junction leading to Jln Tari Piring (I think) Delights include PAPER Prata - MUST TRY $1.00 TEH CHINNO - cross btw tea and capucinno and special appearances by Harley types. ALSO see the most interesting washroom basin with NO TAP..<br>(heheh..long correct..got this from a fren..enjoy!!)<br><br>------------------<br>I saw you smiling at me<br>Was it real or just my fantasy<br>You'd always be there in the corner<br>Of this tiny little bar</div>
