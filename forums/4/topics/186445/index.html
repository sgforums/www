Salivate over LifeStyle's pick of Top 10 chocolate desserts.<br><br>By Teo Pau Lin - 27 November 2005<br>Sunday Times<br><br>1. Chocolate truffle cake, $48 for 1kg<br><br>Cedele By Bakery Depot<br>10 outlets: Terminals 1 and 2 at Changi Airport; Novena Square; Great World City; Raffles City; Suntec City; Temasek Tower; Republic Plaza; 115 Frankel Avenue; and Jelita Shopping Centre<br>Tel: 6243-2056 (two days' notice is required)<br><br>This is quite literally a giant chocolate bar melted down into a cake.<br><br>Sitting on a layer of biscuit crumbs, its thick slab of smooth, mousse-like mixture is nothing more than molten dark Belgian chocolate with top-grade Normandy cream stirred in.<br><br>Unadulterated bliss.<br><br>2. Gateau Chocolat, $5.30<br><br>Canele Patisserie, #01-09 Robertson Walk<br>Tel: 6738-8145<br><br>This cake is a classy tower made of three layers of ganache (a mixture of dark chocolate paste with fresh cream) and three layers of flourless chocolate sponge. It takes 20 hours to make this, and the quality shows. The texture is firm, with each bite bursting with robust flavours of chocolate.<br><br>3. Fondant Chocolat,$2.60<br><br>Beard Papa, two outlets:<br>Takashimaya Food Hall;<br>Seiyu in Bugis Junction,<br>Tel: 6238-8819<br><br>Who says you need to sit down before you can be served a slice of chocolatey heaven?<br><br>You can pick up these chocolate fondants and have them on the go. And they are not any less luxurious than your restaurant variety.<br><br>Sprinkled with icing sugar, each mound oozes gooey Valrhona chocolate from France - and it can get deliciously messy. Don't forget the napkins.<br><br>4. The Chocolate Buffet,$28 per person<br><br>The Fullerton Hotel<br>The Courtyard<br>Tel: 6877-8129<br>On Fridays and Saturdays only, from 8 to 11pm<br><br>Can't decide which one to have? Have it all at this buffet, which offers chocolate in almost any conceivable shape and form.<br><br>There are more than 15 types of chocolate cakes, mousse and tarts - quite a few with undecipherable names. Yogurt chocolate griottine cabosse, anyone?<br><br>It also has a drinks station, where you can choose from a range of premium chocolate with various percentages of cocoa. The solid chunks are melted into a drink in front of you.<br><br>The highlight, though, is the dramatic five-tiered chocolate fountain, which you dip morsels of marshmallows, fresh fruit and profiteroles into.<br><br>Come here if you feel like busting your annual quota for chocolate consumption all in one night.<br><br>5. Mom's Choco Fudge Cake, $28 for 800g<br><br>choc.a.bloc<br>Block 86 Bedok North Street 4, #01-179<br>Tel: 6446-6096<br><br>This is exactly how you'd do it if you are baking a chocolate cake at home - stuff as many layers of chocolate sponge cake and fudge as your cake tin can accommodate.<br><br>Here, three layers of moist sponge alternate with three generous layers of thick, milky fudge made of four types of chocolate.<br><br>Not suited for those prone to culinary guilt.<br><br>6. Chocolate souffle, $10.50<br><br>Bakerzin, five outlets: Millenia Walk #01-23;<br><br>One Fullerton #01-04; Paragon #02-09; Raffles City #01-18A/19; United Square #01-07/60<br><br>This souffle is for those who really like their desserts loaded with sugar.<br><br>Made with the famous French chocolate, Valrhona, it arrives at your table beautifully baked and wobbly. Its texture is smooth and mousse-like, with its sweetness offset nicely by a scoop of thyme ice cream.<br><br>7. Legendary Chocolate Cake, $23.50<br><br>Morton's Of Chicago<br>Oriental Hotel, Level 4<br>Tel: 6339-3740<br><br>Like everything else on Morton's menu, this dessert is giant-sized, and big enough for two people to share.<br><br>Everything about it is satisfying. It is made with top-grade Callebaut dark chocolate from Switzerland and baked fresh upon every order, for 25 minutes.<br><br>Its wall of cake is thick and moist, containing a pool of piping-hot, goo-ey chocolate lava.<br><br>Decorated with icing sugar and raspberries, and served with Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream, it is almost a meal in itself.<br><br>8. Noir Coolness Eclair,$5.50<br><br>Pan Pacific Singapore<br>The Atrium Deli<br>Tel: 6826-8880<br><br>Bigger than the average hotdog, this giant, submarine-like eclair will satiate any chocolate craving.<br><br>Its light choux pastry is cut into half and filled with silky-smooth premium chocolate mousse. It is then topped with a layer of molten dark chocolate. Be ready to get messy.<br><br>9. Suckao, $6.90<br><br>Max Brenner Chocolate Bar<br>#01-06/08 Esplanade Mall<br>Tel: 6235-9556<br><br>It is pure decadence when you don't eat but drink melted chocolate.<br><br>Here, you're given 40g of white, milk or dark chocolate pallets, made by the well-known Callebaut brand from Switzerland.<br><br>You mix it with a little milk, watch it all melt above a tealight, then sip bit by bit. Like a slow boat to paradise.<br><br>10. Dark chocolate gateau with flambe banana, $10<br><br>Wild Rocket<br>Hangout Hotel<br>10A Upper Wilkie Road<br>Tel: 6339-9448<br><br>It is sturdy and slightly crusty, yet it yields completely to the fork. You probably won't find another version with a layer of cake as thin as this.<br><br>It gives way to a warm gush of chocolate lava within, which is not too cloyingly sweet.<br><br>It's so good that when it's broken into, all conversations stop.</div>
