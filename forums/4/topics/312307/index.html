              <p>think about it..</p>
              <p>frozen meat is flash frozen immediately after the animal is slaughtered..</p>
              <p>you bring home the "fresh meat" from the market, the thing has had time to rot while from the abattoir all the way to the market to be kept in the fridges there which are not very efficient from everyone opening and closing them anyway...</p>
              <p>the frozen meat is way more fresh than the "fresh meat"..</p>
              <p>btw.. just how many animals can the Singapore abattoirs handle?</p>

              <p><br>yes.. of course...</p>
              <p>once properly frozen, it doesn't rot anymore.. all cellular activity comes to a total standstill..</p>
              <p>caveat is that the freezing must be done properly, not merely throwing the slaughtered carcass into the freezer..</p>
              <p>there are lots of factors which the butchers know how to control in order that they can command the highest prices for their product.. so it is in their interest to keep the product as high a quality as possible during freezing..</p>

              <p><br>True</p>
              <p>If you deepfreeze it properly you can keep it up to 5 yrs before you see any detoriation in quality</p>
              <p>Btw if you want the meat to taste as sweet do not quick thaw it by leaving it outside or thawing by soaking in water</p>
              <p>Leave it in the chiller section of your fridge to slowly defrost. This way, the meat will not lose that much water</p>

              <p>Do you think that resturants outside actually use chilled meat to cook?</p>
              <p>Most buy frozen pork to process their food.</p>

              <p><br>It's how you thaw the meat really</p>
              <p>Put it this way, I have been buying Frozen USA duck before AVA made such a huge fuss about frozen meat</p>
              <p>The quality is many times better than the local duck we get and taste better</p>
              <p>If you dunk the duck in the microwave or water or just leave outside to thaw, the meat quality won't be there. I had to slow thaw it in the fridge for a few days.</p>
