              </span></p><p class="first">SINGAPORE: Shark’s fin lovers beware. Some shark meat contains high levels of mercury that may be harmful to you.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and international conservation group Wildaid on Monday said tests done on 10 random shark meat samples here show that three contained mercury readings higher than 0.5 ppm (parts per million) the maximum mercury residue limit in Singapore.</p>
              <p>SEC executive director Howard Shaw said he hopes people will consume less shark’s fin when they know the health issues.</p>
              <p>"Our approach is ’If the buying stops, the killing will too’," he said.</p>
              <p>WildAid director Peter Knights added: "The scale of demand for shark’s fin far outstrips the supply, leading to illegal fishing and decimated populations. This will damage marine ecosystems and other fish stocks."</p>
              <p>Mr Shaw said SEC will hold discussions with the Agri—food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) within the next month regarding the possibility of printing health advisories on shark meat products here.</p>
              <p>He explained that people should learn that mercury might affect certain groups of people very badly for example, pregnant women and children.</p>
              <p>"Mercury has absolutely no health benefits whatsoever. We’re not calling for a ban on shark meat products but for people to know what they’re eating and the health concerns," added Mr Knights.</p>
              <p>An AVA spokesman said it has been monitoring mercury levels in fish and seafood, including shark’s fin, since 1980. He added that mercury readings in seafood here are "no cause for serious concern".</p>
              <p>Mercury is present in the sea naturally because of volcanic activity. Fishes higher up in the foodchain, such as tuna and shark, tend to have higher levels of mercury.</p>
              <p>The spokesman added: "Our advice to the public is to have a varied diet. Expecting mothers should consume tuna in moderation and choose smaller fish as the foetus is more susceptible to the neurological damage caused by mercury." — TODAY/ar</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Weddings boost Shark's fin consumption in Singapore: report</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) - - Shark's fin consumption more than doubled in
              Singapore last year from 2006, with demand driven by an economic boom
              and an increase in wedding celebrations, a report said Saturday.</p>
              <p>Singapore consumed more than 470 tonnes in 2007, up from 182 tonnes
              the previous year and reversing a four-year decline, the Straits Times
              reported.</p>
              <p>Strong economic growth in 2007 and a rise in the number
              of people getting married drove demand despite a 30-percent rise in
              shark's fin soup prices and appeals by environmental groups to ease
              consumption, it said.</p>
              <p>Shark's fin soup is popular at Chinese wedding banquets, where it is seen as a status symbol.</p>
              <p>"Most
              of the couple's parents consider this dish a premium and without it,
              they would lose face," Ruth Soh, communications director at the
              Mandarin Oriental, told the newspaper.</p>
              <p>She said however that the hotel buys shark's fin only from fish farms.</p>
              <p>Housewife Janet Gan was quoted as saying: "Shark's fin is a must at a wedding. It is like a birthday cake."</p>
              <p>But
              Michael Aw, a marine conservationist, said more than 30 sharks have to
              be killed to feed a wedding banquet with 300 guests, according to the
              report.</p>
              <p>"We must continue to educate the younger generation and
              make them see that sharks are guardians of the sea that ensure a
              balance in the food chain," Aw said.</p>
              <p>The message is not lost to Melanie Tan, who will walk down the aisle next month.</p>
              <p>"I
              don't want to be part of the cruel act of killing sharks just to make
              others satisfied on my wedding day," she was quoted as saying.</p>

              <p>80% of sharks that are fished are in western nations like UK, Spain etc. You must note that sharks fished in these regions are not for their fins but for the whole fish.

              <p>Seriously speaking, what's so freakin' good about sharks' fin?</p>
              <p>It's just (literally) tasteless strings of gelatinuous stuff.... as the Baba dude has said, most of the flavour comes from the soup and not the actual sharks' fin. Simulated sharks' fin soup made of gelatine costs much less and tastes virtually the same.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is.... the real reason why people eat sharks' fin is the snob factor due to its high price.</p>
              <p>And it really speaks a lot if you have to kill a few sharks just to show other people that you've got money to burn.</p>

              <p><br>You are also missing my point. My point is DUN make shark fin soup the CULPRIT responsible for the shark's plight today. BEING ENDANGERED is a different story altogether from Shark Finning which I definitely agree that it is CRUELTY. I do not like SHark Fin that much to advocate that shark fin soup must stay. But just because shark finning is cruel does not make shark fin soup eating wrong. CITES in fact says that shark finning is contained to a percentage where most fins are taken off after the shark is dead. But it is who to believe isnt it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And while organisations like Wildaid says one thing about finning, CITES from the UN said the other thing. Its really up to you to believe who is telling the truth isnt it?</p>

Afterall we ourselves do not have figures and facts on our hands.</p>
              <p>2) It is not fair to tell people hey its wrong to drink shark fin soup because of finning. WHat if the other person tells you, how do you know the fin i am eating is from illegal finning and not those fins taken after death? Is there anything wrong with eating something from a fish that is already dead just like any other fish that we eat?</p>

              <p>Yes I was correct ... you have been missing the point all along.... taking the whole shark, or just the fins alone, makes no difference, the shark is just as dead afterwards ! ... it's still a statistical loss ! ... </p>
              <p>sharks are not like your run of the mill kembong or batang you see in the fish market ... they don't breed fast and grow slowly .... yet they have an important function as apex predators in the eco system ....</p>
              <p>and if your mindset says that since it's already dead, so let's not waste it, then nothing will change ... cos you're still creating the future demand, the market for it .... you think by slurping down that bowl of soup, patting your own stomach, and saying "I'll eat this bowl, since it's already in front of me, but don't feed me shark's fin again" is going to change anything ? ....</p>
              <p>the real issue is NOT SHARK'S FINNING ! ... IT IS THE EXPLOITATION IF SHARKS ! ..... whether it's fishermen in the med taking whole sharks for european fish and chips (with the fins exported to asia anyways), or fishermen in the philipines finning sharks, it makes no difference, that's what you have been missing all along ...</p>
              <p>but hey, good luck with the mercury in your system ...   <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
