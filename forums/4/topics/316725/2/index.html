              <p>Yes I was correct ... you have been missing the point all along.... taking the whole shark, or just the fins alone, makes no difference, the shark is just as dead afterwards ! ... it's still a statistical loss ! ... </p>
              <p>sharks are not like your run of the mill kembong or batang you see in the fish market ... they don't breed fast and grow slowly .... yet they have an important function as apex predators in the eco system ....</p>
              <p>and if your mindset says that since it's already dead, so let's not waste it, then nothing will change ... cos you're still creating the future demand, the market for it .... you think by slurping down that bowl of soup, patting your own stomach, and saying "I'll eat this bowl, since it's already in front of me, but don't feed me shark's fin again" is going to change anything ? ....</p>
              <p>the real issue is NOT SHARK'S FINNING ! ... IT IS THE EXPLOITATION IF SHARKS ! ..... whether it's fishermen in the med taking whole sharks for european fish and chips (with the fins exported to asia anyways), or fishermen in the philipines finning sharks, it makes no difference, that's what you have been missing all along ...</p>
              <p>but hey, good luck with the mercury in your system ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p><br>Ah yes, you get the point of SHARK EXPLOITATION and thats what I was trying to say, that Shark Fin Soup is not the biggest culprit if you want to pinpoint that demand creates more finning. That is why I say 80% of the sharks are fished by european countries for whatever other usage (other than shark fin soup cos they hardly eat that). To make shark fin soup the main culprit is missing the point. Even if illegal finning is eliminated, the truth is that sharks will continued to be fished down for other usage and sooner or later, this beautiful creature will still be endangered and extinct. True, if people cut down on shark fin soup, most likely illegal finning would decrease. But still, that doesnt solve the main problem of sharks being hunted down to the brink of extinction right? Shouldnt we be also hitting the nail on the head which according to CITES is the 80% of shark fishing that comes from the western countries.</p>
              <p>My point abt all these conservation groups is that why campaign so hard against finning when the bigger of problem of shark extinction is actually the fishing of these creatures for things like you mentioned, fish and chips or even for rearing as pets haha. FINNING is cruel. But ultimately it will not cause sharks to be extinct faster than if you stop fishing them for their meat or other parts. I would think that a conservation group would be more concerned about protecting the species on the whole rather than just pin point on the issue of shark fin soup. Are they conservationist or animalitarian (if there is such a word haha)?</p>
              <p>And anyway I dun eat shark meat at all nor do I drink shark fin soup regularly enough to die from mercury poisioning. So thanks for your concern. That is, if you were genuinely concerned about me hahaha.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>but anyway I respect your committment to protect sharks and dun get me wrong, I also love the environment and believe strongly in protecting the animals and faunas and that is why I give a small sum of money every month to WWF Hongkong. I know money is nothing to saving the environment but then it demonstrates my conviction in that movement, just that for this issue, I feel that many groups are missing the bigger picture. You can save sharks more if you can stop the 80% for fishing them for other purposes.</p></div>

              <p>for your info, shark's fin itself has no taste or flavour. Why people eat shark's fin is because of the mistaken belief or exaggerated claims of its medicinal attributes. They say it is good for waist, supplement vital energy, good for kidneys and
                  liver, and nourish the blood. But these cannot be supported with any evidence
                  by today's nutritional studies. Shark fins of course does have alot proteins and gelatin which helps cartilage growth BUT it is true that they do contain mercury and lead but I am not so sure whether it is at a level too dangerous for human to consume, which is what alot of conservationists are claiming.</p>
              <p>The real hero of shark fins soup is the "SHANG TANG" which is the superior broth which is concentrated chicken broth. That broth itself is the pride and joy of any masterchef haha.</p>
