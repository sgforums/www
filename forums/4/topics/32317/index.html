I dun think I will ever step into it again as I think its such a pain to eat there...<br><br>Juz my experience...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Services like the one u mentioned are common in singapore restaurants, especially so during the festive seasons as the restaurant staff have to cope with the unending numbers of guests demanding a dinner table.<br><br>I can understand ur position as a customer as well as the staff, having been a waiter previously at a 5-star establishment.<br><br>However this is pretty much a chicken and the egg problem. The customer blames the establishment, while the staff blames the customer. Who's right and who's wrong is plainly subjective.<br><br>I suggest that if u want good service coupled with excellent food and dun intend to wait too long if u've made a reservation, try the jumbo seafood restarants.</div>
