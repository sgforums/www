            <div class='col-md body'>Feb 15, 2007<br><strong><span class="large">Uberburger bites the dust </span></strong><br>'The most expensive burger in town' is burnt by business woes but plans to make a comeback soon<br><br>By FOOD CORRESPONDENT, Teo Pau Lin<br><br>TEN months after its high-profile opening as the first gourmet burger restaurant in the region, Uberburger is toast.<br><br>The 100-seat eatery in Millenia Walk closed last Wednesday due to poor business.<br><br>Co-owner Murray Aitken said that last September's International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings - which were held in Suntec City next door - were mostly to blame.<br><br>He said that the eatery, which opened last March, 'is a great concept and had great promise at the start'.<br><br>But during the 10-day IMF-World Bank meetings, 'there was a 90 per cent drop in business due mainly to the road closures and restricted access to the shopping mall', he said.<br><br>Mr Aitken, who is president and chief operating officer of the holding company, Corduroy Lifestyle, added that it lost $110,000 in September alone.<br><br>There was slight improvement from October, but the pick-up was comparatively low, 'compared to the neighbouring malls that launched campaigns to draw back the traffic after the convention', he said.<br><br>Between October and last month, Uberburger was still racking up about $55,000 in losses per month.<br><br>'To minimise further losses, the board of directors has decided to cease operations at its present location,' he said.<br><br>Corduroy Lifestyle owns two other eateries - Corduroy &amp; Finch in Bukit Timah Road and Corduroy Cafe in VivoCity.<br><br>The 5,000-sq-ft Uberburger, which was set up at a reported $1 million, made a splash in the food scene when it opened, touting a $101 wagyu burger - the most expensive in town.<br><br>However, its 14-burger menu also offered more affordable items, from a $9 diced chicken breast burger to a $29 steak tartare burger.<br><br>It also made a statement with its interior design. Styled like a noisy games arcade, it had a sunken bar, flatscreen TVs that aired music videos and bright red and yellow screaming from every wall.<br><br>Still, some tenants in Millenia Walk interviewed yesterday said that the IMF-World Bank meetings were unlikely to be the chief cause of its closure.<br><br>Bab Noodles, which is a few units away, saw business drop by up to 40 per cent during the period.<br><br>But restaurant manager Regine Ng said it took only a week or two for sales to return to pre-IMF levels.<br><br>In fact, business at Devi Fusion restaurant, which is right next door to Uberburger, has boomed over the past three months.<br><br>'The economy has picked up. Our sales in January have gone up 15 per cent compared to last January,' said restaurant manager Vinod Jakhmola.<br><br>Last August, Corduroy Lifestyle was embroiled in two lawsuits involving its partners.<br><br>Uberburger's minority stakeholder Lemonfarm sued the company for not putting in an agreed sum of $600,000.<br><br>KMC Holdings - an investment company owned by the family of boutique hotelier Loh Lik Peng - sued Mr Aitken for not repaying a $200,000 loan.<br><br>Both lawsuits were later settled out of court, said Mr Aitken yesterday.<br><br>He and partner Adrian Wong bought over Lemonfarm and KMC's shares, and brought in a new shareholder, investment company Star Concepts.<br><br>Mr Aitken stressed that Uberburger's closing has 'absolutely nothing' to do with the lawsuits.<br><br>He also dispelled rumours that the two remaining Corduroy restaurants are shutting down, too.<br><br>'They are doing very well. In fact, we are opening three more Corduroy outlets in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur later this year,' he said.<br><br>Uberburger's 15 employees have since been redeployed to the two Corduroy restaurants.<br><br>On its demise, customers like bank officer Ronald Ho, 33, said Uberburger's concept was ultimately to blame.<br><br>'It was supposed to be a gourmet place, but it looked more like an American diner with ESPN on TV and loud rock music,' said Mr Ho, who ate there once.<br><br>'It just didn't connect with me.'<br><br>But it's not the end of Uberburger yet.<br><br>Mr Aitken said there are plans to open outlets in new locations, although details are not confirmed.<br><br>tpaulin@sph.com.sg<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'It was supposed to be a gourmet place, but it looked more like an American diner with ESPN on TV and loud rock music. It just didn't connect with me'<br>Bank officer Ronald Ho, who dined at Uberburger once.<br>He blames its demise on the outlet's concept<br><br>Â© 2005 Singapore Press Holdings.
