            <div class='col-md body'>Went Jack's Place for lunch with my family yesterday.  While serving drinks, the waitress spilled the whole glass of water on me.  We changed table and waited for our steaks.  All came except for mine.  I asked if they had forgotten and they say I didn't order.  I reminded them that I order "T" bone and they came back to tell me they run out of T and I asked for Rideye.<br><br>They quickly take my order again.  When my steak came I realised the inside of my baked potatoes was almost all black.  I asked if it was meant to be like that and they say that's was the potatoes' eyes !!!  Nevertheless, they change one for me !<br><br>Is someone up there trying my patience ?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Anyway, anyone got similar experience ??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I said no need but she insisted.  But then when the food did not come and when it came with the black potatoes, they didn't offer.  The thought of complaining did cross my mind but then, no, I don't want to spoil my day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

We prefer the AMK one although each time we went there, I don't think we got the kind of service we expect ( not to worry, I don't expect very high standard ) but at least expect some decent one.  You don't even get it.  One time,( peak hour ), the waiter bring out the food and shout ( like in hawker centre )," medium, medium - whose ?".
