            <div class='col-md body'>Indulgz Bistro<br>9 Tan Quee Lan St<br><br>Went to check out this place last Oct. Ambience was so-so, food was average, service was pretty good, though we got a little irritated with one of them. She was so intent on clearing our plates, even those with still food on them. Signs of chasing us away? The place was half empty.<br><br>However, a few days ago, I noticed a double charge in my statement. Called the boss and she rectified it promptly enough. However, when I raised my concerns that she did not go the extra mile to double check on this issue back in Oct, she launched into self defence mode. Pen me a SUPER LONG email explaining or rather defending herself. Blaming everything on machine problem, human error etc. Is this the way to appease a angry customer?<br><br>She did mention that after settlement for that day, there was a surplus of S$132.88 in sale. Which was exactly the amount I paid. Was there another table which had that same amount as me? The best part was, I made a reservation, which means, she definitely has my contact number. If she had spent a few more minutes checking, she would have established the discrepancy. There was no extra effort taken to double check. In fact she conveniently blamed it on the machine - which had in fact approved the transaction!<br><br>There was good onsite service. But where is the after sales service?? Imagine if I did not check my statement! Need I say more?<br><br>A place serving average food at 'not worth' price. If anyone decide to go there, please pay cash. At least you will feel safer. But of cos, everyone's taste in food is different. This is my take. But the important issue here is the inability to handle customer's complaint. Do we need to subject ourselves to such drama for any food? Remember... there's always another better restaurant nearby.</div>
