            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I was there last night with my hubby and 2 and a half year old son for dinner around 7ish...we ordered abt $48 worth of food n drinks.  The seats inside were full so we had to sit at a tiny table outside... there were maybe about 6 tables outside, only 1 other table was occupied by a group of 3 ppl.<br><br>I pulled another chair from an empty table to place my bag... coz their chairs are erm... not exactly the most comfortable or roomy in the world... it is hard as it is managing my young son who was throwing a tantrum and grappling with such a tiny table full of food (their sauce bottles take up half the table)...<br><br>The other table with the 2 girls and 1 guy did the same - pulled an extra chair from another table to place their bags.... imagine my irritation when presumably the lady boss, a black-faced ang moh woman came to me and asked "how many ppl?" I told her there is 3 of us... and she said to me "oh then i would have to take that chair" pointing to the chair holding my bag... when the rest of the tables outside were EMPTY except for the other one with the party of 3.  So i told her that it is hard for me to cope holding my bag on my lap and managing my young son and she said in an irritated voice "but i have my customers too" - yeah, where are your customers when the tables outside are EMPTY and there is no queue???  so she gave me an evil look and said "i will have to take it later when there are customers"....<br><br>She didn't take the chair used to place bags from the party of 3 - didn't even go and confront them, only confronted me... maybe i have a "can-bully" face... after saying that to me, she promptly went to the back to bring another chair out to replace the one i took to put my bag... so if she has extra chairs in the back, why is she LIMITING me to only 3 chairs for the 3 of us when her tables are so small, the chairs are so uncomfortable and there are no customers using the other tables and chairs???<br><br>Only 1 reason - BAD customer service, arrogant and thinks her restaurant is so great that she doesn't need good customers like us or believes that her "good" food can overcome the bad word of mouth that will result from this incident... well.... does she know that top-notch hotels like Goodwood Park provide baby chairs for folks to place their bags???<br><br>After that incident with her, I SWEAR i will never ever patronise her restaurant again... if you ask me abt the fish.... objectively? The portion is small - expensive $15-17 for 2 tiny pieces of cod and SOGGY chips.... my hubby's halibut was MISHY.... and our oyster poppers? Not exactly the freshest.... so there, one customer and her friends and relatives lost FOREVER... these ppl should do self-reflection and take a course in CUSTOMER SERVICE!<br><br>I can only imagine that 1) she doesn't have any children 2) only cares abt profit and how many customers she can seat on a friday nite... should we patronise shops like this??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Food-wise, for that price range... Fish and Co has a larger portion of fish (albeit a poorer breed, not cod or halibut or the like) and yummilicious yellow rice) and won't complain or give u a dirty look if you place your bag on their extra chair.  Their chairs are a lot roomier and ambience better to begin with...<br><br>Else, the fish joint at Greenwood is the best... most value for money, chunky white fish, and chips that won't even be soggy if you ta bao home... and good tangy thai chilli sauce. Fisherman Wharf's variety of chips? Oily and soggy... even eating there... good chips like those from Australia's fish and chip shops are crispy after being  packed up in paper....  I recommend the Greenwood one... you won't find Fisherman's Wharf up to standard after u try that...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
