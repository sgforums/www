              <p><cite class="byline vcard"><span class="provider org">AFP Relax</span> – <abbr title="2012-08-29T10:28:58Z">Wed, Aug 29, 2012</abbr></cite></p>
              <p class="first">German health authorities and researchers have come out
               swinging recently against the Taiwanese drink bubble tea, warning that 
              the popular dessert beverage presents a choking hazard to children and 
              may contain cancer-causing chemicals.</p>
              <p>The warnings, released 
              separately, come as Europe, and Germany in particular, begin to catch on
               to the bubble tea trend which has already swept major urban centers in 
              North America to become a popular dessert beverage.</p>
              <p>After analyzing the tapioca balls which make up the ‘bubbles' in the 
              drink, researchers from the University Hospital Aachen, for instance, 
              found that <em><strong>the pearls contained polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs such 
              as styrene, acetophenone, and brominated substances, chemicals that 
              shouldn't be in food at all</strong></em>, researchers told German paper The Local.</p>
              <p>Samples were taken from an unnamed chain in Mönchengladbach, in northwest Germany and <strong>the tapioca balls were made in Taiwan.</strong></p>
              <p>The study comes on the heels of a public health <a href="http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/press_information/2012/23/trend_drink_bubble_tea__health_risk_for_small_children-131486.html">warning</a> from the country's German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment earlier
               this month, which warned that <em><strong>the tapioca balls also present a choking 
              risk to children.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>"Especially with children aged up to four years, there is a risk of 
              foreign objects accidentally entering the lungs," said Dr. Andreas 
              Hensel in a statement.  "And that is precisely what can happen when the 
              bubbles are sucked up through a straw."</strong></em></p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the institute says no bubble tea-related accidents have yet been reported.</p>

              <p>???thought the bubbles was sago thing soaked in coloured flavourings???i believe the manufacturers could have used chemical synthesising to make bubbles cheaper.thus styrene and other toxic monomers are present using the high energy chem disint5egrating method which usually gives an accurate graphical layout to all known materials.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but im not sure about the bubbles being ingested to lungs.maybe they should lpike make bubble tea way more expensive until 4 yr olds cant have em to solve issues.</p>

              <p>They should be made larger, so you really have to chew them to bits.</p>
              <p>Or make them smaller, so they get swallowed before they even get chewed on, which is honestly quite stupid.</p>
              <p>I have tried smaller pearls, so small you could drink it with the common straw, i totally regretted that purchase.</p>
