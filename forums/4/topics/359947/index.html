              <p>Cassia is a tree that is related to
                  Cinnamon and from which the spice, cassiabark, is derived from. It also
                  happens to be the name of the newly opened Chinese restaurant at
                  Capella Singapore, which offers traditional Chinese cuisine blended
                  with haute Cantonese techniques. In short, modern Chinese cuisine. The
                  place is helmed by Executive Chef Ooi Soon Lock, who had stints in HK,
                  Malaysia and Ritz Carlton Singapore.<br> <br> Located at the upmarket Capella Hotel at Sentosa (where rooms start at
                  $650/night), Cassia sits on the 3rd story of this stunning colonial
                  style hotel complete with a sprawling driveway. The restaurant in
                  itself is another work of art, with its lime stone lined entrance and
                  intricately cut black lamp shades that provide a nice warm glow to the
                  place. Seats are comfortable with plush cushions and the cutlery reads
                  Narumi and Christofle - really expensive stuff.<br> <br> Amuse Bouche - Served chilled, the amuse bouche of dragonfruit, pork
                  belly and mango was quite a novel way to start off. The pork was
                  surprisingly firm with a mild hint of barbecue sauce but the fruits
                  didn't quite feature in the overall taste.<br> <br> Steamed Milk Custard Bun with Salted Egg Yolk - The custard bun didn't
                  come in the customary bun shape but in a oblong dumpling shape. It was
                  evidently hand made from the nips in the skin. The custard filling was
                  smooth with traces of egg yolk sediment but reminded me uncomfortably
                  of kaya(coconut jam). There was an overload of flour as well.<br> <br> Deep Fried Spring Roll with Prawn, Garlic and Mozzarella Cheese - I
                  thought this dish was quite decent, with the spring rolls crisp without
                  coming across as too oily. The prawns were crunchy but I couldn't quite
                  make out the taste of cheese though. Nice as a finger food.<br> <br> Pan Fried Bean Curd Skin Rolls with Chicken and French Foie Gras - Foie
                  gras is the key here but sadly, I couldn't quite make out any in the
                  rolls. The beancurd skin was limp and not the least bit crisp but at
                  least the prawns were evident and crunchy. Now where's my foie gras?<br> <br> Wok Fried Carrot Cake with Crisp Garlic in Pi Fong Tang Style -
                  Honestly, I have no idea what constitutes Pi Fong Tang Style but I do
                  know this. The carrot cake was too soft and mashy. And honestly, it
                  could really do with a little more flavour. On the upside, it wasn't
                  excessively oily and deep fried garlic is always nice, albeit
                  irritating as it tends to stick to your teeth when chewing.<br> <br> Steamed Barbecued US Berkshire Pork Buns - I must admit that I enjoyed
                  the pork buns aka char siew bao. The char siew filling wasn't cloyingly
                  sweet and the meat pieces were plump and juicy. The skin was soft and
                  moist too, just that there was a little too much flour.<br> <br> Crispy Prawn Dumplings with Wasabi Mayo - Comfort food to say the very
                  least, the crispy prawn dumplings weren't out of the ordinary but
                  competent enough to warrant a decent grade. The wanton skin was
                  crackling crispy and the prawn huge and sweet. It was served on a
                  cucumber spread with a thick layer of wasabi mayo that didn't threaten
                  to overwhelm.<br> <br> Steamed Crystal Shrimp Dumplings with Bamboo Shoot and Celery - The
                  quintessential dim sum dish - har gao. The skin was thin and slightly
                  elastic while the whole prawn was fresh and crunchy. The addition of
                  bamboo shoots and celery gave it an extra crunch but thats about it.<br> <br> Deep Fried Thai Papaya Puff - This is actually quite interesting stuff
                  and I must admit that its the first time I'm having something like
                  that. The pastry was flaky and inside was mashed papaya that came
                  across as mildly sweet. Would probably be more suitable as a dessert in
                  my humble opinion.<br> <br> Pan Fried Australian Minced Wagyu Beef Bun with Truffle and Water
                  Chestnut - I have mentioned this countless times and I shall say this
                  again. Mincing wagyu beef is a blatant and shameful waste of good beef.
                  And this was no exception. The bun was speckled with sesame seeds and
                  then pan fried till the seeds turned golden brown. There was no
                  inherent beefy taste and in its place, a strong taste of spring onion.
                  The water chestnut gave it a nice crunchy texture though. In case you
                  are questioning where the truffle went to, I have that same question in
                  mind.<br> <br> Steamed Sui Mai Dumplings, topped with Norwegian Salmon Roe - The
                  filling in the siew mai was probably part pork, part prawn paste, hence
                  the noticeable absence of the porky taste. However, the salmon roe
                  proved to be a little too fishy for me and this dish in general. I
                  wonder if the roe could have been better utilised?<br> <br> Baked Farm Egg Tart - I thought that the egg tarts were quite decent,
                  albeit rather smallish in size. The crust wasn't too flaky and had a
                  oat aftertaste (oat flour?) while the custard was quivery and not too
                  sweet. Nice, but not that nice.<br> <br> An uninspiring and partially filling dim sum session set the 3 of us
                  back by about $72, which isn't alot of money. Food hovers around
                  average to slightly above average but with the quality and quantity,
                  I'll be hard pressed to find a reason to return. Maybe only for the
                  ambience and exclusivity? And even if I do, I'll probably just stick to
                  the dim sum. I mean, with prices like $12/pax for tea or $5/bowl of
                  rice, one would be either have to be obnoxiously rich or simply
                  deranged to actually do dinner.<br> <br> See all my pictures <a href="http://www.timelessfacade.com/2009/05/cassia.html"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
