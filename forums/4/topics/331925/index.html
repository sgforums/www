              <p>   Just came back from canada toronto and have tasted two of their very famous and extremely good tasting foods .</p>
              <p>      MONTANA's ribs which is perfectly made with choices of texas sauce or another dunno what honey lemon sauce . But i heard from my brother say the 2 sauces taste identical . But for me i tasted texas sauce and when you tried to cut the ribs , don't be surprised that you not only were able to cut them nicely but majority of the flesh doesn't stick to the bones , yes they come off nicely when you pull the flesh from the bone . usually only abt 0.1% of the flesh per rib gets stuck to the bone .</p>
              <p>    The other great food was the donut from Eat Crispy Creme Donuts . When you reach the shop , you will see the machine making it and also applying the sugar on top of the donut by machine also . And once they see you , they will offer you 1 free donut full size not cuttings of 1/10 or whatever per person . And i dunno if you have to meet conditions or not , they will give you 4 free samples when you buy them .My sister bought abt 24 of them and i heard that if you really want to taste another 1 , they will gladly give you another 1 full donut totally free of charge .</p>
              <p>   So anyone going or still in canada please try to taste them before cmg home :D" .</p>

And some more nowadays gt alot of china pple dammm greedy n bad attitude type . Even at hong kong airport they also cut queue to go into plane . But i really have very good impression of canadians . Once a gang of 6 pple and 2 of the ladies cut into my line of view for taking photos , one of the guys scolded the ladies for being rude and even scolded them "pple are trying to take a picture ,  you stupid canadians" lol . Even my bro and bro in law also smile at it .</p></div>

              <p>Ahahaha !! Montana's !! Err... you should have visited the Singaporeans Overseas forum here in Sgforums before heading to toronto, we would have told you where to eat. Montana's is only good on weds for their all you can eat ribs night, other then that i'll never pay a dime in there. </p>
              <p>Crispy Creme eh, you headed up to mississauga ? </p>
