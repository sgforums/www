            <div class='col-md body'>I was invited to a friendÂ’s birthday dinner at Szechuan Court in Raffles City. Thinking it would a Chinese dinner, it is normal to BYO wine for the occasion. As we bring out our wine, we were told that we would be charged $45 a bottle for corkage since itÂ’s happy occasion for us we agreed to pay for the corkage. But to much of our surprise, we were served with some cheap looking glassware instead of the usual wine glass we would expect from some other Chinese restaurant we been to. Also as they changed our eating utensils, most of us found that the chopsticks are stains and so were our wine glass. This is certainly not we expect from a restaurant in 5 stars hotel. I do not mean that restaurant cannot charge corkage but before you start charging you should at least serve some decent wine glass depending on the customers wine. I think the management should be seriously looking into these. As raffles group hotels are now considered world standard but certainly the way we were serve is definitely way behind some great Chinese restaurant locally, at least they do better service and food and best of all no corkage from BYO and you are serve with superb crystal wine glass.</div>
