            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Avoid the Balcony at Heeren.</strong><br><br>Went with several of my ex-classmates after our ROM for a dinner. As the set dinner looked rather value for money $19.90+++ (either fish/chicken) with dessert and coffee/tea, we proceeded to place our orders for nine people.<br><br>The waitress then clarified that they have ran out of cakes as desserts and it would be a soft drink in lieu. A piece of cake there costs at least $5 and they actually wanted to change it a soft drink which costs a few cents. It was only seven plus and they sold out their cakes with no replenishment..Ridiculous..Subsequently, thought they might use some discretion, we requested to change our 'soft-drinks desserts' to a jug of vodka, but was turned down flatly. Fed up, refused to order the set dinners (obviously short-changed) but ordered a main course and a jug of vodka ribena. One jug costs $34+++ but was not enough for 9 people and ordered two. There were so many restrictions on the choice of alcohol, that we cannot order the cocktail and so on in a jug. Vodka ribena actually tasted like bitter blackcurrant cough syrup. When we complained to the waitress (obviously an overworked, under-paid temp), she gave us a dirty look and showed that she can't do anything. The main course portions were miserly and served with some bitter-tasting raw vegetation. Ended up spending $200 plus, half-fed and full of frustration. They gave a $15/- voucher, hoping that I am another big-head carrot but tore it up and threw it into one of the dirty plates. They got my message.<br><br>This place disappoints me a lot..thought it would deliver some standards after being recommended by Bryan Wong and Patricia Mok in their show. The ambience is ok but the food and inflexibility of the staff really sucks. Go there at your own risk. Restaurants who take their customers for granted would utimately be the loser. Word-of-mouth power rules.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have officially sacked the Fish and Co at Wheelock place.<br><br>The service was terrible.<br><br>The waitress/waiters simply crowded the bar area and watched TV or chit chatted. There was zero service provided. No re-filling of water, no one alert to take orders, they twice screwed up my orders and even pretended to act blur about it when i questioned them. Patrons sitting near me went as far as refusing to pay the 10% service charge, citing extremely poor attitude of the waiters, and called for the manager to express their disgust.<br><br>The food may be decent, but i was totally put off by the poor...no LACK of service.</div>
