              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Kopitiam was awarded the tender for rental of SENGKANG MARKET at a monthly rental of $500 000. SENGKANG MARKET is expected to have 40 wet market stall, 10 dry sundry stall, 50 cooked food stall.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">So $500 000 a month, it means KOPITIAM must collect at least $5000 per month from each stalls! That's obscene.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Going to NEA website, even cooked food stall in Maxwell won't fetch $5000 a month. Moreover a dry and wet market stall would normally fetch $800....</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Who should be blamed for the rising cost of living? KOPITIAM or HDB? For those who feel that Singapore tax little on our income, do think twice.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Or course your indirect tax will be higher if you stayed in SENGKANG.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Can we say no to KOPITIAM? What's wrong with current scheme of having HDB/NEA owning the Markets and Food Centres?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I am glad I stayed near 2 upgraded markets where the coffee stalls there still charged a cup of coffees at 60cents.</p>

              <p>True we can choose not to patronize the stalls or Kopitiam, however are we being deprived of an essential amenity? And what will be the effect on this rental price, food prices have on other food stalls, coffee shops in Seng Kang?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If HDB use this as benchmark, next time HDB will claim that they had provided 'SUBSIDY' at $3000/month to all market stalls in SIngapore.</p>
              <p>Seng Kang is a residential township, high bids which translate to high rentals and high food prices will indirectly affect many residents there. </p>

              <p>Unfortunately, Kopitiam refused to comment why they submit such

              <p>I think they bid high because they are confident they can make the money back, and underestimate the competitor's bidding...</p>
              <p>But they are an established company, not some random guy who anyhow bid, so i am sure they have a plan to make this work. If no plan, and they lose moeny, they are always welcome to give up and cut their losses....</p>

              <p>1. Maxwell market is just located in an high dense area. And their rentals defintitely do not fetch such highs.</p>
              <p>2. So Kopitiam owns the Carpark lots? And Kopitiam collect the monies from Car Park as well? This is something new and not report in paper.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't car park lots to be built only if there is a demand? If people shun that premises, perhaps HDB can forgo the plan of building that car park.</p>
              <p>3. Wow, why won't HDB/NEA sell their advertising space in all MARKETS/FOOD CENTRES? There are many MARKETS located in much more premium locations such as Maxwell, Holland V, and I yet to see any advertising space being built up.</p>
              <p>I believe advertising space are been governed by some advertising regulations, else the whole advertising industry will tank.</p>
              <p>4. Yup lower profit margins? But how low a plate of chicken rice a stall can sell, if he has high overheads to cover? At present chicken rice selling at $2.5 in normal food centre stall whose monthly rental averages $2000. Extrapolate the data, in Seng Kang Kopitiam, a plate of chicken rice may be at $5. And for lower profit margin, perhaps $4.5.</p>
              <p>5. Oh yes, charge for the toilet, maybe 20cents per entry. Charge the stall owners high in maintenance fees, in plate collecting service, in table cleaning service.., and all these may be $500 per stall. And with that perhaps Kopitiam charges the stall at $4.5k rental instead.</p>

              <p>HDB invites tenders for Sengkang market<br><br>THE Housing and Development Board (HDB) began inviting tenders yesterday for a land parcel in Sengkang New Town for the building and managing of a market and food centre. The land parcel has a site area of 6,000 square metres and a maximum gross floor area of 4,000 sq m.<br><br>The tenure is for an initial five years with options for another two terms. The development will house an estimated 100 stalls offering fresh market produce and cooked food, as well as parking lots and a drop-off porch.<br><br>The tender arose from the Forum on HDB Heartware, which among other things, recommended the building of wet markets and hawker centres to promote community bonding and strengthen local identity. Sengkang was chosen for the pilot project as it is a new town and many requests have been made for another market and food centre.<br><br>Despite the dismal economic climate, Nicholas Mak, Knight Frank’s director of research and consultancy, expects the response to be positive. ‘The Sengkang area is a growing estate housing about 140,000 people at the moment and the location of the market is quite attractive as well, with it being surrounded by high-density flats and quite near the MRT,’ he said, adding that the project would most likely be taken on by a contractor that frequently works with the HDB.<br><br>The project is expected to be completed on or before Dec 31, 2010.</p>

              <p>I guess you need to go do some primary school English assessment books.</p>
              <p><br>And maybe you should also go worry about the future 10% GST as well, or worry about a possible unemployment 20 years down the road. There are many many many other possible things that are not finalised for you to worry about. You can be busy enough! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>It is already a known fact that there will be 100 stalls. And
              the detailed breakdown was 40 market stalls, 10 sundry stalls and
              50 cooked food stalls. What u meant by small supermarket? Tuition
              centre?</p>
              <p>If that's the case, then it would be a shopping centre like
              Dawson Road Shopping Centre. I think you can tell a different
              between a shopping centre and a market.</p>
              <p>Yup my priority is to beat the rising cost of living, and to
              start with, is to stop the agency from awarding tenders at
              astronomical price to irresponsible company.</p>

              <p>you are right. maybe you should be the one to choose which company to award to.</p>
              <p>i believe other countries has a choosing system, and coincidentally, the company awarded is usually people who are related to the head of the committee...</p>

              <p>well that sort of a best plan comes from a commercial point of view. My idea of a best plan is one which is citizen oriented. One which can manage the market at the most profit but lowest cost. Obviously, attaining low cost and eventually low prices for citizens is not an agenda on the list.</p>
