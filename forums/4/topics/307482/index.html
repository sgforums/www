              <p>SINGAPORE : The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has issued a warning against a product called Power 1 Walnut.</p>
              <p>The public is advised not to consume this illegal product.</p>
              <p>It
              is believed to contain two potent ingredients — glibenclamide and
              sildenafil. The ingredients are prescription—only medicines which
              should only be taken under strict medical supervision.</p>
              <p>The product’s label stated the manufacturer as Guangzhou Xinkauili Company.</p>
              <p>Based on HSA’s preliminary investigations, the product is likely to have been illegally brought into Singapore.</p>
              <p>It claims to contain only natural herbal ingredients and is marketed for sexual enhancement in both men and women.</p>
              <p>The
              HSA said it had received serious adverse drug reaction reports of two
              male patients who had consumed Power 1 Walnut. They had developed very
              low blood sugar levels.</p>
              <p>This condition, if untreated in time, could lead to unconsciousness, seizures and sometimes death. — CNA/ms</p>

              <h1 class="clr">HSA urges public not to consume Power 1 Walnut</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is urging the public not to consume the illegal drug known as ’Power 1 Walnut’.</p>
              <p>Despite earlier warnings, HSA said there are still many who have
              consumed the China—made product, which is marketed as an aphrodisiac.</p>
              <p>Five
              more men are confirmed to have taken Power 1 Walnut and were found
              either unconscious at home or with symptoms of very low blood sugar. On
              top of that, 11 new suspected cases have been reported. One of them was
              in a coma.</p>
              <p>These patients tested positive for glibenclamide an
              anti—diabetic medication found in dangerous concentrations in Power 1
              Walnut. The drug also contains sildenafil, which is found in Viagra and
              is used to treat impotency.</p>
              <p>The HSA has called on those who have bought such illegal products to stop consuming them.</p>
              <p>Severe
              and life—threatening symptoms of low blood sugar including seizures and
              coma may occur if the drug continues to be consumed.</p>
              <p>Substances
              like glibenclamide and sildenafil are controlled under the Poisons Act.
              Anyone importing, stocking and possessing these items for sale without
              a licence may be fined S$10,000 and/or jailed for up to two years.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Man dies from consuming Power 1 Walnut</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: One man has died after taking "Power 1 Walnut", an illegal product touted for sexual enhancement.</p>
              <p>The middle—aged Singaporean was comatose when he was hospitalised in
              early March. He was one of the patients earlier announced by the Health
              Sciences Authority (HSA) to be a suspected case associated with "Power
              1 Walnut" ingestion. Subsequent investigations found that the patient
              had consumed the product.</p>
              <p>The patient did not regain consciousness and eventually succumbed to pneumonia. The case is pending coroner’s investigation.</p>
              <p>"Power
              1 Walnut" is not approved by HSA, and has been found to contain
              excessive doses of glibenclamide, a prescription medicine used for
              treatment of diabetes.</p>
              <p>The HSA urges the public not to consume
              "Power 1 Walnut" as it causes serious health consequences such as
              seizures, unconsciousness and coma in those who have taken it.</p>
              <p>"There
              are also other patients who developed serious adverse drug reactions of
              seizures and unconsciousness with just a single ingestion of half a
              tablet of Power 1 Walnut. This demonstrates the highly toxic effects of
              this product," says HSA.</p>
              <p>As at 3 April, the total number of
              patients confirmed to have taken "Power 1 Walnut" was 23, while 53 were
              suspected cases. — CNA/ir</p>
