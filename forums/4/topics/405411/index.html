              <p>Hokay~ TGIF everyone...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Review for ytd buffet @ kiseki... No pics and I'm tired and lazy to upload...</p>
              <p>I spend $35 per person...</p>
              <p>Starting from Sashimi... was surprise to see salmon belly there, though no nametags but can see it's salmon belly... however, taste wise it's not very fresh... Even carrefour de salmon belly taste better... They have other fare like tuna, tako, snapper, swordfish, salmon...</p>
              <p>Sushi bar... Very normal fare... nthing exciting, nthing special...</p>
              <p>Seafood bar... Disappoint... Dunno I suay or wat, everytime a place review states got lobster, I go there, no lobster... remind me of Triple 3 T__T... There's Scallops, Mussels, Prawns, Flower Crab, and appetiser like seasoned seaweed, scallop figs and kimchi... Appetiser tasted normal, nthing special... But the seafood are rather fresh... Scallops and mussel are cleaner and fresher then most place I went too... Very pleasantly surprised...</p>
              <p>Steamed Bar, Chawamushi was normal, kushin bo de taste better... They also have the old shukudo de ham and cheese omullete which still taste as good...</p>
              <p>Grilled Bar... They have ribeye strips but I wonder where does one find ribeye strips<img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Taste wise it's gooood... There's also mushroom, chickens, squid... They have a small pasta corner where u pick ur ingredient and they will cook it with the pasta... not bad...</p>
              <p>Noodle Stall... Only got zaru soba, udon and chasoba... udon was very very very nice... not those thick bloated type but those thin type... chasoba and zaru soba is nice too...</p>
              <p>Soup Stall... I only tried seafood soup but I drink my udon soup and I had wasabi in the soup so I didn't manage to taste properly... But I still can taste slight sweetness/saltiness... However my fren (who is a soup nazi) said it's below average... He got extremely high standards for soup... I was tempted to order shabu shabu but when I saw the meat was served in the soup instead of seperated, I became sianx &gt;__&gt;</p>
              <p>Tempura Stall... Usual tempura fare... Ebi was nice... very nice... tempura sauce is served warm, which is a good thing which u can seldom find elsewhere... The others like eggplant is not bad too~</p>

              <p>Yakitori Stall... Mushroom, scallops, pork belly, chicken,  meat ball, Kama(fish head, dunno why in this section sia)...chicken was tough &gt;__&gt; pork belly was goooooood... scallops small la, but still good... mushroom u gotta ownself put sauce arbo very bland(duh!)... The others are normal...</p>
              <p>Littered ard are also cooked food and soup... U can find teriyaki chicken, sweet-and-sour salmon, miso soup, rice, garlic fried rice etc etc...</p>
              <p>Dessert stall... zomg~ zomggg~~ I took damn lotsa of dessert... there's waffles, icecream, chocolate fondue, a good selection cakes and dessert served in shot glass, fruits and japanese pancake... Mango pudding is good, but too bad not cold enuff... there's a shotglass filled with japanese red beans, corn kernals and milk... zomg~ zomg~~ Damn good... The cheese tofu cake also quite nice...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Setting is same as shukudo, but at least they got a small corner setup as a mini playground for kids... I got a table with cushion seats so it's very comfy... Service also attentive... But the section near the dessert stall has a certain "salted fish smell" -___- dunno why also...</p>
              <p>While walking ard and taking pictures, someone tapped my shoulder and I turned back... Looked quite like 7-11 sia... but it turns out to be the boss of the place... Chatted abit, quite a friendly guy, though I presume his main interest would be why am I going around taking pictures <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">... He also asked me for my feedback and which I told him and he was listening very attentively thru out... <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> He told me tat shukudo, kiseki are all under thai express... something which I didn't know... It was only when I left then I remembered I forgot to ask him why no lobster~~ <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall: For the price, Okay okay la... Nthing special also... If they fixed up/improve some stalls, it would have been a good catch... and PLZ give my lobster back~~ &gt;______&gt;</p>

              <p>Nirai-Kani burns a really big hole in my wallet..  Branja a friend to eat, spent almost $100 for a plate of the pancake, a plate of pork belly and a plate of sashimi....</p>
              <p>on the bright side, we were given a really nice room so we enjoy our stay with free flow of good piping hot ocha ..chatting in private for more than 2 hours..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
