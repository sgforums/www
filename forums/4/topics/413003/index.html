              <p><span>Looking almost as fresh as the day it was bought, this McDonald's Happy Meal is in fact a staggering six months old.</span></p>
              <p><span>Photographed
              every day for the past half a year by Manhattan artist Sally Davies the
              kids meal of fries and burger is without a hint of mould or decay.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sitting on a shelf in her apartment,
              Sally has watched the Happy Meal with increasing shock and even her
              dogs have resisted the urge to try and steal a free tasty snack.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I
              bought the meal on April 10 of this year and brought it home with the
              express intention of leaving it out to see how it fared,' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I
              chose McDonald's because it was nearest to my house, but the project
              could have been about any other of the myriad of fast food joints in
              New York.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The first thing that struck me on day two of the experiment was that it no longer emitted any smell.</span></p>
              <p><span>'And
              then the second point of note was that on the second day, my dogs
              stopped circling the shelf it was sitting on trying to see what was up
              there.'</span></p>
              <p><span>'It was then that I realised that something strange might be going on with this food that I had bought,' she explained.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The
              fries shrivelled slightly as did the burger patty, but the overall
              appearance of the food did not change as the weeks turned to months.</span></p>
              <p><span>'And now, at six months old, the food is plastic to the touch and has an acrylic sheen to it.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The only change that I can see is that it has become hard as a rock.'</span></p>

              <p>I keep seeing this article pop up everywhere but what's the point? What are the chemical constituents that are actually present to preserve the food to this extent? I am sure that someone would have done some lab tests on the fast food to tell what's inside? Are the chemicals harmful? It feels plastic-like and acrylic-like but it sure ain't poly(ethene), so what's inside? I am sure it's real beef, but maybe mixed with other stuff that might or might not be harmful to our health! </p>
              <p>This does not put me off eating at McDonalds yet and I'm sure many won't too since McDonalds is just a stone's throw away from everywhere and the food there is affordable.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Like ThunderFBolt said, that just proves that they are well preserved. You can see the McDonalds burgers are shrink wrapped before they toast it slightly to serve it. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the fries since they are frozen and then deep fried, which 100% removes any pathogens, so it should still be alright to consume the food. No one has died from eating too much at McDonalds, so it should still be safe.</p></div>

              <p>Bill Clinton talks about going veg to reverse heart disease, so he 
              can be healthy in the years ahead to see his potential grandchildren.</p>
              <p>Scroll down for video.</p>
              <p>We also have this from ecorazzi.com:</p>
              <p>"I'm trying to be one of those experimenters," said Clinton. "Since 
              1986, several hundred people who have tried essentially a plant-based 
              diet, not ingesting any cholesterol from any source, has seen their 
              bodies start to heal themselves -- break up the arterial blockage, break
               up the calcium deposits around the heart. 82 percent of the people who 
              have done this have had this result, so I want to see if I can be one of
               them."</p>
              <p>Just hours ago, Ecorazzi received exclusive information from a friend of
               Clinton (who wishes to remain anonymous) regarding first-hand 
              conversations with the former president about his vegan diet.</p>
              <p>According to our source, Clinton decided to adopt the diet in the early 
              part of May. While he does occasionally eat fish, the former president 
              otherwise follows a strict vegan diet.</p>
              <p>What made him go vegan? According to our source, Clinton has read many books on the topic, including books by <strong>T. Colin Campbell, Caldwell Esselstyn and Dr. Dean Ornish</strong>. Although losing weight was a benefit of the dietary change, the choice to go vegan was about more than just losing weight.</p>
              <p>"I've never known him not to say what's on his mind," says our source. 
              "And he knows quite a bit and likely has a lot to say about the benefits
               of a vegan diet. <strong>He has read The China Study, and he knows the issues</strong>.  With time, I think it's likely he could become the most outspoken proponent of a complete vegan diet."</p>

              <p>Well, don't be surprised in any project which requires equipment or materials, don't be surprised to get items more than 2 years old. Some things could be in inventory for months before it gets shipped out, and don't forget all that paperworks that needs time to get thru, etc. So why should food be a surprise?</p>

              <p>All these people who carry out these experiments haven't paid enough attention to science lessons at school. Here's an explanation to why the food doesn't get moldy or decompose. (A guy with the username Jonah from Yahoo! Answers wrote this):</p>
              <p>"<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333;">I know people like to jump on fast food, but this one isn't unusual. And it has nothing to do with "preservatives"</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333;"><br>Those french fries? Well, the reason they are browned is that is burning the top layer of starch so that it is crisp- that also makes it an unhospitable environment for any type of mold or bacteria to grow. Mold and bacteria need moisture - and that has been removed from outside layer of the fries and replaced with oil. Have you ever seen oil get mold? Of course not.<br><br>Pretty much the same story on the bun. Most white bread will go stale before it molds. This has more to do with the humidity in the room being low - and not much to do with the bun<br><br>As for the patty - well, again, browned food is cooked off - have you EVER seen a thoroughly cooked piece of meat get moldy? It just doesn't happen.<br><br>So overall - I can see why people who look for any reason to demonize certain companies and their food - but they were expecting something (of course, they never say what) to happen to this food and it didn't. That doesn't meant anything was wrong - only that they had the wrong expectations."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see? Nothing to be worried about. Anyways, "I'm Lovin' It!"!</p>
