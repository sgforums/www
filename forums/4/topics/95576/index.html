            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ah Ger 83,<br><br>This restaurant has been taken over by new management during mid '2002. I suppose by flaming the restaurant is not a good idea. I suppose u work before mid'02.  I suppose the ' Disgusting Chef' u mentioned named 'xxffexy', am I right ?<br><br>This new management team is owned by a professional Chef now and I do know him directly. Not trying to help things like that but just like to make things clear. I do admit the previous team before mid '2002 is a problematic group but not this new team.<br><br>As for that previous owners , they are gone already so lets not flame this new team. My friend hope that you can vouch for the time presence when u r wif the company and testify the incident time that take place. Ur help will be greatly appreciated.<br><br>As for Kissy, my friend came to know abt the bad service u experience and would like to apologize for that matter. But I do know most of his staff is very attentive to customer needs. I am sure u do get his other server's service as well except for that tall lady u had bad experience wif .I can vouch that most patrons who visit after the new team came in has very good experience in the restaurant.<br><br>I hope that all dear forumers Bros and Sis continue to support this new team.<br><br>Peace to All !!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Kissy,<br><br>The new owner is my chef friend in Shatec. To be honest , he dun really used computer or even the net. I just happen to see this post and reflect to him on this incident and he feels bad abt it .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>See that u dine out often usually, service staff in Singapore is one of the most highly turn over rate job cause most ppl here perceive it as a low graded job compare to the youth in Europe. Put urself in a shoe of a restauratuer , u will not have a lot of time in managing high turn over rate. My friend is lucky enough to keep some good staffs that work with him since he took over I suppose..<br><br>Anyway he like to apologize for that experience with that server that serve u sincerely.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I am oso a restauratuer myself and I know how he feels and most importantly u as the customer feels.. I am sure both him and me would like to be served nicely and end up walking the restaurant with good memory.<br><br>From the post u reply, sure that u have given them a chance and would visit Swiss Culture again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Peace to All !!!<br>Learn to Forgive and Forget and enjoy a better Day tomorrow  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

To be honest , he dun really used computer or even the net. I just happen to see this post and reflect to him on this incident and he feels bad abt it .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>See that u dine out often usually, service staff in Singapore is one of the most highly turn over rate job cause most ppl here perceive it as a low graded job compare to the youth in Europe. Put urself in a shoe of a restauratuer , u will not have a lot of time in managing high turn over rate. My friend is lucky enough to keep some good staffs that work with him since he took over I suppose..<br><br>Anyway he like to apologize for that experience with that server that serve u sincerely.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I am oso a restauratuer myself and I know how he feels and most importantly u as the customer feels.. I am sure both him and me would like to be served nicely and end up walking the restaurant with good memory.<br><br>From the post u reply, sure that u have given them a chance and would visit Swiss Culture again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Peace to All !!!<br>Learn to Forgive and Forget and enjoy a better Day tomorrow  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Well good to hear this<br><br>Anyway, just did a marketing project for another restaurant.<br><br>And adding my experience with some restaurants, it shouldnt be too difficult neither is it too easy to have a staff who are dedicated to staff service.<br><br>Most of them manage to have customer dedicated staff with very low turnover.<br><br>Perhaps ur management should invest more time, effort and money in training and getting long time staffer. Or add incentive for staff who provides good customer service would be good.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Kissy ,<br><br>Raymond is wif me now. In fact both of us as restaurant owners fully agree wif wat u say esp sometime one bad apple spoil the whole crate. To be honest both of us are working right in wif our staffs . We in fact tried our best to train our staffs to the very best service is defintely a plus in our ruling.<br><br>Like wat I mention in the earlier thread is like service in Sg indeed is down esp wif the miserable wages to the workers. In fact nowadays we actually came up wif schemes like attain certain target and share wif the staffs ( of course of reachable and realistic targets  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  ) But wat to do wif the economic downturn nowadays to the answer of the low wages to the service industry cause ppl are more $$$ conscious nowadays even to food esp to those who dun dine out often.<br><br>Hi Kissy,<br><br>This is Raymond here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Appreciate ur comments of my staff . In fact , I have look into this matter already when Culinaist told me abt it and will ensure no such matter occurs again. My deepest apologies if my staff have not served u well.<br><br>Tks for ur compliments for my service rendered to u and hope at least u would come back again ( saw on ur previous thread ). Do identify urself during ur next visit if u see me .<br><br>To all forumers bros and sis , do continue to support Swiss Culture and we will provide u wif our service.<br><br>Cheers to all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Raymond will be in most of the time in the restaurant and never such things will happen.
