            <div class='col-md body'>SO, YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO TRY TO LEARN ENGLISH?<br>This little treatise on the lovely language we share is only for the brave. It was passed on by a linguist; original author unknown. Peruse at your peril, English lovers.<br><br>Reasons why the English language is so hard to learn:<br>1) The bandage was wound around the wound.<br>2) The farm was used to produce produce.<br>3) The dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse.<br>4) We must polish the Polish furniture.<br>5) He could lead if he would get the lead out.<br>6) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert.<br>7) Since there is no time like the present, he thought it was time to present the present.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> A bass was painted on the head of the bass drum.<br>9) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes.<br>10) I did not object to the object.<br>11) The insurance was invalid for the invalid.<br>12) There was a row among the oarsmen about how to row.<br>13) They were too close to the door to close it.<br>14) The buck does funny things when the does are present.<br>15) A seamstress and a sewer fell down into a sewer line.<br>16) To help with planting, the farmer taught his sow to sow.<br>17) The wind was too strong to wind the sail<br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> After a number of injections my jaw got number.<br>19) Upon seeing the tear in the painting I shed a tear.<br>20) I had to subject the subject to a series of tests.<br>21) How can I intimate this to my most intimate friend?<br><br>Let's face it - English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple.<br>English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France.<br>Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.<br>We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.<br>And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and s don't ham.<br>If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth?<br>One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices?<br>Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend.<br>If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?<br>If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught?<br>If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?<br>Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship?<br>Have noses that run and feet that smell?<br>How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?<br>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which, an alarm goes off by going on.<br>English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all.<br>That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.<br>Why do you park on a Driveway, annd drive on a Parkway?<br>PS. - Why doesn't "Buick" rhyme with "quick"?<br><br></div>
