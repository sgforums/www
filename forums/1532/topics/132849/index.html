            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Wahlew I went to Queenstown polyclinic (dental clinic) for the first time.  Previously, I used to go Private clinic.<br><br>So..I made an appointment and went, hoping to get my teeth cleaned and fillings done.  And you know what?  The dentist only did one filling for me on my upper jaw.  And she told me I will have to make another appointment for the other two holes on the lower jaw.  Why can't she do them all at once?  Worse still, she did not clean my teeth for me!  Only did one filling, and I was in there for less than 10 mins.  My buddy who went with me said perhaps it was nearly Lunch time, so they made it snappy.<br><br>So while making payment, I told the receptionist that the dentist told me to go back for another appointment to do the fillings.  She said the earliest is next month.  Ok fine..but weekday I cannot..coz I have to attend school. I requested to have it on a Saturday and she arranged for me to go in September!  I asked her politely, to help me check with the dentist, when should I go back?  Coz I'm afraid the holes will get bigger by then.  WTH she talked back to me 'WHAT'S THERE TO ASK?  SHE ALREADY WRITTEN HERE CLEARY ON THE CARD.'<br><br>Her attitude sucks man!  How can she talk to a customer like that?  The dentist wrote wat is to be done on next appointment but din write the next appointment date wor.  For that pathetic 10 mins and 1 filling done, I paid $39!!!  Subsidised?  Daylight robbery!  Last time I went to Polyclinic, I only paid $45-$60 for cleaning and fillings.  Not only did I get my teeth cleaned thoroughly, the dentist's service was good!<br><br>I won't go back for the appointment in September.  </span></div>
