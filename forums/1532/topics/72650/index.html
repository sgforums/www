            <div class='col-md body'>Top 20 Reasons Why Singaporeans ArenÂ’t Having Sex or Children<br><br>1. Gahmen told me last time to stop at 2, so I thought better be kiasu and stop at zero.<br><br>2. Sex is cheaper overseas, like in Batam or Hat Yai, so I thought IÂ’d have sex there instead.<br><br>3. IÂ’m too scared that IÂ’ll accidentally call out my maidÂ’s name during sex.<br><br>4. I am having sex. ItÂ’s just that itÂ’s all oral at the moment.<br><br>5. Romancing Singapore campaign is too subtle. We need a LetÂ’s Shag, Singapore! Campaign.<br><br>6. If I have kids, that means IÂ’ll have to start watching weird shit on TV like Teletubbies or Barney, and IÂ’d rather die.<br><br>7. I doÂ’wan to mess up my hair. Do you know how much hairdressing costs nowadays?<br><br>8. If I have chewren, wait they take all my Hello Kitty dolls, then how?<br><br>9. I canÂ’t do it with my parents in the next room, I donÂ’t have a car, and I canÂ’t afford hotel rooms.<br><br>10. Are you kidding? I doÂ’wan to have the same kind of fucked-up children like my parents did.<br><br>11. During NS, my sergeant told me to fuck off, so being the obedient type, IÂ’m now completely off fucking.<br><br>12. If Ministers want us to have kids, give us some of their salary and maybe I can afford it.<br><br>13. Wah lau, I everyday kena screw at work, you want me to go home and screw some more?<br><br>14. Which sadist would bring a child into this world to go through our education system?<br><br>15. Too scared. During horror movies, the ones who always kena killed first by the psycho serial killer are the ones having sex.<br><br>16. During sexuality education in school, they kept teaching us to abstain from sex. I guess IÂ’m just a very good student.<br><br>17. IÂ’m just too shacked out from masturbating to Internet porn.<br><br>18. How do you know Singaporeans arenÂ’t having enough sex? ItÂ’s just being exported. Singapore women only want to have sex with foreigners so they can cabut the country, while Singapore men are having sex in foreign countries like China, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc.<br><br>19. I wonÂ’t believe the Gahmen seriously wants me to have sex until MediaCorp starts producing porn. (Note: please, not starring Moses Lim or Lydia Sum.)<br><br>20. Every time I have sex, I recall that the Gahmen wants me to have sex, and frankly, thinking of the Gahmen when having sex totally kills my mood<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ENCOURAGE TEENAGE PREGNANCY<br><br>1. Teenagers between the ages of 16 and 20 are actually the ideal candidates for bearing children because:<br><br>a. hormones are at their most powderful during this period. Why let all those eggs and sperm go to waste?<br><br>b. they are comparatively Â‘engÂ’ and can spare the time. (Especially undergrads.)<br><br>c. And face it: adults in their mid and late twenties are too busy fighting to establish a career to deal with a baby as well.<br><br>d. In all likelihood, your ancestors Â– maybe even your grandparents Â– did this. You think you too atas for your ancestors, is it? Boh tua boh suay! Clearly, this is a pro-Asian values policy.<br><br>2. We know some people will say, Â“But they must concentrate on their studies!Â” To which we reply:<br><br>a. Ye-es, but teenagers donÂ’t study round the clock. We all know that the other half of their time is spent trying to pak tor, so this would be a productive way of indulging their existing interests.<br><br>b. Besides, making babies would not take them more than ten minutes during the right time of each month. That is less time than they will take surfing pornography sites. They can even do it while chatting to their friends on their hands free sets, although they might find it difficult to SMS.<br><br>c. Also, at the age of 16-20, the prospective teen parents will themselves have parents who are roughly between 32 Â– 50 years of age, and are at the a more stable period of their careers, so they can spare some time. Further, fairly healthy grandparents may also be around. This means that potentially, the child-rearing burden can be shared between three generations.<br><br>d. Come on! Study what? Under SingaporeÂ’s education system, do 10 year series, can oreddy!<br><br>e. And undergrads? Come on!<br><br>3. In fact, teens in the through-train programme donÂ’t have to do Â‘OÂ’ levels, so they might as well spend their time usefully. Some more, theyÂ’re supposed to have superior genes, so all the more they should be made to contribute.<br><br>4. By the time teen parents finish tertiary education or enter the job market, their child would be ready for pre-school or even primary school, which will free them to concentrate more on their careers.<br><br>5. In fact, this scheme is great for making the best use of homosexual citizens. At this age, theyÂ’ll be a bit more confused and curious, and will be open to heterosexual experimentation. So their eggs and sperm will not go to waste!<br><br>6. Also, we no longer have to worry about teens being exposed to pornography. Surfing porn websites could actually be considered life-skills research.<br><br>7. Similarly, the age for R(A) movies should be lowered to 16, and the NC-16 rating done away with altogether. The censors will have their work halved, and can devote their energies to more important issues than whether society will collapse because people can see nipples.<br><br>8. Incentives for teens to have kids:<br><br>a. Automatic scholarships and bursaries for higher and further education for teen parents. (Extra for through train students.)<br><br>b. If youÂ’re in school or any educational institution when you have a kid, you get childcare subsidies.<br><br>c. Girls are allowed two and a half years of paid maternity leave, to be taken any time between the ages of 16 and 21 following the birth of their child. The pay would be similar in scale to that of full-time national servicemen. In fact, these two and a half years can be considered girlsÂ’ NS, or Â‘MSÂ’, for maternity service! This would also serve to ameliorate the resentment some men feel about their female counterparts getting the jump on them career-wise.<br><br>d. Boys will have to serve NS during this period. This way they can avoid feeling guilty about not sharing childcare duties like changing nappies, etc, because they can take comfort in the thought that they are also doing important national duties like running to distant trees, touching them and coming back. To serve as a further incentive, NSF fathers will be given more bookout leave.<br><br>9. Incentives for parents of teen parents:<br><br>a. Tax breaks if you have 3 grandchildren before the age of 40. This is fair, bearing in mind youÂ’re helping your kids shoulder the financial burden of your grandkids.<br><br>b. Statutorily-mandated extra month every year for Grandmaternity and Grandpaternity leave.<br><br>10. Naturally, all junior colleges, pre-university centres, ITE campuses, universities, etc, must be changed to provide the following:<br><br>a. adequate and heavily-subsidized childcare facilities.<br><br>b. Cubicles for students to perform their national duties. Fewer sick bays, more sex bays Â– for when they Â‘bay tah hanÂ’.<br><br>c. Compulsory biology and financial management classes.<br><br>11. Pre-primary, primary and secondary schools should all switch to full-day schools to keep students occupied for most of the day, while their parents can devote more time to work. They should also include sex education in the curriculum to prepare for the next generation of teen parents!<br><br>12. Shut POSBank down and re-purpose it. ItÂ’s already duplicating DBS services, so why not make it the Population Optimisation Sperm Bank? Pay interest for contributions, and provide insemination loans!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>13. Should teen parents have to get married? In our opinion, not really. HereÂ’s why:<br><br>a. The main aim is to boost the population, period.<br><br>b. Having kids between 16-20 means an alternative nuclear family with father or mother figures (in the form of grand or great-grandparents) is already available. However:<br><br>i. Either teen parent can have sole custody, if both parents consent.<br><br>ii. If the relationship cannot produce a consensus on custody, then the child will go to the family with the highest income.<br><br>iii. But the non-custodial family should retain regular visitation rights at all times, and will be asked to contribute either money or services to the childÂ’s upkeep.<br><br>c. The concern that teen parenthood may lead to a corresponding increase in the divorce rate is overstated. Nowadays, many married couples already have to live apart because of trans-global careers, so whatÂ’s the big difference? Divorce is part and parcel of life, so deal with it. The main concern is the impact of divorce on the child.<br><br>i. But we canÂ’t shield a child from all kinds of emotional trauma anyway, so we just have to get used to it.<br><br>ii. Anyway, the child of divorcing teen parents may not suffer as greatly because:<br><br>1. Suppose, following the pattern of the 7 year itch, teen parents who have a child at, say, 19, later divorce at 26. Since the primary caregivers would include not just parents, but also grandparents and even great-grandparents, the childÂ’s affections would be spread out. A break with one tier would produce less trauma because of the added buffer.<br><br>2. Also, should the teen parents divorce, these other tiers of caregivers, such as the grandparents, would already have spent a significant amount of time building a relationship with the child. At this time, the grandparents would be around 39 to over 47 in age, and would have settled into their careers, and would be able to provide the child with a relationship that is as supportive as any nuclear family we may recognize now.<br><br>3. Further, it may be good for the teen parents, who are now more mature, to move on to more mature relationships, and who knows? They may produce more children!<br><br>d. People just have to get used to this system of what we call Â“modular parentingÂ”.<br><br>e. Singapore is already full of bastards, whatÂ’s a few more?<br><br>14. In fact, why restrict teen pregnancy to just teens?<br><br>a. It is clear from court cases that male adults show a great interest in teenage females. Why not legitimize this practice by pairing off suitable male adults with teen brides? DonÂ’t waste resources!<br><br>b. The same principle can be applied in matching teen males with adult females, who can provide them more mature guidance in the art of love, not to mention the occasional free gift! A win-win situation.<br><br>c. Actually, we can also include foreign talent in this whole scheme. As long as the children become Singaporeans, who cares?<br><br>d. And if no one wants the children, look at the last point below:<br><br>15. If teens donÂ’t want to be burdened with children: never mind! The state can step in. The main thing is to get those babies. HereÂ’s how it can work:<br><br>a. Teens who canÂ’t cope with or donÂ’t want the children can drop them off at their nearest CDC (Child Deposit Centres) where either:<br><br>i. The children are paired off with willing families in the community;<br><br>or<br><br>ii. The state can raise them with all the very finest propaÂ… sorry, national education it can muster, until they enter the work force!<br><br>b. Why shouldnÂ’t the Gahmen take care of the children? After all, itÂ’s the Gahmen who really wants them, and itÂ’s thanks to the GahmenÂ’s Â“Two is EnoughÂ” campaign that our population problem is in such a big mess now.<br></div>
