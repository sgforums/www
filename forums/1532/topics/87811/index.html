            <div class='col-md body'>I'm writing this now, for I fear that I may lose my humanity one day. The beast in me is foul, and desires blood and flesh. It seeks the havoc to bleed many, to hurt many and I am jealous of its rage. It courts my heart, seeked to undermine my logical reasonings. I am afraid one day I lose control and will no longer be the person I am now. Dear me, I'm telling you that you must not let the beast roam the surface for he is ghastly. His actions will only throw you further into insanity. I am speaking to you through this to reflect before the hourglass runs too low. You must not let him know that I am weak. You must not show him my frail skeletal being, for he will take advantage of that. Heed me, I plea with you. I am forgiving but this beast will not be partial when unleashed. He must be chained, restrained and denied all chances to see the light of the world. Here I solemnly pledge in my oath that I will not falter should I face any problems and in that I want your word that he will be imprisoned and hidden away.<br><br>All in the name of goodness,<br>Utter Nonsense.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear me, I'm pleading again. I'm no usurper of throne. I thought I was fighting for the sake of justice, but the blood stains on my uniform cannot be removed. The beast is on a rampage, my mind losing its sanity and permeated by the evil thoughts that seeps through my veins. They speak ugly things about me, calling me many things which I am not. I am no heretic, nor do I challenge the lawful king for the throne. I served dutifully yet those rumour mongers spread words, lies, all lies that clouded the truth. The beast is enraged, and I fear the chains could not hold him. I am weary, and these people, men and women, will not stop until the lid on my coffin is nailed shut. The soul of the dead must be haunting me, for I am no less guilty of being a butcher. These ghosts of the past will not forgive me for the sins, and they will blind the eyes of those who should appreciate my efforts. They will continue till the beast consumes me, or I draw my last breathe. Heathen, I am called. Traitor, I am known. I hope you will give me peace from this.<br><br>All in the name of goodness,<br>Utter Nonsense.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest me, I am begging again. There is a shadow in my heart, it devours everything and everyone in my path, it is deeper than the fallen one as if it is the original emptiness of the material-less universe. There is no name, there is absolute emptiness within yet it exists deep within everything. I see it whenever I close my eyes, it is everything yet nothing. It is ageless, beyond the limitations of time. It tells me, it is the source of all material conflicting form, and what to come, which will to pass. There is no justice, there is no sanity, there is no world, for all is an illusion that will come and pass like spring to autumn. There is no throne, there is no beast, there is no king, there are no truth. Death is meaningless, so is life itself. I am not named, nor known, nor understood yet all that exists are lies my seed within.  I am the purest, the everlasting and the only answer and truth - There is nothing. Simply nothing. Let us return to that state, before any material was formed, before any words were spoken and actions delivered. Before there was light, shadow and you. It beckons me, it begged me, crying my heart out as if I was twisted beyond its recognition. Join me, I am not evil nor good, nor light nor dark.<br><br>All in the name of goodness,<br>Utter Cok Toker.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
