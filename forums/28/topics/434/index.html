            <div class='col-md body'>although people may think acp acs acj r the 1 of the best sch in sg then they r wrong. just becoz they r popular doesnt means they r gd. guys r the worest type &amp; guys r the flirtest kind. acj rank is only in the middle. they gd in sports becoz the sch is rich enough to get gd coaches &amp; students who r gd in sports pay alot to tt sch in order to get in. i cant say guys there r not charming stupid &amp; ugly but they r too proud of themselve. wait till 1 day they fall &amp; i will be the 1st to laugh at them. still gers like them just becoz they r fm acj! gers in acj are very chio &amp; i cannot say it's not true but so wat. there arent many scholars fm there, hardly a few. so wat's there to be proub of. it's is proub of been in tt fuck up sch or becoz they r fm rich family? gers are all flirt &amp; i guess most of u all r not virgin or have heavy petting with ur steads b4. even a ger fm srjc can go ntu/nus, so there's not to be proub of. so wat if u r rich, pretty/handsome &amp; smart! u all r only a nerd, flirt &amp; try to act cool only.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lonelyguy, all ru accusations are based on ur own personal opinions which i feel are very very objectable. i come from a neighbourhood school, yusof ishak in bukit batok and wen i first went into acj i also had that impression, but lemme tell u its not true. i dare u to go in there wif a open heart n mind n then u'll c fer urself. true some fo the acs(i) guys can be real arseholes but trust me they only make upa   minority. and its very obvious u probably got ditched by some acj ger or a ger tt's from acj, well...all i can sae is u're one big loser, go get a life lar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! I was from ACJC. Now in NUS. I don't think it is wise for anyone to berate a school - especially if you are not a student of the school. How the school is viewed from outside is not the same as what it really is inside.<br><br>I feel that ACJC is a wonderful school. The teachers are great! I even miss the fiercest teacher there - DK. The students are great too. Some of the nicest people I know are people from ACJC.<br><br>Not everyone in the school is rich... most of us get into the school on our own merit. Most of us have done well in the 'A's. I wouldn't judge a school by its ranking, because rankings don't tell the full story. But when you have students in the last class beating everyone to earn a place in the Medicine school in NUS, and others getting A1s for GPs after struggling with English... when you see teachers actively caring for and helping students in need... only then will you know what a lovely place ACJC is.<br></div>
