              <p class="standfirst"><em><strong style="display: block;">T</strong></em><strong style="display: block;">HE
              teenage son of Queensland's richest man Clive Palmer, and so-called
              ''sugar daddy" of the LNP, has won pre-selection at the next state
              election.</strong></p>
              <p><em>The billionaire iron ore magnate's 18-year-old son Michael will contest the seat of </em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nudgee</span></span></strong><em> on Brisbane's northside.<br> <br> His
              rise at the age of only 18 comes after the Bligh Government has
              furiously attacked his father over the past year for allegedly "buying"
              the new party.<br> <br> LNP headquarters has refused to deny receipt of
              donations from Mr Palmer ahead of compulsory disclosures in coming
              months but confirmed the party had used his helicopter and luxury DC-9
              jet.<br> <br> Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg yesterday denied the
              teenager had been given preferential treatment because of his dad's
              generosity.<br> <br> "I'm not going to count him out because he is Clive's son," he said.<br> <br>  "This is the politics of envy and personal character assassination from Labor."</em><br> <br> However,
              acting Premier Paul Lucas said the growing influence of Clive Palmer
              was "disturbing" and a reminder of the old Nationals under former
              premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.<br> <br> "T<em>he disturbing development is
              how one figure such as Mr Clive Palmer seemingly comes to dominate a
              party, from running and bankrolling conferences to supplying DC-9s," he
              said.<br> <br> "A DC-9 is a commercial passenger jet!"<br> <br> Michael
              Palmer was unavailable to comment yesterday but LNP state director
              Michael O'Dwyer said that the youngster won the seat uncontested
              through a normal selection process.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">The novice will battle Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts, who holds the Nudgee seat by a margin of 18 per cent.##</span><br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">He
              is involved in his father's new A-League soccer club on the Gold Coast
              but also dabbled in politics as an intern for revered US Senator Ted </span></em><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kennedy during last year's election.<br> <br> Mr O'Dwyer yesterday confirmed the party had used the jet and a helicopter but would not say how often.</span><br> <br>  He also refused to say whether or not Clive Palmer had donated any cash to the LNP.<br> <br> No
              larger donations have emerged under a new rule requiring donors of
              $100,000 or more to declare themselves within 14 days but other,
              smaller donations may surface under new half-yearly disclosures soon.<br> <br> "They are not details I am willing to divulge," Mr O'Dwyer said.<br> <br> "Clive has a back seat in all this."<br> <br> Mr
              Springborg insisted there was nothing wrong with using the chopper
              about 10 times to travel between Brisbane and his Darling Downs
              property.<br> <br> However, the Palmer connection has now claimed one
              scalp, with Mr Springborg admitting he had scrapped plans to use the
              jet during the election campaign because of Labor's focus on it.<br> <br> "It would have saved the taxpayers money but I don't want the campaign being hijacked," he said.</em>----EOQ</p>
