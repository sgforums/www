            <div class='col-md body'>or the toy u regretted never bought but when u went back sold out liao....<br><br>1. one of my rare catch: a die cast metal Mospeada Veritech (Red in color and transformable into the three modes).......but my bro spoil it by twisting/breaking it into two at the robot's hip....bought from Toys R US Parkway Parade when I was 8-9 yrs.....quite expensive $29.90/- twenty years back...never see it around the shops before.....who knows, could become a collector's item if it is not spoilt<br><br>2. A plastic "Rook" figure from the Mospeada series with her red cyclone. Transformable also into Rook's armour. Regretted never bought from Toys R US also. It was $14.90 I think.<br><br>Come to think of it...Toys R US Parkway last time got a section with red price tags which means offer price. Can usually get a lot of goodies there. Bought a chiong china made "Preceptor" Transformer there also. Identical to the original except it is black in color.<br><br></div>

I can never afford that ($199.95).<br><br>My most expensive series were the Decepticons predacons. Once Isetan had an offer and the Japan versions were selling for $19.90 each. Bought all except the lion (forgot the name liao) as I think it sold out. If not I can combine them to make bigger robot. I usually buy the main stream smaller ones....like insecticons, protectobots.....and I remembered u can cut out the points from the card board last time, go to seven eleven and exchange for transformer toys once u accumulated enuff.<br><br>I think Headmasters and Pretenders were pretty good.

Was it 9.90 or 11.90? coz it was small.<br><br>Soundwave I remembered not that cheap....it is bigger size, like its autobot counterpart Blaster who is also a radio. All I can afford are the small tapes which fit into their radio mode. I remember I have one small rhinoceros which belong to Blaster. If I not wrong the names of the decepticon tapes are Frenzy, Rumble, Lazerbeak, Ravage etc. Rumble and lazerbeak though very small but play big parts in the TV series. U can always see Rumble starting the attack on autobots by changing his hands into hammers that beat the ground. Lazerbeak too always start the attack with lazers shooting out from its eyes.<br><br>I enjoy the dinobots cartoon series on TV. Story was very good. But I never buy any of the toys becoz it is too expensive. I have nearly all the constructicons. Even bought two sets of chiong one which can combine into Devastator. But the chiong ones dun last long. Break easily.<br><br>I remembered the first 1st generation robots which can combine into bigger robot are the aerial bots. I only have one plane out of the five or six. Last time if we visit provision shop we can always buy transformer snap together toys for cheap. It is smaller size but I have fun assembling them. Always looking out for the new series. Of coz, they are made of inferior plastic and dun last long. But I always have a sense of accomplishments when I finish assembling and start pasting the decals on them.<br><br>Should have bought 1st gen Starscream. I think it can fetch a fortune now.</div>

When I was young, he was as tall as me.<br><br>Then there's this penguin that's blue in colour. I hugged this to sleep everyday. My parents not happy that I hugged it everyday, had it washed pretty regularly till it torn. Threw away.<br><br>There's another blue rabbit which I picked up from a rubbish bin. Brand new! Don't know why it was thrown away. Brought it back, and they threw it away while I wasn't around.<br><br>Gave away a bear that I shouldn't. It's one of the bears from Bossini, its name is Hope. I still missed it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
