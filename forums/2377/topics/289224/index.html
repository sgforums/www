            <div class='col-md body'>If you cheat and she's with you she's the one....to be dumped<br><br>That's my darkside telling you<br><br>My goodside is telling you:<br><br>ask God for a sign. But you must already have a close/intimate relationship with God to do that....I've personally never asked god for a sign for a mate though i did ask for a sign for something else.....and was given literally 3 seconds after i asked....so God does answer your request..no matter how silly it might be.<br><br>a bit of advice if you ask for a sign be sure to ask for one which leave no room(as little as possibe/statistically very improbable) for coincidence so you can be sure.<br><br>If the sign is given believe it otherwise you're testing God. Don't ask for more signs. One is enough.<br><br>And oh yea after you asked for a sign DO NOT DOUBT whether God would answer it otherwise you are testing God and God will not allow Himself to be tested. Your attitude must be: Waiting for God to give you the sign whatever that you asked before. If you think you have waited long enough and no sign is given that is the sign that was given: NO. Don't play when asking for sign. Be dead serious about it. Ask or don't ask never try to ask.<br><br>Do not think that asking for a sign is a must. A lot of times God makes the first moves(God always have the initiative) i.e, sign given to you before you asked. Most of the time through dream or vision in a dream that eventually happens.<br>Perhaps you see the one in that dream.<br><br>Or you can rely on your intuition if you are a straight man.</div>

I really second that. But if she cannot get along well with my family then i think I don't see any future ahead of us. I hope this won't happen to me, I really dread this kind of situation the most.
