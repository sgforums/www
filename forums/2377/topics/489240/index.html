But I am recently fired from my job after they found out that I am a Christian and anti ISIS!
              I did indicate on my Whatsapp status "A Christian who hates ISIS!". I think they had seen my Whatsapp status after they had added me into their group chat. Since then, I had very cold reception from my Malay colleagues till I am fired this week! It is a high chance I am persecuted because of my faith and ideology! But I do not find anything wrong with being anti ISIS as this vicious terror group has committed so many atrocites and last of all, being a Christian!
              I came to realize even though most malay muslims in Singapore are known to be moderate, they are silently supporting terrorism and jihad. If not, I will not lose my job suddenly after they had seen my Whatsapp status! 
              I did remember my malay classmates were happily rejoicing after the 9-11 terror attacks in my secondary school days. Besides the malay muslim leaders in Singapore perhaps under pressure, openly condemning the 9-11 attacks, none or few stood up to condemn the attack which claimed the lives of about 3,000 innocent people!
              It is not a pleasant experience working with malay people whom you do not share the same faith with! In their mind, they view you as an outcast or infidel(unbeliever) and you will be singled out for unfair treatment!</span></p>

              <p>Of course I knew everything! I am not stupid! The USA is the puppet master of all these wars in the Middle East. 9-11 was an inside job and Al Qaeda and ISIS was formed by the CIA to allow the government to continue selling weapons in these wars to make money and also part of the Illuminati's agenda to reduce the world's population.</p>
              <p>But such reasons are no excuse for ISIS to commit those crimes of pure wicknesses and muslims to stereotype us Christians and the Jews! They would rather be better to blame it on the American secret government which is responsible for this fiasco in the Middle East!</p>
