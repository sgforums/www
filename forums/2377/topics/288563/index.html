            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to quote wat spnw07 wrote at EH. I think many of us Christians here share the same sentiments too.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">After reading some hot comments posted by non-believers in EH, I would like to share with the forum something about my circle of friends.<br><br>Most of them are Christians of different denoms and I don't think I need to keep any distance away from them just because we don't believe in the same faith. But I'm aware of the reality that a certain psychological or spiritual distance will exist between us due to different doctrines and concepts taught in our faiths. And I'm ok with that.<br><br>Like what most Christians here have said, if you don't believe in the Biblical God, that's ok. No point challenging or persistently asking for answers that you know you can't hardly accept at all in the first place.<br><br>I'm not trying to lecture anyone and I have in no position to do that at all. I'm just trying to say that let's all try to do what most established world religions have in their core values: God loves all living beings, has told us to cultivate universal love and respect, and we just try to do that till we get near to God's standard.<br><br>Let free-thinkers be free thinkers, atheists be atheists and so on. BUT..please don't forget to learn how to be a human who knows how to respect differences in opinions and beliefs, even if loving strangers or maybe yourself is seemingly impossible at the moment.<br><br>I'm trying hard to achieve that. Hope I can succeed one day.  </span></div>

The stupid people will have to resort to name-calling when they lose. Name calling, you can totally ignore because that is just primary school mentality and nobody will say that "silence = consent or admittance of guilt" because everyone will recognize how stupid the one doing the name-calling is.<br><br>Like for example, they call you a "toad". Let them keep on calling and see if people think that "silence = consent or admittance of guilt" or they think that the name-caller has a primary school mentality.<br><br>But if they say, "when you say this and that, you, because you ignore that and that, you are sotong." "Sotong" in this case is not name calling because what it means is that you are blur and they have spelled out why they conclude that you are blur.<br><br>In the first instance, "toad" is name-calling because the name caller did not say why you are a toad, but the second is not name calling because it was a conclusion and the person explained how he came to that conclusion.<br><br>If the reasons are true, then "sotong" is true! If the reasons are not true, then "sotong" is not true!<br><br>They way I see it is that, there are many people that have no idea how to make a good argument, understand what a good argument is.<br><br>Those that are simply giving their opinions and without arguing why their opinions make sense (one-liner opinions) just ignore them.<br><br>They are anonymous nicks and who cares about their opinion when you have no way of knowing how they arrived at their opinions?<br><br>Those that take their opinions to heart are stupid people because they do not know how that chap came to his opinions.<br><br>Stupid people, you ignore.<br><br>I am sure that you can think of many examples, since you have been here a while, those that are incorrigible baseless opinion givers. Just ask them, why do you say that and it will shut them up.<br><br>If they dare to explain, it will expose their stupidity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no matter how skillful one defends oneself, as long as the opposing individual disagrees with the defences, because they cannot agree on any common points, the opposing individual will still resort to calling names like "delusional" and "bigoted"<br><br>andrew is one such individual, he calls anyone "delusional" as long as he does not agree with the arguments....<br><br>tge will resort to bigotry when he cannot even substantiate his claims....<br><br>so once such names start to appear, no need to discuss further liao. ignore and move on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best way to stop people from making trouble in forums is to not bother replying to their questions esp those on apologetics. They want, come meet me in real life, we go to church, kopi tiam, food court, restaurant, KFC or whatever to talk. No meet, no talk haha! So I think just leave the forum open and just do leisure talking. For those who are interested in apologetics or got questions about the christian faith, PM or arrange to meet up. And then EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPY! Except for those who will then have nothing to do because no more place to for them to antagonise people liao ahah!</div>
