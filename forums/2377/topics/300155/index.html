The heresy of indifferentism - everyone who utters Lord Lord will be saved despite contradictory teachings - is a flawed teaching that has been rejected by Catholics, Church Fathers and Protestant Reformers.

The issue is not whether one expressed a believe in Christ to be saved, but does this person have a repentent heart to go with the desire to follow Christ.<br><br>Had Hitler repented, he will be saved. No one need to be happy about it. Salvation is a personal thing, it has nothing to do with what other people thing.</div>

You WILL GET, however, a myriad of confusing answers.<br><br>Since Catholics and Protestants are the two groups you'd highlighted, allow me to further classify these two groups into contemporary and liturgical. Among the protestants you will need to go down to the level of denomination focused, or non-denomination.<br><br>Depending who you are asking, I am sure you will have received different opinions. The practical way is to go to a church you think you are comfortable with and try it out. The "Christian" answer is: pray about it and allow God to direct you.</div>

Will hitler (a christian) be saved? </div></blockquote>hmm.. i believe that grace is unfair in nature.<br><br>i mean, yeah you can berate that God is unfair for loving Hitler even though he caused so much suffering. But all of us have done the same thing wat.<br><br>Surely we have bore unkind thoughts to many people throughout our lives. To God, that's as good as murder. Surely we have lusted after girls in our thoughts. To God that's as good as adultery.<br><br>A wrongdoing is a wrongdoing. Even though you can't compare to the atrocities of Hitler, but we're no angels ourselves.<br><br>What if one day you made a terrible mistake and caused someone to commit suicide?<br><br>What if one day you made a terrible mistake and while arguing with someone, you accidentally killed him?<br><br>What if one day you really make a mistake of really participating in a murder?<br><br>Would you like it if God decided you're not good enough for Him to save you?<br><br>The same love that God gives a mass murderer, is the same love He shows to you as well. He loves you not because of what you do or never do, He loves you just because He does, so you will never need to worry if you're good enough.<br><br>So yes, I do agree that it does seem unfair that God forgives Hitler, and loves him too. But in a way, it is fair, because if God loves Hitler so much, He loves me that much too. And that's alot of love to give  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
