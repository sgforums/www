            <div class='col-md body'>I think the figure/model shops scene is abit like sim lim square... it pays to look around.  When most of the shops have the same item, everyone sells at a competitve rate.  However when that piece is sold out the shop that still has it will usually jack up the price sky high.  Also some shops are quite dishonest.  One of the shops I called on the phone quoted me a price for an item...but when i actually went down to pick it up he increased the price by 5$.  Naturally I did not buy and won't be buying from that shop if I can help it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by laoda99:<br>no wonder sunshine plaza very deserted.....<br></blockquote>Yeah, some of them have attitude problems.  Like don't even want to reveal the price on the phone etc...  They can't seem to understand that customers need to know the price before deciding whether to buy or not. Instead they want you to come down waste time/travelling cost then offer you a price based on whether they like your face or not.</div>
