              <li>Improved labour climate and investment environment by enacting the 
              Employment Act to lay down standards of employment to help resolve industrial 
              disputes. In addition, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and National 
              Wage Council (NWC) also helped to promote better labour-management relations.

              <li>A more mature economy with slower growth. </li>
              <li>Resource constraints more binding and faster rising costs. </li>
              <li>More intense competition, from both developed and developing countries. </li>
              <li>Relatively low technology base on a global basis. <br><br></li>
              </ul>
              <span>Developmental Strategies</span> <br><br> 
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Deepen Technology Base</strong><br>The Government took the lead in catalysing 
              the development of technology. We committed $2 billion from 1991 to 1995 under 
              the National Technology Plan and another $4 billion under the National Science 
              and Technology Plan from 1996 to 2000. <br> </li>
              <li><strong>Cluster Development</strong><br>Industrial strategy was refined to leverage on 
              synergies at the firm and industry levels. Mutually supporting industries were 
              identified and developed to entrench entire clusters niche areas, e.g. 
              electronics, petrochemical and engineering. By competing on the basis of 
              clusters, we could formulate cluster development plans with emphasis on core 
              capabilities that were common to industries within the cluster. <br></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Promoting Manufacturing and Services as Twin Pillars of the 
              Economy</strong><br>To diversify our sectoral and market dependency, reduce 
              vulnerability, and promote a broader base for the economy, services were 
              promoted together with manufacturing as twin pillars of the economy. For this 
              purpose, many incentives offered for manufacturing investments, e.g. pioneer 
              status, investment allowances, were also extended to investments in service 
              sectors.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Regionalisation</strong><br>The Government encouraged leveraging on the 
              potential of the Asian markets in order to overcome local resource/market 
              constraints and complement our established links to the OECD countries. </li>

              <ul>
              <li>The Singapore economy was hit by the regional crisis that started with the 
              devaluation of the Thai Baht in July 1997. Although our financial and economic 
              fundamentals were sound, the rapidly deteriorating external environment 
              adversely affected Singapore due to our close linkages with the regional 
              economies. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>The Singapore economy contracted 1.4 % in 1998, after achieving 8.3 % growth 
              in 1997. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>After picking up in 1999-2000, Singapore was hit by another recession in 
              2001. The synchronised downturns in the major developed economies as well as the 
              global electronics industry led to a sharp deceleration in global growth. The 
              terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September further aggravated the slowdown. As 
              a result, the Singapore economy fell by 2.4 %, down from 10 % growth in 2000. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>The rise of large new players like China and India brings both challenges

              <li>Singapore aims to become a globalised, entrepreneurial and diversified 
              economy, with economic growth of 4-6 % p.a. over the medium term. <br></li>

              <li><strong>Expanding external ties</strong> - embracing globalisation through the

              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Maintaining competitiveness and flexibility</strong> - keeping the burden of 
              taxes and the Central Provident Fund on the economy as low as possible, 
              reviewing the labour market and wage system to make them more flexible, and 
              pricing factors of production competitively. <br></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Promoting entrepreneurship and domestic companies</strong> - encouraging 
              people to be innovative and improving the ability of firms to develop new ideas 
              and businesses, tap new export markets and broaden the economic base. 
              <br></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Growing manufacturing and services</strong> - upgrading these sectors by 
              improving cost competitiveness, equipping the labour force with relevant skills, 
              and developing new capabilities and industries. <br></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Developing human capital</strong> - investing in education, helping workers 
              train and upgrade, and welcoming global talent to augment the indigenous talent 
              pool. </li>
