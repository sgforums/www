Just because a majority of Singaporeans now are more focused on the material side of life doesn't mean they are unable or will never be able to appreciate the arts.<br><br>Besides art doesn't only refer to big money fine arts like in your post.  It is all-encompassing , more liberal and wider than you think, including things like popular culture, traditional and cultural arts, visual, audio and performance.<br><br>There's no right or wrong way to appreciate art.  People are moved by things they see or hear; art affects the emotions and the mind. One doesn't have to justify or explain individual preference and appreciation.

It is all-encompassing , more liberal and wider than you think, including things like popular culture, traditional and cultural arts, visual, audio and performance.<br><br>There's no right or wrong way to appreciate art.  People are moved by things they see or hear; art affects the emotions and the mind. One doesn't have to justify or explain individual preference and appreciation.  And I think that's the beauty of it.<br></div></blockquote>Noooooooooooo...I am not belittling my fellow country men and women. Did it sound that way???<br><br>You forgot that I am actually saying "I don't understand why people can appreciate art". I am saying I am too simple to appreciate the arts <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am saying people that appreciates arts are trying to make people think they are complex. They are trying to differentiate themselves from the simple people. Like leaving the HDB and moving in to a condo...and rub shoulders with the ang mors....</div>

Reason - to see them in the flesh. Same with football fans willing to go all the way to Old Trafford or Anfield to watch their team.<br><br>But...go watch man in tights and bulging LP doing the swan lake...Why would anyone want to prefer these things over the simpler enjoyments in life.
