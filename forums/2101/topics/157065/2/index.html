How does that alienate the public?<br><br>Isn't traditional Chinese opera that largely appeals to the senior citizen population, art too?<br><br>If you're feeling awed by art that you don't understand or dislike, don't.  As in my previous post, there's no need for justification for what one likes or dislikes, understands or not.<br><br>Art appreciation is personal and entirely individualistic.

People who do it because they love doing it...These are the artist. I can understand how they must feel...Believe me, I know how much they care for what they do.<br><br>I actually really pity them having to live in a country like ours.<br><br>The Chinese troupe you mentioned...well it just proof my point futher. The arts going public here are selective about what the go see. Do you think a 'famous' show from broadway will have the same problem of not selling the tickets. I doubt it. Mention the name broadway...and people will rush <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to be seen </span>entering the theather.<br><br></div>

Because I suspect there are people who goes to these arts performance just because it is fashionable. Just like F| had pointed out in one of her post  - "those people that go there and end up groaning or sleeping bcos they are forced to be there". Forcing themselves to love the arts just because all 'high society' people love arts too.<br></div>
