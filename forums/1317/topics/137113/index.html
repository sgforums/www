            <div class='col-md body'>Dads Will Be Dads<br>By Susan M. Lang<br><br>While I was pregnant with my first child, sweltering through the endless, fiery<br>summer months in which ankles swelled and sweat poured forth profusely,<br>I wanted only one thing - to give birth.<br><br>"I can't wait until this child is out," I would huff and puff in frustration.<br><br>My husband lovingly reassured me that the baby would spring forth at the<br>appointed time. That some day I would be free from the burden of the added<br>weight and the painful swollen ankles. I, however, felt as if the child had taken<br>up permanent residence.<br><br>"Suppose the kid likes it in here and doesn't want to leave," I would say.<br><br>"Highly unlikely, dear. The baby will be here before you know it," he insisted, his<br>feet still grounded firmly in reality, while mine were constantly elevated.<br><br>As it turned out, when my water broke that fateful evening, I was shocked into<br>reality. Our first daughter did leave the womb and enter the atmosphere. She<br>even arrived three weeks early.<br><br>When Mary was born, I was overjoyed. Not only was it a relief to hold her tiny<br>body in my arms, but she was a red-headed beauty. Even when she was minutes<br>old, I felt that we had a unique attachment. And we did, for she had been a<br>part of me. However, what I didn't anticipate was how difficult it would be to<br>let her go.<br><br>For those nine months that seemed like an eternity, the baby had been mine<br>. . . all mine. She was joined with me and depended on only me for survival.<br>Even though Tom could feel her kick through the womb as she grew bigger,<br>I usually had to notify him that she was moving. He depended on me to tell him<br>what the baby was doing. The communication that Mary and I had was ours<br>alone. Now, she was in the world and I had to share her with others. Including<br>her dad.<br><br>Now, it's not that I didn't trust him. My husband is a compassionate husband<br>and father. It's just that he doesn't do things the way that I do them.<br><br>He held the baby differently. I cradled her close, showing her my maternal love.<br>He held her facing outward so she would have a world view. He transported her<br>differently. I carried her in my arms from room to room as I tidied up. He placed<br>her in the stroller and rolled her around so that he could put things away and still<br>keep an eye on her. He comforted her differently. I rocked her quietly to calm<br>her; he bounced her. He even fed her differently. I breast-fed her at 2:00 a.m.<br>He bottle-fed her at 2:00 p.m. (Okay, so I can't hold biology against the poor<br>guy.) It's just that it was difficult to accept that someone could relate to Mary<br>in another way. Undoubtedly, I was very insecure, and sharing her was hard.<br>Even with her dad.<br><br>Of course, there was the time that I was downstairs in the basement office for<br>a while working on a project. It was Dad's time to watch his little girl. As I<br>reached the top of the steps after finishing my work, he asked, "Where's Mary?"<br><br>"What do you mean, where is Mary?" I screamed.<br><br>"I thought you had her," he said nonchalantly. "Don't worry, I'll find her." He<br>had placed her on the living-room floor for a moment and then inadvertently<br>turned his back. We began our search there. As it turned out, she had crawled<br>over to the floor-length picture window and was hiding behind the drapes.<br>We found her giggling in delight at the birds on the front lawn and at the cars<br>passing by. It was the first time that she had crawled. I seldom placed her on<br>the floor, but Tom liked to give her room to stretch and play. No harm was done,<br>in fact just the opposite. Our baby had reached a new point in her life because<br>my husband, her dad, had let her expand her horizons.<br><br>During all those months of pregnancy while I complained, I never imagined how<br>difficult it would be to let her go once she was born. For me, it was the first<br>test of motherhood - to let Dad be Dad. To realize that someone else could<br>nurture my child in his own way. And to realize that what he had to give her,<br>I couldn't give.<br><br>That is the beauty of parenting. That each mother and each father has a<br>unique contribution. That our babies need the distinctive love and nurture that<br>each one of us has to offer. And it pays off, too. By the time our second child<br>was on the way, Mary was two years old. She and her dad had a wonderful<br>relationship forged by the variety of experiences which they alone had shared.<br><br>After our youngest child, Kristi, arrived, I was able to give my husband more<br>freedom - and space - in his distinctive parenting techniques. I, too, had grown.<br>And, I had learned from his parenting style, even as he had learned from mine.<br>After all, we were a team.<br><br>"Well, they're all yours," I declared one day as I headed for the office.<br><br>"Aren't you just a little worried?" he teased.<br><br>"No, just remember to check behind the drapes if the baby disappears," I laughed.<br>"Besides," I added, "you've got everything under control."</div>
