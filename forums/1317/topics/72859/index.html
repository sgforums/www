            <div class='col-md body'>Hehehe... some of you may know that I was a party bus driver. Had a 12 seater bus with everyone loaded on. And guess what?<br><br>One of my friends rocked up with his 17 year old girlfriend.. even though everyone told him there was no room in the bus. AND TWO WE HATE HER AND DON'T WANT TO HANG AROUND A 17 YEAR OLD AT PUBS AND CLUBS.<br>Anyway..  he met us at the beach. So we got on the bus and she sat on the FLOOR of the bus. Which really pissed me off cos as the driver, i'm responsible for the safety of everyone. As in, they have to wear the seatbelts and i can't overload the bus.<br><br>Went to a pub... she was having martini or whatever. Went to another, hoping that they will check for ID. AND THEY DIDN'T. After one of the girls had one too many shots. She went off to tell the bouncer that we had someone underaged in our group. She had someone else's ID and she got off the hook. Then another girl told the bouncer that there is no way that there is her ID and said she knew for a fact, she is still in school. So.. the bouncer marched her out of the pub. Consequently, we had a mixed group of relieved people and guilty people. We were kind of guilty that we kicked someone out.<br><br>Hmm...what do you people think? Isn't it wong for a 17 year old to think that she can come and hang around us 24-26 year old people. And after we kept hinting that there is no room and there is no way that we want her to come into the pubs/clubs with us. And the birthday boy said there was no way she was allowed to come.<br><br>Was it mean? I'm sorta glad she got kicked out. But now i'm afraid that she will know if was one of us to told the bouncers. Oh well..</div>

And she is the one who told me that i will be attached to my first car -&gt;&gt; Like how would she know? And everytime someone says something, she must say something to contradict and argue to ad nauseum. Please.. she even got me arguing about Aussie Rules footy.. even when it is so blatant and obvious that she is wrong. I don't know the full details cos i was in another section. But someone stumbled in, told us the news.. all of us was hugging cos we got rid of her. Problem is she thinks probably thinks that we are friends with her! Dunno why she tried to borrow someone's ID to get in. URGH.</div>
