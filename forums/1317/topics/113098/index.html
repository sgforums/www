            <div class='col-md body'>When You Divorce Me, Carry Me Out in Your Arms<br><br>On my wedding day, I carried my wife in my arms. The<br>bridal car stopped in front of our one-room flat. My<br>buddies insisted that I carry her out of the car in my<br>arms. So I carried her into our home. She was then<br>plump and shy. I was a strong and happy bridegroom.<br><br>This was the scene of ten years ago.<br><br>The following days were as simple as a cup of pure<br>water: we had a kid,?I went into business and tried to<br>make more money. When the assets were steadily<br>increasing, the affections between us seemed to ebb.<br>She was a civil servant. Every morning we left home<br>together and got home almost at the same time. Our kid<br>was studying in a boarding school.<br><br>Our marriage life seemed to be enviably happy. But the<br>calm life was more likely to be affected by<br>unpredictable changes.<br><br>Dew came into my life.<br><br>It was a sunny day. I stood on a spacious balcony. Dew<br>hugged me from behind. My heart once again was<br>immersed in her stream of love. This was the apartment<br>I bought for her.<br><br>Dew said,?You are the kind of man who best draws<br>girls. Her words suddenly reminded me of my wife. When<br>we just married, my wife said,?Men like you, once<br>successful, will be very attractive to girls.?Thinking<br>of this, I became somewhat hesitant. I knew I had<br>betrayed my wife. But I couldn' t help doing so.<br><br>I moved Dew's hands aside and said,?You go to select<br>some furniture, O.K.? I 've got something to do in the<br>company.?Obviously she was unhappy, because I had<br>promised her to go and see with her. At the moment,<br>the idea of divorce became clearer in my mind although<br>it used to be something impossible to me.<br><br>However, I found it rather difficult to tell my wife<br>about it. No matter how mildly I mentioned it to her,<br>she would be deeply hurt. Honestly, she was a good<br>wife. Every evening she was busy preparing dinner. I<br>was sitting in front of the TV. The dinner was ready<br>soon. Then we watched TV together. Or, I was lounging<br>before the computer, visualizing Dew's body. This was<br>the means of my entertainment.<br><br>One day I said to her in a slight joking way,?suppose<br>we divorce, what will you do??She stared at me for a<br>few seconds without a word. Apparently she believed<br>that?divorce?was something too far away from her. I<br>couldn' t imagine how she would react once she got to<br>know I was serious.<br><br>When my wife went to my office, Dew had just stepped<br>out. Almost all the staff looked at my wife with a<br>sympathetic eye and tried to hide something while<br>talking with her. She seemed to have got some hint.<br>She gently smiled at my subordinates. But I read some<br>hurt in her eyes.<br><br>Once again, Dew said to me,?Divorce her, O.K.? Then we<br>live together.?I nodded. I knew I could not hesitate<br>any more.<br><br>When my wife served the last dish, I held her hand.?I<br>'ve got something to tell you,?I said.<br><br>She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the<br>hurt in her eyes. Suddenly I didn' t know how to open<br>my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was<br>thinking.?I want to divorce.?I raised a serious topic<br>calmly.<br><br>She didn t seem to be much annoyed by my words,<br>instead she asked me softly,?why??I'm serious.?I<br>avoided her question. This so-called answer turned her<br>angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at<br>me,?you are not a man! .<br><br>At that night, we didn t talk to each other. She was<br>weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had<br>happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her<br>a satisfactory answer, because my heart had gone to<br>Dew.<br><br>With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce<br>agreement which stated that she could own our house,<br>our car, and 30% stake of my company. She glanced at<br>it and then tore it into pieces. I felt a pain in my<br>heart.?The woman who had been living ten years with me<br>would become a stranger one day. But I could not take<br>back what I had said.<br><br>Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was<br>what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually<br>a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had<br>obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and<br>clearer.<br><br>A late night, I came back home after entertaining my<br>clients. I saw her writing something at the table. I<br>fell asleep fast. When I woke up, I found she was<br>still there. I turned over and was asleep again.<br><br>She brought up her divorce conditions: she didn t want<br>anything from me, but I was supposed to give her one<br>month's time before divorce, and in the month's time<br>we must live as normal life as possible. Her reason<br>was simple: our son would finish his summer vacation a<br>month later and she didnt want him to see our marriage<br>was broken.<br><br>She passed me the agreement she drafted, and then<br>asked me,?Do you still remember how I entered our<br>bridal room on the wedding day?<br><br>This question suddenly brought back all those<br>wonderful memories to me. I nodded and said,?I<br>remember .?You carried me in your arms , she<br>continued,?so, I have a requirement, that is, you<br>carry me out in your arms on the day when we divorce.<br>&gt;From now to the end of this month, you must carry me<br>out from the bedroom to the door every morning.<br><br>I accepted with a smile. I knew she missed those sweet<br>days and wished to end her marriage with a romantic<br>form.<br><br>I told Dew about my wife s divorce conditions. She<br>laughed loudly and thought it was absurd.?No matter<br>what tricks she does, she has to face the result of<br>divorce,?she said scornfully. Her words more or less<br>made me feel uncomfortable.<br><br>My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my<br>divorce intention was explicitly expressed. We even<br>treated each other as a stranger. So when I carried<br>her out for the first day, we both appeared clumsy.<br>Our son clapped behind us,?daddy is holding mummy in<br>his arms.?His words brought me a sense of pain. From<br>the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I<br>walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed<br>her eyes and said softly,?Let us start from today, don<br>t tell our son.?I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I<br>put her down outside the door. She went to wait for<br>bus, I drove to office.<br><br>On the second day, both of us acted much more easily.<br>She leaned on my chest. We were so close that I could<br>smell the fragrance of her blouse.?I realized that I<br>hadn' t looked at this intimate woman carefully for a<br>long time. I found she was not young any more. There<br>were some fine wrinkles on her face.<br><br>On the third day, she whispered to me,?The outside<br>garden is being demolished. Be careful when you pass<br>there.<br><br>On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I seemed to<br>feel that we were still an intimate couple and I was<br>holding my sweetheart in my arms. The visualization of<br>Dew became more vague.<br><br>On the fifth and sixth day, she kept reminding me<br>something, such as, where she put the ironed shirts, I<br>should be careful while cooking, etc.?I nodded. The<br>sense of intimacy was even stronger.<br><br>I didn t tell Dew about this.<br><br>I felt it was easier to carry her. Perhaps the<br>everyday workout made me stronger. I said to her,?It<br>seems not difficult to carry you now.<br><br>She was picking her dresses. I was waiting to carry<br>her out. She tried quite a few but could not find a<br>suitable one. Then she sighed,?All my dresses have<br>grown fatter.?I smiled. But I suddenly realized that<br>it was because she was thinner that I could carry her<br>more easily, not because I was stronger. I knew she<br>had buried all the bitterness in her heart. Again, I<br>felt a sense of pain. Subconsciously I reached out a<br>hand to touch her head.<br><br>Our son came in at the moment.?Dad, it's time to carry<br>mum out.?He said. To him, seeing his father carrying<br>his mother out had been an essential part of his life.<br>She gestured our son to come closer and hugged him<br>tightly. I turned my face because I was afraid I would<br>change my mind at the last minute. I held her in my<br>arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting<br>room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck<br>softly and naturally. I held her body tightly, as if<br>we came back to our wedding day. But her much lighter<br>weight made me sad.<br><br>On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could<br>hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. She<br>said,?Actually I hope you will hold me in your arms<br>until we are old.<br><br>I held her tightly and said,?Both you and I didn t<br>notice that our life was lack of such intimacy.<br><br>I jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the<br>door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my<br>decision. I walked upstairs. Dew opened the door. I<br>said to her,?Sorry, Dew, I won't divorce. I'm serious.<br><br>She looked at me, astonished. The she touched my<br>forehead.?You got no fever.?She said. I moved her hand<br>off my head.?Sorry, Dew,?I said,?I can only say sorry<br>to you, I won t divorce. My marriage life was boring<br>probably because she and I didn t value the details of<br>life, not because we didn t love each other any more.<br>Now I understand that since I carried her into the<br>home, she gave birth to our child, I am supposed to<br>hold her until I am old. So I have to say sorry to<br>you.<br><br>Dew seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud<br>slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I<br>walked downstairs and drove to the office.<br><br>When I passed the floral shop on the way, I ordered a<br>bouquet for my wife which was her favourite. The<br>salesgirl asked me to write the greeting words on the<br>card. I smiled and wrote,?I 'll carry you out every<br>morning until we are old.</div>
