            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed, threads based on raw emotion should die.<br><br>I'm not exactly sure about how Don's "observations" can be considered actual observations considering they are heavily coloured.<br><br>Considering that some unbalanced individuals can make the exact same "observations" as her and conclude that women are rather stupid for submitting to such situtations rather then respond to them and hence justify the ill-treatment of women. But I certainly don't subscribe to them.<br><br>And I certainly do not accept the fact that if she's implying that if "many" (many as in how many? what percentage?) women go through this at some point of their lives, this would mean that many men are in her books defined as rotten. This is obviously hardly based in reality.<br><br>I have of course noticed a large number of relationships in which the girl was treating the guy as nothing more then a wallet and was being extremely unfaithful, but you don't see me denouncing all ladies as "unfaithful cows". This is because I prefer to use something called objectivity.<br><br>Of course, I was probably asking and expecting too much when I was waiting for a logical response, but at least she had the common courtesy to bother to post a rolling eye emoticon in response, indicating her unwillingness to engage in logical banter.<br><br>But I know one thing. Emotions can make you say whatever you want to say and ignore whatever you want to ignore, and of course, post as many rolling eye emotioncons as you want, but at the end of the day, it is logic that refuses to be bent to our will, and if you choose to ignore it, it'll raise up to bite you in the butt sooner or later.<br><br>It is however obvious that no matter what personal issue Don may have, that her personal conclusions on the general nature of men is grossy wrong. And at the end of the day that's that. Wrong's wrong and no amount of screaming is going to change that.</div>

Agreed, some or most of what she has said are heavily colored &amp; opinionated but that is exactly as it should be since it's based on what she went through? I too would like to know wat's behind all that rage and bitternes but if she's not going to divulge, let's just respect her privacy?

NO, they ask for more and do things that does injustice to the love these women give. these women are willing to be 'victims' in hope the men of their life is happy and well, are they really victims then? i may agree they are silly but never victims. it takes a lot of selfless-ness and love to sacrific the way they did.<br><br>i am woman as that is wat is on my birth ceritificate. i don't believe in all that mambo jumbo about gal power and equality. what i believe is to treat the one you love with love. if you don't love her, please don't even start. if you don't know how to love her, think and ask. if you expect the gal to be faithful, you have to be faithful. if you intend to fool around, you better let your other half know and be prepared you will get the same treatment.<br><br>i never said all guys are against me. even if they are i don't care. i am not bothered with scum.<br><br>a gentleman will automatically treat a lady well and with respect. if there are such gentlemen around then there will be no need for screamings and aunt agnoys.<br><br></div></blockquote>Do not blindly apply extremism. It is extremely bad for health. If you want to support feminism, then please be prudent and know the cause you are supporting.<br><br>Not all relationships are the guy's fault. Although we always hear stories about how the guy is a jerk, think a lot of people don't realise that there are men who suffer in relationships too. But usually, guys would not voice out. Act tough and suffer in silence.  Girls find it easier to share their emotional distress. Guys tend to try and maintain pride.<br><br>You have only seen girls go to extremes, well I have seen guys go to extremes. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.<br><br>There is no guy against you here, and it's not that we're here to defend men either. It's just that you are taking too extreme a stand. Basically, jumping to conclusions. Understand you are pissed, but wildly throwing tantrums isn't helping anyone either.<br><br>It's not true that Aunt Agony is only for girls. Guys write to Aunt Agony. Do not let your anger blind you from truth and facts. You say you write about what evil deeds guys do but is it all guys? You say you voice out what a lot of women go through but is it all women who feel that way? Those who are happy in their relationships wouldn't be angry and wouldn't have anything to speak out against, don't you think?<br><br>The guy who made you angry is definitely a jerk for having done what he did, but branding all guys as creep isn't fair to the good guys out there. Think about it, maybe there was some guy who you met who can be truly faithful, maybe a guy who will never lie nor cheat on you. But you're not with him because you rejected him.<br><br>I'm not trying to shift the blame on you or anything, just saying there are nice guys out there. Just that maybe you've not met them or given them a chance. Be fair to them. Don't generalise. What would you say if a guy has been badly hurt in a relationship and because of that one girl, he brands all girls are b*itches?<br><br>Anyway, you can choose to forget this guy and carry on with your life. Especially after he's been such a emotional burden to you afterall. A true love shouldn't have to hurt like you said. You could just move on, forget the creep, and stop letting him affect your life.</div>

Well, this is the <strong>patriarchal </strong> society.<br><br>I noe men like women with figure. but why most women are so crazed abt slimming stuff like "extrim"?<br><br>That's becos WOmen are getting infantized (meaning: being looked upon and treated like a child) all the time. You ppl noe why every female are crazy abt slimming pills and stuff like tt?<br><br>Most (I said most becoz not all are) of these females are actually victims of patriarchal school of thots, without even being conscious of it themselves.
