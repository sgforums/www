[/quote]<br><br>Maybe you would like some of the burnt gentlemen here to state facts about what women can do? And then refuse any kind of logic you try to put into them? Like you?<br><br><blockquote><strong>women who love their men often suffer in silence. victims? yes they are! in order to keep a r/s, i've seen some extremes gal are willing to go. all these just so the men is happy. but are they? NO, they ask for more and do things that does injustice to the love these women give. these women are willing to be 'victims' in hope the men of their life is happy and well, are they really victims then? i may agree they are silly but never victims. it takes a lot of selfless-ness and love to sacrific the way they did.</strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>Isn't that the classic victim mentality? In the end it still takes two hands to clap. If abused ladies insist on staying in abusive relationships with half-witted neandertals because they want their partner to be happy, then it's their funeral and choice isn't it?<br><br>If it's their sacrifice is so selfless and loving, then why on earth are you complaining about it? After all, there are plenty of exit routes from such a situtation and they by personal choice, are choosing to stay in it. This is hardly selfless love I'm afraid, it is a show of emotional dependancy, disfunction and depravity on the girls' part to stay in such a destructive relationship.<br><br>What did they expect? That such a person will treat them better with time? I'm afraid this is the real world. If you cannot take responsibility for your own situtation, or worse, decide to stay in their mire when they can jolly well escape, it's their own fault as much as it is their abusive partner.<br><br>What's more tragic is that there are plenty of gentlemen out there who know how to honour their partners that can treat these girls better but they are being demonized because of their neandertal counterparts.<br><br>As long as you refuse to take responsibility and actions for your situtation and yet insist that things change for you, don't expect much sympaty to your opinions, for they are clearly biased and illogical, based more on emotions then logic.<br><br>Yep, the true victim mentality.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>i am woman as that is wat is on my birth ceritificate. i don't believe in all that mambo jumbo about gal power and equality. what i believe is to treat the one you love with love. if you don't love her, please don't even start. if you don't know how to love her, think and ask. if you expect the gal to be faithful, you have to be faithful. if you intend to fool around, you better let your other half know and be prepared you will get the same treatment.</strong></div></blockquote>Isn't that great? The perfect solution then? The problem with plenty of girls is that they go into a relationship with a shifty character with all heart and no brains, take no measures to guard themselves, and then blame everything when things fall apart.<br><br>Why would a girl get into a relationship with a guy that does not honor her? And worse, why on earth would she want to stay in one when it is obvious that the person treats her no more then a plaything? There is no emotional bond or relationship, it is an unhealthy emotional dependancy.<br><br>When you can't quit smoking just by blaming the sticks, citing great moral ideas and systems and then take no action yourself.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>i never said all guys are against me. even if they are i don't care. i am not bothered with scum.</blockquote></div>That's your problem you see. By refusing to see things as they really are, and keep shooting from your own biased point of view, you will never see the truth and hence hit the wrong people. For all your screaming, I doubt you served anything other then to tell a S.O.B.S of an emotionally damaged, dependent lady who blames everything but herself.<br><br>Plenty of solutions are already there, and as any social worker can tell you, mindlessly screaming nonsense about men is hardly one of them. If you want to contuine to get burned by fire by standing close to it citing tales of selfless love ironically at the same time hurling abuse at the very thing you are supposed to "love" selflessly, then be my guest.<br><br><strong>[quote]a gentleman will automatically treat a lady well and with respect. if there are such gentlemen around then there will be no need for screamings and aunt agnoys.</strong>Oh, so what are you implying exactly? That they do not exist?<br><br>Let me put your amazingly flawed logic to the test:<br><br>A good doctor will automatically treat a patient well and heal him. If there were such doctors around then there will be nobody dying and suffering.<br><br>Nuff said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Please...<br></strong></div>

And then refuse any kind of logic you try to put into them? Like you?<br><br>Isn't that the classic victim mentality? In the end it still takes two hands to clap. If abused ladies insist on staying in abusive relationships with half-witted neandertals because they want their partner to be happy, then it's their funeral and choice isn't it?<br><br>If it's their sacrifice is so selfless and loving, then why on earth are you complaining about it? After all, there are plenty of exit routes from such a situtation and they by personal choice, are choosing to stay in it. This is hardly selfless love I'm afraid, it is a show of emotional dependancy, disfunction and depravity on the girls' part to stay in such a destructive relationship.<br><br>What did they expect? That such a person will treat them better with time? I'm afraid this is the real world. If you cannot take responsibility for your own situtation, or worse, decide to stay in their mire when they can jolly well escape, it's their own fault as much as it is their abusive partner.<br><br>What's more tragic is that there are plenty of gentlemen out there who know how to honour their partners that can treat these girls better but they are being demonized because of their neandertal counterparts.<br><br>As long as you refuse to take responsibility and actions for your situtation and yet insist that things change for you, don't expect much sympaty to your opinions, for they are clearly biased and illogical, based more on emotions then logic.<br><br>Yep, the true victim mentality.<br><br>Isn't that great? The perfect solution then? The problem with plenty of girls is that they go into a relationship with a shifty character with all heart and no brains, take no measures to guard themselves, and then blame everything when things fall apart.<br><br>Why would a girl get into a relationship with a guy that does not honor her? And worse, why on earth would she want to stay in one when it is obvious that the person treats her no more then a plaything? There is no emotional bond or relationship, it is an unhealthy emotional dependancy.<br><br>When you can't quit smoking just by blaming the sticks, citing great moral ideas and systems and then take no action yourself.<br><br>That's your problem you see. By refusing to see things as they really are, and keep shooting from your own biased point of view, you will never see the truth and hence hit the wrong people. For all your screaming, I doubt you served anything other then to tell a S.O.B.S of an emotionally damaged, dependent lady who blames everything but herself.<br><br>Plenty of solutions are already there, and as any social worker can tell you, mindlessly screaming nonsense about men is hardly one of them. If you want to contuine to get burned by fire by standing close to it citing tales of selfless love ironically at the same time hurling abuse at the very thing you are supposed to "love" selflessly, then be my guest.<br><br>Oh, so what are you implying exactly? That they do not exist?<br><br>Let me put your amazingly flawed logic to the test:<br><br>A good doctor will automatically treat a patient well and heal him. If there were such doctors around then there will be nobody dying and suffering.<br><br>Nuff said.
