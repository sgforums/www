            <div class='col-md body'>Huh, has it occurred to you that the women who hate men like that are actually showing their own victim mentality? In the same way men who beat up their partners to make a point are actually the most insecure and vulnerable men around.<br><br>If you were a real woman who thinks she has real girl power, then why on earth are you hanging around with such a gorilla and allowing him to emotionally control you? And becoming more and more of a victim and embittered in the process that you can no longer function as an individual, thinking all guys are against you.<br><br>Seesh, a real lady would expect, and demand to be treated well, not choose to be a victim consciously and then scream about it here.<br><br>It takes two hands to clap, you can't accuse a guy of causing all the r/s problems when you are the very one choosing to tolerate such a gorilla, therefore sending out the message that such behaviour is acceptable. After all, there are plenty of nice guys out there who have every intention of honouring their partners so there's no clear reason why you should hang with the scum, and then paint everybody, including the nice ones with the same brush.<br><br>I dread to think what will happen if you carry in your bitterness and preconcieved misconceptions of men as worthless things with nothing good to offer into a r/s with a nice person, chances are, no matter how good he is, your tainted view of him will ruin things pretty soon. I prefer to go by a case-by-case basis rather then becoming irrational and think there's one cause for everything.<br></div>

But to just post/speak out of anger or frustration isn't portraying any maturity either.<br><br>I was dumbfounded, havin found your finger quick to point towards my direction.<br>It is true to your claims that men are bad...but to say that the problems lies with men isn't right either. When in a party of two, two chooses to solve the problem, most of the women i've met are suffering on their own inferiorities. No doubt men have pride so strong to have it hidden, Still to claim that 'ALL(?) problems lies with men is really something need to be sorted.<br><br>Please understand that i wish to stand in neutral ground and not argue and even defend men.<br>I too want to voice out my grievances.

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm just stating facts about what men do.<br><br>women who love their men often suffer in silence. victims? yes they are! in order to keep a r/s, i've seen some extremes gal are willing to go. all these just so the men is happy. but are they? NO, they ask for more and do things that does injustice to the love these women give. these women are willing to be 'victims' in hope the men of their life is happy and well, are they really victims then? i may agree they are silly but never victims. it takes a lot of selfless-ness and love to sacrific the way they did.<br><br>i am woman as that is wat is on my birth ceritificate. i don't believe in all that mambo jumbo about gal power and equality. what i believe is to treat the one you love with love. if you don't love her, please don't even start. if you don't know how to love her, think and ask. if you expect the gal to be faithful, you have to be faithful. if you intend to fool around, you better let your other half know and be prepared you will get the same treatment.<br><br>i never said all guys are against me. even if they are i don't care. i am not bothered with scum.<br><br>a gentleman will automatically treat a lady well and with respect. if there are such gentlemen around then there will be no need for screamings and aunt agnoys.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">Huh, has it occurred to you that the women who hate men like that are actually showing their own victim mentality?
