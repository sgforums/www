            <div class='col-md body'>The Littlest Daughter<br>By Julie Firman<br><br>They were a happy family: four Pogue daughters all in the same school in<br>different grades. They were talented and friendly girls. The youngest, Janice,<br>who was in my class, seemed to be glued to her mother's skirts. The three older<br>girls took the bus to school every morning and gaily rushed to their classrooms,<br>but Janice was always driven to school by her mother, arriving just in time for<br>the kindergarten morning song. Her mother usually stayed around until Janice<br>seemed to be content and was involved in some activity and then she would<br>tiptoe out. But she would return in time to take Janice home.<br><br>One Friday, Janice's mother called and asked for a conference with me. She<br>entered in an agitated and fragile way. She almost seemed to wring her hands<br>in distress. She said in a too-soft voice, "My husband is going to Europe on<br>business for two weeks and he insists that I go with him. I have tried to explain<br>over and over that Janice needs me here. But he is equally adamant that she<br>will be fine without me so I have no choice; I have to go. I have told the<br>babysitter that she is to drive her every morning and watch her until she is<br>settled into the classroom. She has explicit instructions about picking her up<br>and getting to school early so Janice won't worry. Will you please give Janice<br>special attention and help her during this time of our separation? We have never<br>been apart a single day since she was born five years ago. She is so young and<br>fragile and I want to be sure everything goes well for her."<br><br>She stopped for a quick breath, but I stepped in and assured her that we would<br>make every effort to support Janice and see that she was happy and healthy<br>while her mother was away. I even volunteered to meet Janice at her car so<br>she would see a familiar face. Janice's mother thanked me for our understanding<br>and reassurance. As she left we talked about the logistics of watching for Janice<br>and agreed that it would present some extra effort on my part but was worth<br>the time it might take.<br><br>Monday morning, anticipating a tearful anxious child, I planned a special program<br>of fun and games. I waited outside to greet Janice, but just then the bus<br>arrived and not three, but four Pogue girls got off of it. Janice skipped along<br>joyfully, yelling "good bye" to her sisters as she ran with two friends into the<br>classroom. I walked slowly into the classroom and called Janice over to ask how<br>the bus ride went. Impatiently she said, "Oh, I always wanted to take the bus<br>with the other kids, but Mother needs to be with me. You see there won't be<br>any more babies and so I have to be a baby a little longer. While she is away,<br>I'll just ride the bus every day. I am five, you know."</div>
