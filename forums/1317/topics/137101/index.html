            <div class='col-md body'>The Most Beautiful Flower<br>By Cheryl L. Costello-Forshey<br><br>The park bench was deserted as I sat down to read<br>Beneath the long, straggly branches of an old willow tree.<br>Disillusioned by life with good reason to frown,<br>For the world was intent on dragging me down.<br><br>And if that weren't enough to ruin my day,<br>A young boy out of breath approached me, all tired from play.<br>He stood right before me with his head tilted down<br>And said with great excitement, "Look what I found!"<br><br>In his hand was a flower, and what a pitiful sight,<br>With its petals all worn - not enough rain, or too little light.<br>Wanting him to take his dead flower and go off to play,<br>I faked a small smile and then shifted away.<br><br>But instead of retreating he sat next to my side<br>And placed the flower to his nose and declared with overacted surprise,<br>"It sure smells pretty and it's beautiful, too.<br>"That's why I picked it; here, it's for you."<br><br>The weed before me was dying or dead.<br>Not vibrant of colors, orange, yellow or red.<br>But I knew I must take it, or he might never leave.<br>So I reached for the flower, and replied, "Just what I need."<br><br>But instead of him placing the flower in my hand,<br>He held it midair without reason or plan.<br>It was then that I noticed for the very first time<br>That weed-toting boy could not see: he was blind.<br><br>I heard my voice quiver, tears shone like the sun<br>As I thanked him for picking the very best one.<br>"You're welcome," he smiled, and then ran off to play,<br>Unaware of the impact he'd had on my day.<br><br>I sat there and wondered how he managed to see<br>A self-pitying woman beneath an old willow tree.<br>How did he know of my self-indulged plight?<br>Perhaps from his heart, he'd been blessed with true sight.<br><br>Through the eyes of a blind child, at last I could see<br>The problem was not with the world; the problem was me.<br>And for all of those times I myself had been blind,<br>I vowed to see the beauty in life, and appreciate every<br>second that's mine.<br><br>And then I held that wilted flower up to my nose<br>And breathed in the fragrance of a beautiful rose<br>And smiled as I watched that young boy, another weed in his hand<br>About to change the life of an unsuspecting old man.</div>
