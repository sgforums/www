Because the prices will always go up and never down. Not even when the company is making profits.<br><br>Take SBS for example, it's making profits averging $35 million per year.<br><br>And now they are still going to increase the price of the northeast line.<br><br>What did they claim?? That the line will be in red for 2 years?? Hell, yeah, we all know that.<br><br>Isn't it possible for them to allocate a certain amount of their financial resources to the NE lines??<br><br>And what would happen after 2 years when the line is back to making healthy profits. They will forget about the past and start spinning new stories on rising cost again.<br><br>I think I will live to see the fare prices rise up to $5 per trip one day. No kidding.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the whole bunch of idiots that make up the management of the public transport companies and the PTC which probably has vested interest are <strong>Ivory Tower Dwellers divorced from Reality</strong>!<br><br>Remember the line will be fully automated.  And it will cost them more than if they put in drivers!<br><br>Anyone see the insanity and stupidity in this move??  These people keep claiming that they are businessmen... then for the sake of sanity BEHAVE like businessmen!!<br><br>By going driverless, they admit that it will cost them more... so, in the middle of an economic crisis, a big company is going to throw (yes! THROW) away good money.  I don't think they care.. they can just hit their customers for more.. we're totally dependent on them for public transport.<br><br>The idiots could have EMPLOYED a bunch of people, making the line safer and it'll be cheaper to run!  They could have been "Good Corporate Citizens" and help with the economy by giving us average people something to cheer about, and helping fight unemployment.<br><br>But no... they insist on being blinded by technology, using a $1,000 gizmo do something that a $1 notepad can do better...  But then, those who run and own these companies will never know.. they are driven in their chaufferred cars.<br><br>So, in the end, it's us, the consumers, and those who cannot afford to buy a car and have to, and are forced to use public transport who will be scalped.<br><br>Singapore's gone to the dogs... it's been like that for some time.<br><br>Alas...</div>
