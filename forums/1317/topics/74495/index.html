Adolescence changed JeabÂ’s immediate social group and he started hanging around with other boys, and even agreed to torment the other girls -- including Noi-Na -- at his friendsÂ’ behest. Noi-Na was understandably upset and angry and her family moved to another province a week later. Jeab didnÂ’t see her after that, but then one day he received an invitation to Noi-NaÂ’s wedding.

Reminds me of that Bee Gees sound-tracked Melody film of 1973 that explored childhood, love and marriage. Btw, can anybody tell if the hair-cutting had any significance? Does it give an indication why the Noi-na's family moved away? The reason for this was not given in the movie. Thanks! (Reply tclai@pacific.net.sg)<br>John (Singapore)<br>I have just seen this movies. It is very interesting and reminds me of the past childhood days. Very entertaining. It is a very simple story but it is great. This is better than most of the commercial movies now showing, which has less substance.<br>gups<br>Very nice movie... thou i dont understand a word of thai... it bring back many childhood memories... thumbs up!!! =)<br>ice cleghorn<br>oh, fan chan is great, i can even say it with my mouth full, man! i like all da songs on da movie and the loving of friendship. it just so great!<br>Desmond (Singapore)<br>hello everyone, after i watched the "fan chan", i really feel that the movie was really very nice to watch. although i dun understand the langauge, but the way they express, talk , action really make mi laugh, cry and sad. the two main cast really make the movie alive! i have enjoy a great show or what should i said that i have been forcus for a movie beside Titanic other than this. this movie can said that it really change my life style. I really enjoy the movie very much. Hope i can see more of this kind of production from Thailand again.<br>Tanaporn Chuto<br>What a wonderful and cute film! I've got the DVD and the VCD an i love this movie. It remembers me at my time in Thailand before I moved to Germany...<br>n_liz<br>I got to see this movie even b4 it will be released on march 18. singapore is the third country to watch it.....i haf to say it's a privilege. I even had the chance to attend the network session wif the directors of this movie, it was nice to meet them.....Even though i do not understand thai, they had subtitles which i tot was great. I really felt that the movie was great and wonderful. i'm a great fan of this movie. The kids in the movie can really act. The movie is very funny, sad as well as sweet. The ending was the best, everyone expected to see noi nah's face to knoe how she looked when she was grown up, but instead they showed the young noi nah. I felt tat it was a different ending and a good one as well. As a video production student and an aspiring director, i feel tat the movie as well as the young directors are an inspiration. Definitely a movie which everyone should watch......i rate it 4.5/5........i would give it a perfect score but i feel tat there is still some stuff tat can be improved. Great Movie !!!!<br>Sathit<br>Fan chun<br>jamie<br>The best movie i ever saw.<br>Jennita<br>This movie is great .<br>Howard<br>Fan Chan - Was one of the best Thai movies I ever watched. My only wish is that it will one day be released with English subtitles as I cannot understand Thai. I wathced the movie at Central World Plaza which is one of the few theaters in Thailand which adds English subtitles toThai films. Great movie, Great Story............. English subtitles please................<br>Gerry<br>I have limited Thai but the movie was great....I want to watch it again with someone Thai...really brought back even a farangs childhood. Petchuburri was a good place to film it too....<br>phet<br>suriyothai<br>Stuart<br>Fan Chan - This is my favorite Thai movie from last year. It is about a young man who looks back to his childhood and regrets that maybe he should have made some better decisions in his life. The flashback is provoked by the news that his childhood sweetheart is about to get married. He wonders if he had done some things differently as a child it might be him getting married now. The child actors in the movie are all natural and have done a wonderful job.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.. Thanks for providing the reviews from so many people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Goes to show this show is not bad at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Personally, i think she cut her hair to signify the break of friendship between Jaeb and her. Like 'cutting' off the past for a new future sort. She doesn't want to remain friends with Jaeb because of what Jaeb did. But she didn't get to receive the thing that he almost gave her.
