It's meant to be enjoyable, but it means stress for me. Everytime I go on a holiday, i lose weight. Right now i've got a job interview lined up, so once again. I CAN'T LEAVE MELBOURNE?! I don't know why, just sit still for one minute!<br><br>Anyway.. i'll keep you posted!<br><br>Kittyn.. no i don't. I just sucked up and applied for a job there. Even though i hate that company.
