Service 858 is a service with a purpose of getting passengers from Yishun to Airport in approx 30 mins and Woodlands in approx 1 hr. Extending service 858 will make a detour and thus extending travelling time, defeating the purpose of the service.<br><br>Again, if this line become reality, it will, again, snatch the business of buses. By then, bus companies will only be left with feeder services to operate.</div>

A LRT line between Tampines and Loyang is fine but to the airport is not possible in my opinion, because this may be a long route to the airport without any stations along the way.<br></div>
