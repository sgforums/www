            <div class='col-md body'>Remember, We're Raising Children, Not Flowers!<br>By Jack Canfield<br><br>I recently heard a story from Stephen Glenn about a famous research scientist who<br>had made several very important medical breakthroughs. He was being interviewed by<br>a newspaper reporter who asked him why he thought he was able to be so much<br>more creative than the average person. What set him so far apart from others?<br><br>He responded that, in his opinion, it all came from an experience with his mother that<br>occurred when he was about two years old. He had been trying to remove a bottle<br>of milk from the refrigerator when he lost his grip on the slippery bottle and it fell,<br>spilling its contents all over the kitchen floor - a veritable sea of milk!<br><br>When his mother came into the kitchen, instead of yelling at him, giving him a lecture<br>or punishing him, she said, "Robert, what a great and wonderful mess you have<br>made! I have rarely seen such a huge puddle of milk. Well, the damage has already<br>been done. Would you like to get down and play in the milk for a few minutes<br>before we clean it up?"<br><br>Indeed, he did. After a few minutes, his mother said, "You know, Robert, whenever<br>you make a mess like this, eventually you have to clean it up and restore everything<br>to its proper order. So, how would you like to do that? We could use a sponge, a<br>towel or a mop. Which do you prefer?" He chose the sponge and together they<br>cleaned up the spilled milk.<br><br>His mother then said, "You know, what we have here is a failed experiment in how<br>to effectively carry a big milk bottle with two tiny hands. Let's go out in the back<br>yard and fill the bottle with water and see if you can discover a way to carry it<br>without dropping it." The little boy learned that if he grasped the bottle at the top<br>near the lip with both hands, he could carry it without dropping it. What a wonderful<br>lesson!<br><br>This renowned scientist then remarked that it was at that moment that he knew<br>he didn't need to be afraid to make mistakes. Instead, he learned that mistakes were<br>just opportunities for learning something new, which is, after all, what scientific<br>experiments are all about. Even if the experiment "doesn't work," we usually learn<br>something valuable from it.<br><br>Wouldn't it be great if all parents would respond the way Robert's mother responded<br>to him?</div>
