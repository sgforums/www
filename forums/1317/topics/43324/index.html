Sometimes I see it runs along the tracks as early as 11.45pm. Usually it starts its maintenance works at around midnight. BTW Windy, do you have any info if SMRT is going to buy new EMUs soon? The first batch of EMUs have gone for an exterior refurbishment works recently, and they look quite 'new'. I also remember that SMRT tested bench seats similar to those on buses and plans were under way to implement those type of seating on future trains.

Notice that when the viaducts pass over a big junction, a wide river or has a triple track cross-over, the distance (length) between the 2 rows of pillars are wider, so 2 pillars are used instead of 1 for strengthen purpose.<br></div>
