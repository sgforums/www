            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Amida Buddha</strong><br><br>Amida Buddha is not a historical Buddha living in our world, rather, He resides in His Pureland in the West. According to the Amida Sutra, He has gained enlightenment more than 10 Kalpas ago. Amida Buddha is the embodiment of enlightenment, compassion and wisdom.<br>According to the Sutra of Immeasurable Life spoken by Sakyamuni Buddha, Amida Buddha was known as Dharmakara Bodhisattva in the distant past. It is said that during the time of Lokesvaraja Buddha, he was the king of a country and, having heard the Dharma taught by Lokesvaraja Buddha, he gave up his throne and seeked to learn the Dharma under Lokesvaraja Buddha. It was during this time that he wished to set up his own Pureland to benefit other sentient beings, and under Lokesvaraja Buddha, set up his 48 Vows. Dharmakara Bodhisattva vowed that if his vows were not fulfilled, he would not gain enlightenment.<br>Amida Buddhas 48 Vows are condensed into the 18th Vow the Primal Vow that states, If I were to become a Buddha, and people, hearing my Name, have faith and joy and recite it for even ten times, but were not born into my Pureland, may I not gain enlightenment.<br>Dharmakara Bodhisattva established and fulfilled the special Vow to save all sentient beings and become Amida Buddha. While the other Buddhas help people who accumulate meritorious deeds, practice meditative activities, and perfect wisdom, Amida Buddha saves the being of blind foolishness and karmic evil through form (Primal Vow) and Name (Nembutsu). That is the person who realizes himself as being truly human (ignorant and evil) and becomes his foolish self attains Buddhahood by virtue of Amida Buddha.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"></span></div>
