            <div class='col-md body'>Rennyo Shonin wrote,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chapter On Abstinence And Taboo<br>{Mono Imi No Sho}<br><br>Letter # 9<br><br>People have said from long ago that our Jodo Shinshu Sect is a laughably defiled sect. In truth, they are pointing to a condition with justification; there are people in this sect who (without due understanding) explain points in the Teachings of our school to those of other sects without due circumspection. This is a great mistake. The "adherence to the manner of conduct as set forth by this Jodo Shinshu Sect" means that a person well understands the matter of keeping the traditional Teachings of our school firmly in his heart and refrains from showing even a hint of it outwardly. However, since recently, some have thoughtlessly expounded the Teachings of our sect to those of other sects without due consideration, people have labeled our sect as being without depth. Due to the existence of such persons with poor understanding among us, people look upon our sect as defiled and hateful.<br><br>You should understand that the core of the trouble lies not in the people of the other sects being bad, but in the poor judgment of the people within our own sect.<br>Now, with respect to abstinences and taboos, we can say that (relative to the Dharma) we do not observe abstinences or taboos in our sect. Should there not be avoidances pertinent to our association with those of the other sects and to those in governmental circles? It goes without saying that in our contacts with those of the other sects, certain refrainments as mentioned above must be observed; and too, there must not be slander on our part because others observe abstinences and taboos. However, it must be remembered that those who wish to pursue Buddha's Dharma are not limited, by any means, to only the followers of the Nembutsu.<br><br>It is clearly written in many Sutras that there are to be no abstinences or taboos. For instance, in the Nehan Gyo it states, "Passage is given in the Japanese calligraphic form of the Sutra...." The meaning of this passage is, "Within the Teachings of the TathÃ¡gata, there are no such things as the selection of appropriate sign-filled days for luck or favorable times...." Again, in the Hanjyu Kyo-, it states, "Ubai kono sanmai wo kikite, manaban to hossen mono wa mizukara Butsu ni Kimyo shi, Ho ni Kimyo shi, Bikuso ni Kimyo shi, yodo ni tsukauru koto wo ezare, ten wo haisuru koto wo ezare, kijin wo matsuru koto wo ezare, kichi ryo nichi wo miru koto wo ezare...." The meaning of this passage is, "A lay woman who seeks the Truth after having heard this Teaching and desires to learn it, should place her reliance on the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. She must not aspire to some other Path, pray to heavens, worship demons and deities, and select lucky days and favorable times...." Although there are other passages from Sutras that state the same thing, the above passages will suffice here.<br><br>It appears to me that the followers of the Nembutsu especially ought not to have any anxieties over abstinences and taboos. You should understand this very clearly.<br><br>With reverence, I remain<br><br>9th month, 5th year of Bunmei (1473CE)<br><br></span><br><br>Concerning the first paragraph of the letter, it would seem that Rennyo was advocating Shinshu followers' keeping their faith to themselves and not sharing it for others.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Billy,<br>a personal take on this Epistle would be that Rennyo shonin is trying to prevent over-enthusiastic followers of Jodo Shinshu who are not learned enough about the Shin doctrine from spreading wrong doctrines. As we have seen throughout Shin history, especially during Rennyo shonin's time, this was a common problem in the Honganji kyodan.<br>Gassho</div>
