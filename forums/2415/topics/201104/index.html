            <div class='col-md body'>On 3rd July 2006, Nepal was recognized by Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha (Nishi Hongwanji) as an Overseas Missionary district (Kaikyochi ÂŠJÂ‹Â³Â’n) in view of the continuing spread of the Jodo Shin teachings there. It is the forth after Australia, Mexico and Taiwan.<br>The current name is "Hongwanji Buddhist Society Nepal, Kathmandu Hongwanji". A new temple building temporarily called Kathmandhu Hongwanji is now being built in Kathmadu, and it will house the District Office. Currently the Main Shrine Hall (Hondo) on the 1st floor as well as living quarters on the 2nd floor have been completed as a Buddha-dedication service is scheduled in Mid-August.<br>Jodo Shinshu first spread in Nepal 14 years ago due to the auspices of the late Mr Mukaibo Hiromichi (passed away in May/June 2006), who contributed to the building of the "Greenlife Research Society", a Buddhist welfare group in Nepal. Later it was re-named the "Greenlife Buddhist Society, Nepal". The current president is Rev Sonam Wangdi, who after meeting Mr Mukaibo, converted from Tibetan Buddhism to Jodo Shinshu in 1998.<br>Rev Sonam Wangdi studied at the Chuo Bukkyo Gakuin (Â’Â†Â‰Â›Â˜Ã…Â‹Â³ÂŠwÂ‰@) in 2003 and was ordained as a minister in the Jodo Shin tradition before graduating and made an overseas missionary in September 2004. Nepal is an overwhelmingly Hindu country and Buddhists make only 10% of the population. At first Rev Sonam held gatherings at his own home, but with the completion of the Main Shrine Hall gatherings as well as worship services in Nepalese, English and Japanese. Other than scheduled services as well as sermons, "A Beginners' Guide to Jodo Shinshu (Â�Ã²Â“yÂ�^Â�@Â“Ã¼Â–Ã¥)" as well as the Japanese language are taught. Membership of the society numbers at more than 200 members currently.<br>In April this year (2006), Director Goto of the Hongwanji visited Nepal and supervised the construction of the temple building and temple activities. The Hongwanji also accepted Rev Calup Lama (sorry not sure of the correct spelling for his first name so just guessing from the katakana in the newspaper  ) who graduated from the Chuo Bukkyo Gakuin in April this year and is now assisting Rev Sonam Wangdi in Nepal; currently Miss Uma Lama Gishin (also not sure of her name!  ) who is scheduled to graduate next spring and will return to Nepal to assist in temple activities.<br><br>(Translated by sanath from the Honganji Journal 20/7/2006)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Use of Hongwanji name allowed</strong><br><br>Nepal, which was officially recognised as a new Overseas Missionary District in July this year (2006) has been officially given the recognition to use the name "Hongwanji" by the Gomonshu. On 4 September, Rev Sonam Wangdi who heads the Mission was present at the Hongwanji in Japan to receive the Certificate of Recognition from Gov-gen Fujikawa.<br><br>Kathmandu Hongwanji was the dream of the late Mr Mukaibo Hiromichi, who wanted to build a Shin temple in the land of Buddha's Birth (present Nepal). In order to do so, Mr Mukaibo set up the "Greenlife Research Center" which is also a welfare organization.<br><br>Mr Mukaibo, who energetically used welfare to spread Buddhism, was allowed by the Nepalese government to purchase a plot of land in Kathmandu for the construction of a temple in 2004. Even though Mr Mukaibo passed away in May this year, funds for the new temple still continue to pour in from well-wishers all over Japan.<br><br>Receiving the Certificate of Recognition, Rev Wangdi remarked with fervour, "Mr Mukaibo's "dream" is being fulfilled. With the new temple, we hope to be able to spread Jodo Shinshu in Northern India as well as Bangladesh!".<br><br>The new temple, which is still being built, is a concrete 3 storied building. The 1st and 2nd floors that house the main shrine hall and Mission office and Conference room respectively have been completed, while the 3rd floor which will have accomodation facilities and the roofing will start construction soon.<br><br>Other than Rev Wangdi, there are 5 other staff at the new Temple, including Rev Kalup Lama who was ordained in March this year. There are services every week and Buddhist talks at three different locations within Kathmandu. Also, blood-donation and other welfare projects such as donations of wheelchairs and clothes take place on a regular basis. Other projects done by the temple are Japanese language lessons and interaction with the local community.<br><br>(Translated from Hongwanji Journal - 20 Sept 2006 Issue)<br><br></div>
