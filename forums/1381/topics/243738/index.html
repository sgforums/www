            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>do i have to refer to the bible to argue with you that god exist?<br><br>sigh..... if you want to argue over this<br><br>i care not,<br><br>as this is very very subjective,<br><br>nor did i state that i am right, i merely said that in faith, we place our trust in god, and please read john 3:16, let me ask you a question, do you believe that jesus christ is the son of god, if you want to disprove that jesus christ is not son of god, then i have nothing more to say you </blockquote>I do not believe in the bible  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> The whole question really stems from the fact why do u believe in the bible and tat is word of god. Because god is just an idea introduced by the bible. U believe in bible because it says so ?<br><br><blockquote>and between, i have never state that you are wrong, merely i just listed an example, i never judge you nor question you<br><br>my statement isn't subjective,<br><br>again, how do you know there is air, the correct answer is you feel or sense<br><br>how can this be any subjective? again i want to say this, you chose the wrong words at the wrong time </blockquote>If u ask me, I know there is air because u can conduct experiments tat is repeatable to prove there is air tat is logically sound and prove no other conclusion. U answer it for god, but I ask u why different people believe in different things then u did not answer. Is tat a clear case tat your "sensing" is subjective and varies differently from people to people ?<br><br><blockquote>this thread is not about denying god,<br><br>and one more thing, you only trying to find fault in my sentence, but never state any form of arguement of your own, </blockquote>I thought my stand is clear tat i believe there is no god. I feel tat the TS, despite all the reasons for not believeing in god, still believe in it nevertheless puzzling. Tat is why i ask him how he come to the conclusion god exist in the first place<br><br><blockquote><br>until you provide any form of evidence that god doesn't exist at all<br><br>or i rest my case and not post again<br><br>you are just being arguemental</blockquote>The burden on proving god lies on u. Tis is because u make an extraordinary claim tat cannot be observed and logically deduced. I can say tat there exists the invisible flying spaghetti monster. Wat do u think is the right way ? Should u prove it wrong for me otherwise it is deemed as fact and u have to accept it ? Or should I show evidence tat there is the flying spaghetti monster before u take it seriously ?</div>
