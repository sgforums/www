All claims about Jesus derive from writings of other people. There occurs no contemporary Roman record that shows Pontius Pilate executing a man named Jesus. Devastating to historians, there occurs not a single contemporary writing that mentions Jesus. All documents about Jesus got written well after the life of the alleged Jesus from either: unknown authors, people who had never met an earthly Jesus, or from fraudulent, mythical or allegorical writings. Although one can argue that many of these writings come from fraud or interpolations, I will use the information and dates to show that even if these sources did not come from interpolations, they could still not serve as reliable evidence for a historical Jesus, simply because all sources derive from hearsay accounts.<br><br><a href="http://atheistempire.wordpress.com/faith-in-jesus-christ/" rel="nofollow">http://atheistempire.wordpress.com/faith-in-jesus-christ/</a><br><br>As well as that I always stress that there is no proof or historical evidence of his existence and that all of the historians of the 1st century are curiously silent on the matter.<br><br><a href="http://www.atheists.org/christianity/didjesusexist.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atheists.org/christianity/didjesusexist.html</a><br><br>About a decade ago, however, I began to reexamine the evidence for the historicity of Jesus. I was astounded at what I didn't find. In this article, I would like to show how shaky the evidence is regarding the alleged existence of a would-be messiah named Jesus.</div>
