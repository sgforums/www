In the past, here in SGforums, I have had plenty of arguments with her fans on what she did. Most, if not all, of them are from CHC. This is at least true in Singapore.<br><br>Having said that, not all CHC folks are her fans.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

I believe you may have had an influence on the teens as well. However, even without the Sun Ho factor, there are too many of these young people going to church for the wrong reasons.<br><br>They are going just to be part of the IN crowd and rather than for the actual purpose of going to church. Not only that, they drag other people along who become like them, getting caught up in everything and losing the real meaning and purpose.<br><br>Sometimes, such people become so disillusioned that they just get angry with the whole of christianity and lamblast any Christian as being brainless and mindless because their angry with how they got "conned" into going to church last time.</div>
