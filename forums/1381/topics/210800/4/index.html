I believe you may have had an influence on the teens as well. However, even without the Sun Ho factor, there are too many of these young people going to church for the wrong reasons.<br><br>They are going just to be part of the IN crowd and rather than for the actual purpose of going to church. Not only that, they drag other people along who become like them, getting caught up in everything and losing the real meaning and purpose.<br><br>Sometimes, such people become so disillusioned that they just get angry with the whole of christianity and lamblast any Christian as being brainless and mindless because their angry with how they got "conned" into going to church last time.</div></blockquote>Yes, it's those people who give christians a bad name. I personally know a friend who goes to church becos' she's lonely. And there's plenty of people who do that. What is the point?<br><br>And also those who come knocking at your door to promote christianity.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Having said that, true christians are not like them.</div>

I would prefer she goes wanting to know God better. We are supposed to bond as Christians afterall.<br><br>However, it's a different thing to get too fanatical and too caught up such that it comprimises the good you do or the good that is being done. Like how some people who get so caught up and jaded end up hating church instead.<br><br>And I don't get it with people who go to church to see pretty girls, you don't go to the temple to bio the chio bu nuns right? Or maybe this same group of people do that I won't know. But that is seriously so wrong. Then, instead of drawing closer to church and to God, these people start hating Christians just because they were rejected by the girl or something.</div>
