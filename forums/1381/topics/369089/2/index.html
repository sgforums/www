              Singaporean on a personal level, nor should he espouse a hatred for
              homosexuals and their acts. It is their personal lives and no

              <p>evolution you said..i once read in a science journal many years back on how scientist tried to prove there is no God..as starters, they believe Earth to be the bowl..in it are water,gases(cloud) and their respective chemical and physics properties..so lightnings and such high energy events soon gave life..all in the pre bioitc soup...thus the 1st bacteria and so on...</p>
              <p>the scientist tried to replicate the same in their labs..and they did succeed in produce similiar results..now..the point is..the whole experiment was very controlled...hope you get my drift..</p>
              <p>of course God did not give birth to you..nor create you directly..the only one directly created by God was Jesus..it was your dear parents that birthed you..but one must always remember the source of their drinks..was it not God who created the first humans?</p>
              <p>evolution Vs creationism Vs adaptation..charles darwin theory has been proven flwed by so many others already..and none can deny the precision involved from the protons,electrons to the heavenly bodies in space..can evolution provide for such precision??</p>
              <p>that makes 3 of us who dislike the present system...</p>
              <p>hatred for being gay is not wrong..hatred of gay people is wrong..same sex acts will only lead to the extinction of a certain species...hetrosexual is the only way to continue the race of humans...even frogs and fishes understand this principle is it not??i dont support gay..in fact i hate the act..(though lesbians are erotic..only because im a straight guy..) and i only hate gays who try to touch me against my will..otherwise they are but another human that must have some good qualities in them...</p>

              <p>The problem is that evolutionism accepts that there are missing holes in its logic, and as long as the mistakes could be tested and verified to be true, it would be accepted to improve the theory by the overall scientific community.</p>
              <p>In other words, it is at least a belief that allows itself to be scrutinized.</p>
              <p>Creationism, or any religion that preaches a creator that must be worshipped are not so gracious about having the holes in its logic pointed out. It believes that the logic do not have to be tested or verified and often threatens violence of both verbal and physical nature against anyone who does not agree.</p>
              <p>I'm agnostic so i believe that there is a God. But i do not believe that books written by men who would be considered mentally unsound today could possibly record all we would possibly need to know about God and could know what an entity as powerful as that could "want".</p>
              <p>I would state that it would make 4 of us who dislike the present system. But i have a more cynical view of what the vague concept of freedom entails.</p>

               So worship science then. I'll just worship God and let you worship science. For me God has revealed what science cannot. The future, the hearts of men, death and a few others. Science cannot reveal these things to me.  I marvel at God while you marvel at science.
              I'm not saying I can't appreciate science. I love science but science is not an object of worship to me.
