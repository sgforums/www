              I've never seen angel or demon.
               <br><br>
              But when I was a kid I remember when I just woke up approaching dawn just as I opened my eyes I was so convinced that a sentient being was present in the middle of the room. My eyes didn't see anything but I knew for sure it was there. I knew it was without sin and it was from God. I kind of laughed in my heart because it was without sin and I wanted to tell my grandmother who was kneeling in her usual morning prayer just beside my bed but as I tried to speak.....I couldn't ....I wanted to speak but somehow my own mind refused to utter the word. It was a weird situation which I never again encounter to this day. I really wanted to speak but as the desire came out the guilt of speaking was mounting and I just couldn't speak or utter even one word. This went on until the presence disappear. Right after I no longer felt the presence of that holy being I could speak like usual. There was no terror at all just that my mind and guts and conscience refused to obey my will....
                                                  <br><br>
              As for demon I personally never saw one but an evil spirit was sent my way back in 2002. I didn't open my eyes for fear of being frightened but when it went past the door it emitted a unique flash of energy wave that could be felt and I kind of saw it went past the door in my mind though it was just a flash. It fled right after I cried out to God. God must have been very terrifying to it. I don't think it was a demon just some evil spirit of no high rank.

              <p>hmm..interesting...especially how demons can disguise themselves into even something righteous..for easy reference..lifeforms that aint physical and not sent from God are angels..anything else are demons..in this topic..please dont include other religions into the mix as yet..dont condemn your own religion for now for all those who are reading...</p>
              <p>M&amp;P..wonder if you remember the stroy of paul as he went around preaching..and there is this medium gal..who went behind him and kept crying out that paul is preaching the true word of God..it totally pisses paul off and he kinda told her off..how righteous paul's fury is...that spreading the word of God need no demons' help..the demons assisting the gal clearly know what paul was talking about and know its the truth..shows how twisted they are just to get some form of worship..</p>

              Hmm yea the girl was prophesying not under the influence of the holy spirit but of other spirits. But how did the apostle know?
                                <br><br>
              Yes I know that perhaps demon can disguise themselves but in my own experience God is still God. Many people believe that demons or the devil are more active than God these days, they look at everything with utter suspicion and tend to view everything supernatural is from the devil.They think this way because they don't know God<br><br>
                                
              Even when Jesus was performing all those miracles including casting out demons the people suspect Jesus was using the power of the devil to do all of His miracles.<br><br>
                                
              They were blind in spirit. They failed to see the work of the holy spirit even when it's performed in front of their very own eyes.<br><br>
              Jesus was considered false Messiah even after He died or because He died. No let me correct that Jesus is still considered as false Messiah to this day by the majority of the jewish people. The Jewish people didn't have knowledge of God and was blind in the spirit. They loved their religion more than they loved God. They thought Jesus death was a must to appease the Romans and brought stability. The Pharisees were furious that Jesus condemned them. To them Jesus was a mere son of a carpenter.<br><br>
              They sincerely believed that Jesus was a false Messiah despite everything that Jesus had performed.<br><br>
              Those Jews who believed in Jesus and admitted to it were cast out of the synagogues(their churches) thus expelling them from their community. Many of those who believed in Jesus were too afraid to admit that because they didn't want to be cast out of the synagogue.<br><br>
              The Pharisees did all this because they didn't know God and they loved their religion more than they loved God. In fact they worshiped their religion instead of God. They did their rituals for the sake of doing the rituals. They became numb and blind in spirit. Though they did all their physical rituals that their religion demanded of them, they were doing them for all the wrong reasons. They replaced God with idols called religion and rituals and a feeling of false self-righteousness. The very way to become closer to God has turned into the very obstacle to God.<br><br>
                                
              Next time before judging or crying out satan or the devil be sure you know what you are talking. We ought to learn from the Pharisees. Paul knew the girl was prophesying not udner the influence of God because he had a spiritual insight. The many Jesus disciples that prevented a man from casting out demons in God's name thought they had spiritual insight and Jesus told them they were wrong to have prevented that man.
              You see even Jesus own disciples were then wrong in judging what was from God and what was not.

              It takes a spiritual insight to know which is which without which we cannot judge correctly.
              <br><br>
              And I don't think the spirit that made the girl to prophesy was doing it for the sake of being worshiped . . . .I would called it a possession manifestation but it was not doing what it was doing so that it could be worshiped.

              <p>this part seems to describe catholics more than jews..the pharisees did not love religion nor God..they just love the power they have..Jesus was a thorn in their side for Jesus spoke the truth about God and how to worship God according to God's standard and not man..thats why they have to remove Jesus..</p>
              <p>Paul knew for he was anointed with holy spirit..therefore he rebuked the gal who then lost the powers from the demons not long after and cast aside by her masters for not able to cast divining lots.</p>
              <p>it is true God still send his angels and holy spirit to protect humans especially in this ending days..this im sure..however, it isnt what humans thought it is..as it will contradict the  bible which is God's word..the bible was meant to guide humans till the restoration of true worship..so there is no need for more prophets, visions.everything needed is in the bible.</p>

              Yes I agree there's no gray area in life. Those who think they are neutral are NOT neutral. They still haven't realized whose side they are on.
              <br><br>
              But I cannot agree with you that today there's no longer be any prophet or any prophecy or any vision or any revelation or any miracle just that they are no longer being recorded thus they remain personal most of the time. I've personally witnessed a prophecy coming true. It took 5 years and it was fulfilled in every detail.
              <br><br>
              The holy spirit is still at work in this world just as what God promised in the bible. Believers are having prophetic dreams, seeing visions, receiving revelations, some even heal the sick with prayer, some even raised the dead through Christ and a lot of people are speaking in tongue or being given the gift of words of knowledge(to know things, people supernaturally).

              What believers must be careful is to judge which is from which. There are most probably many false teachers and false prophets. Whatever revealed must not go against what has already been revealed. That is one way to know these frauds.
              <br><br>
              How did Mary know that the angel that appeared to her was really an angel from God?
              How did Joseph husband of Mary know that the dream was from God?
              How did Moses know that it was God that commanded him to got o the Pharaoh?
              How did Noah know that it was God that commanded him to build the ark?
              How did Joseph son of Jacob know that it was God that gave Pharaoh his dream? and not Pharaoh's sixth sense? lol
              How did John the apostle know the revelation was from God and not his own fantasy or from the devil?
              How did Abraham know that God is God who commanded him to go out from his father's place?
              How did Abraham know the visitors that came to his tent were from God?
              How did Lot know that his guest was an angel?
              How did Jeremiah know that it was God that made him a prophet and not the devil?
              How did Solomon know that his dream was from God and that his wisdom really was the result of what he asked and that it was not his own ability but it was a blessing from God?
              How did Jonah know that God wanted him thus commanded the ship's crew to throw him into the sea?
              How did the apostles know that Jesus was really the Messiah? 
              How did Daniel know that God was God and how did he know what had been revealed to him was the truth from God and not from the devil?
              <br><br>
              We believe these people were really God's people because we read them in the bible. But how did they know what they know?

              <p>noticed i said not anymore as in nowadays..back then they know because God speaks to the very openly..none can refute that..if God were to speak again like he did and tell me the church is right..most probably i still go kill myself than serve a god like that..haha..the thing is..you pointed all correct people in the correct time..that is..BEFORE the completion of the bible..but of course..no one can say you are wrong..</p>
              <p>miracles happen nowadys..faith healing thats healing everything else but faith..bringin people back to live..never see happening again in mordern days..and those miracles come with a price..they have to be paid..</p>
              <p>demons were angels who stood in the truth..they had loved God last time..even satan did..though they had their power greatly reduced when cast out of heaven during the events stated in revelations..the tinest of them is way superior to mere humans..and they things they can do are miraculous to humans..6th sense you said??besides the sense of humor..i cant think of anything else..humans werent made to foretell future events isnt it??</p>

              <p><strong><a name="II">II. THE FALL OF THE ANGELS</a> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><a>391</a></strong> Behind
              the disobedient choice of our first parents lurks a seductive voice,
              opposed to God, which makes them fall into death out of envy.<sup>266</sup> Scripture and the Church's Tradition see in this being a fallen angel, called "Satan" or the "devil".<sup>267</sup> The Church teaches that Satan was at first a good angel, made by God:
              "The devil and the other demons were indeed created naturally good by
              God, but they became evil by their own doing."<sup>268</sup></p>
              <p><a name="392"></a><strong><a>392</a></strong> Scripture speaks of a sin of these angels.<sup>269</sup> This "fall" consists in the free choice of these created spirits, who radically and irrevocably <em>rejected </em>God and his reign. We find a reflection of that rebellion in the tempter's words to our first parents: "You will be like God."<sup>270</sup> The devil "has sinned from the beginning"; he is "a liar and the father of lies".<sup>271</sup></p>
              <p><a name="393"></a><strong><a>393</a></strong> It is the <em>irrevocable </em>character
              of their choice, and not a defect in the infinite divine mercy, that
              makes the angels' sin unforgivable. "There is no repentance for the
              angels after their fall, just as there is no repentance for men after
              death."<sup>272</sup></p>
              <p><a name="394"></a><strong><a>394</a></strong> Scripture witnesses to the disastrous influence of the one Jesus calls
              "a murderer from the beginning", who would even try to divert Jesus
              from the mission received from his Father.<sup>273</sup> "The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil."<sup>274</sup> In its consequences the gravest of these works was the mendacious seduction that led man to disobey God.</p>
              <p><a name="395"></a><strong><a>395</a></strong> The power of Satan is, nonetheless, not infinite. He is only a
              creature, powerful from the fact that he is pure spirit, but still a
              creature. He cannot prevent the building up of God's reign. Although
              Satan may act in the world out of hatred for God and his kingdom in
              Christ Jesus, and although his action may cause grave injuries - of a
              spiritual nature and, indirectly, even of a physical nature- to each
              man and to society, the action is permitted by divine providence which
              with strength and gentleness guides human and cosmic history. It is a
              great mystery that providence should permit diabolical activity, but
              "we know that in everything God works for good with those who love him."<sup>275</sup></p>

              If anyone still doubted about God still doing miracles and all other kind of work
              Research the following people, they lived and some still live today
                                                                    
              Therese Neumann from Konnersreuth(died in 1962)
                                                                    
              Padre Pio(died in 1968 )
                                                                    
              Julia Kim from Naju Korea
                                                                    
              All of them are stigmatist that is people who bear the marks of Jesus suffering by spiritual means(supernatural)
                                                                    
              Among the things that they did was bilocation(being in more than one place at the same time), reading of hearts(feeling what the others feeling in their heart), seeing irregardless of distance, levitation(being lifted as if flying), bearing the physical injuries of Jesus and literally feeling what Jesus went through some even saw the events including smell, sounds and all other sensations, seeing visions.
                                                                    
              If you doubt these people note that Therese Neumann had been studied and she spoke a wide array of languages though she couldn't understand them such as ancient aramaic(Jesus tongue), French, Italian, etc. She herself was German. She spoke not only some of the quotes in the bible but others too. Among her extraordinary 'feat' was she didn't take any nourishment for decades. She was studied to prove that she didn't take any nourishment or to counter proof it but the study was stopped at the 14th day since a man would already die at the 11th day had he not eaten anything by that day. She worked as usual though she didn't eat anything for decades.
              The Allied forces marked her town to be saved from heavy bombardment in WWII and tried to preserve her town as much as they could though 1/3 of the town was inevitably destroyed. 
                                                                    
              If you think they had sixth senses than you're lost. If you think they are just a remote viewer who happen to be religious then you're lost too. Then again do you really think that a remote viewer doesn't involve spiritism? That would be naive at best. Ignorant at worst.
                                                  
              All three had extensive study done on them and nobody nobody could explain what happened to them.

              up of God's reign. Although Satan may act in the world out of
              hatred for God and his kingdom in Christ Jesus, and although his
              action may cause grave injuries - of a spiritual nature and,
              indirectly, even of a physical nature- to each man and to society,
              the action is permitted by divine providence which with strength
              and gentleness guides human and cosmic history. It is a great
              mystery that providence should permit diabolical activity, but "we
              know that in everything God works for good with those who love
              him."<sup>275</sup></p>

              <p>thanks for the post sgmacross...i agreed with everything in most ways except the last part where it says its a great mystery that God would allow such diablolical acts..it is simple to see actually..</p>
              <p>satan issued a challenge to God's right of sovereignty..citing that creatures can lead better lives even if limitted by their own rule than living endlessly under God's rule..</p>
              <p>by allowing what has happend to happen, all areas of such self governance is being tested..mankind has used all forms of governments till date only to always get into wars and bloodshed...no happiness..only problems..the faithful man Job is but a mini version of the entire challenge..being tested by satan the devil with all ways possible..</p>
              <p>hope i had made a clear point on the great mystery..</p>

              <p>If anyone still doubted about God still doing miracles and all
              other kind of work<br> Research the following people, they lived and some still live
              today</p>
              <p>Therese Neumann from Konnersreuth(died in 1962)</p>
              <p>Padre Pio(died in 1968 )</p>
              <p>Julia Kim from Naju Korea</p>
              <p>All of them are stigmatist that is people who bear the marks of
              Jesus suffering by spiritual means(supernatural)</p>
              <p>Among the things that they did was bilocation(being in more than
              one place at the same time), reading of hearts(feeling what the
              others feeling in their heart), seeing irregardless of distance,
              levitation(being lifted as if flying), bearing the physical
              injuries of Jesus and literally feeling what Jesus went through
              some even saw the events including smell, sounds and all other
              sensations, seeing visions.</p>
              <p>If you doubt these people note that Therese Neumann had been
              studied and she spoke a wide array of languages though she couldn’t
              understand them such as ancient aramaic(Jesus tongue), French,
              Italian, etc. She herself was German. She spoke not only some of
              the quotes in the bible but others too. Among her extraordinary
              ‘feat’ was she didn’t take any nourishment for decades. She was
              studied to prove that she didn’t take any nourishment or to counter
              proof it but the study was stopped at the 14th day since a man
              would already die at the 11th day had he not eaten anything by that
              day. She worked as usual though she didn’t eat anything for
              decades.<br> The Allied forces marked her town to be saved from heavy
              bombardment in <span>WWII</span> and tried to preserve her
              town as much as they could though 1/3 of the town was inevitably
              destroyed.</p>
              <p>If you think they had sixth senses than you’re lost. If you
              think they are just a remote viewer who happen to be religious then
              you’re lost too. Then again do you really think that a remote
              viewer doesn’t involve spiritism? That would be naive at best.
              Ignorant at worst.</p>
              <pre>All three had extensive study done on them and nobody nobody could explain what happened to them.

               If anybody think that saints are psychic that is they have ESP ability he is simply dismissing a miracle which is supernatural in nature as a mere man ability while in fact that I strongly believe these people who we consider saints do not view themselves as psychic at all that is what they are experiencing and what they seemed to be able to do was not their own but came as a result of God's grace. In stronger word it was all God's not them.

               If anybody called these saints to be involved in spiritism it was half right and half wrong. We must all realize that God is spirit in fact God is called the Lord of spirits. Jesus WAS NOT a gifted prophet. Jesus was full of spirit. That is to say Jesus was working through the holy spirit which was active and commanding in Him. Jesus WAS NOT   a gifted psychic nor was He involved in witchcraft. So it IS WRONG to say that Jesus was a spiritistist though He was full of the holy spirit. Jesus used the holy spirit which was in Him but He had nothing to do with spiritism like we know or heard as in the occult.
                                <br><br>
               Everything supernatural doesn't come from man. Everything that is supernatural comes from the spirit. So the next time you see someone with a genuine supernatural 'ability' knows it that it doesn't come from the man but from spirit. So the next question should be does it come from God or not.
              <br><br>
              And every thing that came from God IS GREATER than anything else. What is impossible for spirits not from God is perfectly possible with God's spirit.
