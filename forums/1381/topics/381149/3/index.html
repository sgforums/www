              <p>You've got a god see. He can do everything and see everything, but he's too much of a lazy idiot to do anything. So we got our world of plagues and misery, while he's sitting on his butt.</p>
              <p>Then you gotta worship him. Or else HE'LL PUT YOU IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY WITH NO CHANCE OF EVER GETTING OUT, BEING TORTURED WITH THE WORST TORTURES IN THE UNIVERSE, BURNING IN THE ETERNAL PAIN, WRITING IN AGONY AS LITTLE DEVILS PIERCE YOUR SOUL WITH BURNING HOT IRONS AND POUR SALT INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS YOU SCREAM WITH HORRIFIC PAIN. Oh but he loves you too.</p>
              <p>So the way to aviod that is to keep thinking I LOVE GOD in your head every sunday when you rather be out on Orchard road with your friends, until you start to hear voices in your head, but don't worry, its not mental disease, its religion. But recent studies have shown both to be about the same... hmm...</p>
              <p>But there are plenty of advantages! If you kill 30 people or commit mass murder, all you have to do is say I LOVE GOD in your head and kill yourself, for then you''ll go to heaven just because you love him. On the other hand, Ghandi and Mother Teresa will go to hell because they didn't accept jesus. Aww...</p>
              <p>Oh and don't listen to scientists either, not even your biology teacher. Because years of scientific research by people much smarter than your priest can't be better than a dusty old book written by cavemen. So when scientists try to tell you about evolution, aviod all the facts and talk like a 6 year old, and keep shouting GOD DID IT until they give up and go away.</p>

              You know what I saw just last sunday over a thousand people gathered at the city's business district to protest against the arrest of two man. They were allowed there and took pictures together, read poems, discussing one with another. many came from outside towns and other far provinces.
              <br><br>
              Those students you saw they were not subdued they were allowed to carry on with their protest the police was there to ensure order was maintained but they were not stopping the protest.

              A Singapore police officer making death threat to a citizen:
                                
              Gary: He said to me at the lift lobby 90% of the exact words - <b>â€�Mr Tan,if you walk out of here tomorrow,you might get killed.You might meet with a mysterious accident,you might disappear and nobody will know what happened to you! Mr Tan, some things and people in this country you cannot offend! Some people are above all things! You better make sure you know this! Mr Tan,we can arrange for things to happen to you.You understand or not!â€�</b>
                                
                                <br><br>
               A brave mother speaking up, she was threaten her son life was threaten<br><br>
                                
              If I know there is something wrong, I will try to set it right whether or not it is my business to do so. At my age, I have not lost the fire in my belly. But such a busybody trait has got me into a lot of trouble because I'm not Prof Lee Wei Ling, who is the daughter of MM Lee Kuan Yew and sister of PM Lee Hsien Loong.
                                
              <b>I was threatened to shut up. My son's life will be in danger if I continue to set things right. My son has a hard time in schools.</b>
                                
              I have many personal experiences with MOE, which is very guilty of not setting things right. <b>They allow teachers and principals to abuse students. Their educators cheat, lie but such cases were covered up. MOE condone wrong doings of their staff. One of their PR officers even threatened an editor against pursuing a case I was complaining.</b>
                                
              I have an extremely hard time with the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) recently. I find the officers very KL, making things more difficult for me after I complained to Minister Wong Kan Seng. Many people said I deserve it. For setting things right?
                                
              <b>Even in a government hospital, my son and I were not spared</b>. I wrote to Minister of Health Khaw Boon Wan but sigh...... Luckily, I would be meeting Prof Lee Wei Ling. She has agreed to see my son.
