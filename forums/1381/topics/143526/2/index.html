Most see it as a religion, not a relationship between god and himself. They also fail to understand the most important part of the message in the bible: grace.<br><br>Unlike islam, they see it as a relationship between allah and themselves, and all the code of law given by the prophet are eternally binding and correct. The code of law is punishing also to those who want to leave the muslim faith. So once u believe as a muslim, u can never backslide. Seeing the deterioriation of values in the west make pple more convince that a code of law is needed to guide pple in these uneasy times, and Islam provided that answer for most pple.<br><br>The church is also partly to be blamed, emphasize on 'can-dos' and 'cannot-dos' too much until the grace message is diminished. Pple left church when they feel rejected (homosexuals/adulterers etc) and when they cannot recouncil the preachings to grace and to their own lifestyles. The ungrace present in the church will not help this situation. Men knew they are all sinners, so when they conform to the church, they leave the church. Hence a drop in the number of Christians.</div>
