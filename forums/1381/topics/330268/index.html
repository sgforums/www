              <p>Soosiang sometimes God gives the grace of forgiveness to certain people so that they could forgive their enemy.</p>
              <p>God is a powerful God who could change hearts.</p>
              <p>I've had one experience in which God gave me the grace of forgiving another person. In an instant my peaking anger turned into love literally. I still rememeber how much I wanted to say Man I love you. I really love you [in God]. I was too ashamed to utter the words as the whole people inside the van might hear it and laughed at me or thought I was trying to act  holy or something.</p>
              <p>I really had love for that guy somehow I knew his life was really pitiful. Now on this earth and later after he died. I don't know how I could be sure of that but I just knew that for sure. That's why I felt that I had big compassion and love towards him. My exploding anger tunerd into compassion and love in an instant. I never forget what God did to me that day.</p>
              <p>Maybe I was wrong for not speaking up my love and compassion towards him. But he never gave me trouble ever since. <strong>Not even once</strong>. Let it be clear that the offending person wasn't looking at me when I
              felt love for him he never did look at me at all. He was in front of me
              so I was able to see him but he was not able to see me.</p>
              <p>Who is like you our God.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I just want to add that without the grace to forgive from God it's very hard to forgive some people who logically do not deserve to be forgiven. At most you could promise yourself not to seek revenge. Let God do his part on that.</p>
              <p>What's the point of forgiving another person if he or she doesn't even want to admit his/her transgressions let alone felt sorry for their transgressions against you and still commiting them on regular basis. On and on and on.</p>
              <p>I guess that's why God wants people first to repent and felt sorry for their sins before forgiving them.</p>
              <p>I know people who could make 70x7 a little number. I know perhaps Jesus didn't mean a literal number of 490 but still . . .Jesus thought the number was large enough to convey His message of forgiveness. And Jesus did say we must forgive another person when he <strong>asks</strong> for forgiveness.</p>
