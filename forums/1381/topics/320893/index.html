              <p>sin as in the Christian context - there is no such thing as greater sin or lesser sin.</p>
              <p>sin as in the context of wrong doing - sure there are differences - for example in the court of law.</p>

              <p>Well I think sins cover a full spectrum.</p>
              <p>Quote from the link ChinEng gave,</p>
              <p><em>Actual sin, consisting of evil acts, words, and deeds, is in turn
                                  divided into mortal sin, in which the perpetrator deliberately turns
                                  away from God, and venial sin, <strong>a less serious transgression</strong> committed
                                  without full awareness of wrongdoing.</em></p>
              <p>In that paragraph there are less serious sins and I think that's only one way of categorizing sins according to its severity.</p>
              <p>Jesus also spoke that every sins could be forgiven except the sin of insulting the Holy spirit.</p>
              <p>Would a man who fell in love with another man's wife but did nothing immoral with her sins<br> as grave as another man who fell in love and went to bed with her on many occasions?</p>
              <p>would a man who hurted his friend's feeling commits a sin as grave as one who killed his friend?</p>
              <p>I don't think so. God is fair.</p>
              <p>If men who are evil know that an unlawful act deserve punishment and weigh each crime according to its severity I don't see why God who is holy would not.</p>

              <p>They didn't just ate the fruit of knowledge...they broke God's law. And that sinning and for every sin there is  a punishment. God could not live together with sinful creations so He casted them out of Eden.</p>

              <p>but we dont call breaking the law of a country as sinning right?</p>
              <p>Sin, from what i gather is used more for religious laws and morals.</p>
              <p>Its still hard to think that back in the Old Testament times, theres all the rituals and punishments for a variety of 'wrongdoings', can find it in the Books of the Law (first few books).</p>
              <p>Well, i know a sin is a sin, just like how a lie is a like (doesnt matter if its 'white' or not).  And we are all born sinners and need God's sanctification. </p>
              <p>My next point is, the world is filled with sin, agreed?, and how would we go about being 'destined for heaven' if we fall now and again? (sin is sin?)</p>

              There are felonies and misdemeanours. They may all be crime, but they still vary in severity. You can scream "BUT A CRIME IS A CRIME" all you like, but don't expect us to dish out capital punishment to people who exceed the speed limit.
              
              In short, yes, there is. Though sin is always preferably avoided, there are different levels to sin.

              <p>They didn't just ate the fruit of knowledge...they broke God's
                  law. And that sinning and for every sin there is  a
                  punishment. God could not live together with sinful creations so He
                  casted them out of Eden.</p>

              <p><br>actually if you read carefully what i said, u would noticed my main point was not the damned fruit.i said they were not supposed to. meaning they fall short of God's laws.=sin</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe if we say sin=death den it will be clearer we are not supposed to sin regardless of the severity of the sin??</p>
