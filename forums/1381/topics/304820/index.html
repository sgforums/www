            <div class='col-md body'>Life as a secret Christian convert<br>By Linda Pressly<br>BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents<br><br>Abandoning Islam for Christianity is such a sensitive issue in Malaysia that many converts find themselves leading a secret, double life.<br><br>Maria - not her real name - is a young Malaysian woman who has lived a secret and sometimes fearful life since she converted from Islam to Christianity.<br><br>Apostasy, as it is known, has become one of the most controversial issues in Malaysia today.<br><br>Maria became a Christian over a decade ago when she was 18. She says no-one forced her to convert, that she made the decision after studying different religious texts.<br><br>Conversion is deemed so sensitive in Malaysia that even the priest who baptised her refused to give her a baptismal certificate.<br><br>And, even now, the church she attends asked her to sign a declaration stating the church is not responsible for her conversion.<br><br>"My church says if the authorities come, they are not going to stand up for me. I have to stand up for myself," she said.<br><br>Not even Maria's family know she has converted.<br><br>"If my family find out I am no longer a Muslim they will completely cut me off. That means my name in the family will be erased.<br><br>"I could migrate, but the problem is I want to stay in Malaysia, because this is my country. And I love my family. I just want to live peacefully."<br><br>Full report in here :<br><a href="http://www.malaysia-today.net/2008/content/view/78/46/" rel="nofollow">http://www.malaysia-today.net/2008/content/view/78/46/</a><br><br>========================<br><br>"My church says if the authorities come, they are not going to stand up for me.

You really have to decide when the time comes if ever but I believe it already has. There's no in between.<br><br>Do you have enough faith to choose God over the state or do you want to play it safe in this world hence choosing the state over God....<br><br>I think(and from my own experience) many, possibly most people would choose the state over God hence committing grave sins in the process because most people don't know God.<br><br>You'd be fighting against the odds if you were to choose God. But really anyone who fights against God are really the ones fighting against the odds....LOL</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a few years ago, i went to malaysia for a youth conference. there were some malays youth who gave their testimonals and it shocked the audience because the conference was held in a hotel (with malays workers of course). i was observing the reaction of the crowd because it was something very new. to my surprise, there were no much of reaction as it seems that it is a common thing in malaysia nowadays. One of the malay youth stated that the first choice that they made was to leave their family because their family no longer accepts them. There was also another person (who is a adult) who testified  abt his conversion from Islam to Chrisitanity. It was directly kind of conversion because it was not unlawful to convert from a muslim to a chrisitian but they must go through some kind of conversion course which was offered by the authorities. I have some malay friends who are christian too in singapore. they are open with their faith and they have christian name too. the people around them accepts them as who they are and there is nothing to hide at all.
