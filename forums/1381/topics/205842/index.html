            <div class='col-md body'><strong>You were weighed but you were found wanting</strong><br><br>Ps 143:2 Do not enter into judgment with Your servant, <strong>For in Your sight no one living is righteous</strong>.<br><br>Think of that, muse on that, ponder on that. NO ONE LIVING IS RIGHTEOUS IN THE EYES OF GOD. That's you and me and everybody for :  ".....all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," [Romans 3:23]<br><br>we all have sinned at least once. We have not reflected in our lives God's glory.<br><br>What is the glory of God referred to in this verse?<br><br>For sure it refers to God's <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">moral</span></strong> attributes.  it  refers to God's manisfested excellent moral attributes. God is holy, righteous, good and etc. But have we been righteous and holy all the time or are there times wherein we fall short of holiness and righteousness?<br><br>Surely we can recall times of unholiness and righteouosness on our part right? During times like that we 'fall short of the glory of God".<br><br>"For there is no difference; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," [Romans 3:22-23]<br><br>that's why in God's eyes NO ONE LIVING IS RIGHTEOUS. And where wil the unrighteous be at eternity? lake of fire. But you have not sinned so gravely like Hitler?!!!!? You have not sinned so low as the female prostitutes?!!!? You have not been addicted to drugs like the others?!!!? and many other man-made standards of righteousness.<br><br>You see the standard of righteousness is not other people. It's God. God standard is perfect righteousness. Do you have it or not? I don't know how much movie tickets costs now it's been a long time since i have not watched a movie flick, but Superman's coming and i think i will watch that [I wrote this in the other forum when Superman was still in the offing].<br><br>supposing we go to the movie house to watch the movie. And when we got there we learned that movie tickets costs 6$ each. You sink your hand into your pockets and found out you only have 4$. I fished for my wallet and found out to my dismay i only have 1$.<br><br>Question: which of us will go in? None of us. the 'standard' is 6$. I may have lesser than you but still the same, we fall short of the price of the movie ticket which is 6$.<br><br>The standard is perfect righteousness. How much do you have compared to Hitler? Maybe you have a lot morally than him but the essential question is: are you up to the standard? Assuredly not. You are a sinner. You need a righteousness outside of yourself. you need a Savior.<br><br>Ro 4:25 who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our <strong>justification.</strong><br><br>See that word 'justification'? that means perfect righteousness. it's complete and perfect and eternal righteousness. Jesus Christ came to the world to die for sinners and rose again so that sinners may be justified [perfectly righteous in the eyes of God].<br><br>what you need to do is trust in that work of salvation alone. Accept Christ's righteousness NOW my frined. Rely solely on what Christ did for you.<br><br>it's simple because it's a gift from God. it's simple because it came from the mercy and kindness of God to helpless and hopeless sinners like us.<br><br>Note: you may have heard this message over and over again. You have become wearied by it. question is: what are you doing with this truth my friend? Have you run to Christ? The more you delay and put off recieving the perfect rightousness of Christ through the offer of the gospel, the more your heart will become hardenend.<br><br>The Israelites were wearied by Isaiah's monotonous preaching. It's always the same message they already know over and over again. They complained and even ridiculed Isaiah: "This guy Isaiah is teaching us elementary truths. What!!?? are we little kids just over our milk days?!!!?<br><br>[Isa 28:9  "Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just drawn from the breasts?]---&gt;it should be  BREAS...but the forum censors such words.<br><br>His line of teaching is boooring. Line by lIne. precept by precept......it's sooooo booooring.<br><br>[Isa 28:10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept, Line upon line, line upon line, Here a little, there a little."]<br><br>God made His message through Isaiah simple and easy to understand that even a little child could comprehend it. In the end, they will not have to complain to God that they did not clearly understood His message for God through Isaiah clearly, over and over again, repeated the simple message of repentance to them.<br><br>God is saying to you now my friend: repent and rely on Christ alone for salvation.<br><br>Life is short my friend, think about eternity. Where will you spend it?<br></div>
