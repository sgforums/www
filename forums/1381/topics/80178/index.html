            <div class='col-md body'>yes indeed. We must be wary of not misusing God's name in vain. Some christians like to say..'God is speaking thru me..blah...blah....' so that what he says carry heavier weightage and ppl will tend to listen..which in fact he is carrying out his own personal agenda. such a case is typical example of misusing God's name and putting humans words into the mouth of God.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prophesizing in current context is no longer like what those prophets did during the OT days.  "Prophets" nowdays are no longer going to say "GOD WILL MAKE YOU A KING" sort of thing. In those times, we have to be mindful that prophets existed and are anointed by GOD becos there were no scriptures then! So it is totally possible then that God would use them to speak His truth to His people.<br><br>NOW today if today is someone were to say "Hey God is gonna come tomorrow." WE KNOW it is WRONG becos GOD said in His bible that no one will know when He will come. So a modern day "PROPHET" is ONE who speaks the truth about what is written in the bible, about what had happen, what happen and what will happen according to the bible. That is what we call a MODERN DAY PROPHET.<br><br>And in any case, in any sort of prohpecies made nowadays, it is good to check on the bible. Bear in mind that any so called prophecies made in the name of Jesus is all wrong. GOD still do speak through people nowadays.  A pastor once prophesized for a fren of mine in a mass meeting that she will become an evangelist and later on in 2 separate occassions, another 2 pastors prophesized the same thing for her. Now, she is in East Asia doing  full time christian work.<br><br>So, bear in mind, In Deuteronomy it is said "....Which I have commanded..." It is wrong ONLY when GOD did not command the person to say the particular thing but I can assure you that GOD did and still does speak through people nowadays, so its up to us who listen to discern whats from God and whats not.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think most of the misunderstanding of religions, in this case christianity, comes from a lack of understanding of the context of what was said and mentioned.  Many things in the bible need to be read in context. Thus If anyone have anything that he/she has not enuff evidence to conclude of something, it is good to ask, It is only fair. I do that to all my frens of other faiths too, and i find it an enriching experience becos whatever I know of the Quran and Buddhist scriptures, I only know in parts...so i really cant conclude anything from them if i do not take into the context...it would not be fair then...</div>
