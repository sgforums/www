              <p>It finally becomes clear.</p>
              <p>Jooled prayed and got pissed because God was not at home. Says He is giving hj and bj to angels and procrastinate.</p>
              <p>What a loser, must have waited and waited.</p>
              <p>By the way what is a Christian God. God is God. Whether in this name or that name. In this form or that form.</p>
              <p>You are lazy and  expected magic from God to benefit you. <em>Tan koo koo. </em></p>
              <p>You misunderstood what God is all about.</p>
              <p>Heard of the saying "God help those who help themself."</p>
              <p>It means you must strive for yourself, and if you have God in your mind and heart, you will end up a better person, whether you succeeded or not.</p>
              <p>Riches or power is not the point, the point is after all the struggle, you look back at your struggles and you feel good, because you have put up a good effort. And within yourself you have peace.</p>
              <p>Right now your emotions are crappy because you missed the point about God.  You are  cursing and scolding. This shows that you are a loser. </p>

              <p><br>No. Here's a very simple fact : Even Christians go to hell.</p>
              <p>The concept of Christianity is that people who sinned goes to hell. and this means everyone will go to hell because there is no one who is righteous. Due to God's grace to forgive us, he sent Jesus to pay for our sins through death.</p>
              <p>By repenting and praying to God to forgive our sins, we are given a chance to start anew. God wants EVERYONE to repent from the sins, but not everyone do so. The ultimate decision goes to us, whether we repent or not. It does not lie with God to chose who will be save and who will be not.</p>
              <p>So, based on what I said. Do you think a "Christian" who "repented" but sin as if it's nothing will be saved? The answer is of course : No.</p>

              <p>I  am pointing out to  you, even in USA, they have Christian terrrorists. So you have to be careful, who you listen to. Do not assume just because they are Americans, therefore they are correct.</p>

              <p>Let's see how this end up like this...</p>
              <p>First I pointed out most
                                              Christians I met in other forums tend to view 
                      Allah as a pagan
                                              god.</p>
              <p>You reply asking me if I wonder what kind of Christians they are and suggest that most probably they are deviationist and mainstream
                                              Christians do not "hang out" with them.</p>
              <p>Which to I explained they are Americans and some of them (maybe I wasn't clear but I mean Non-Americans here) were influenced by the Americans.</p>
              <p>To which you reply:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>What kind of Christians blow up half of a public building in

              <p>What kind of Christians in America stock guns

              <p>Which I see it as referring to the American Christians (those who I debated with regarding whether Allah is or isn't God)</p>
              <p>Or maybe you were reply to my second question, are the Americans mainstream Christians? Is that an answer to my question?</p>
              <p>And I do not see the need to bring in the Oklahoma bombing, which I don't know what are you trying to drive at until your latest post.</p>
              <p>Me using Blanket analogy? You got to be joking I got that impression that you were thinking this way from your replies.</p>
              <p>I'm did not assume what they said is correct (which if I did, why would I bother debating with them?)</p>

              <p>Good of you to bring the discussion  back to the topic.</p>
              <p>Also nice to know you argued with those Americans.</p>
              <p>The word Allah, has been used before Islam was founded.</p>
              <p>It is used by the people of the the Middle East, and the Jews and Christians included, (Jews and Christians as followers of the religion, not  race).</p>
              <p>The name Allah as meaning the word God to the Jewish and Christian alike.</p>
              <p>To the other ethnic groups Allah may mean, the Moon God, or any of the diety stored in the Kaaba at that time.</p>
              <p>Mecca in those time was a trading hub, and various nationalities arrive there with their own representations of God. To the individual groups, it was their supreme God, to the others it was their diety.</p>
              <p>Basically, they have all the concept of God with them. It is bigotry that deemed this God is <strong>the God</strong>, and the others are pagan.</p>
              <p>Therefore Allah is another word for God. This has been adopted by the Islamics as the name for their God. It still represents the same entity as the Jews and the Christians, the ones that originated the word God Almighty. </p>

              <p><br> No. Here's a very simple fact : Even Christians go to hell.</p>
              <p>The concept of Christianity is that people who sinned goes to
              hell. and this means everyone will go to hell because there is no
              one who is righteous. Due to God's grace to forgive us, he sent
              Jesus to pay for our sins through death.</p>
              <p>By repenting and praying to God to forgive our sins, we are
              given a chance to start anew. God wants EVERYONE to repent from the
              sins, but not everyone do so. The ultimate decision goes to us,
              whether we repent or not. It does not lie with God to chose who
              will be save and who will be not.</p>
              <p>So, based on what I said. Do you think a "Christian" who
              "repented" but sin as if it's nothing will be saved? The answer is
              of course : No.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>anyway, salvation is by grace and not grace plus blah blah blah...so why we repent of our sins? It is the holy spirit that convicts us to repent our sins and why holy spirit come into us, is by god will.. so i felt your statements a little faulted, but overall idea is there</p>

              <p>You may be right, but I don't agree with the statement.</p>
              <p>First, let me reorganise what you said in case I interpret wrong. You are implying double predestinaton. That by God's will, he DETERMINE  who he will send Holy Spirit (HS) to. that is to say, he will determine who he will NOT send HS to. And this means that God has already planned who will go heaven and hell from the moment we are born.</p>
              <p>If you think this way, Christians are no different from Jews.</p>
