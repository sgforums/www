                                      anger, to incite ill-feeling. Yet you go about 
              accussing others of

              <p>So, you do agree that religions tend to preach / increase tolerance? ALL religions at that? In that case, wouldn't religion be good for the person who started this thread?</p>
              <p>In any case, it's funny and ironic for secularists to rant and rave about the intolerance of the religious while demonstrating the very same intolerance they set themselves up against.</p>
