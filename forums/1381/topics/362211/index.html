              <p>Hi Joolead, <br>   <br>      Perhaps what caused you to write in this way, is it because of the past bad experience you had related to Christianity?</p>
              <p>We can think a lot of issues and questions but who can provide the answers to all those that you have thought about?<br><br>Cheers :)</p>

              <p>Faith is akin to a double edged sword with no handle. Use it to settle disputes and answering questions to the world, you'd end up cutting yourself and others.</p>
              <p>For many people, however being a better person and hating with an ever increasing intensity is actually the same thing.</p>
              <p>Hate i think is too strong a word to use. But depising and looking down on unbelievers, pitying them and believing they need to be brought back into the fold is i think, more common. .</p>

              <p>It's not humanity against God, but the devil against God.</p>
              <p>It's not only some Christians who talk crap. There are lots of people who talk crap, including those who don't believe in God... if you get wat i mean.</p>
              <p>It's not only some Christians who seems obsessed with accumulating money... there are some others if you read the news.</p>
              <p>It's good to believe in yourself, but if everybody only believes in themselves and judge everyone else by their own standard, then that's the beginning of the end.</p>
              <p>There ought to be a "standard" where everybody strive towards. If everyone believes that there is a "standard", strive towards that, then that will be the beginning of unity.</p>
              <p>Yes, the FUTURE is in our hands... the peaceful sake of human race depends on unity of them who have one common goal and set of belief.</p>

              <p>It's not humanity against God, but the devil against God.</p>
              <p>It's not only some Christians who talk crap. There are lots of
                  people who talk crap, including those who don't believe in God...
                  if you get wat i mean.</p>
              <p>It's not only some Christians who seems obsessed with
                  accumulating money... there are some others if you read the
                  news.</p>
              <p>It's good to believe in yourself, but if everybody only believes
                  in themselves and judge everyone else by their own standard, then
                  that's the beginning of the end.</p>
              <p>There ought to be a "standard" where everybody strive towards.
                  If everyone believes that there is a "standard", strive towards
                  that, then that will be the beginning of unity.</p>
              <p>Yes, the FUTURE is in our hands... the peaceful sake of human
                  race depends on unity of them who have one common goal and set of
                  belief.</p>

              <p><br>There's NO obligation for anyone to give money. No doubt there are some church leaders who encourage, some who urge, some who give guilt trip... So, is it only about giving money that you are upset with Christianity? Cuz you seem to focus on that point a lot. If that's the case, the next time you hear any leader or pastor talk about giving money, then don't give lor.</p>
              <p>If you believe that you perish and have no more existence after death, then perhaps religion's not for you. But do you think there's a chance that there's something after death?</p>
