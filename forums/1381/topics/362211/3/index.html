              <p>Hi Joolead:</p>
              <p>thanks for your response.</p>
              <p>Being purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ, i am not free to
              do as i will to my life. And if i go and jump down, i act in
              defiance towards God, which is not according to His will. He may of
              course inflict me with sickness or sudden death.</p>
              <p>God is omnipotent. He also created reason and logic. Go around
              asking money isn't reasonable and logical.</p>
              <p>I do not use God to get rich. My bank account only have 58
              dollars, and will deduct 2 dollars by OCBC end month.</p>
              <p>But you have indeed made a valid point, actions speak louder
              than words. If we say we love people and so on, and continue living
              "high-class" and elite, then we are wrong and we should repent and
              really start to love people.</p>
              <p>regards,</p>

              <p>dear don..please do not ever be misled by churches that God will inflict sickness or sudden death..it is our failing bodies that is accountable..remember upon Job..all the sufferings wasnt inflicted by Jehovah isnt it??but by satan..Jehovah doesnt want people to suffer..he feels for everyone of us..why else will he keep postponing destruction?he wants everyone to have enough time to make their decision..he does not create an awful accident just to pluck someone out and place it by his side..he doesnt want our loved ones to be sadden by our demise..</p>

              <p>All god all religion exists and i believe and acknowledge their past, histories, novels, and holiness. All religion founders are holy and respectful and they definitely possess almightiness in themselve to save earthlings from suffering. It's the naiveness, jealousy, selfishness, Greed in human that misintepret the religion point of views, the actual practice,and the kind of unparellel unshaken faith that once any of the holy god or founder of any religion have had attained have become a legend as time goes by. i can say that for a person to practice, understand and learn the genes of any religion, below are some important advise which are essential</p>
              <p>Know the history of your founder clearly, study and have at least a certain level of understanding and keep on finding facts on a single qury.(At least 50 source thats proves the holistic fact. Not hearsay from those whom are not sure and are vulnerable of cheating you in any form of gain he/she stands. As ''facts'' are of different classes, family and sects nowadays. The greater diversification of multiple religion actually makes people giddy. Whereby minority from different religion stir-up aweful stories or disrespect other people whom believe in different religion. Whereby all this nusiance give way to many social factors.</p>
              <p>Do Not Support Or Believe Religion Scam:</p>
              <p>As they are unreal and could not really help people, also it's sinful and had bad karma in cheating the mass instead of delivering them for your own gain. Also, this will spoilt any religion name and this will cause naive locals tend to lost faith easily and create bewilderment, and also stands a great chance for those in other religion to ''use'' it to denounce and promote their religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spreading of any religion is a holy matter, the one who does it must be REALLY impartial, have ultimate strong faiths and really know his''god'' well also upon exhuasting everywords do not curse if the listener don't believe in it or are convince. Do not use, personal, untrue and swindling stories or facts to ''instil'' faith in the person brain, yes you might have another ''new'' believer but since the way of imparting faith had become wrong or unorthodox... the ''new'' comer would had at least 25% chances of spreading or imparting too little, or his ''improvished version'' ( add on ) or part and puzzle of the true meaning to the next generation.... this sub-concious in a long run spoilt and deminish any god faith and almightiness. That perpahs why some people pray god answer while others no... if you join any religion without truely believing in it or simply half-believe.. you are no different as a free thinker. BecaUSE your half-hearted or being tall around faith is proven furtile to god. But this definitely won't be make known to everyone with naked eyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Almost all religion, way of teachings and the original scripts had been lost, alter by later man whom are not god, unholy, but he himself think he is god. Thus nowadys we don't see miraculous god sighting and those days when god appear him/herself is a mudane had become a legend now... and craving to see any of this miraculous god sightings would be denounce or insult as being superstitious to many layman navie earthlings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any religion founder presumingly god or holy one are saint and sages. They are merciful and forgiving. Thus there won't be any clashes in believing in more than 1 religion. Also Religion is a school of thoughts in life and also our guidance yardstick to lead us smoothly and perhaps can help us out in times of need. It's stupid man that's make religion too dangerous to talk about. Whoever or whatever claims to have 1 god, the best religion he/she is bullshitting unless he/she denounce and wipe out other that he/she do not recogniZed or is not the best. The saying goes, if you are the best, prove the others are crapps, if there's only 1 god, say it out loud and insult those other gods with vengence. So far those who does that has been melted out by almighty forces. The religion still stays. Boy and Girls, If any religion or god you do not believe in, please respect and check their history. Facts has been in existence many century before you were born. If the fact relics, history of any religion god are proven fake or unheard of then you must point the finger in the mirror and laugh at yourself. As all your forebearer, ancestor, many generation had been conned till now. If you still think you are the savoiur of the ''truth''. Think again, is there any chance that you are the lucky one out of the million whom had found out this ''truth'' that everything was ''fake''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i had no knowledge of any god even if i see a group of people praying to Shit. I will keep quiet and study and understand that why are they people praying to shit? Everything tell tales, from this we can reflects how intelligent this type of people are and how high or important they stand in society.</p>
              <p>GOD DON'T FIGHT,HUMAN WILL</p>
              <p>The lack of understanding, unwilling to learn, or simply being mislead by others in education or while in any places, or social group. I metaphor a simple story for religion stated below</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Sword is once an unformidable and useful weapon being used by heroes and warrior at war. The sword is past down from this heroes and warrior to their son. The son has lesser knowledge and aility to use the Sword being passed down by their forebearer. The sword is really old and blurnt when it was pass down to their grandson. None or very few really know swordplay, however the sword is still the same, the one who weild it is for show or a joke.</p>
              <p>However this sword was passed onto many generation... some say this sword can... some say the sword will...end of the day they wear the sword in the name of their father. But the actual skill to activate command the sword to do great things and acheivement had been lost or incomplete or had been change maybe by 1 of the generation. These people then carry the sword to walk around ''trying to gain recognition and glory'' that he is a warrior or their grand grand great father was once a formidable warrior...????</p>
              <p>In the eye of those who know the evolution and history and current facts.. religion is drying out soon despite many people still wear a sword walking around.. Those who really can weild a sword had died out. or less than 10% left.. hope this llot can at least teach some skills. As locals nowadays pray to whatever god or religion as long as their is gain..... or rather  blacksheep bewilder naive lot causing initially a historical iron sword to become a toy sword... these give rise to initially toy sword claiming to be iron sword.. Human error always. In time of stability and busy lifestyle.. Human forsake or are half-hearted in toward religion pratice. This is why evil abound and are getter stronger, and god forsake us all because our faith and sincerity is not enough to ask god in any favour. The mind, heart and soul. these 3 need to be strong, pure and always revitalized we can move objects in the air too with simply a  wink and thought. thus we can communicate god in a better way. This is a glamour last time for almost all human. Now if you can bend a spoon you are really consider ''god--like'' . Don't be laugh at thanks</p>

Organs are holy and should die as 1 piece and not fragmented to other people body. Not say iam cruel or not compassionate but in past histories there ar no such precedence of donating organs to starnger or rather those who need it. Yes, if to parents as they give us initially, given back to save them is very obvious filial piety. Nowadays to greater extend maybe only to loves one or sibblings.

              <p>Why individual race couldn't speak their mother tongue well, in writing and mentally? and thus being insulted or rather being laughed at when they travel overseas and most sensitively back to their COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. If one do not know your language well, not only will you be laugh at and if you hates your language though, dude.. i got nothing to say you are as well disregarding your race at the back of your IC living in bewilderment.</p>
              <p>If you don't know your language well, there are many danger....</p>
              <p>1) insults and jokes from within your area or life cycle</p>
              <p>2) do not know anything about your roots or history</p>
              <p>3)Easily brain-wash or being conned into any activities, in other words being make used of blindly AS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOURSELF WELL.</p>
              <p>4) Offspring living in the outer shell design like Suzuki but motor is hyunda thus creating more wannabe xxxx ???? bringing more joyous and fun to the society with jokes.</p>
              <p>Any Japanese doesn't know how to speak Japs? Any Korea doesn't know how to speak Korean. Any British doesn't know Queen's english?</p>
              <p>MAYBE WE SHOULD STUDY HARDER IN SCHOOL.... BUT WHAT IF WE REALLY DID OUR BEST AND WE STILL HAVE LIMITIVITY TO OUR LANGUAGE?? ARE WE STUPID? OR is there any other reasons?.....</p>
              <p>Example:The hideous fact of chinese ''learning'' or rather ''brush up'' their language...again.. IT IS chinese learning CHINESE LANGUAGE. Ever heard of japanese, learning japanese language, when they are grown up? A worthy effort of a typical chinese finally learning his/her own roots. ALSO THE LANGUAGE COULD BE USED IN CHINA FOR BUSINESE PURPOSES.&lt;-- another reason perhaps why a chinese would learn chinese language.... Last time i heard some lot of these people could only, the best write their 3 chinese letter names....</p>
              <p>would like to hear more comments and follow up</p>
