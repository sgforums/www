              <p>When you have full understanding about something, you'll be able to rule over that thing. In the same way, if anyone is able to fully understanding and therefore be able to prove God, then the person is bigger than God. So in a way, NO ONE human is able to prove to you. Well, let me correct myself... you can ask God to prove himself to you.</p>
              <p>The waiting for Christian to go to a "better place" then come back and tell us thing doesn't work for everyone. Jesus who lives in the "better place" came to earth to tell, but not everyone believed. Will you believe if someone who lives in a "better place" go talk to you? Same thing, how about you ask God, since you don't believe Christians?</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm sure lots of people, not only Christians, donate their organs. So that part is taken care of.</p>
              <p>We don't kill ourselves to honor God, that's cult.</p>
              <p>Since I believe that after death, my soul continues its journey, and that i believe that it goes to either heaven or hell, obviously i work towards going to heaven. Of the many religions in this world, Christianity teaches that if we believe in Jesus, we will be in heaven with him. I make a choice to believe that.</p>
              <p>But what if it's like what you said? That I go to Pearly Gates and St Petes tells me wrong religion and I go to hell? Well, if that happens, i won't mind you having the last laugh... But what if I'm right? Where will you be?</p>

              <p>Hi Joolead:</p>
              <p>I was recently going through your posts. Let me tell you an incident.</p>
              <p>There was once a pastor from America who went to the Soviet Union. He went preaching about the health and wealth gospel. Back then, nearly all of the people/villagers in the Soviet Union were poor, very poor. He promised to heal them of sickness, if they would come to his gathering. Many came, NONE was healed. And the ones who came, spitted on the pastor.</p>
              <p>It's sad that by our actions, people despise Christianity. People assume Christians are a group of brainwashed fools, that are manipulated, because of their weak state of mind, by unscrupulous leaders that are only out there to make more money.</p>
              <p>This is not what we should be like.</p>
              <p>Our actions should glorify God, and even to cause all to give glory to God. And if it doesn't, we should repent.</p>
              <p>Having said this, another point to share would be, to know the Truth, you would have to look at the Bible. And look at it fully, in context and not partially. All sorts of people will come and say all sorts of things and say that they represent Christianity. Some would say God will give you great wealth and prosperity on earth, and i would show that the Apostles are beheaded, crucified, jailed, and put into exile. And almost all the Apostle die a martyr's death. You might have heard that we need to give an offering of 10% and so on, but i would show you that God has given His Son for us. Christians and non Christians alike, shouldn't just take out "Golden nuggets" from the Bible and showing it to the world, while ignoring the Full Gospel.</p>
              <p>The Bible holds the Authority, not mere man. Because it's the spoken Word of God.</p>

                          and i would show that the Apostles are beheaded, crucified, jailed,
                          and put into exile. And almost all the Apostle die a martyr's
                          death. You might have heard that we need to give an offering of 10%
                          and so on, but i would show you that God has given His Son for us.
                          Christians and non Christians alike, shouldn't just take out
                          "Golden nuggets" from the Bible and showing it to the world, while
                          ignoring the Full Gospel.</p>
              <p>The Bible holds the Authority, not mere man. Because it's the
                          spoken Word of God.</p>

              <p>Hi Joolead:</p>
              <p>Thanks for your response. Let me further share with you.</p>
              <p>When i look at another person, and have been asked to make a guess at how tall he/she is, i suppose i would be able to make a reasonable guess. Eg. i would guess that Yao Ming would be over 2 metres instead of unreasonably guessing that he is 10 metres. Why? because we have in us, the idea of length, how much roughly is 1 metre and 1 cm and so on.</p>
              <p>When i look at the earth, i do see injustice, i do see unhappiness, i do see death, i do see evil. What i see is the lacking of the earth.</p>
              <p>But how do i know that the earth is lacking?</p>
              <p>I believe there is in our hearts the idea/concept of perfection. But is there anything in the world that is perfect? If i have an idea of the length of 1 metre, i can go refer to a ruler. But where can i refer to perfection?</p>
              <p>Only God is perfect. I believe when the time comes, when i [God willing] am by His side, i would know what is perfect. But now, i do not know fully.</p>
              <p>The Gospel should start from God, not from man. By this i mean, we should not taylor the Gospel to lure and attract man. I should not start to share the Gospel by saying got nice nice heaven, got lots of blessings and money. But i should start by saying, there is God, God is Holy, and we are but mere sinners. And we should repent. God is loving, and has given His Son as an atonement for our sins, and by believing in Him, we are declared righteous. And we are to worship God.</p>
              <p>I couldn't kill myself, because my life does not belong to me. God hates suicide. And if i love Him, i will not do that.</p>
              <p>1. i am willing to donate my organs when i die.</p>
              <p>2. when i am dead, God willing i will know and get to be at the better place.</p>
              <p>3. in the first place, i would not offend God and ask Him to rescue me. He is omnipotent, He is also Holy and Just. He can perform miracles, but He is not anyone's servent, being called to perform.</p>
              <p>4. If you really need help financially, that makes the 2 of us. Let us encourage each other to strive to be more financially savvy.</p>

              <p>GOD don't hate  suicide he will be more happy to see you in heaven don't you want to heaven after dead.</p>
              <p>sure he is holy ominpotent thru you so that you can go around asking money rite.</p>
              <p>dun try to bullshit and brain wash me. if you believe in GOD then give me your entire saving from your bank unless you don't believe he is just and holy. he will truly bless you with the 10 20 or 60 time reture ...oyah by the way include your CPF,oso.</p>
              <p>then i will believe then there is ajust and holy god. and lastly as i say before go and jump down from the 40 floor.</p>
              <p>no use try toking action is louder then words.</p>
              <p>you can't do it because there is still doubts and you don't believe in him as ominpotent one and just and holy one since  you preaching alone the way as he is just ,holy and ominpotent . Do it and  proof that i am wrong ..come on an what are you waiting for .</p>

              <p>Hi Joolead:</p>
              <p>thanks for your response.</p>
              <p>Being purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ, i am not free to do as i will to my life. And if i go and jump down, i act in defiance towards God, which is not according to His will. He may of course inflict me with sickness or sudden death.</p>
              <p>God is omnipotent. He also created reason and logic. Go around asking money isn't reasonable and logical.</p>
              <p>I do not use God to get rich. My bank account only have 58 dollars, and will deduct 2 dollars by OCBC end month.</p>
              <p>But you have indeed made a valid point, actions speak louder than words. If we say we love people and so on, and continue living "high-class" and elite, then we are wrong and we should repent and really start to love people.</p>

              <p>When you have full understanding about something, you'll be able
              to rule over that thing. In the same way, if anyone is able to
              fully understanding and therefore be able to prove God, then the
              person is bigger than God. So in a way, NO ONE human is able to
              prove to you. Well, let me correct myself... you can ask God to
              prove himself to you.</p>
              <p>The waiting for Christian to go to a "better place" then come
              back and tell us thing doesn't work for everyone. Jesus who lives
              in the "better place" came to earth to tell, but not everyone
              believed. Will you believe if someone who lives in a "better place"
              go talk to you? Same thing, how about you ask God, since you don't
              believe Christians?</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm sure lots of people, not only Christians, donate their
              organs. So that part is taken care of.</p>
              <p>We don't kill ourselves to honor God, that's cult.</p>
              <p>Since I believe that after death, my soul continues its journey,
              and that i believe that it goes to either heaven or hell, obviously
              i work towards going to heaven. Of the many religions in this
              world, Christianity teaches that if we believe in Jesus, we will be
              in heaven with him. I make a choice to believe that.</p>
              <p>But what if it's like what you said? That I go to Pearly
              Gates and St Petes tells me wrong religion and I go to hell? Well,
              if that happens, i won't mind you having the last laugh... But what
              if I'm right? Where will you be?</p>

              <p>But how do i know that the earth is lacking?</p>
              <p>I believe there is in our hearts the idea/concept of perfection.
              But is there anything in the world that is perfect? If i have an
              idea of the length of 1 metre, i can go refer to a ruler. But where
              can i refer to perfection?</p>
              <p>Only God is perfect. I believe when the time comes, when i [God
              willing] am by His side, i would know what is perfect. But now, i
              do not know fully.</p>
              <p>The Gospel should start from God, not from man. By this i mean,
              we should not taylor the Gospel to lure and attract man. I should
              not start to share the Gospel by saying got nice nice heaven, got
              lots of blessings and money. But i should start by saying, there is
              God, God is Holy, and we are but mere sinners. And we should
              repent. God is loving, and has given His Son as an atonement for
              our sins, and by believing in Him, we are declared righteous. And
              we are to worship God.</p>
              <p>I couldn't kill myself, because my life does not belong to me.
              God hates suicide. And if i love Him, i will not do that.</p>
              <p>1. i am willing to donate my organs when i die.</p>
              <p>2. when i am dead, God willing i will know and get to be at the
              better place.</p>
              <p>3. in the first place, i would not offend God and ask Him to
              rescue me. He is omnipotent, He is also Holy and Just. He can
              perform miracles, but He is not anyone's servent, being called to
              perform.</p>
              <p>4. If you really need help financially, that makes the 2 of us.
              Let us encourage each other to strive to be more financially
              savvy.</p>
