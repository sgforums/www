If we all keep to our own religions/faiths, and yet claim there is religious tolerance, well, it's just self-deceit or self-consolation at best.<br><br>Let's all work together at our own pace to achieve the best possible spiritual cultivation for our own faiths and beliefs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You may be alone in person, but never alone in spirit and will to be close to the Holy Spirit in your own religion.<br><br>May Holy Spirit/God in every religion guide all followers to the path of universal wisdom and love.<br><br>May all be happy and peaceful.<br></div>
