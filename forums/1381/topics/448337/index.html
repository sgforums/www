              <p>Actually, there were many other 'gospels' that were floating around in the first few centuries. The early church compiled the Bible based on the Gospels that were authentic and accurately conveyed the teachings of Jesus Christ, leading to what we have today - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.</p>
              <p>I suppose that some of the others that did not make the cut, including the above 'gospel of Barnabas', may make for interesting reading, but best not to put too much stock in them. As for the Vatican wanting to take a look at this gospel, they may want to study it, but it certainly does not mean that they endorse it.</p>

              <p><br> Agreed!! there were many other 'gospels' that were not included in the Bible as reason shown below;.</p>
              <p> <a href="http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/bible/canon.stm">Christian canons</a> emerged through a complex process in which some books were "chosen" and 
              others were left out. A tradition of use, authority within the 
              communities,  antiquity or apostolic, and orthodoxy were factors in 
              deciding which books were "in" and which were "out."</p>
              <p>http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/bible/outside.stm</p>
              <p>Also, as interesting to read the Gospel of Barnabas, it is more intriguing to know who the person was.</p>
              <p>Barnabas was a Jew born in Cyrus. His name was Joseph and due to his 
              devotion to the cause of Jesus, the other apostles had given him the 
              surname of Barnabas; this term is variously translated as "Son of 
              Consolation" or "Son of Encouragement".</p>
              <p>Paul was a Jew who was persecuting the Christians. He 
              is said to have seen Jesus in a vision and to have become a convert to 
              the creed of Jesus. Among the disciples of Jesus, Barnabas was a dynamic
               evangelist.</p>
              <p>Paul also became a preacher, with the difference that Paul 
              began to over-praise and deify Jesus. "And straightaway he preached 
              Christ in the synagogues, that he is the son of God." (Acts 9: 20).</p>
              <p>ACTS
               9:26 and 27: "And when Saul ( Paul ) was come to Jerusalem he assayed 
              to join himself to the disciples, but they were all afraid of him and 
              believed not that he was a disciple. "But Barnabas took him and brought him to the Apostles"<span style="font-size: small;">.</span></p>
              <p>Such was his influence to the first few follower of Jesus teachings, yet we knew little of him as oppose to Paul.</p>
              <p>Back to question asked, should Vatican found the authenticity of the Gospel is true and endorse it, will Christianity be false?</p>

              <p>ACTS 9:26 and 27: "And when Saul ( Paul ) was come to Jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples, but they were all afraid of him and believed not that he was a disciple. "But Barnabas took him and brought him to the Apostles"<span style="font-size: small;">.</span></p>
              <p>Such was his influence to the first few follower of Jesus teachings, yet we knew little of him as oppose to Paul.</p>
              <p>Back to question asked, should Vatican found the authenticity of the Gospel is true and endorse it, will Christianity be false?</p>

              <p>I doubt that the Vatican will find this gospel authentic because it goes against the general flow of the Bible. Every single book in the Bible somehow complements each other and reveals an overall consistent message, even though the books were written by different people over different time periods and found in different locations. That is the beauty of the Bible and perhaps a miracle in itself :)</p>
              <p>So I don't see how this gospel of Barnabas would fit into the whole thing.</p>

              <p>My understanding:</p>
              <p>Bible now is much on Paul theology which Emperor of Constantine had made the belief of Trinity became the official religion during his Empire of course with Vatican endorsement.<br> During Emperor Of Constantine reign, it even became a penal offense to possess a Bible not authorized by the 
                                              Church.</p>
              <p>So, I too doubt that Vatican will find this gospel authentic.</p>
              <p>Agreed, Gospel of Barnabas will go against the general flow of the bible with reason below;</p>
              <p>Barnabas together with small group of Jesus disciples in Jerusalem,  were observing the Law of the Prophets, which Jesus had come,"not to destroy but, to fulfill" (Matthew 5:17).<br> Until Paul came and wanted to give up the Commandments about things
                                               to eat; circumcision. <br> Barnabas and the other personal disciples 
                                              disagreed. <br> <br> The following sentences in the Acts give a hint of the rift:<br> <br> "And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, <br> "Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved."<br> "When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputations with them, they determined that Paul<br> and Barnabas should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question" (Acts 14:1 and 2).<br> <br> Not denying other gospels reveals the message of Jesus BUT many of these only chose what deemed fit into Pauline Christianity.<br> <br> Hence Gospel of Barnabas would not fit into the Bible as we have today.<br> <br> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> Hey! i could be wrong, i'm still learning..<br> <br> Sidenote; <br> My apology to Christian here if my previous thread on asking if Christian religion is false to be rude.<br> Got carried away be Falseislam accusation.</p>

              <p>After reading so many of your distasteful joke and senseless contribution, there is one conclusion.  you are lonely.  no bf.  no date.  can't even get laid from a stranger.  that's why your above reply only talks about penis foreskins.  that's the problem with thinking too much and not getting it.</p>
