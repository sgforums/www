              <p>They may share the same OT as Scriptures but IMO it takes a seriously confused individual to say that Christianity is a branch of Judaism. Jesus was a Jew but He certainly was not a follower of Judaism. You need to know what Judaism believes to note the differences.

              <p>Secondly, not all Jews see Christianity as deviant. There are Messianic Jews who see Christianity as the fullness of the Jewish faith. See <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/Messianic-Judaism.html">http://www.gotquestions.org/Messianic-Judaism.html</a></p>

              <p>1. Christianity is a branch of Judaism. But of course you see christianity as a :"fulfillment" of judaism. But theoretically speaking, christianity came from judaism. Jesus quoted from the OT, and always referred to the judaic god as his god,even on the cross (abba abba why did you forsake me). BTW, saying it's a branch doesnt mean it is completely the same as judaism. Thats why its called a branch, not totally identical. It's just like how buddhism is a branch from hinduism.</p>
              <p>2. When did i try to use its source to prove thats its wrong in this specific discussion? We are just discussing about the roots of xtianity, not whether it is wrong by its roots. You are overly defensive.</p>
              <p>3. I never did say all Jews see jesus as deviant. Defensive again</p>

              <p>1. Already addressed this on the other thread.</p>
              <p>2. OK, take it that I am overly defensive then. As asked in the other thread: So what's your point?</p>
              <p>3. Well, you never qualified your statement, so who's to tell whether you meant some or all?</p>
