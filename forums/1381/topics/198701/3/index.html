I assume the audience know who I am talking about.<br><br>Anyone is free to set up his own group for a variety of reasons. It doesn't matter whether that person is inspired by God or not, all the claims about "God speaking to me last night" cannot be verified. So during the Schism, the Eastern set up their own group. SSPX also set up their own group. King of England also set up his own group. In a sense, cults and heretical groups are not so different.<br><br>Furthermore, a protestant cult is an oxymoron.
