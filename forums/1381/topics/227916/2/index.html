Or will both of you just mingle and be at the mercy of your eager guests? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Regarding bridal shoots, if you are not taking photos as part of the package, it boils down to logistic and coordination. You need to discuss if it's possible to take out the gowns and suits for photo-taking. You may also need to get a separate make-up artist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a partially renovated flat. Flooring, doors, electrical power points, kitchen tiles, toilet, windows all done up by HDB. Except the kitchen you need to fit the cabinet, sink, stove and water &amp; gas pipes. I using SP gas. Very Convenient. Never regretted till now. That time got free gas water heater.<br><br>I must really thank God for this house. I had a lot of problems on lodgings and I lost my bunk when I was transferred to a stay out dept at that time. I don't want to rush into buying a house at that time. So really recce a lot to buy one. Finally was led to this house. Up till now, I thank God for his grace as my previous job and current job are all within 10mins drive away. My current job even have a straight bus too.<br><br>Saved on renovations very much. Didn't have much money that time when I got married. My wife lost her job also. During the SARS peak period. We were left with only 1/2 of our monthly income. So must control the budget very well. But Thank God, those hard days were over. Now everything is stable and planning for a baby next year.<br><br>Young couples always have a lot of problems. My advise is not to rush into buying things. Take a good look before you commit. Buy only when there's a need. Trust God to lead you</div>
