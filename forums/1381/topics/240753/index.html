            <div class='col-md body'>When asked to name the most important commandment, Jesus replied that the most important is to love God.  And the second most important is to love others.<br><br>Probably there are a numerous teachings on love, on how God loves us.  It is important to know that His love is immeasurable.  I think it's ok to teach that.  That danger lies in that we just stop at that and do nothing about it.  We forget to mention that this love that God gives freely needs a response from us.  It is critical to know that we need to love Him back so that we can be transformed by His love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are many passages in Scripture where Jesus and the sacred writers teach that works are required for salvation.<br><br>For example, in the parable of the talents, Jesus teaches that those who increased their talents with good works were saved. Those who buried their talents by not doing good works were condemned (Matt 25:14-30).<br><br>When Jesus comes at the end of the world, He grants salvation based upon what we have actually done, not how much faith we had (Matt 25:31-46; 16:27). Jesus determines our eternal destiny based upon what we have done with our lives.<br><br>In Rev 2:5, Jesus warns the faithful to do the good works they did at first, otherwise he will remove their place in heaven. This proves that good works are necessary for salvation. Our deeds follow us, and determine our eternal destiny (Rev 14:13; 20:12; 22:12). That is why Jesus says "He who endures to the end will be saved" (Matt 10:22).<br><br>Furthermore  Paul also explains this in 1 Cor 3:15 where he describes how a person must pass through fire based on the works he performed during his life. If the works are bad enough, the person is condemned.<br><br>Hence we can clearly see that works do play a vital role in securing salvation. Nowhere in Scripture does it say Faith alone except in James which condemns the protestant proposition.<br><br></div>

Paul says we are not saved by works in Eph 2:8-9, but James says we ARE saved by works in James 2:24. How do we reconclie the two? They appear to be entirely inconsistnet. Here is the answer:<br><br>Paul is speaking about works done in a system of law, where we view God as owing us salvation for our works. These types of works can only condemn us. The CC dogmatically affirmed this teaching at the Council of Trent. When Paul speaks of "works," he is primarily referring to works of the Mosaic law. This is why Paul usually calls them "works of law."<br><br>However, James is talking about works done in a sytsem of grace, where we approach God with faith, as a Father, not an employer. When we approach God in faith knowing that He doesn't owe us anythin but will reward us because of His gooodness, He views us with grace and rewards us for our faith and works. These do not refer to "works of law," but works of love. This is the key paradigm of the biblical teaching on justifciation.<br><br>When we are under law, neither our faith nor our works can please God. When we are in grace, both our faith and works please God. I hope this helps hasha.<br></div>
