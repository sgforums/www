            <div class='col-md body'>actually I listen to Nirvana, Slipknot, Creed, Radiohead, Marilyn Manson even....though I am a christian.<br><br>Now, people will rush to demean my spirituality or faith because of what I listen to. They say that good christians do not listen to such music.  I say nonsense.<br><br>In my church, I use to be 'counselled' left, right, centre because of what I listen to. But I had my reasons.  I was serving in another ministry where they reach out to kids who are not keen on church or church music, they simply love "destructive" loud music. And to reach out to them, I must know my stuff, i cannot just go up to them and ask them to listen hillsongs or preach Jesus right away. They would simply ask u to buzz off if u did that.  In their words, they said "Dun talk sh*t about me, if you aint know sh*t about me.". I had to be their fren, so I listen to what they listen to identify with them (actually i listen to all these since secondary school lah hehehe).<br><br>But beyond that, I wish to correct christians' perceptions that rock music is evil. it is not. The music itself has nothing. The people who plays it puts life into it. If we were to say God has no control of Rock music, then He is not LORD of ALL. God can use rock music to reach out too. The key to rock music evangelism is to get people to come, play songs (never mind if they cant hear the lyrics), get off stage, mingle with the people and be a fren.<br><br>So, people, there are a group of people who will turn and walk away when they hear hillsongs or hymns (sometimes i wanted to hahaha), so why not let God use their kind of music reach out to them.<br><br>In that aspect, recently my church allowed me to do a small concert with my kind of music in church. People came and heard about Christ! Cool!!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>And to add on....some words that these secular musicans say...makes me think as a christian...<br><br>Marilyn Manson once said "Since everybody thinks I am anti-christ, I shall be then." ------- it reminds me how labelling people can be bad.<br><br>He also said "If you look up to me, you will see God. If you look down on me, you are a fool. if you look at me, you see yourself."<br>This really brings me to realisation that people look up or look down on people too easily. You look up to something (like money) as though it is God. Or else you look down on something as though it is so different from u.<br><br>I said all these not because we should strive to be like Marilyn Manson. He had a solid christian background. Why is he like that? It is more or less a path he chose because he could not understand God's ways in this world.<br><br>So brothers and sisters, listen to what the "secular" people has to say, sometimes it helps us to be a better christian.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well actually i just want to find out more about what other christian bands pple like here. Din know end up debating over rock music.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Basically i hate death metal. Bands like Cradle of Filth, Tool or Marilyn Manson. They make my spine chill and spooky too. They are partly the reason why kids nowadays become maniacal and suicidal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Well i like jars of Clay too, but only their first album was really good. Liquid. The rest not that good. Except for the zoo album, the songs Unforgetful You and No One Loves Me like You , is really nice.<br><br>I like Pillar too! They are not a very popular band here. But they really rock! Their music is getting better! Christian version of linking park and limp bizkit! Kick ass lyrics. Here's their website, some reccomended songs include Fireproof, Guess Who's Won and alot others. Guess who's won is the great rap singing about how to kick the devil's ass. LOL. Check them out here. <a href="http://www.pillarmusic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pillarmusic.com</a>.<br><br>Really, the issue of rock music is very controversial i must say. I must say that music comes from God first in any way. God created the archangel of worship, lucifer. He was the most beautiful creature God had ever created - body made up of musical instruments and so on. But his pride got the better of him, that's why he fell. Origin of music is still from God in anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
