Confession is usually done in private to the priest. I am not catholic so cant tell more. Pls ask your catholic frens.<br><br>All i know for protestant pastors is that you can approach them for help &amp; prayers &amp; seek counselling from them. You can also confess at home to God in private in your personal prayers. Dont need to find priests or pastors.<br><br>My friend, Jesus loves you no matter how bad you are. I was also a sinner saved by grace. Go to church to listen more. &amp; maybe schedule a meeting with a pastor or deacon or counsellor. For we are saved by the blood of Jesus alone. His blood cleanses us from all our sins.<br><br>Let me share a chapter from the book of Isaiah chapter 53 regarding the sacrifice Jesus made for all of us:<br><br>1 Who has believed our message? To whom will the LORD reveal his saving power? 2 My servant grew up in the LORD's presence like a tender green shoot, sprouting from a root in dry and sterile ground. There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance, nothing to attract us to him. 3 He was despised and rejected Â– a man of sorrows, acquainted with bitterest grief. We turned our backs on him and looked the other way when he went by. He was despised, and we did not care.<br><br><strong>4 Yet it was our weaknesses he carried; it was our sorrows that weighed him down. And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God for his own sins! 5 But he was wounded and crushed for our sins. He was beaten that we might have peace. He was whipped, and we were healed! </strong>6 All of us have strayed away like sheep. We have left God's paths to follow our own. <strong>Yet the LORD laid on him the guilt and sins of us all.</strong> 7 He was oppressed and treated harshly, yet he never said a word. He was led as a lamb to the slaughter. And as a sheep is silent before the shearers, he did not open his mouth. <strong>8 From prison and trial they led him away to his death. But who among the people realized that he was dying for their sins Â– that he was suffering their punishment? 9 He had done no wrong, and he never deceived anyone. But he was buried like a criminal; he was put in a rich man's grave. </strong><br>10 But it was the LORD's good plan to crush him and fill him with grief. Yet when his life is made an offering for sin, he will have a multitude of children, many heirs. He will enjoy a long life, and the LORD's plan will prosper in his hands. 11 When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish, he will be satisfied. And because of what he has experienced, my righteous servant will make it possible for many to be counted righteous, <strong>for he will bear all their sins.</strong> 12 I will give him the honors of one who is mighty and great, because he exposed himself to death. <strong>He was counted among those who were sinners. He bore the sins of many and interceded for sinners.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you accepted the Lord Jesus as Saviour? Mere confession in a confession box wont save you for eternity. You have to confess that Jesus Christ is the Son of God &amp; He came to die &amp; save you from your sins. He shed His blood to cleanse &amp; redeem us from our sins. Without His saving blood, we cannot enter heaven. Jesus has paid the penalty for our sins once for all at the Cross where He was crucified. You just have to confess with your mouth &amp; believe in your heart that Jesus came especially for you to save you from your sins &amp; that He is your Lord &amp; Saviour &amp; that by His blood you are cleansed &amp; forgiven by God once for all.<br><br>Pray with me right now: Father God, I admit that I am a sinner. I admit that no matter what i do, i cannot go to heaven. I believe &amp; confess Jesus died for my sins &amp; rose again on the third day to justify me. I accept &amp; confess Jesus Christ as my Lord &amp; Saviour. Whatever sins I have committed have been washed by His blood &amp; forgiven by what He did on the Cross of Calvary. I will now live for Him alone &amp; determine to study the bible &amp; go to church to learn more about His saving power &amp; grace. Thank You Father God for Lord Jesus Christ. Yes, I believe He is the Christ who saves me. His blood has washed me eternally. In Jesus name, Amen.</div>

We are lights to this world no matter how small we are. I am just doing my small part to help a lost soul. It is up to God the Holy Spirit to do the rest. It is also up to him or anyone to pray the sinner's prayer &amp; mine might not be the best version around. Look at Pastor Prince &amp; Pastor Kong Hee's version. They are really doing great work for God. Look at all the missionaries out there in the field &amp; jungle. Arent they doing more? God will remember us for our part, whether small or big. But we sure wish to have a big reward in heaven!</div>

What if got queue outside the box? People will know right?</div></blockquote>The Sacrament of Penance (Reconcilliation, Confession), is administered in the Catholic Church as well as in the Orthodox Church. To a certain extent High Church Anglicans practise it.<br><br>Why is there a need to have this Sacrament? As some will say, "I can confess to God, there is no need for a priest." True, the priest is not God, but the priest has the authority to forgive sins. God had sent Jesus to forgive sins, but after his resurrection Jesus told the apostles, "Â‘As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.Â’ And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Â‘Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retainedÂ’" (John 20:21Â–23). Throughout history, the authority to forgive sins has been passed down till today.<br><br>The presiding minister is the Priest. Only validly ordained priests may hear confessions. The penitent will have his sins forgiven THROUGH the priest. It is God who really forgives the sinner. After hearing your confession, the priest will give you some advice and then absolve you of your sins. He may give a small Penance. What is Penance?<br><br>When we sin, we do not merely sin against God. We sin against others, and the Church. The Priest is the Church's representative. It is necessary that we say 'sorry' to the Church and make some repayment. It is impossible to repay Jesus' sacrifice, but it would be wrong to take it for granted right? Penance is what we repay to our neighbour or the Chuch. If we have stolen something, we try to pay it back. If we have insulted someone, we apologize.<br><br>But one may say, If a certain someone commits serious sins, confesses, then goes back to his old ways, isn't he getting away too easily? Well, not much; to confess sins without a repentant heart is a sin in itself. To withhold any sins on purpose would be a sin in itself. God knows the heart of a sinner. There is no escaping.<br><br>What are the benefits of this Sacrament? First, the sinner seeks forgiveness the way Christ intended. Second, by confessing to a priest, the Catholic learns a lesson in humility, which is avoided when one confesses only through private prayer. Third, the Catholic receives sacramental graces the non-Catholic doesnÂ’t get; through the sacrament of penance sins are forgiven and graces are obtained. Fourth, the Catholic is assured that his sins are forgiven; he does not have to rely on a subjective "feeling." Lastly, the Catholic can also obtain sound advice on avoiding sin in the future.</div>
