It started with raptured posting one of his inane question. Somewhere in the middle he answered his own question. So is the question rhetorical in the first place or is he seeking help? From the trend of his previous threads, seems he is asking for ask sake.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">He is coming to us with a problem.

I had already stated very clearly in my very very brief description sinners - everyone has sin, sexual sin is only one of the many sins, and no, it does not prevent anyone from entering heaven if he truly has accepted Christ.</div>
