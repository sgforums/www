Your issue isn't about <span style="color: darkred;">can or cannot</span>, it is <span style="color: darkred;">sinful or not</span>.<br><br>Why make unknown subjects become a code of conduct?<br><br>- Should/can Christians listen to Rock music?<br>- Can Christians smoke?<br>- Can Christians Drink alcohol?<br>- Can Christians eat food offered to idols/anccestor worship?<br>- Can Christians accept homosexual breathen into the congregation?<br>- Can Christians play poker cards or Mahjong as form of entertainment?<br><br>NT2 have voiced out in another thread that True christians wouldn't do this and that.

Are you seeking endorsement? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I say this once again. People can conceal themselves very well and have a 'Christian Conduct' in front of many. But IF their hearts ain't clean. Whats the point?<br><br>Lets look at it practically:<br><br>a) A single Christian who struggles with masturbation and lift the issue to God. Fervent Christian and humble in service of God and Church.<br>Just that he have this 'thorn'...<br><br>b) A married Christian who have high sexual drive always have the need to 'release'. Unfortunately his Christian wife do not have as much desire as he does, she rejects him. He felt that the intimate times were cutting down. He turns to masterbation. He is too a fervent and humble in service of God and Church.<br><br>c) A single Christian who have high sexual drive, he does not see masterbation as a Sinful act.<br>Fervent Christian and humble in service of God and Church.<br>What would you do if you have the chance to offer your counsel to him?<br><br>________________<br><br>I need to address this.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">It is one thing to <strong>Displease God</strong></span>. And another to <span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>commit a Sin</strong>.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>God's grace and chastisement</strong></span> and <span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>God's Tolerance towards Sinful act/thought</strong></span> are different matters<br><br>Christians need to get this right before they conclude on Grey areas.<br>_________________<br><br>To me, it takes Conviction to know what God thinks and this conviction is personal.<br>We know how some church teaches that small tithing and offering is sin and a sign of unbelief. How personal issues with God can become a matter of an Act of Faith before the christians.<br><br>This is a very practical issue which no Christians decides whichever Act is Sinful or Holy.<br>Personal Level.....personal level.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

I agree with you. But who is perfect here on this earth? You mean you want to expose everyone including yourself before you will want to become a Christian?
