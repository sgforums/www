Surely all of us cannot be making up stories.<br><br>Most times we try to overlook what a certain person has said, taking it with a pinch of sale, but when is enough enough? How many times are you going to allow someone to twist and turn and warp the issues? This person has crossed the line repeatedly and has been warned not to. Many people come here for genuine answers to genuine questions. But because of this loose cannon,we are repeatedly trying to put out fires and contain the stiuation. This person has turned everything into a circus. I for one do not want this forum to be a circus.</div>
