              <p>Have you tried studying a bit of global economics?</p>
              <p>Simply giving money to the poor will not solve the global issue of poverty. What it will do instead is that it will render the money so useless that you help nobody at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>In the same vein, solving world hunger is not as easy as simply dumping grain on countries with famine. That only takes care of short-term situtation, but it's akin to giving a fish to a person as opposed to teaching them to fish.</p>
              <p>You want to know the REAL cause of poverty? You only need to look into the mirror. Our global economic system is structured in such a way in which the rich become rich on the backs of the poor on the 80/20 rule. Look at the shoes and clothes you wear, were they made in a sweatshop by a person who could not afford them with a month's pay?</p>
              <p>Are you not working in an economic system that tells you to consume and spend and spend and spend? Do you think it's obscence that you have an environmental footprint 20 times that of the average person in the developing country? You consume movies, popular culture and what have you not that enforces all this.</p>
              <p>So no, before making bombastic speeches about how saints are apparently not helping the poor, let us consider how we as each persons are actually the CAUSE of the problem.</p>

              of poor people not the tens of thousands she

              <p>Haha. U mean pastor in megachurch? In one Megachurch I attended for almost half a year, the church is having their new land. Of course new land must also got building ma, if not sit on grass pray and worship jesus mehz. Then very funny sia. After telling their member they got the land in the area they want, they starting campain called Arise and Build, to generated funds to build that building. Very nice lor. Then suddenly got like a couples per week for at least 2 weeks, come up to stage, share very very nice testimony sia. Tell how poor how bad their life is. Then God tell them give that church $$$ for their building fund. Then very funny sia. They will tell us how much they give to the church, how much blessing they get back. Of course blessing beside making their life better, the amount give and bless backed is calculate in $. Very very nice number. Like telling us to give more money, so our blessing is bigger in a indirect way. Darm contradicting sia, they say dun treat God like vending machine, but like that seem to treating God like vending machines lehz</p>

              <p>i know very well about this photograph which i read in the newspaper. the poor child was on his way to get food. the vulture behind was waiting for him to die so that it could feed on him.</p>
              <p>according the paper, the poor child died shortly after this photo was taken as he was too weak to walk to get food. the photographer who took this photo passed away months (if i am not wrong was 3 months), if i remembered correctly he committed suicide due to depression. i guessed must be what he experienced with the child that put him into depression. if it is me, i think i will too.</p>
