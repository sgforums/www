              Hello to you all.speaking of properity preachers.
              Are they used by God?
              Before I tell you the answer, I first like to enlighten you about how God can succeed even men meant for evil!
              
              I know of a man who had surrendered his wife to another man to safe his own skin.
              And this same man had an affair with his maid and then bore him a son.
              Again this very man kicked this maid out along with his son.
              Once again this time to make matter worst, he wanted to kill his own son by his wife and said God told him to do it!
              
              In this day and age, base on just the matter of killing his own son, we all would agree to put this man in jail and throw away the key.
              
              Don't you think what this man did is many times worst than the prosperity preachers?
              And yet this man was a hero in those days!
              He is revered by Jews, Muslim and Christians alike.
              
              His name is ABRAHAM!
              
              Does it mean that we Christians condon to what these prosperity preachers do?Off course not!!!!
              But God whose thought which is higher than our thought, is always able to bless even men has their evil ways.
              
              While I was attending a service one Sunday,the congregation was singing and then into worship.
              I heard  people begin to ask more of God!
              Give us more, give us more!
              I was troubled in my spirit, I began to feel sad and my tears began to flow.
              And I began to pray...Lord , it is not more of you that we need,but rather it is us who need to give more of ourselves each day.
              
              And this is my prayer this day...
              Lord teach me to be a obedient slave and not a demanding servant that prays for earthly comfort. 
              Instill in me what is necessary for me to understand the extend ofvyour love so that others around me can sense your love.
              Teach me to give more of myself each passing day,and not asked more of you as you have already given all there is to give for a undeserving slave like me.
              And I pray that those who are down and discourage and feel defeated be bless this day.

              <p>Have you tried studying a bit of global economics?</p>
              <p>Simply giving money to the poor will not solve the global issue
              of poverty. What it will do instead is that it will render the
              money so useless that you help nobody at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>In the same vein, solving world hunger is not as easy as simply
              dumping grain on countries with famine. That only takes care of
              short-term situtation, but it's akin to giving a fish to a person
              as opposed to teaching them to fish.</p>
              <p>You want to know the REAL cause of poverty? You only need to
              look into the mirror. Our global economic system is structured in
              such a way in which the rich become rich on the backs of the poor
              on the 80/20 rule. Look at the shoes and clothes you wear, were
              they made in a sweatshop by a person who could not afford them with
              a month's pay?</p>
              <p>Are you not working in an economic system that tells you to
              consume and spend and spend and spend? Do you think it's obscence
              that you have an environmental footprint 20 times that of the
              average person in the developing country? You consume movies,
              popular culture and what have you not that enforces all this.</p>
              <p>So no, before making bombastic speeches about how saints are
              apparently not helping the poor, let us consider how we as each
              persons are actually the CAUSE of the problem.</p>
