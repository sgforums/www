(Ps 27:4 MSG).<br>What is this house of God which David seeks? Is David describing a physical structure? Does he long for a building with four walls and a door through which he can enter but never exit? No. "Our Lord does not live in temples built by human hands" (Acts 17:24). When David says, "I will live in the house of the LORD forever" (Ps. 23:6), he's not saying he wants to get away from people. He's saying that he yearns to be in God's presence, wherever he is.</div>

The hand that touched the leper had dirt under its nails. The feet upon which the woman wept were calloused and dusty. And his tears...oh, don't miss the tears... they came from a heart as broken as yours or mine ever has been.<br><br>So, people came to him. My, how they came to him! They came at night, they touched him as he walked down the street; they followed him around the sea; they invited him into their homes and placed their children at his feet. Why? Because he refused to be a statue in cathedral or a priest in an elevated pulpit. He chose instead to be a touchable, approachable, reachable Jesus.</div>

So he began to teach them many things.<br>MARK 6:34<br><br>The Compassionate Christ<br>When Jesus lands on the shore of Bethsaida, he leaves the Sea of Galilee and steps into a sea of humanity. Keep in mind, he has crossed the sea to get away from the crowds. He needs to grieve. He longs to relax with his followers. He needs anything but another crowd of thousands to teach and heal.<br><br>But his love for people overcomes his need for rest....<br><br>Many of those he healed would never say "thank you," but he healed them anyway. Most would be more concerned with being healthy than being holy, but he healed them anyway. Some of those who asked for bread today would cry for his blood a few months later, but he healed them anyway.... He had compassion on them.</div>

And all you have to offer him is your hurt.<br><br>Maybe that has kept you from coming to God. Oh, you've taken a step or two in his direction. But then you saw the other people around him. They seemed so clean, so neat, so trim and fit in their faith. And when you saw them, they blocked your view of him. So you stepped back.<br><br>If that describes you, note carefully,... one person [whom Christ] commended... for having faith. It wasn't a wealthy giver. It wasn't a loyal follower. It wasn't an acclaimed teacher. It was a shame-struck, penniless outcast [a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years] who clutched onto her hunch that he could and her hope that he would.<br><br>Which, by the way, isn't a bad definition of faith.

If so, you remember that "splanchnology" is a study of...the gut.<br><br>When Matthew writes that Jesus had compassion on the people, he is not saying that Jesus felt casual pity for them. No, the term is far more graphic. Matthew is saying that Jesus felt their hurt in his gut:<br><br>He felt the limp of the crippled.<br><br>He felt the hurt of the diseased.<br><br>He felt the loneliness of the leper<br><br>He felt the embarrassment of the sinful.<br><br>And once he felt their hurts, he couldn't help but heal their hurts.</div>

That's like God telling a housewife to stand up to her abusive husband or a high school student to take on drug peddlers or a preacher to preach the truth to a congregation of Pharisees. "Y-y-you-b-b-better get somebody else," we stammer. But then God reminds us that he knows we can't, but he can, and to prove it he gives a wonderful gift. He brings a spirit of peace. A peace before the storm. A peace beyond logic....He gave it to David after he showed him Goliath; he gave it to Saul after he showed him the gospel; he gave it to Jesus after he showed him the cross. And he gave it to Gideon. So Gideon, in turn, gave the name to God. He built an altar and named it Jehovah-shalom, the Lord is peace (Judges 65:24).</div>

He doesnÂ’t ask for a meal or to spend an evening in GodÂ’s house. He wants to move in with himÂ…forever. HeÂ’s asking for his own roomÂ…permanently.

Confused because we've never been taught. Frightened because we've been taught to be afraid.<br><br>May I simplify things a bit? The Holy Spirit is the presence of God in our lives, carrying on the work of Jesus. The Holy Spirit helps us in three directions-inwardly (by granting us the fruits of the Spirit, Gal. 5:22-24), upwardly (by praying for us, Rom. 8:26) and outwardly (by pouring God's love into our hearts, Rom. 5:5).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Free Behind the Fence<br><br>A village was situated on a hilltop. Surrounding it was a fence, which covered a fairly large perimeter. The fence had only one gate through which the villagers moved in and out. It kept the citizens in and kept strangers out. Houses had no doors because people trusted one another. The fence also kept children from falling off sharp cliffs. Little ones were free to play in the open fields. The community was busy and there was much laughter and joy. One day at a village council meeting, some people complained that the fence was restrictive. They felt they could not roam freely. Others disagreed. After many days of hot debate and deliberation, the council finally decided to tear down the perimeter fence.<br><br>When it was removed, the village changed significantly. Strangers came to the village and many things were reported stolen from homes. People began to build doors to safeguard their property. They became less trusting and open. Some boys almost fell off a cliff while at play. Parents began to forbid their children to go outside. The village became much quieter and no laughter was heard in the fields.<br><br>We often think that freedom means no limits. But ironically, we enjoy true freedom only behind the fenceÂ—one that is established by the omniscient and omnipotent God to protect us and not just to bind us. These limits are found in GodÂ’s Word and are to be observed in our lives.<br><br>As Christians, we have found freedom in Jesus, but it is not without boundaries. We are not free to do anything we like. The exercise of our Christian freedom must not become a stumbling block to the weak. In 1 Corinthians 6:12, we see that our freedom should not cause us to act without self-control or respond in the wrong way. LetÂ’s enjoy our freedom and letÂ’s also appreciate GodÂ’s fence! Â—Lim Chien Chong<br><br>bottom line: Christians are free from sin, but not free to sin.</div>
