            <div class='col-md body'>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep</span>. For this we declare to you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by a word from the Lord</span>, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the dead in Christ will rise first</span>. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words.  (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 )<br><br>From 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, I see that Christians are just "fallen asleep" after death and Paul told us that God will bring with Him those who have "fallen asleep". Here we are told that the dead (christians) are like sleeping (unconscious) and they are away from their bodies. It means that the soul of the "fallen asleep" are with the Lord. We know little about the state after death but we are assured that the "fallen asleep" are at rest with the Lord waiting for the resurrection of the bodies.<br><br>Notice that God will bring with him those who have "fallen asleep". This is where "called home to be with the Lord" comes in. We're told that believers who have "fallen asleep" are with the Lord and they are at home.<br><br>The scripture tells us (Paul was told by Jesus) that Jesus will return for His Church and when He return for His Church (or the bride), He will raise the dead first (because they are with the Lord), then He will rapture the Church, bringing along those who have first being raisen.<br><br>Commonly, people thought that heaven is up above the earth. But I think this is not correct. Where God is, heaven is. So where God is, the "fallen asleep" is. They are with God forever. And God is omnipresent.<br><br>I understand some christians may have other interpretations of after death. Well, that is just what I think. The bible is not too clear concerning after death, so there is still some mystery in it.<br><br>I hope I have answered your questions, if not part of it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What does sleep mean? The Bible uses this term when speaking of death in that the physical body, a dead body, looks very similar in this state. It's always referring to the physical body, not the soul. It is the appearance of the body that is sleeping, no one is able to see the spirit . It is also a term used exclusively for believers. The term sleeping, in reference to death, is not used for unbelievers. It is crucial in understanding what the Bible is trying to portray to christians when it says that the dead in Christ are sleeping.<br><br>Believers and unbelievers do not experience the same afterlife. So, sleeping is used for one who is in Christ, it is God' s viewpoint of a temporary suspension of physical activity, yet, there is a continuation of the mind and the soul, the personality.<br><br>Believers enter immediately into the presence of the Lord at death and enjoy fellowship with him there (see 2 Cor. 5:8, Phil. 1:23, Luke 23:43, Heb. 12:23). These verses confirm that there is conscious existence after death and fellowship with God.<br><br>Luke 16:24-26, a conversation between Abraham and the rich man and 1 Samuel 28, Saul, who had disobeyed God,tried to reach Samuel from the dead through a medium, confirms that the "fallen asleep" have awareness of thier existence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A person, christian or not is made up of 3 parts: Mind, Soul and Body. Neither can go on without the other. Even before a person departs, i strongly believe Angels are there to recieve him/her. To relieve and to comfort their souls, right after they breathed their last.<br><br>Why is it some people who're in a state of consussion after drowning, coma, woke up to tell of their out of body experience? Again its my believe here, that some drowning victims, or accidental death people had the choice if they want to return to their loved ones, or not if their time ain't due. Some chose not to, others decided to return to their families and wake up in revalation to an out of body experience.<br><br>When my grandma pass away suddenly, i went to sleep in her room, hoping to see her for one last time on the 7th day, as the chinese say, the person's soul will come back one last time on this day (did i get it right people?).Yet there was nothing. Somehow when a person departs, i believe you'll meet old friends up there, there'll be a reunion with tears of joy in heaven.<br><br>; j</div>

It seems that man is likely made up of three distinct parts: body, soul, and spirit. The body is made up of flesh and can be touched. The soul forms the basic thought patterns and directs oneÂ’s functions. The spirit is in direct relationship with the Lord.<br><br>To sum up: Your Spirit is always guided by God. Your Soul is always guided by your Spirit. And your Soul always seeks to guide you and your Personality, here on earth, to the degree that it can, in the daily affairs of your life. But, your Personality can choose, consciously or unconsciously, either to accept, not to accept, or to reject the thread of guidance given by your Soul, your Spirit, and God. On the Earth plane, it really is all a matter of choice ; j<br></div>

But sometimes, you know, just sometimes, i wish it ain't true. and that their spirits can still visa to and fro, to visit the ones they've loved, and had so regretfully left behind ;. i<br></div>

Believers have passed from death [judgment]  to life if they accept Christ. They 'agreed' to be judged by God in Christ when they accepted Christ to bore in advance the judgment for their sins. This takes place in the moment of salvation.<br><br>2) God's disciplinary judgment [or more accurately chastisement, discipline] when His child is rebelious.<br><br>3) Judgement seat of Christ. When God gives His rewards to His saints.<br><br>4) judgment of the nations or the Day of the Lord. Immediately after Armaggdon [Matthew 25], the anti-christ  and the false prophet will be the first occupants of the lake of fire [REvelations 19:20]<br><br>5) Great White Throne Judgment at the end of the Millenium. Where all the unsaved will be judged and thrown into the lake of fire along with Satan and his angels.
