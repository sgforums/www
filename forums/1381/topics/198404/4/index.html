A feature of a bureaucratic organisation is the existence of rules and regulations, and other explicit guiding principles, so I was not looking at just Code of Canon Laws, but others like Catholic doctrines, including Catechism of the Catholic Church. Another telling sign is the existence of various levels of hierarchial positions, as described here<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church_hierarchy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church_hierarchy</a><br><br>Furthermore, you had backed up the description of the lower levels of the Church hierarchy as organic, when you talked about priests in individual parish having the authority to organise his own parish, as well as the authority to set up different ministeries to suit the parish's needs or aims. Matrix structure is also a telling sign the lower part of the organisations is rather organic in nature.<br><br>Anyway, matrix structure? So the dioceses report directly to Vatican as well as the national/regional governing bodies?<br><br></div>
