            <div class='col-md body'>The lord Jesus Christ has overcome Satan at the cross; therefore, Christians can claim God's promise of help when they resist the Devil, causing him to flee(James4:7). But our resistence must be "standing firm in faith"(1Peter 5:9). We can best thwart Satans designs on us by daily yielding ourselves to the Lord in prayer and by putting on the whole armour of God(eph 6:10-17)<br><br>We can also defend ourselves against satan in other ways<br><br>--We can avoid the extreme or trying to see Satan behind every misfortune without reconising our personal responsibility and choice for our actions.<br><br>--Equally dangerous, however, is being so lulled by the sophistication of our age that we are unaware of Satan and his wiles against us in the spiritual battle in which every true believer is engaged.<br>-<br>--We can develop "renewed mind" by knowing biblical principles(Rom 12:2)<br><br>--We can avoid tempting circumstances or dabbling around the edges of things that seems harmless:" Let no one be found amongyou...who practises devineation or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in whichcrafts, or cast spells or who is a meduim or spiritist or who consults the dead"(deut 18:10-11)<br><br>--We shld decern whether sources that claim to be true(such as ouji board, tarot crads computer games, tv shows and movies) are indeed of God:" Test the spirits to see whether they are from God"(1John 4:1)<br><br>--We can use Michael's phrase: the Lord rebuke you" when temptations come.<br><br>--Never claim or steal Gods glory. "Angels speel out the tenderness of God's love, meet a desperate need; then they r gone.<br>Angels never draw attention to themselves but ascribe the glory to the Lord"by billy graham<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">once again, 100% hand written and taken form the book.<br>Pls read it even if you think you know already.</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following are my personal opinions on additional points:<br><br>- Remember and practice the greatest commandments of Love (Matt 22:37-40, 1 Cor 13:13). For we all ought to know that God is Love, and the devil is God's 180-degree opposition, which means being evil is having absence of Love. Evil shall not completely overcome us if we have even a slight trace of Love within our heart and spirit.<br><br>- If you know how to pray in tongues, use it when facing difficulties (Rom 8:26-27). In this way, your spirit will intercede for yourself in praying to the Holy Spirit Himself, Who will strengthen your spirit. But, if you do not know how to pray in tongues, do NOT even try, for the devil can give devilish tongues as well.<br><br>- Christ died for mankind once and for all, by replacing the blood of a sacrificial lamb with His own precious Blood. Have faith and always call on the Blood of Jesus to cover us when facing difficulties or fear.<br><br>- Remember the promises of God for eternal life (Jn 10:10) in any circumstances. Do not treat challenges in life as a means of forsaking God, for hardships will eventually leads us to hope on God (Rom 5:3-6). Once we forsake God, the devil will work overtime to claim our souls.</div>

Rather, I suggest you read the following passage and examine what you think, in case you find a person suddenly come out and speak strange languages - whether is it for God or not...<br><br>Matthew 24:23-25<br>"If anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or 'There he is!' - do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear; they will perform great miracles and wonders in order to deceive even God's chosen people, if possible. Listen! I have told you this ahead of time."<br><br>Remember, Satan can counterfeit almost everything God gives us. The only weapon we can use, and where Satan cannot counterfeit, is Love.</div>

The prayer is prayingg to God not man so we should not understand. it only edify himself. So most of the time it's like it should be done private i guess. so he mind his own business i mind my own, so i'm not really worried. speaking in tongues refers to "praying in the spirit", the Holy Spirit.<br><br>so Devilish tongues maybe someone with an evil spirit praying? chunting probably.<br><br>And how we how should we look out for false messiah.

Antichrists choose to deceive themselves &amp; others. Living in their own sweet dreams but i dont think they are truly happy. Demons are most contorted suffering creatures. How can these creatures cursed &amp; damned by God already be happy? How then can anyone who join them be truly happy? Guess insanity perhaps!</div>
