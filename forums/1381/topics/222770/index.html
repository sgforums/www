It is almost impossible to love them without understanding them. If we want to love God, we must know who He is. If want to love the people we come in contact with, we must know who they are.<br><br>For understanding to come in, there must be a relationship between the two people. There must be communication. For example, when you pat someone on the back and you see uncomfortable, you will remember that he does not like physical affection.<br><br>So maybe the psychologist maybe right to a point. Interaction with people on a deeper is not so easy. Any treatment given to a person without love is not the best.</div>

In such scenarios, the 'Golden Rule' is still valid.<br><br>If we take the psychologist's argument to its logical conclusion, whereby everyone is entitlted to be treated differently on account of their personal traits, then it would have to be argued that there must be different laws for different people, which is an absurdity as far as the governance of society is concerned.<br><br>Hence, the psychologist, by saying that the Golden Rule is not the best, has committed the error of comparing apples with oranges.  The type of interactions that he probably had envisaged is of a different category from that whereby the Golden Rule has its most effective operation.<br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>
