However instead of getting beat up, the true followers of God will emerge stronger than ever from the trials and triumph over the Devil.</div></blockquote>Again you mix up the second coming with the rapture. This verse is talking about the second coming which everybody knows so how can it be that Jesus come like a thief in the night when everybody knows? So during rapture nobody knows the date as He will come unexpectedly. It is talking about two diff events. Day of the Lord is actually a length of time starting with the rapture of the Christians and ending with the second coming of Jesus. You are a bit confusing or is scripture contradicting itself? How can Jesus come like a thief when everybody knows when He comes?<br><br>Yes, God's followers will emerge stronger but the Day of the Lord is for punishment and judgement on the unbelievers not trial to refine Christians. It is tribulation not trial. It is punishment and judgement of God on the world not on His beloved church. So we are not in the tribulation.</div>

Can God condemn us for not being able to follow all His laws esp since His grace is very very very deep?

NO. But I would like to hear your views.<br><br>2) But we still sin right? Just that our status has changed positionally. If it's unnatural why we still sin? It's natural for the flesh to sin am i right? Even Paul said in Romans 7. But can we stop sinning? Is there a way? I don't like sins and sinning.<br><br>I see that it's defn of salvation and rapture but what i mean is could salvation lead to rapture or not? As you said salvation is a free gift. Is rapture a free gift also? Bcos so many places in the NT God and Jesus warns about not watching, getting drunk and beating fellow servants, living like the heathen in Noah's time eating and drinking and in Lot's time planting and building, parables warning of disobedience like the parable of talents, parable of wise and foolish virgins etc etc. It seems so work related. That we must earn to go up in rapture like keeping holy and watching. Would like to hear your views.<br><br></div>

For eg, I believe in my earthly father but i keep getting into trouble and going to jail bcos of some drug addiction that i can never kick, so will my father disown me even though I am unrepentant but tried to change? NO. But I would like to hear your views.<br><span style="color: green;">Like what you had just said, do you think your heavenly Father will disown His own?</span><br><br>2) But we still sin right? Just that our status has changed positionally. If it's unnatural why we still sin? It's natural for the flesh to sin am i right? Even Paul said in Romans 7. But can we stop sinning? Is there a way? I don't like sins and sinning.<br><span style="color: green;">if its unnatural, why do we sin, do remember we are still in this inperfect world, physically in this fallen body, till the Lord's return, we will still have to struggle with this issue, but do not be dishearten, and continue to fight a good fight. Is there a way to stop sinning? prayers, flee from temption, ...etc for some.. its not impossible, just sometimes may be difficult, and other times, just unintentional. and yes, neither do I like to sin.</span><br><br>I see that it's defn of salvation and rapture but what i mean is could salvation lead to rapture or not? As you said salvation is a free gift. Is rapture a free gift also? Bcos so many places in the NT God and Jesus warns about not watching, getting drunk and beating fellow servants, living like the heathen in Noah's time eating and drinking and in Lot's time planting and building, parables warning of disobedience like the parable of talents, parable of wise and foolish virgins etc etc. It seems so work related. That we must earn to go up in rapture like keeping holy and watching. Would like to hear your views.<br><span style="color: green;">Rapture is not a gift, its an event, as in something that may happen (depending on how you see it), but know that at the end, be it term as rapture or not, we will still be with the Lord just as we are in Him.</span><br></div></blockquote>hope I am not confusing you.</div>
