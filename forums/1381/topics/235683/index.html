Salvation based fully on the work of Jesus Christ. But many places in the bible, even by Jesus' words Himself, a believer has to keep holy and even to watch for His second coming to earth or miss the rapture. So contradiction here?<br><br>So can a Christian miss the rapture? I mean he/she sins a lot, tried repenting but cannot and even is sinning during the time of rapture. I ask a side question here: <strong>Can this sinning Christian be saved in the first place at all?</strong> So how can a saved Christian keep sinning and not repenting even if he/she knows Jesus is watching and he/she is saved by grace? So he/she will miss the rapture? Or will he/she go up as well by grace?<br><br>So I have given you my option of salvation by grace.

However one must look at the entire bible as a whole in order not to be deceived.  The following text dispels all notion of any rapture.<br><br>[quote]2 Peter 3:10 NIV<br>But <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the day of the Lord </span></strong>will come like a thief. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.</span></strong>Then what does "the day of the Lord will come like a thief" mean?<br><br>Day is a reference to time.  It means what we think it is.  The time when Jesus will come is unknown to all except God the father.  It will be a time when we least expect it.  This does not refer to Jesus behaving sneakily like a thief and sneaking people off to heaven without those left behind knowing.  As both text I have quoted shows, Jesus will come openly in a great display of power and glory such that everyone good or bad will know that he has finally come.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Raptured:<br>Once again God will focus on Israel and the Gentile church will be raptured to start the 70th week. This is the Great Tribulation or Time of Jacob's Trouble.<br></blockquote>Those who desire to escape the tribulation will perish.  But those who gladly go through such trials in service of Jesus will be refined as gold in the fire and be fit to enter the kingdom of heaven.</div>

It's better to be safe than sorry.</div></blockquote>Rapture is a doctrine created by modern day theologicans. Hold fast to your traditions both written and unwritten.</div>

It means what we think it is. The time when Jesus will come is unknown to all except God the father. It will be a time when we least expect it. This does not refer to Jesus behaving sneakily like a thief and sneaking people off to heaven without those left behind knowing. As both text I have quoted shows, Jesus will come openly in a great display of power and glory such that everyone good or bad will know that he has finally come.<br><br></strong>[/quote]<br><br>This verse you quote refers to the rapture itself and not the second coming of Christ. If Jesus comes unexpectedly, how can it be after the Great Tribulation when everyone will see the Antichrist and everyone will know that the bible is true and everyone will know that Jesus is coming for sure? It surely must be before the tribulation when nobody except those watching will know that He is coming back to snatch His followers away. Nobody will be watching bcos there will be no Antichrist, no tribulation, no wars, no beheading of saints, no 666 mark of the beast, no armageddon, no signs at all etc etc, except for His believers who are watching. This verse shows conclusively that Jesus is coming back pre-trib and not post-trib to rapture His believers. And then later come again after 7 yrs visibly in the sky. The previous verse you mentioned earlier.<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]<br>Those who desire to escape the tribulation will perish. But those who gladly go through such trials in service of Jesus will be refined as gold in the fire and be fit to enter the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>Those who desire to escape the tribulation will perish.

We are already being refined day by day as we live and there are martyrs dying every day even now. Many are also suffering persecution now. So it won't be in the trib. The tribulation is for those who convert after the rapture. This is not normal tribulation. It is great delusion and suffering. God will keep His faithful followers from this time. Jesus won't beat up His bride before He takes her to heaven.<br></div>

Only those who are born from above will enter it. The Lord will punish them at His coming since they will have allied themselves to the Antichrist and oppress the believing remnant of Israel in the GReat Tribulation together with the men who who will attack Israel at the Armageddon:<br><br>Re 19:17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to <strong>all the birds</strong> that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come and gather together for the supper of the great God,<br><br>Re 19:18 "that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great.<br><br>So our question is: What does the Lord mean in these verses that one <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WILL BE TAKEN</strong></span>?<br><br>Lu 17:34 "I tell you, in that night there will be two men in one bed: the one <strong>will be taken</strong> and the other will be left.<br><br>Lu 17:35 "Two women will be grinding together: the one <strong>will be taken</strong> and the other left.<br><br>The best commentary of the Bible is the Bible itself. In a parallel acount in Matthew we are told that 'taken' there just means death just like in the days of Noah when the Flood set in and the unbelieving taken:<br><br>Mt 24:38 "For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,<br><br>Mt 24:39 "and did not know until the flood came and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>took them all away</strong></span>, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.<br><br>Mt 24:40 "Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.<br><br>Mt 24:41 "Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.<br><br>.<br><br>2) all our sins have been covered <strong>positionally</strong> by the blood of Christ.

Rapture just means 'caught up'<br>Paul was not wrong when he wrote:<br><br>1Th 4:17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>caught up</strong></span> together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

Is it before Revalations 6-19, in the middle or after it.<br><br>1) If one can clearly see the distinction between Israel and the Church, he will clearly see that the Great Tribulation is for Jacob [israel] not for the Church, that the 'caught up' doctrine Paul is predicting in the verse above is before the Tribulation.<br><br>2) if one can rightly divide the Word of Truth that the Rapture doctrine was revealed to the Church [though it has a type in the Old Testament] not to Israel, that the caught up doctrine is a mystery, then it is easy to see that the caughting up will be before the Tribulation.<br><br></div>

In other words, those Christians living at the time of the Â“raptureÂ” are not taken first.<br><br>Instead, Â“the dead in Christ will rise first; then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the airÂ” (vv.16-17).<br><br>These passages clearly teach that the resurrection of the dead precedes the rapture. Therefore, to know when the rapture occurs, we must first know when the resurrection of the dead occurs.<br><br>Scripture teaches that the resurrection of the dead occurs on the Â“last dayÂ” of the world. Because the resurrection of the dead occurs on the Â“last dayÂ” of the world, and the rapture follows the resurrection, this means that the rapture also occurs on the Â“last dayÂ” (there can be no day after the Â“last dayÂ”). Since the rapture occurs on the Â“last day,Â” it cannot occur on any other day.</div>

He spent 33 years here on earth in the First Advent. The same way with His Second Coming. First it will be marked off the Rapture of the Church before the Tribulation, then at His Manifestation to Israel after the Tribulation, the resurrection of the just will take place:<br><br>Da 12:2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, <strong>Some to everlasting life,</strong> <strong>Some to shame and everlasting contempt.</strong><br><br>Without REvelation 20 we would think that the two resuctions here will take place at the same time.

In a parallel acount in Matthew we are told that 'taken' there just means death just like in the days of Noah when the Flood set in and the unbelieving taken:<br><br>Mt 24:38 "For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,<br><br>Mt 24:39 "and did not know until the flood came and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>took them all away</strong></span>, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.<br><br>Mt 24:40 "Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.<br><br>Mt 24:41 "Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.<br><br>.<br><br>2) all our sins have been covered <strong>positionally</strong> by the blood of Christ. God knew in advance how many and what sins we will be committing from birth to death and He has atoned for it on the cross of Christ.<br><br>The Rapture is a clear doctrine of the Bible. Rapture just means 'caught up'<br>Paul was not wrong when he wrote:<br><br>1Th 4:17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>caught up</strong></span> together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.<br><br>The question however that is in question is when will that take place? Is it before Revalations 6-19, in the middle or after it.<br><br>1) If one can clearly see the distinction between Israel and the Church, he will clearly see that the Great Tribulation is for Jacob [israel] not for the Church, that the 'caught up' doctrine Paul is predicting in the verse above is before the Tribulation.<br><br>2) if one can rightly divide the Word of Truth that the Rapture doctrine was revealed to the Church [though it has a type in the Old Testament] not to Israel, that the caught up doctrine is a mystery, then it is easy to see that the caughting up will be before the Tribulation.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>So according to you, ALL will be raptured irregardless of sins or backslidden or lukewarm condition since you say full rapture and not partial rapture? I am not arguing about pre or post but who goes up. Thanks for your answers supporting the pre trib scenario. But would like to hear more about what i raised to you here above as to who gets to go up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Devils_advocate:<br><strong><br><br>So you mean to say the person who keeps sinning and not repentant altho he/she claims to have received Christ is NOT saved so cannot go up in rapture? But you also say it has nothing to do with man's work so how to confirm whether he/she really is or is not a Christian? Since it doesn't really matter what we do good or bad after we get saved? But what if that person is generally nice but in bondage to certain sins like alchoholism, masturbation, smoking, get angry easily etc etc? Even Paul sinned after being a Christian as in Romans 7 by coveting in the flesh. But Paul got the revelation of rapture.<br><br>What about lukewarm or backslidden Christian? What about Christian who happen to sin during the time of rapture? You haven't answered fully. Thanks for your answers.<br><br>[b]IMPORTANT TO ALL REPLYING: THIS IS NOT A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE RAPTURE IS PRE OR POST TRIB OR NO RAPTURE. IT'S FOR BELIEVERS OF PRE-TRIB RAPTURE AS MENTIONED. ALTHO YOU ARE WELCOME TO CONTRIBUTE, PLS KEEP IN MIND IT'S OUT OF POINT HERE AND NO MARKS WILL BE GIVEN.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>we are talking about two different group of people here<br>1) those who profess that they are Christian, yet they live a life of sin and had no desire of repentance. to this, I would really question their confession, as in have they really put their faith in Christ or just treat Him like a fire inssurance.<br><br>2) those who had really received Christ as their savior, and had a desire to live a life according in Christ. now this group of people, though they may fall once in a while, sin once in a while, its no longer natural to them. To this group, I will say, the conversion is real, though sin may be committed and may even fell, they fell in Christ, hence still in Christ by grace.<br><br>What about lukewarm or backslidden Christian? What about Christian who happen to sin during the time of rapture?<br>ok, assuming you are right, they are Christian, then my take is that they aill still be saved, cause its really boils down to How faithful God is.<br><br>my apology for my lack of proficency in expression that may cause confussion.</div>
