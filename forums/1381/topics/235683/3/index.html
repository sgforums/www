Nobody to talk to. Just God in heaven and Jesus and His Holy Spirit. Nobody can understand anyway. Tried many times for over so many years. I think it's sometimes better that I am alone but very lonely and painful. Been going to church but always by myself. Lately joined my bro in another church but got friction. God has given me a very great trial and temptation. I wish it needn't have to be like this. I was hoping for the rapture to come so that I can say bye bye to this world. I don't want to die but thots of death and suicide do come. But praying still...</div></blockquote>here is something to share with you<br><blockquote><br>2 Timothy 2 : 8 - 13<br><br>8Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, 9for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained. 10Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.<br><br>11Here is a trustworthy saying:<br>If we died with him,<br>we will also live with him;<br>12if we endure,<br>we will also reign with him.<br>If we disown him,<br>he will also disown us;<br>13if we are faithless,<br>he will remain faithful,<br>for he cannot disown himself.<br></blockquote>I had been through a time where I wanted to just 'curse God and die', a time where I had lost almost everything I hold dear and had given up all hope.<br>I still remember those dark hours in my life, yes, even during those dark hours in my life, when I had abandon all hope and faith, God had not abandon me. To be honest, if its not for those few bros that came to encourage me, I may not be alive today.<br><br>Thats why I am saying this to you, don't give up hope, but this is easier to say than do, you need someone you can trust to confide to, that this person can encourage you on.<br><br>God bless.</div>

What more is needed other than repentance and worship of God etc? God will keep faithful Christians from the tribulation but what is the qualification?
