              </span></p><h3>How do you differentiate between persuasion and manipulation?</h3>
              <p>-by Pastor John MacArthur</p>
              <p>The difference lies in the means we use to persuade. The Word of God is
                  the only legitimate means of persuasion. Legitimate persuasion is
                  cognitive—stirring the mind with reasonable truth. Convincing with
                  tear-jerking stories, histrionics, and emotional outbursts takes an
                  unfair advantage of people and wrongly muddles their thinking. That
                  does not mean we cannot use all the communication skills available to
                  us, but we should avoid playing on people's emotions, even by repeated
                  singing or playing of hymns. These are artificial and should be avoided
                  because they bypass the reason.</p>
              <p>Our goal in preaching is to constrain people to choose
                  change because it is reasonable and right before God, not because they
                  have been manipulated into some momentary feeling or action. We
                  persuade them from the Scriptures to choose the right course of action.
                  We do not pile on emotional pressure until they break. We want them to
                  know clearly what the alternatives are and that they must choose.</p>
              <p>If after hearing our sermon someone does not know what
                  he is supposed to do about it, we did not reach that person. I believe
                  the legitimate point of persuasion ends with the clear presentation of
                  the truth and must not move beyond that to artificial emotional stimuli
                  for eliciting a response. This latter kind of appeal has produced false
                  Christians and weak believers bouncing from one emotional high to
                  another without a theology to live by.</p>
              <p>In <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/esv/1%20Tim.%204.13">1 Tim. 4:13</a>,
                  Paul writes to Timothy, "Until I come, give attention to the public
                  reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching." What he tells
                  Timothy is to read the text, explain the text, and apply the text. That
                  verse is a call to persuasive, expository preaching.</p>
              <p>Paul himself was a very persuasive preacher, but he
                  never tried to manipulate emotions to move people artificially. At the
                  end of one of his messages, King Agrippa exclaimed, "In a short time
                  you will persuade me to become a Christian" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/esv/Acts%2026.28">Acts 26:28</a>). Agrippa clearly understood the message. Sadly, he made a wrong decision in spite of his understanding.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, however, our sermons will only be as persuasive as our
                  lives. A traveling speaker who does not remain in one place long enough
                  for people to get to know him may be able to "fake" it without a
                  consistent life to back up his message, (though this is regrettable).
                  Those of us who preach to the same people week after week, however,
                  cannot do that. Our people know us, and our persuasiveness depends on
                  the quality of our lives.</p>
              <p>Paul's preaching was persuasive; but it was his life
                  that won the hearts of people. The Ephesian elders cried when Paul left
                  them, but not because they would not hear him preach anymore. They were
                  "grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they
                  should see his face no more" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/esv/Acts%2020.38">Acts 20:38</a>). The integrity of the preacher's life is a key element in persuasiveness.</p>
