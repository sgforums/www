            <div class='col-md body'>Let me share to you a true story which happened during World War 2 as told by Corrie ten Boom<br><br>"Many people came to know and trust the Lord Jesus Christ during World War 2. One was an Englishman who was held in a German prison camp for a long period of time. One day he read Psalm 91 which read:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">PS 91:1 He who dwells in the shelter of the <strong>Most High</strong> Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.<br><br>PS 91:2 I will say to the LORD, Â“My refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust!Â”<br><br>PS 91:9 For you have made the LORD, my refuge, Even the <strong>Most High</strong>, your dwelling place.<br><br>PS 91:10 No evil will befall you, Nor will any plague come near your tent.<br>PS 91:11 For He will give His angels charge concerning you, To guard you in all your ways.</span><br><br>Â“Father in heaven,Â” he prayed, Â“I see all these men dying around me, one after the other. Will I also have to die here? I am still young and I very much want to work in Your kingdom here on earth.Â”<br><br>He received this answer: Â“Rely on what you have just read and go home!!!Â”<br><br>Trusting in the Lord, he got up and walked into the corridor toward the gate. A guard called out, Â“Prisoner, where are you going?Â”<br><br>Â“I am under the protection of the Most High.Â” he replied. The guard came to attention and let him pass, for Adolf Hitler was known as Â“the Most High.Â”<br><br>He came to the gate, where a group of guards stood. They commanded him to stop and asked where he was going.<br><br>Â“I am under the protection of the Most High.Â” All the guards stood at attention as he walked out the gate.<br><br>The English officer made his way through the German countryside and eventually reached England, where he told how he had made his escape.<br><br>He was the only one to come out of that prison alive."<br><br>The above does not happen to all Christians. Some are delivered while some are given to persecution and even to martyrdom. The English brother was rescued from physical danger. But much more than that, his soul was delievered from the eternal danger of the lake of fire simply because he was under the protection of the Most High when he trusted in Christ Jesus alone for salvation.<br><br>How about you, are you under the protection of the Most High?<br><br></div>
