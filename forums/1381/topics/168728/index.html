In Taurah "Son of God" generally means somebody close to God (Adam, Salomon, David, etc.), like prophet, so could it be that Paul deliberately forbid teaching of Taurah to Pagans so that they would understand "Son of God" through their old pagan-religions (Hercules son of Zeus etc.), and so make Christianity sound as false religion to Jews through "pagan churches" (trinity etc.)?<br><br>In Bible also satan (antichrist/false prophet?) has permission from God to keep even Jesus in the desert fo 40 days, and SMALL stoning might not be dangerous (except small damage), so can we be sure where Paul got his "inspiration" and "strenght"?</div>

As far as u believe Mohammad is your prophet, I think there is no dispute that Paul is an apostle of god.<br><br>However Christ is definitely more than a prophet. He is the son of god. Was once persuaded by a muslim friend Christ is merely a prophet. After I read the bible again I am convinced he is the son of god (note: Christ openly receive worship and never did once deny that he is the son of god. His deeds are not what any "mere" prophet can compare to)</div>

Then there is nothing to discuss already. The hypothesis is that: THE BIBLE IS THE WORD OF GOD.<br>It this hypothesis is not true, that nothing else written the Bible means anything.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Karim (Kai):</div><div class="quote_body">Jesus also said that those false prophets will deceive even "ELECT", who would be more "elect" in Christianity but disciples?<br></div></blockquote>Going back to the hypothesis - Peter and the other apostles have no problem with Paul. We can assume that their credibility is strong.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Karim (Kai):</div><div class="quote_body">But into who these descriptions about seeing Jesus in desert or inside house fits, if not into revelations of Paul?<br></div></blockquote>The description was given by Luke, not Paul, in Acts. It was not a self-proclamation.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Karim (Kai):</div><div class="quote_body">If it holds true now, why not in times of Paul?<br>Now you maybe began to see whole picture of my problem here.</div></blockquote>Yes it holds true in the times of Paul as well. There are some accounts of false prophets in the NT.<br><br>As what Ironside and Laoda had asked: what is your intent of asking your question?<br><br>One cannot walk around professing to believe in "all prophets and all apostles" BECAUSE anyone can call ourselves prophets and apostles. Even in this present times, there are some preachers who call themselves prophets and apostles. So in itself, your intention is already flawed.<br><br>If you are a Muslim, it is ok to find out about what other faiths believe in - academically speaking but there is no reason to believe in every Tom, Richard and Harry you come across.<br>If you are a Christian, may I ask you to speak to your pastor about it.<br></div>

So you believe that part of the Bible and do not believe the rest ?<br><br>Who are we to judge about God's grace for him ? Before Paul, Jesus already rose from the dead and those who seek him is saved. i would rather believe that God is able to touch him - yes even him.  How about ourselves ? Who are we to question Paul's integrity ? Are we without sins ? Cast the first stone then.  The fact of the day is this - at times, we have already cast our "stones" by judging other people's sins (with or without grounds).<br><br>Stoning - i dont think the Bible mention anything about the "smallness" of stoning or it is compared with 40 days and nights in the desert without food and water.  Stoning however, is contrary to what you said - extremely fatal.  Just need to imagine this - in the old days, roads are not properly tarred like ours today. There are small stones and BIG stones here, there, everywhere. You stand in the center and the crowd (80 people ? 100 people ?) each pick up a stone in anger and throw at you.  Small damage ? i dont think so.  Anyways, i raise this issue up not really for you to look at how the crowd hates Paul - but how Paul stands up and walk away.  That is the Act of a Man after God's heart.  Evil ? Rather - he Lives in Victory - Not in Vengeance but in Faith.<br><br>Did Paul forbade the teaching of Law ?  NO !! If so, how do you explain this:<br><br>"They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. From morning till evening he explained and declared to them the kingdom of God and tried to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets." - Acts 28:23<br><br>?????<br><br>[/b]</div>
