            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all, if u r interested, pls search for <strong>"The prophecies of St. Malachy"</strong> using search engines like google or yahoo. Very interesting prophecy of the no. of popes until the end time. This present pope is the 2nd last pope acc to count of popes from last time. Very convincing as even the name Benedict xvi is connected to the prophecy.<br><br>I agree somewhat that we r on the verge of great trib. Bcos this pope is very old &amp; vatican said he is a transitional pope as they r looking for younger one. How long could he serve? I was glued to CNN, BBC etc for the election of the pope &amp; walla, BLACK SMOKE! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> A sign of the times! The 1st one in so many yrs acc to catholic sources. I think the next one just might be the antipope or false prophet but this is my own opinion only. Catholics pls dont whack me. Maybe this pope will die some time in future, or resign or gets raptured up. Holy Spirit seems to be telling me that God has given so much grace to us all-see how He preserved Pope John Paul II. Even when he was hunchback &amp; wracked with disease &amp; pain, he survived until the turn of the millenium &amp; beyond. God is so good! God is so good! God is so good, he's so good to me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Btw, this is a very nice song to me even when i m suffering now.</div>
