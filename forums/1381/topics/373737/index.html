              <p>As was written in the bible..Jehovah/Yahweh had begun creating through the prehuman Jesus/Yeshua..and an idea struck Jehovah..so he speak to Jesus..let us make man in our image..when that idea was formed and carried out..people usually will think God have a humanoid shape..and hes a guy..but just how deep does this simple phrase goes??let us make man in our image..</p>
              <p>ever since the trinitarian doctrine was infused with pure worship..this simple "let <strong><em>us</em></strong>" had been used as an evidence to the concept of trinity..but then again..when 2 or more people says let us go get something or do something..does that automatically makes that 2 or more person the same person??it does not..nor is it logical to assume that..logical thinking will correctly assume there are more than 1 person..but some will say the mystery of God is way too profound for the mind of imperfect humans to comprehend..is it true then that we have no way to understand and establish a personal relationship with God as was written in the bible??Nope. for God also said he is not a God of confusion..since he invited mere sinful humans to establish a relationship with him..it must be true and do-able..</p>
              <p>"make man in our image" from the first look, we would think humans were moulded in Jehovah's and Jesus' shape..that isnt wrong..and to quote Transformers 2: revenge of the fallen..if we are made in God's image..then who made him??(while pointing to Optimus Prime)...jokes aside..not only are humans made in the shape of God...but also inborn qualities..</p>
              <p>intelligent brain - a superior brain that thinks deeply, analyse and learn at a much faster rate than other animals..the ability to design and plan..to appreciate art,music and beauty..to make decisions..to think logically..</p>
              <p>emotions - happy= smile or laugh, upset = cry..angry = murder..haha..when God is pleased with his servants, he shows great favour to them..smilling upon them, when He is saddend by their betrayal he felt hurt at heart..when he says whoever that lay his hands upon you is touching my own eyeball, he is crying with you when you are hurt..and when he is angry with the sinful human activities..he judges and wipe out entire nations..</p>
              <p>humans have the inherent ability to love,hate, feel injustice and want justice to be served..the need to want to bow down and worship something greater than themselves..why so??</p>
              <p>Jehovah loves. Jehovah is LOVE...He hates injustice and anything bad..he is just in his judging..actually i personally feel he isnt fair..because he only looks at the best in us and judge us more on what good we did and tries his best to forgive and forget the evils we did..but if he were to judge us on our demerits..none can stand clean befoe him..that shows how loving he is..humans always wanted to worship, having that spiritual need in them is because God made us so..that we would inherently want to know and choose to love the creator and rightful sovereign of the universe..however..due to the sins of Adam and Eve..later generations are like copies from a broken photocopier machine..have the image, but has become unclear or fuzzy..hence so many bad things happen to us..otherwise..thus Jehovah said unto the prehuman Jesus...</p>

              <p><br>If you're looking at it from a biological perspective, humans are extremely flawed. Our offsprings are born weak and needs to be taken care of for at least a few years, our eyes and energy consumption are so inefficient compared to other things in the animal world, the list goes on.</p>

              <p>i do agree that humans are weaklings..even after reaching their prime..i always question myself..why doesnt God create humans with some other stronger things besides bones..something so we need not suffer broken bones and such..but what purpose does it really serve?</p>
              <p>from a biological point of view, we are right.but how about the more important point of view??the spiritual one..our spawns are weak which allows a very close parenting bond. the closeness of spawns and parents is by right something very enjoyable in the original plan of no work, all fun..most parents will agree that seeing your little one growing bigger and stronger daily little by little is one of the greatest joy in life..not forgeting that since the first sin, human bodies had degraded..scientifically speaking actually..no longer do humans live forever in their prime nowadays..and humans fall to sicknesses..so its no wonder that fuel consumption..i meant energy consumption isnt at prime level.</p>
              <p>God is much like humans.but only in the good points..yes he does exact vengence but in a loving way unlike human rulers. when people sees another being treated unjustly, they will usually feel unhappy that such a thing happened..they want justice to be served..albeit it may be in an more extreme way..how much so for the God who created everything and must stay impartial?the error will be rectify in loving guidence so they can repent..unrepentant ones of course must be ousted..</p>
