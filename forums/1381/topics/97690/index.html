Just to agree intellectually that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for our sins is not enough. Nor is it enough to have an emotional experience.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..that is a good question. shows that u r keeping track of the flow of events  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>From the chart itself, it really does seem that everybody before Christ is doomed. well....if you wanna put it that way. But first understand the nature of God. Like i mentioned in the 'Dead babies go to heaven' thread, we often scrutiny the Bible as if we dun trust who God is and waiting to find some evidence that prove He is bad before we deny His existence and kindness towards us.<br><br>Abraham, the famous man of the OT as well as other 'OT Heroes of Faith' as spoken about in NT Hebrews 11 are ppl whom God has highly favoured. Those days there is nothing revealed about Christ, although several prophecies were spoken about Him in the OT. The people in the past (pre-Messianic age) were justified based on their faith in God and for those who do not know God (totally, just like the case of remote villages) they were judged not based on whether they know Christ or not but rather whether or not they follow the conscience God placed in them. That is to say, whether they observe God's laws (like a normal man will know murder is a sin etc).  Infact, God talked about crediting to Abraham and those who have faith in Him as being righteous.<br><br>But this doesnt fully explain God's criteria for salvation. His ways are always higher than our ways and we know God doesnt anyhow judge a person with with truth and equity He shall judge. Before and after Christ, people are still able to be saved because when Christ died on the cross, He died for the sins of people past, present and future. His one perfect sacrifice has made atonement for the sins of the entire world. It is just a matter of fact do we appreciate and accept this free gift.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

It explicitly mentioned tat the only way to salavtion is through god or something.<br>Judging using conscious is probably derived from wat taoist, buddhist or hindis have been doing all along.

U need to be christ's slave and reject all the other religion in order to get his salvation. If u don't know him, u can't accept him.

So I am right in the above paragraph ?<br><br><blockquote>For God does not show favoritism.<br>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.) This will take place on the day when God will judge men's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares. </blockquote>Your god show the most favourtism. It is naive not to accept it. He only accept christians to be in heaven according to the bible.<br><br>About the gentiles thingy, then doesn't tat prove christianity and bible is totally redundant ? Since all civilisation come out with their own laws naturally, why need the bible ? They can still go to heaven as well. Why need the bible ? The laws r formed not because of any supernature intervention or godly acts, it is just a way society works.</div>
