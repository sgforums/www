              <p>Jesus was among one of the most hated person in his life time. That's why the authority at the time tried to kill him and they did. They said he blasphemed and a false messiah.

              <p>Well it is personal opinion. Because I've never seen a person whose live is an insult to God who knows God or have the knowledge of God. They may hear about God but they never hear from God, they may have been told or read about God's work but they never see God's work, they may read the bible but they never know God. So thus they are easily fooled into believing nonsense and lies and they in turn fool others whose faith are not strong.</p>
              <p>But if that man changes his live things could be different but will not unless he stops his life of insult to God.</p>
              <p>Salvation is on the condition that the man stops his life of contempt in the eyes of God.</p>

              <p>Firstly, i am not here to condemn any religion. I have faith in God. I'm Muslim btw.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to the issue of people witnessing possessions and climing to be healed by the hands of priests, i am not disputing that. Just that i hope we all have a more open mind to these things.</p>
              <p>Have we ever thought that this could be the Devil's way of 'conning' us? He could purposely make us 'vomit' or do any other weird stuffs.  He's certainly more than capable of such things bearing in mind, he knows more about us than we do of ourselves. He's been here longer than us.</p>
              <p>I am not saying we should not trust these 'miracles', just that not to read too much into it. Rather, we should look at more important things at hand; being better people, better neighbours, better sons or daughters, better husbands or wifes, better employees or employers etc.</p>
              <p>'Miracles' or not, they are not the reasons that should make us believe in God, rather, it is God's creations; the universe, earth. animals, plants, mountains, ourselves.</p>

              <p>that doesn't mean that God doesn't love that person. salvation is a gift, which is paid for by Jesus. If God didn't love certain people, whose lives are in a mess, Jesus wouldn't have died for that person already.</p>
