              <p>1. Trinities in other religions besides Christianity</p>
              <p>2. Providing a verse that says that Jesus is God in the bible, but despondent failed to do so.</p>
              <p>3. Islam and Islam's method of salvation and Islam's version of Jesus</p>

              <p>The doctrine of Trinity is indeed unique to Christianity. The belief is in God the Father who created the universe, the Son who comes down to earth to complete the salvation and the Holy Ghost who now dwell in believers to help them live lives that glorify God. Hard to discuss when we compare Trinity to Fu Lu Shou or Super 3 in 1.</p>

              <p>1. Yes MOST christians do believe jesus was god. But as discussed earlier on, can you please provide evidence that jesus is god? Please dont use the bible to prove that jesus is god. Because if you use the bible to prove your god, then hindus, muslims, sikhs can all use their religious books to prove their gods. What we need is EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE.  Do you know what is empirical evidence?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If you're talking about the bible, there are INDIRECT verses that seems like telling us that jesus is god. BUT there are many verses in the bible that tell us directly that jesus isn't god. One good example is the bible tells us that jesus does not know the hour of the end of times. If you claim that jesus is god, he should be 100% god and 100% man. Yet jesus doesnt know the time of the end! Now, how can he be 100% god? God should be allknowing. </p>

              <p>But does it mean if your Trinity is unique, then it is more true?</p>
              <p>I mean come on, every TRINITY in every religion is unique anyway....right?</p>

              <p>1. Yes MOST christians do believe jesus was god. But as
                      discussed earlier on, can you please provide evidence that jesus is
                      god? Please dont use the bible to prove that jesus is god. Because
                      if you use the bible to prove your god, then hindus, muslims, sikhs
                      can all use their religious books to prove their gods. What we need
                      is EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE.  Do you know what is empirical
                      evidence?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If you're talking about the bible, there are INDIRECT verses
                      that seems like telling us that jesus is god. BUT there are many
                      verses in the bible that tell us directly that jesus isn't god. One
                      good example is the bible tells us that jesus does not know the
                      hour of the end of times. If you claim that jesus is god, he should
                      be 100% god and 100% man. Yet jesus doesnt know the time of the
                      end! Now, how can he be 100% god? God should be
                      allknowing. </p>

              <p>Speaking of empirical evidence. Is there one for thoughts, 
                      emotions, dreams or imagination? You can say that arguments given by religious
                       people for the existence of God can be shown to be flawed. However, the
                       same is true of any arguments made against the existence of God. 
                      Religion is purely a matter of faith; people who choose to believe in 
                      God do not have evidence to support it(Accordingly to your scientific methods) and people who choose not to believe in God do not have 
                      evidence that there is no God.</p>
              <p>So how about just let those that want to believe, believe ? Just because one believes God does not mean they do not accept the factual, testable aspects of these theories, but they 
              also acknowledge a real and tangible role for God in the process.</p>
              <p>There are many layers of misunderstanding regarding empirical evidence, and the concept of 'proof'.The truth is that  emperical evidences really can prove nothing, not even scientific theories and concepts.  What you are trying to do, is reduce the concept of faith  to empirical evidence or 
                      to scientific method. Saying that God can be proven empirically is 
                      making a claim to some ultimate power of rational and critical analysis 
                      that simply does not yet exist. Do yo have such ultimate power and critical analysis ? I really dont think so by the kind of questions and remarks you have been posting.</p>
              <p>The nature of 'scientific method', or even about the 
                      occasionally tumultuous history of scientific theory, you realise that 
                      empirical evidence and experimentation are designed to eliminate opposing or contrasting proposals about how a given system works.</p>
              <p>All I see are ramblings of a person coming into a religious place and starts mouthing off ' PROVE THIS....'  or 'PROVE THAT...' or 'SCIENCE SAYS THIS....' or' SCIENCE SAYS THAT ....;</p>
              <p>Really, from a oblique perspective point of view.</p>

              <p>Its the weekend. How about you have a cuppa.. go grab a book and READ.</p>
              <p>If you are really that curious, why not grab one of em books like that have detailed accounts of the Veracity of Jesus. Or books on 'Does God really exist' kind of books and if yes why is there still famine, disease and all that horrible stuff.</p>
              <p>And if you are unhappy, you can have a read of Christopher Hitchens books.Or Dawkins. And after you have read all these books and more, how about you give us a low down on what u REALLY think.</p>
              <p>That would be really enlightening. And perhaps, THEN you can come in here and shower us with you great knowledge and wisdom. Like the morning sun, we bask in your ultimate truth.</p>
              <p>But until then... I'll wait for the next episode.</p>

              1. According to the Bible, those who deny the deity of Christ are NOT considered believers at all. Just because you call yourself a Christian does not mean you are one. Your beliefs must also be considered. 
              
              2. If you know of a way to prove a spiritual truth by empirical means please demonstrate. It seems to me that you subscribe to some form of religious scientism but are unaware of the limitations or flaws of empiricism.
              
              3. And it is entirely legit to use the Bible to prove that Jesus claimed to be God. And this I have done so. Why should your so-called indirect verses trump my direct verses? Moreover the incarnation means that Jesus  willingly limited Himself in some ways but yet the fullness of deity is in Him. 
              
              4. Please expound on the trinity found in all other religions and I will further enlighten you on how the Christian Trinity is unique and that it is misleading to say that other religions also got their trinities as if this idea is nothing special to Christianity.
