Nowehere in the bible does it say that jesus became god. Your verses are not clear that’s why Christians disagree about trinity, I repeat for the tenth time. (quote:I showed you one verse that clearly showed that the Jews understood Jesus to be claiming to be God) = No people got stoned for blasphemy, and that does not mean he/she is god. Today people still get stoned in middle east for blasphemy but that doesn’t mean he/she is a god.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2. We can end this creationism-in-school topic. You know very well why hindu creationism or Taoist creationism isn’t taught in school. Same reason why Christian creationism isn’t taught in school.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3. Your proof that bible is “divinely inspired” are –</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a) miracles (which you have not substantiated) b) prophecies (which you have not told me how your book prophecies are more true than other religious books prophecies) …….You haven’t proven anything and now you claim your bible is  “divinely inspired” Great.</span></p>

(</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">quote:</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Please remember your absurd demand that Christians REPRODUCE the miracles in the Bible for you.) = Yes it is reasonable to demand for proof if you make a claim. And so far, you have failed to provide proof for miracles.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5. Again skirting the question. You haven’t proved to me what makes your holy book more true than the other holy books.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">6. No majority isn't always right but majority with evidence can be taken as correct. YEC = zero evidence = wrong.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">7.  (</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">quote:</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Yet you think you are open minded when you say all religions are false?) = I think its either you are on a  monologue or you are lazy to read my posts.

              <p>1. Again this shows how ignorant you are of the Bible, and failed to read properly what I wrote. Which part of my post said Jesus became God? I said that God took on human form. It is not man deified, but God emptying Himself to take on human flesh. And it is false to say that the Bible is not clear on the deity of Christ. I have proven you wrong on that. And you are playing daft here, I said that Jesus was stoned for claiming to be God. You may not believe that Jesus is God, that's besides the point. The point I am making is that Jesus was being accused of claiming to be a God. You have provided no rebuttal to this.</p>
              <p>2. Again the reason why creationism is not taught in school is because it has been defined as religion. But that does not mean that creationism is therefore false. Please know the proper distinctions.</p>
              <p>3. To a person who holds to naturalism as a worldview, nothing would convince him of the divine inspiration of the Scriptures. So why pretend to be open-minded when you are not? Patronising again?</p>
              <p>4. You said that YEC have zero evidence. This shows that you have no clue what the origins debate is all about. It is not for lack of evidence, it has got to do with the INTERPRETATION of the evidence that all sides possess. We have the same rocks and fossils, it is how we interpret them that differs.</p>
              <p>5. You never said all religions are false? You really must be one hell of a confused atheist! So which religion is true? Be honest. Or should we expect a shifty patronising reply from you again? And since when is stepping into a temple or mosque proof that one is open-minded? Can you read minds? You can be stepping into a church every week and still be happily bashing it in this forum everyday! This is your idea of being open-minded? Duh...</p>

              <p>1. My basis for believing that Jesus is God in the flesh is because that's what the Bible says. I did not make it up myself. My authority is the Bible. You may not agree with my authority or like my authority, but that's not my problem. People disagree with the teaching of Trinity for a host of reasons. But those that say because the Bible is unclear have nothing to stand on. Just take a look at your objections and so-called verses proving Jesus was not God, it was a complete failure. I said the incarnation meant that God limited Himself in the exercise of His divine faculties but that apparently just flew over your head. And why are you putting words in my mouth again and again? I already said that in the case of Jesus, the charge of blasphemy was that He claimed to be God. Please stick to the subject of Jesus and not play games about what blasphemy is. I NEVER said that blasphemy only means claiming to be God.</p>
              <p>2. Since when did I lie to myself? I was the one who told you why creationism of any form is not taught in schools. You asked for the reason and I told you so.</p>
              <p>3. It is wrong to say that I did not answer your questions. I have. But I also exercise wisdom not to "cast pearls before swine". Until you show yourself to be humble and teachable, nothing offered by way of evidence to you will be treated with proper consideration. You have already demonstrated that.</p>
              <p>4. Who recognise YEC is besides the point. The point is whether the Bible teaches it, and whether the evidence supports it. But since you are hardly interested I see not need to waste time dwelling on this.</p>
              <p>5. I really wonder whether you are a true atheist. Please answer me, "Which religion do you believe is true, as an atheist?" Or are you afraid to answer for yourself? Shall I help you out then? You said life is not black and white. But for an atheist the existence of God and the supernatural is a matter of black and white, there is no God and no such thing as the supernatural. Or you telling me you are unsure and uncertain? Then you should leave the atheist club and join the agnostic club.</p>

              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>I think the issue is not whether one is happy with their own beliefs. The issue is that beliefs have consequences, and if we truly care for people we want to help them get rid of bad beliefs. Example? Think about the Applewhite tragedy. Were they happy with their beliefs? Sure they were. You think there's a need to warn them about their beliefs? I for one think so. We should not be guided by what makes us happy (drugs can make you happy, but dead too!) but by what is right, good and true. Agree?</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. The point is that I am able to REBUTT the arguments of those who think that the Bible does not teach the deity of Christ, like the way I have done so for your proof-texts. You couldn't even touch my John 10:33 that clearly showed that Jesus' enemies understood Him to have claimed to be God. You show me a Christian who claim otherwise and I will show you a Christian who does not know the Scriptures.</p>
              <p>2. Re the miracles I have already earlier said that if you can provide the tools for proving miracles that have happened 2000 years ago, I will surely provide you the proof that they happened. Point is, you have no idea what we are dealing with here. What is even more absurd is that you demand that we reproduce the miracles before you would believe!</p>
              <p>3. Concerning kids sitting for exams, don't be silly. Examinations are a test of one's knowledge of the subject matter, not a test of truth or whether you believe it to be true. It is designed to show whether you have studied the subject. So a Christian can always answer the exam questions according to the standard textbooks without any question of conscience. Yes, I will tell students to write, "The earth is believed to be 4.5 billion years old by many scientists" or "According to XYZ text, the age of the earth is 4.5 billion years old". You think the teacher will fail the kids? I don't think so. Christians can be smart when it comes to answering exam questions. So you don't have to worry for us, though I know you are feigning concern here.</p>
              <p>4. In life there are black and white and also shades of gray. I am NOT saying that everything is either black or white. I am saying that in life MANY things are black or white. Even you would agree with that. So clearly you are guilty of MISREPRESENTING my worldview.</p>

              who claim otherwise and I will show you a Christian who does not
              know the Scriptures.</p>
              <p>2. Re the miracles I have already earlier said that if you
              can provide the tools for proving miracles that have happened 2000
              years ago, I will surely provide you the proof that they
              happened. Point is, you have no idea what we are dealing with
              here. What is even more absurd is that you demand that we reproduce
              the miracles before you would believe!</p>
              <p>3. Concerning kids sitting for exams, don't be silly.
              Examinations are a test of one's knowledge of the subject matter,
              not a test of truth or whether you believe it to be true. It is
              designed to show whether you have studied the subject. So a
              Christian can always answer the exam questions according to the
              standard textbooks without any question of conscience. Yes, I will
              tell students to write, "The earth is believed to be 4.5 billion
              years old by many scientists" or "According to XYZ text, the age of
              the earth is 4.5 billion years old". You think the teacher will
              fail the kids? I don't think so. Christians can be smart when it
              comes to answering exam questions. So you don't have to worry for
              us, though I know you are feigning concern here.</p>
              <p>4. In life there are black and white and also shades of gray. I
              am NOT saying that everything is either black or white. I am saying
              that in life MANY things are black or white. Even you would agree
              with that. So clearly you are guilty of MISREPRESENTING my
              worldview.</p>

              <p>1. Similarly any non-trinitarian christian or me can also provide you verses (which i have done but you refuse to see them) to rebutt your trinity claims derived from the bible.  So my point is not whether you are right or they are wrong, but that christians interpret the bible differently when it comes to trinity. So why are you so defensive when I am not even saying you're wrong? You assume and judge a non-trinitarian christian as "unchristian". But still thats only your judgment and your interpretation of who the christian god is. :)</p>
              <p>2. Simply put, you cant reproduce the crossing of the red sea, lviing in a fish stomach, donkey talking, walking on water and flying into the skies. So I will just take it as your "claims".</p>
              <p>3. So you truly believe in your heart that the earth is 6000 years old but in the exams you will write it is 4.5 billion years old. INTERESTING! Isn't that like bearing false witness to what God has intended?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Hopefully you do feel that there are  grey areas in your religion too. </p>

              <p>I think the issue is not whether one is happy with their own
              beliefs. The issue is that beliefs have consequences, and if we
              truly care for people we want to help them get rid of bad beliefs.
              Example? Think about the Applewhite tragedy. Were they happy with
              their beliefs? Sure they were. You think there's a need to warn
              them about their beliefs? I for one think so. We should not be
              guided by what makes us happy (drugs can make you happy, but dead
              too!) but by what is right, good and true. Agree?</p>

              <p>At the very least you can see the effects of those beliefs. If those beliefs require you to harm yourself or commit mass suicide, I am sure you can be a good samaritan and point them out. Other beliefs may not have such drastic consequences but you can also help to point out flaws in them.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. You tried to produce a proof-text and I rebutted you on that. But you have not rebutted my John 10:33. I am hardly being defensive here. I don't think your offense was even strong to begin with! BTW, I am only saying what the Bible says, that those who deny Christ as God are not true believers.</p>
              <p>2. Indeed I cannot reproduce the miracles to you, but I don't see how that would mean these things did not happen. Unless you hold to a naturalistic view of the world you have no basis to deny that miracles can happen.</p>
              <p>3. You failed to understand as usual. Why would it be false witness to write the answers as the examination require? Are exams the test of one's beliefs? Do exams require you to swear on the truth of what you wrote? The answer is NO. It is the test of one's knowledge of the subject matter. Get this clear please.</p>
              <p>4. As far as the Bible is concern, where it speaks clearly we should also speak clearly. Where it does not speak clearly Christian liberty and charity should be the guide, so long as it does not violate other parts of Scripture.</p>
