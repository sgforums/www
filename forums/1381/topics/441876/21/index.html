              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. Yes, indeed the doctrine of the incarnation is clearly
              taught. And the verse I showed you is crystal clear. You are just
              playing daft here.</p>
              <p>2. Typo error re the point about Jews rejecting the OT, I meant
              NT.</p>
              <p>3. Creationism is NOT taught in secular schools at all. So
              what's with the irrelevant point about Hindu creationism?</p>
              <p>4. Creationism is labeled as pseudo-science, but if that is so,
              then evolutonism should also be labeled pseudo-science.</p>
              <p>5. Since when is confidence in what the Bible says about origins
              something to be considered wrong? It is entirely reasonable to
              believe that God created the universe. We have a local scientist
              here by the name of Dr Aw Swee Eng, in the department of nuclear
              medicine at SGH. Go check him out.</p>
              <p>6. Your dismissal of the Bible rests of spurious reasons. It is
              silly and absurd to expect Christians to reproduce miracles for
              you.</p>
              <p>7. The point about owyh is that it is a limitation of Hebrew
              language and a matter of translation. There is nothing wrong with
              calling a bat a winged animal, is there?</p>
              <p>8. Yes, I believe the earth is about 6000 years. You can add up
              the chronologies in the Bible and come to this conclusion as well.
              Else tell me how come prior to Darwin it was universally believed
              that the earth was 6000 years old?</p>
              <p>9. Pray tell what was the content of Jesus' blasphemy for which
              the Jews wanted to stone Him? Hint: John 10:33</p>
              <p>10. Are you open to other religions? Then you are clearly
              confused. As an atheist you should be saying that all religions are
              simply results of evolutionary processes, invented for survival
              purposes.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BroInChrist,</p>
              <p>1. Let's conclude fairly shall we? About the incarnation, the bible is pretty unclear, that is why some christians say jesus is god while some christians say jesus isn't. Both camps use verses to justify their beliefs. I am not gonna say who's right or wrong, but I'm just saying, the bible is generic and thats why the different interpretations. Moreover, you only showed me one verse that says "jesus and the father are one". When someone says he is one with the other, it can MEAN ALOT OF THINGS. </p>
              <p>2. ok</p>
              <p>3. Yes I know all forms of creationism isnt taught in schools. I am asking you why? Which you have still not answered me. Why are all forms of creationism not taught in most schools? Do you have a reason?</p>
              <p>4. My friend. If you say evolution is pseudo-science, you are disagreeing with the majority of scientists. Evolution is well founded. Very well founded. </p>
              <p>5. If you say the origins of the bible is your god, then prove it. I am ok with you saying that it's your god who did it. But please prove it. And if you use the bible to prove it, again I ask you what makes your holy book more true than the rest of the holy books. This is the 2nd question you have continuously not answered.</p>
              <p>6. My dismissal of the bible based on the reasons given are reasonable. Many christian theologians also agree that the bible isn't perfect. Only creationist-fundamentalist christians like you will insist the bible is perfect word for word. I have met many christians who have also admitted that the bible isn't perfect and complete. But your pride has blinded you.</p>
              <p>7. Like I said before, its funny how you need to do the explanation for all the inconsistencies and errors in the book that was "supposedly inspired" by an allknowing god. It's strange isnt it? That christians likeyou have to do so much explanation on behalf of your god. Shows that your bible isnt very clear to begin with!</p>
              <p>8. Sadly, i know many christians who would strongly disagree with you regarding the age of the earth. They say christians like you make them look stupid.</p>
              <p>9. 2000 years ago, when someone commits blasphemy, he/she is sentenced to death. And that doesnt mean he/she is a god just because he/she claims he/she is. </p>
              <p>10. Dont be silly. Yes I know the purpose of religions but yet I am open to the religions. I see beauty in religions. I am not like you. I am not narrow minded. You only are open to one religion and you think the rest are trash. You have not even answered my question. Are you openminded like me? Are you able to walk into a temple or mosque to see the beauty of other religions? You cant. BECAUSE you have closed your mind.</p>

              <p>No, but I will believe a Book that originates from plenty

              that has eyewitness accounts, references from non-Christian
              sources and a present-day church (with historical roots all

              <p>Please explain and make sense</p>

              <p>1. Yes I am sicnerely asking for nonchristian sources, that Servant claimed.</p>
              <p>2. I am also asking about the eyewitneesses accounts. Did he mean the eyewitnesses accounts in the bible? Can a person use a book to prove itself?? Can I use a history book to prove itself? Can I use a story book to prove itself?</p>
              <p>3. Age of the church proving that jesus is god? Well if that's the case, then age of the islam with all its scriptures, age of hinduism with all its scriptures, , age of sikhism with all its scriptures,  and age of greek religion with all its scriptures,  can all prove their gods. There is no correlation right? Please clarify.</p>

              <p>BroInChrist,</p>
              <p>1. Let's conclude fairly shall we? About the incarnation, the bible is pretty unclear, that is why some christians say jesus is god while some christians say jesus isn't. Both camps use verses to justify their beliefs. I am not gonna say who's right or wrong, but I'm just saying, the bible is generic and thats why the different interpretations. Moreover, you only showed me one verse that says "jesus and the father are one". When someone says he is one with the other, it can MEAN ALOT OF THINGS. </p>
              <p>2. ok</p>
              <p>3. Yes I know all forms of creationism isnt taught in schools. I am asking you why? Which you have still not answered me. Why are all forms of creationism not taught in most schools? Do you have a reason?</p>
              <p>4. My friend. If you say evolution is pseudo-science, you are disagreeing with the majority of scientists. Evolution is well founded. Very well founded. </p>
              <p>5. If you say the origins of the bible is your god, then prove it. I am ok with you saying that it's your god who did it. But please prove it. And if you use the bible to prove it, again I ask you what makes your holy book more true than the rest of the holy books. This is the 2nd question you have continuously not answered.</p>
              <p>6. My dismissal of the bible based on the reasons given are reasonable. Many christian theologians also agree that the bible isn't perfect. Only creationist-fundamentalist christians like you will insist the bible is perfect word for word. I have met many christians who have also admitted that the bible isn't perfect and complete. But your pride has blinded you.</p>
              <p>7. Like I said before, its funny how you need to do the explanation for all the inconsistencies and errors in the book that was "supposedly inspired" by an allknowing god. It's strange isnt it? That christians likeyou have to do so much explanation on behalf of your god. Shows that your bible isnt very clear to begin with!</p>
              <p>8. Sadly, i know many christians who would strongly disagree with you regarding the age of the earth. They say christians like you make them look stupid.</p>
              <p>9. 2000 years ago, when someone commits blasphemy, he/she is sentenced to death. And that doesnt mean he/she is a god just because he/she claims he/she is. </p>
              <p>10. Dont be silly. Yes I know the purpose of religions but yet I am open to the religions. I see beauty in religions. I am not like you. I am not narrow minded. You only are open to one religion and you think the rest are trash. You have not even answered my question. Are you openminded like me? Are you able to walk into a temple or mosque to see the beauty of other religions? You cant. BECAUSE you have closed your mind.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>OK, let's conclude fairly then.</p>
              <p>1. The doctrine of the incarnation is clearly taught in Scripture. People who think the Bible have verses that support the non-deity of Christ clearly FAILED to grapple with the doctrine of the incarnation and what that means. Already the very fact that God took on human form is already a self-imposed limitation in terms of where Jesus can be at any point in time. I showed you one verse that clearly showed that the Jews understood Jesus to be claiming to be God and thus guilty of blasphemy and deserving of stoning. Yes, people can be stoned for blasphemy and blasphemy is not just restricted to claiming to be God. But in Jesus' case, the charge of blasphemy was the claim to be God. Your failure to grasp this point is evident.</p>
              <p>2. Creationism is not taught in school because it has been defined as religion, simple as that. But I would also argue that evolutionism should not be taught in school because it is also a religion. And yes I realise that I would be disagreeing with many people on this. Many think that evolution is well-founded. I used to think the same too. But I now know better. In any case, majority does not determine truth.</p>
              <p>3. A proof of the Bible's divine source is the fact of fulfilled prophecies. Of course the standard atheist comeback would be that these are all after-the-fact recon. But I think this line of argument is easily rebutted.</p>
              <p>4. Please remember your absurd demand that Christians REPRODUCE the miracles in the Bible for you. Is this demand reasonable? How so?</p>
              <p>5. You are throwing in another red herring about me having to defend the Bible from your bashing. Why? Is it because your objections have been refuted and now you are harping about why Christians have to defend the Bible? What's your point really? That God has to appear before you and validate every single passage until you are satisfied? Why should He?</p>
              <p>6. Yes, there will be many Christians today who would disagree with me regarding the age of the earth. Just a couple of centuries ago it would have been the reverse. Again so what if majority disagree with me on this? Are you saying that majority determines the truth? There are reasons why many choose to depart from the plain teaching of the Bible. In fact, many OEC have said that when it comes to exegesis, it is the YEC who have the better argument. But the reason why OEC rejects that plain meaning is because they have chosen to defer the Bible to science.</p>
              <p>7. You said I am narrow minded because I think only my religion is true. Yet you think you are open minded when you say all religions are false? If this is not warped thinking I don't know what is. And as far as I can tell, your bragging about seeing the beauty in other religions is sheer patronising and not speaking honestly. BTW, do you see the beauty in Christianity? I think we know the answer to that already. And please don't go on a red herring here. Whether I step into a mosque or a temple is totally IRRELEVANT.</p>

              to think the same too. But I now know better. In any case, majority
              does not determine truth.</p>
              <p>3. A proof of the Bible's divine source is the fact of fulfilled
              prophecies. Of course the standard atheist comeback would be that
              these are all after-the-fact recon. But I think this line of
              argument is easily rebutted.</p>
              <p>4. Please remember your absurd demand that Christians REPRODUCE
              the miracles in the Bible for you. Is this demand reasonable? How
              so?</p>
              <p>5. You are throwing in another red herring about me having to
              defend the Bible from your bashing. Why? Is it because your
              objections have been refuted and now you are harping about why
              Christians have to defend the Bible? What's your point really? That
              God has to appear before you and validate every single passage
              until you are satisfied? Why should He?</p>
              <p>6. Yes, there will be many Christians today who would disagree
              with me regarding the age of the earth. Just a couple of centuries
              ago it would have been the reverse. Again so what if majority
              disagree with me on this? Are you saying that majority determines
              the truth? There are reasons why many choose to depart from the
              plain teaching of the Bible. In fact, many OEC have said that when
              it comes to exegesis, it is the YEC who have the better argument.
              But the reason why OEC rejects that plain meaning is because they
              have chosen to defer the Bible to science.</p>
              <p>7. You said I am narrow minded because I think only my religion
              is true. Yet you think you are open minded when you say all
              religions are false? If this is not warped thinking I don't know
              what is. And as far as I can tell, your bragging about seeing the
              beauty in other religions is sheer patronising and not speaking
              honestly. BTW, do you see the beauty in Christianity? I think we
              know the answer to that already. And please don't go on a red
              herring here. Whether I step into a mosque or a temple is totally
              IRRELEVANT.</p>

              trinity, I repeat for the tenth time. (quote:I showed you one verse that
              clearly showed that the Jews understood Jesus to be claiming to be God) = No
              people got stoned for blasphemy, and that does not mean he/she is god. Today
              people still get stoned in middle east for blasphemy but that doesn’t mean
