              <p>Fact is, there are people who are anti-Christians, and I don't know if you count yourself among them. Jesus said that there is no neutral position when it comes to Him. He said that those who are not against Him are FOR Him. But I see a double standard being used here. Christians are called all sorts of names for simply sharing the faith (extremists, fundamentalists etc) but you are now offended if you take a hard stance against Christianity and are being labelled by the Bible as an anti-Christ?</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Let's see how well you fare using the Bible, shall we?</p>
              <p>1. I already said that the doctrine of the incarnation explained
              the part about Jesus not knowing about the time of His Second
              Coming. You are clearly out of touch with what this doctrine is all
              about. Jesus limited the use of His divine powers but that is a
              self-imposed limitation, it in no way diminishes His divine nature.
              Which part of your Bible in Matt 19 has Jesus denying His goodness?
              Please produce the relevant portion, if you can. Denying means that
              Jesus said, "I am not good, only God is." or "Don't call me good,
              I'm not good at all." None of the above verses prove anything
              remotely close to Jesus not being God. I have given you one clear
              verse from John 10 and you have not even addressed that.</p>
              <p>2. You are committing the fallacy of irrelevant thesis. Just
              because something is not taught in secular universities today means
              you disregard it? Had you been living in Europe a few centuries ago
              you would be learning about it in universities when such
              universities were started by Christians. Anyway that is besides the
              point really. Calling it pseudo-science is merely being dismissive.
              You brag about being scientific but hardly showed yourself to be
              so. Science tries to uncover causes and effects. This universe has
              a beginning and thus begs a cause. Agree or not? Either this
              universe made itself (a logical impossibility) or it was created by
              a Being that is wholly other and not part of this universe. I
              challenge you to show how my conclusion is illogical or
              impossible.</p>
              <p>3. I have provided one relevant verse that proved that Jesus
              claimed to be God, and this was admitted by His enemies. I wait for
              you to rebutt that. As for your so-called verses, I have already
              rebutted them as not proving the case.</p>
              <p>4. Your fifth point is totally irrelevant which is why I ignored
              it. What kind of beauty are you talking about? It is in the eye of
              the beholder. You say it is beautiful, so be it. Beauty is not a
              determinant of truth.</p>

I see you made a
              lot of baseless statements there. "Jesus limited his powers. Self-imposed
              limitation". Sorry where did you get this in the bible? Where did you get
              this idea that jesus limited his own powers? Sorry but you did not address my
              question of jesus not being all-knowing. You didnt quote where you saw that
              jesus self-imposed his powers. Seriously about jesus denying he's good. If he
              was really god, his answer would be "Rightfully you have known me and seen
              me because I am who i am (or I am He)" Why go into such pains to give such
              a dubious/unclear answer? For me and non-trinity christians, its very clear. He
              was giving credit to god and not himself. But for you, you choose to "read
              so deeply" into that simple verse........lol</span></p>

              you know very clearly why Christian creationism is not taught in most schools. Ask
              yourself why creation stories of Hindusim/Sikhism are not taught in sec schools
              or NUS. Those reasons will be the same as why creation stories Christianity are
              not taught in most universities today. of Oh yes and I am so thankful that Christians
              are no longer in control of the army, government and schools. Look at the inquisition,
              crusades, colonialism and the dark ages when you guys were in control! Sure no
              one really knows the beginning of the universe, though there are evidence-backed
              theories. I can live with the fact that im not allknowing. But you seem to want
              to prove that you know even the beginning of the universe! You are quite
              arrogant to say you know the beginning of the universe when there’s no
              conclusive statement among the scientists who spend their whole lives studying
              the beginning of the universe. IT IS pseudo-science when theres no empirical
              evidence. For example, Christians say the earth is 6000 years old and that dinosaurs
              were all plant eaters. These are all clearly psedo science, created to suit the
              religion.</span></p>

              <p style="background: white;"><span lang="EN-US">3. If you’re talking about john 10
              which states that jesus is “one with the father”, that is not definite or
              conclusive. When I say I am one with my girlfriend whom I love, it doesn’t mean
              I am my girlfriend. It can be a metaphor to express how much I love my gf, and
              not literal. So your verse is not clear. I wonder why if the message of jesus
              is god is so important, yet the bible isn’t very clear and precise about it. I wonder
              why.</span></p>

              <p style="background: white;"><span lang="EN-US">4. So according to you, the other
              trinites are not beautiful? Oh that’s a pity. Maybe you haven’t studied them
              well enough! I do think the Christian trinity is beautiful too just like the
              hindu trinity is unique!</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-US"></span></p>

              <p>Rooney,</p>
              <p>It's one thing to say that you don't agree with the teachings and preachings of Christianity, and you probably don't also agree with the teachings and preachings of other religions as well. But sometimes actions speak louder than words. When it seems that your target is Christianity or that you have singled out Christianity for bashing, then I think the label sticks.</p>

              can still refuse to believe they are the original and stick to
              their guns. But I suppose you have never heard the term "textual

              <p>There is no obligation or onus on me to produce a talking donkey

              will dismiss any claim of the supernatural without even bothering
              to take a second look. You are clearly operating on prejudice here.
              The arrogance and haughtiness you demonstrate exposes the lie that

              <p>Big claims need big evidence. Again I stress the difference. Qin Shi Huang, Julius Caesar or any historical figure did not claim that they are divine or that they flew up into the skies. Neither did their followers and loyalties wrote books to tell people that they rose from dead, walked on water or flew into space.</p>
              <p>You see the big difference?</p>
              <p>It makes sense, there are original records, eye witnesses accounts, then it's all ok.</p>
              <p>But when it doesn't make sense....and NO original records (like the bible).......then it is only as good as a religious/faith scripture.</p>
              <p>WOULD YOU believe a book that is 4000 years old, no records and say that Santa Claus flew to the moon or Chang Er flew to the moon with her rabbit?</p>
              </div>

              <p>No, but I will believe a Book that originates from plenty of archived manuscripts and credible archaeological evidence, that has eyewitness accounts, references from non-Christian sources and a present-day church (with historical roots all the way back to the time of Jesus Christ) that is a visible symbol of everything that the Bible stands for.</p>
              <p>Actually, all this is from the article that I posted which makes all this as clear as daylight. So looking at your silence on this article, logic would now suggest that you don't have an answer to all this, despite your pretence of being open and knowledgeble.</p>
              <p>Just a friendly piece of advice: it's okay to say 'I don't know' or 'perhaps I am wrong', really. You won't lose any respect for that. </p>

              <p style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1. I see you made a lot of baseless statements there. "Jesus limited his powers. Self-imposed limitation". Sorry where did you get this in the bible? Where did you get this idea that jesus limited his own powers? Sorry but you did not address my question of jesus not being all-knowing. You didnt quote where you saw that jesus self-imposed his powers. Seriously about jesus denying he's good. If he was really god, his answer would be "Rightfully you have known me and seen me because I am who i am (or I am He)" Why go into such pains to give such a dubious/unclear answer? For me and non-trinity christians, its very clear. He was giving credit to god and not himself. But for you, you choose to "read so deeply" into that simple verse........lol</span></p>
              <p style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="background-color: white;"><span>2. I think you know very clearly why Christian creationism is not taught in most schools. Ask yourself why creation stories of Hindusim/Sikhism are not taught in sec schools or NUS. Those reasons will be the same as why creation stories Christianity are not taught in most universities today. of Oh yes and I am so thankful that Christians are no longer in control of the army, government and schools. Look at the inquisition, crusades, colonialism and the dark ages when you guys were in control! Sure no one really knows the beginning of the universe, though there are evidence-backed theories. I can live with the fact that im not allknowing. But you seem to want to prove that you know even the beginning of the universe! You are quite arrogant to say you know the beginning of the universe when there’s no conclusive statement among the scientists who spend their whole lives studying the beginning of the universe. IT IS pseudo-science when theres no empirical evidence. For example, Christians say the earth is 6000 years old and that dinosaurs were all plant eaters. These are all clearly psedo science, created to suit the religion.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span>3. If you’re talking about john 10 which states that jesus is “one with the father”, that is not definite or conclusive. When I say I am one with my girlfriend whom I love, it doesn’t mean I am my girlfriend. It can be a metaphor to express how much I love my gf, and not literal. So your verse is not clear. I wonder why if the message of jesus is god is so important, yet the bible isn’t very clear and precise about it. I wonder why.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span>4. So according to you, the other trinites are not beautiful? Oh that’s a pity. Maybe you haven’t studied them well enough! I do think the Christian trinity is beautiful too just like the hindu trinity is unique!</span></p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. To cut the long story short, please read up on the doctrine of the incarnation here <a href="http://creation.com/incarnation-why-god-became-man">http://creation.com/incarnation-why-god-became-man</a>. It would be casting peals before swine if I simply respond and you just ignore it. You said I make baseless statements but I think it is your ignorance that is showing.</p>
              <p>2. Jesus asked the question "Why call me good?" How is that a denial of His own divine goodness? He is only asking the person to check his own words. It is YOU who failed to read the passage simply. I am going no deeper than what the text literally said.</p>
              <p>3. Again the reason for why creationism is not being taught in our schools is a political/secular reason, and not because creationism has been shown or proven to be false. Please know the proper distinctions. Just because something is not taught in school does not mean it is false. And just because something is being taught in school does not mean it is true.</p>
              <p>4. Your point about Christians not in control of the government or what not is the fallacy of irrelevant thesis. Why bring this in at all? It's a red herring and a distraction. I could jolly well reply by saying that I am even more thankful that atheists are not running the nation. God knows how many will perish in atheistic regimes and we have already seen the sordid record of such reign in the last century.</p>
              <p>5. Regarding the beginning of the universe, the fact is that we KNOW that the universe has a beginning. Therefore logic demands that it has a cause. Why should it be arrogant of me to say that God is the cause? It is scientific materialism (a piece of philosophy) that refuses to allow a divine foot into the door, rather than the will to follow the evidence wherever it leads. You say it is arrogant of me to credit God with being the cause of the universe, but I say it is foolish of you to think that the universe made itself from nothing. And if you then claim that you do not know what created the universe, then you ought to be silent when others claim that God is creator, unless you know better or have something better to offer.</p>
              <p>6. Not all Christians believe in a 6000 year old universe. But have you considered the evidence for such a claim, or you just dismiss them outright without even thinking about it? How reasonable is such an attitude? Does such behaviour deserve to be called truth-seeking? Sincere truth seeking? Not at all. You should examine yourself honestly whether you are sincere or not. Nothing in your postings so far support the claim to be a sincere truth seeker.</p>
              <p>7. Re John 10, it is CONCLUSIVE because that's what the enemies of Jesus understood Jesus to mean. You are not a Jew, and you will never appreciate the impact of those words. In fact you are trying to dilute those words as it would sound to a pious Jew in Jesus' day. You are confused and unclear, but to His hearers it was crystal clear that Jesus claimed to be God, which is why they wanted to stone Him. And you failed to explain why Jesus did not quickly correct the Jews who wanted to stone Him if He really did not make the claim.</p>
              <p>8. Again the aesthetics of the trinities of other religions are IRRELEVANT. So what if I say they are beautiful? Beautiful in what sense? What difference does it make? Like I said, I am defending the Christian faith from those who seek to bash it. Please stick to the discussion.</p>

So please don't go on a red herring. The point is that there is nothing that we know in science that would undermine the Bible's teaching concerning the creation of the first human pair.</p>

              <p>Allow me to interject with one comment. Why do we call marriage the joining of husband and wife as one flesh? The nonbeliever has no answer, but the Bible provides the true answer. A husband and wife is one flesh in marriage because a man and woman was one flesh historically. God made Adam and from Adam's side God made Eve. If it were not true historically it would not be true today. And it is also in Genesis that we have a good reason why same-sex marriage should be forbidden. God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, or Eve and Evelyn.</p>

              It's a question for you to answer for yourself. I keep asking

              <p>hahahahahah, your response is self pawned lol!!!!!!!!!!!!    hahahahahahhahahahah!   That is why i said it depends on how one perceives if I am nice.   To christians, when i disagree with the bible I am not nice, you are one of them.  To those kind, understanding and mature christians, they have no problem with people disagreeing with Christianity. So I am "guilty of that in this forum"   Hey you are also guilty of finding fault , taking the specks out from others but you refuse to take the speck out of you, hahahahahahahahh!</p>
              <p>Hey, how I see your response to non christians here is absolutely without love. THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY IS LOVE, THAT IS WHAT GOD WANTS HIS CHILDREN TO HAVE.    AS A CHILD OF GOD, IF YOU REFUSE TO SHOW LOVE THEN YOU ARE NOT FIT TO TALK ABOUT GOD.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. To cut the long story short, please read up on the doctrine
              of the incarnation here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://creation.com/incarnation-why-god-became-man">http://creation.com/incarnation-why-god-became-man</a>.
              It would be casting peals before swine if I simply respond and you
              just ignore it. You said I make baseless statements but I
              think it is your ignorance that is showing.</p>
              <p>2. Jesus asked the question "Why call me good?" How is that
              a denial of His own divine goodness? He is only asking the person
              to check his own words. It is YOU who failed to read the passage
              simply. I am going no deeper than what the text literally said.</p>
              <p>3. Again the reason for why creationism is not being taught in
              our schools is a political/secular reason, and not because
              creationism has been shown or proven to be false. Please know the
              proper distinctions. Just because something is not taught in school
              does not mean it is false. And just because something is being
              taught in school does not mean it is true.</p>
              <p>4. Your point about Christians not in control of the government
              or what not is the fallacy of irrelevant thesis. Why bring this in
              at all? It's a red herring and a distraction. I could jolly well
              reply by saying that I am even more thankful that atheists are not
              running the nation. God knows how many will perish in atheistic
              regimes and we have already seen the sordid record of such reign in
              the last century.</p>
              <p>5. Regarding the beginning of the universe, the fact is that we
              KNOW that the universe has a beginning. Therefore logic demands
              that it has a cause. Why should it be arrogant of me to say that
              God is the cause? It is scientific materialism (a piece of
              philosophy) that refuses to allow a divine foot into the door,
              rather than the will to follow the evidence wherever it leads. You
              say it is arrogant of me to credit God with being the cause of the
              universe, but I say it is foolish of you to think that the universe
              made itself from nothing. And if you then claim that you do not
              know what created the universe, then you ought to be silent when
              others claim that God is creator, unless you know better or have
              something better to offer.</p>
              <p>6. Not all Christians believe in a 6000 year old universe. But
              have you considered the evidence for such a claim, or you just
              dismiss them outright without even thinking about it? How
              reasonable is such an attitude? Does such behaviour deserve to be
              called truth-seeking? Sincere truth seeking? Not at all. You should
              examine yourself honestly whether you are sincere or not. Nothing
              in your postings so far support the claim to be a sincere truth
              seeker.</p>
              <p>7. Re John 10, it is CONCLUSIVE because that's what the enemies
              of Jesus understood Jesus to mean. You are not a Jew, and you will
              never appreciate the impact of those words. In fact you are trying
              to dilute those words as it would sound to a pious Jew in Jesus'
              day. You are confused and unclear, but to His hearers it was
              crystal clear that Jesus claimed to be God, which is why they
              wanted to stone Him. And you failed to explain why Jesus did not
              quickly correct the Jews who wanted to stone Him if He really did
              not make the claim.</p>
              <p>8. Again the aesthetics of the trinities of other religions are
              IRRELEVANT. So what if I say they are beautiful? Beautiful in what
              sense? What difference does it make? Like I said, I am defending
              the Christian faith from those who seek to bash it. Please stick to
              the discussion.</p>

              </p><p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;" lang="EN-US">1. Where did this incarnation doctrine come from? Or was it
              invented by men? If the message of incarnation is so important, why isn’t it
              clear in the bible? If it is the main message of the bible, it should be clear.
              Instead you quote verses that are unclear (no john 10 isn’t direct that is why
              there are alternative interpretations of who jesus is). If the bible is super
              crystal clear about jesus being god, very few people would question his nature.
              Why does your god want to leave people guessing? It’s dubious! Ever wonder why
              there are so many different interpretations among Christians about who jesus is
              or doctrinal differences? Answer is because your bible is too generic and
              unclear and believers interpret it in a thousand ways! I shall look past your
              name calling tactics (swine).</span></p>

              because the bible is too generic and unclear, that is why some Christians think
              he’s god, some Christians don’t think he is. That’s why some Christians come up
              with the incarnation doctrine, some Christians don’t. Even jews who know the Hebrew
              language and believe in the old testament will tell you that God isn’t triune. (Note
              that your religion is copied/adapted from Judaism)</span></p>

I brought it up
              because you claim so proudly that Christians were in control a few hundred

You’re arrogant
              because you claim an invisible friend of yours created everything, based on a
              4000 year old book riddled with errors. That is why youre arrogant. Scientists
              who spend their whole lives studying and they are not conclusive. Yet you are
              conclusive just because your little book says so? Just because you feel good
              about it? Oh man, grow up dude. We are unsure of the beginning of the universe doesn’t
              mean we cannot elimate riduclous reasons. Like a fairy creating the universe.
              No. Santa claus creating the universe no. A 4000 year old god who said bats are
              birds creating the universe? No. I can dismiss that. But still I don’t know
              what was the beginning. Its not that I have nothing to offer. I told you there
              are theories. You can read up.</span></p>

(Not all

              prosperity gospel, nature of jesus to nature of heaven and hell, Christians quote
