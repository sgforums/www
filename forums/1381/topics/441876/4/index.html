              <p>sgdiehard, you ask me why I ask christians about their experiences? LOL. YOU were the one who claim that your christian experiences validate your god. So that is why I am counter-asking you about the hindus and muslims. Please don't keep skipping my questions.</p>
              <p>Tell me. If your religious experiences validate your god, do the other religious experiences from other religions validate their gods too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, you asked me why i wanna know about the evidence of the bible's authencity. Yes I wanna know because I wanna learn. Could you please help me out? You dont have to be a scientist to be able to autheticate the bible right?</p>

              <p>sgdiehard, I have sincere questions below -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Can you authenticate the bible? Can you prove that the contents in the modern bible are the same as the contents in the bible that the disciples used 2000 years ago? </p>
              <p>2. You said that experiences validate your God. So I am curious if you also think that other experiences validate other Gods?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok if you cannot answer these questions, let me know so I wont ask you. I hope you can answer though. :) Cheers.</p>

              <p>TCmc, despondent already said christianity is based on faith.   To this point it is clear they are worshipping and believing in God without evidence.     You keep on asking for evidence which they cannot help by giving you any proof.</p>
              <p>Such is christianity lol, that is why God does not encourage christians to question.    Doubting is a sin.      I was taught not to use intellect when worshippng God or where God is concerned.</p>
              <p>May be you may want to consider to learn about other religions, you keep asking for evidence from Christianity gets you no where.   </p>

              <p>I don't question einstein, newton and edison records/writings/photographs because</p>
              <p>1. There are supporting evidence for the records/writiings/photographs and ample of it available. </p>
              <p>2. Edison, einsterin and newton did not do things that are "out of the ordinary" like they did not claim to heal people and they did not claim to have ascended into heaven. THe things they did and wrote were logical and factual. So there's not much need to question. However, the disciples and jesus himself do claim a lot of "out of the ordinary things" in the bible. Therefore I am asking if any christian is willing to authenticate the accounts in the bible.</p>

              <p>despondent,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is not true that I go by faith when I go to the doctor. When we see a doctor, we make sure he is certified and approved by the authorites and that he has the relevant qualifications in medicine. Then we need to also know what medicine he is giving us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I DO NOT go to the doctor by faith. Maybe you do, but that is very dangerous for your health?</p>

              <p>You yourself are not diplomatic so don't point finger, hypocrite.   Don't give the crap it is not 100% by faith.   </p>
              <p>You are not as diplomatic as sgdiehard,  you are a hypocrite.   Hypocritical christians build wall and not bridges for encouraging non believers to christianity.</p>

              <p>Yes we cant tell by looking at the certificates that they are real. Therefore we can go a further step to check with the authorities or check with the schools that he attended, I mean if we really want to, we CAN find out if he's a real doctor. Systems are in place to ensure the doctors at our clinic are qualified. My point is there are MANY things in place to authenticate a doctor's professionalism and we can also check it up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No back to the bible. Yes by looking at it, we do not know if it's authentic or not, similar to the doctors' certification. That is why now I am asking you or any christian to TRY to authenticate it. I am willing to listen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a way to authenticate edison/newton's writings and doctors' certificates. But my question is - is there a way to authenticate the bible? If so, please share.</p>

              <p>I don't question einstein, newton and edison
              records/writings/photographs because</p>
              <p>1. There are supporting evidence for the
              records/writiings/photographs and ample of it available. </p>
              <p>2. Edison, einsterin and newton did not do things that are "out
              of the ordinary" like they did not claim to heal people and they
              did not claim to have ascended into heaven. THe things they did and
              wrote were logical and factual. So there's not much need to
              question. However, the disciples and jesus himself do claim a lot
              of "out of the ordinary things" in the bible. Therefore I am asking
              if any christian is willing to authenticate the accounts in the
              bible.</p>

              <p>it is not true that I go by faith when I go to the doctor. When
              we see a doctor, we make sure he is certified and approved by the
              authorites and that he has the relevant qualifications in medicine.
              Then we need to also know what medicine he is giving us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I DO NOT go to the doctor by faith. Maybe you do, but that is
              very dangerous for your health?</p>

              <p>I agree.</p>
              <p>But be prepared that there will be christians who say that they don't need doctors.  They just need to have faith that God will heal them so doctors not needed.    When I was a christian my christian friend scolded me for going to see doctor.   She said I have no faith in God that he will heal me.</p>
