              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">1. Where did this incarnation doctrine come from? Or was it invented by men? If the message of incarnation is so important, why isn’t it clear in the bible? If it is the main message of the bible, it should be clear. Instead you quote verses that are unclear (no john 10 isn’t direct that is why there are alternative interpretations of who jesus is). If the bible is super crystal clear about jesus being god, very few people would question his nature. Why does your god want to leave people guessing? It’s dubious! Ever wonder why there are so many different interpretations among Christians about who jesus is or doctrinal differences? Answer is because your bible is too generic and unclear and believers interpret it in a thousand ways! I shall look past your name calling tactics (swine).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">2. Again, because the bible is too generic and unclear, that is why some Christians think he’s god, some Christians don’t think he is. That’s why some Christians come up with the incarnation doctrine, some Christians don’t. Even jews who know the Hebrew language and believe in the old testament will tell you that God isn’t triune. (Note that your religion is copied/adapted from Judaism)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">3.No no. Wait. Tell me WHY Hinduism creationism isn’t taught in schools? Please I need to know the answer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">4. I brought it up because you claim so proudly that Christians were in control a few hundred years back. Therefore I refute your point by telling you that theocracy isn’t good.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">5. You’re arrogant because you claim an invisible friend of yours created everything, based on a 4000 year old book riddled with errors. That is why youre arrogant. Scientists who spend their whole lives studying and they are not conclusive. Yet you are conclusive just because your little book says so? Just because you feel good about it? Oh man, grow up dude. We are unsure of the beginning of the universe doesn’t mean we cannot elimate riduclous reasons. Like a fairy creating the universe. No. Santa claus creating the universe no. A 4000 year old god who said bats are birds creating the universe? No. I can dismiss that. But still I don’t know what was the beginning. Its not that I have nothing to offer. I told you there are theories. You can read up.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">6. (Not all Christians believe in a 6000 year old universe) Again the bible is so generic and unclear, Christians interpret it in so many ways. From tongues, healings, prosperity gospel, nature of jesus to nature of heaven and hell, Christians quote the bible to say different things,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">7. Excuse me if I were a jew I would stone him because he was being blasphemous, NOT BECAUSE HE WAS GOD. Even jews today hold the belief that jesus was misguided and a false prophet!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">8. Just seeing if you’re open minded about other religions. Seems like you are not.</span></p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. The doctrine of the incarnation is clearly taught in the Bible. You can't see it because you aren't even looking. Again John 10 is crystal clear, Jesus' enemies said that they are stoning Him for claiming to be God. Which part of "We are stoning you for claiming to be God" do you not understand or is generic and vague?</p>
              <p>2. Revelation in the Bible is progressive. Many Jews reject the OT because they failed to recognise Jesus as the Messiah. Yet many Jews have also believed upon Jesus as the Messiah. The deity of Jesus is fully proved from the Scriptures.</p>
              <p>3. Red herring in that Hindu creation thingy. What do we do with red herrings? We ignore them. They are what they are, a distraction.</p>
              <p>4. You failed to read properly. I said that many universities of note had Christian beginnings a few centuries ago. Had you been studying them you would not have called them pseudo-science. This is fact.</p>
              <p>5. What would be arrogant would be someone saying that I should not be confident to speak of things of which he is ignorant of. You are so confident of there being no God, so why can't I be confident of there being a God. And moreover there are many scientists who believe in God, so please do not paint the wrong picture as if all scientists are atheists.</p>
              <p>6. We are SURE that the universe has a beginning. And we are sure that the universe has a cause. While there are many scientists who refuse to think that God is the adequate cause of the universe, there are also many who have concluded that God is the best explanation. And you failed to produce any reason why belief in God is ridiculous. You mean your belief that the universe made itself is reasonable? Again the fact is that you are simply dismissing the Bible out of sheer prejudice and ignorance. Did you even ask why the Bible called bats as birds, or bothered to find out? I don't think you bothered to. Had you done the requisite research you would have found out the following:</p>
              <p>"The Hebrew word for <em>bird</em> is actually <em>owph</em> which means “fowl/winged creature.” The word <em>owph</em> simply means “to fly” or “has a wing.” So, the word includes birds, bats, and even flying insects. The alleged problem appears due to translation of <em>owp. </em>The Hebrew word for <em>bird</em> is actually <em>owph</em> which means “fowl/winged creature.” The word <em>owph</em> simply means “to fly” or “has a wing.” So, the word includes birds, bats, and even flying insects. The alleged problem appears due to translation of owph as bird. Birds are included in the word <em>owph</em>, but <em>owph</em> is not limited to birds."</p>
              <p>7. On the contrary, the Bible is pretty clear about the age of the earth such that prior to the rise of Darwinian evolution it was universally believed that the earth was not more than 6000 years old. It was the gradual chipping away at Biblical authority that led many Christians to depart from the plain sense meaning of the Bible.</p>
              <p>8. Please don't presume things foolishly. Read the Bible, the charge of blasphemy was precisely because Jesus claimed to be God! Stick to what the text says OK?</p>
              <p>9. Who are you to talk about me being open-minded about other religions when you are CLOSED to anything religious? You are just patronising other religions out there.</p>

              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-US">1. You keep saying incarnation is CLEARLY
              taught in the bible.hahahaha. And you only showed me a very dubious and unclear
              verse that seems to SUGGEST remotely that jesus is “one with the father”. Secondly,
              I don’t know how you come to a conclusion that jesus is god because people
              wanted to stone him for being blasphemous. Its like saying I wanna execute you
              for being a murderer because you are innocent. You’re very very incoherent and
              you read too much into the text.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-US">2. (You said Many Jews reject the OT because
              they failed to recognise Jesus as the Messiah) Sorry jews don’t reject the OT. They
              reject the NT. Those jews who believe jesus is a messiah are called Christian jews.
              I am talking about orthodox jews who believe only in the torah. To these jews,
              jesus was a false prophet. (You said The deity of Jesus is fully proved from
              the Scriptures). Lol sure you proved it with one verse that is so unclear and
              that needs so much inference. </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-US">3. I asked you about Hinduism creationism
              because it’s relevant. Stop brushing it aside. Come on, answer me. Tell me why
              is hInduism creationism not taught in schools? There must be legitimate

              are not accepted scholarly. Only churches and bible colleges teach pseudo
              sciences nowdays. Just like only madrasahs and muslim schools teach Islamic creationism.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-US">5. I never did say all scientists are
              atheists. There are Christian scientists, just like there are hindu ones,
              muslim ones and atheist ones. I don’t deny that. I am just saying those who
              think they know what happened in the beginning because of a 4000 year old book
              containing talking snake and magic fruit are too confident.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-US">6.(You said there are also many who have
              concluded that God is the best explanation). Ok may I know which are these sooo
              many scientists? (You mean your belief that the universe made itself is
              reasonable?) You keep saying I said the universe made itself. I didn’t say that
              for the whole of our convo. I keep telling you im not sure and that you’re the
              confident one. But then I am able to eliminate ridiculous reasons like ‘an
              invisible friend of mine did it”.  I did
              not dismiss the bible because of prejudice. I dismiss it because of lack of
              empirical evidence proving the miracles, inability to reproduce the miracles in
              it, errors in the bible, inconsistencies in it. It is not because of prejudice.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-US">Wow and you’re doing the explanation for the
              word “bird” for an all-knowing god. Ironic isn’t it? If he was real and did not
              want us to doubt, he would not have inspired such silly errors.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-US">7. So you do believe the earth is 6000 years

              <p>ok...yes...there are fundamental doctrines and deeper
              doctrines...fundamental doctrines are like the doctrines concerning
              trinity, virgin birth, salvation by grace and nt gd works, jesus
              being son of God and also God etc...</p>
              <p>doctrines on tongues, miracle healings, whether is pre,mid
              or post-tribulation are wad we call deeper doctrines which although
              are essential for christian growth and convictions are not
              considered vital to the destiny of the soul...eg, whether one speak
              in tongues or not wun determine if the person is saved...but nt
              believing in the trinity, virgin birth and jesus being God will
              affect one's destiny...hope u guys can see the difference...</p>
              <p>so when i said christians generally go along the same line, i
              meant the impt fundamental doctrines...</p>

              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">cmc,</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1. You keep saying incarnation is CLEARLY taught in the bible.hahahaha. And you only showed me a very dubious and unclear verse that seems to SUGGEST remotely that jesus is “one with the father”. Secondly, I don’t know how you come to a conclusion that jesus is god because people wanted to stone him for being blasphemous. Its like saying I wanna execute you for being a murderer because you are innocent. You’re very very incoherent and you read too much into the text.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2. (You said Many Jews reject the OT because they failed to recognise Jesus as the Messiah) Sorry jews don’t reject the OT. They reject the NT. Those jews who believe jesus is a messiah are called Christian jews. I am talking about orthodox jews who believe only in the torah. To these jews, jesus was a false prophet. (You said The deity of Jesus is fully proved from the Scriptures). Lol sure you proved it with one verse that is so unclear and that needs so much inference.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3. I asked you about Hinduism creationism because it’s relevant. Stop brushing it aside. Come on, answer me. Tell me why is hInduism creationism not taught in schools? There must be legitimate reasons. Tell me.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">4. Pseudo science is pseudo science. They are not accepted scholarly. Only churches and bible colleges teach pseudo sciences nowdays. Just like only madrasahs and muslim schools teach Islamic creationism.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5. I never did say all scientists are atheists. There are Christian scientists, just like there are hindu ones, muslim ones and atheist ones. I don’t deny that. I am just saying those who think they know what happened in the beginning because of a 4000 year old book containing talking snake and magic fruit are too confident.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">6.(You said there are also many who have concluded that God is the best explanation). Ok may I know which are these sooo many scientists? (You mean your belief that the universe made itself is reasonable?) You keep saying I said the universe made itself. I didn’t say that for the whole of our convo. I keep telling you im not sure and that you’re the confident one. But then I am able to eliminate ridiculous reasons like ‘an invisible friend of mine did it”.  I did not dismiss the bible because of prejudice. I dismiss it because of lack of empirical evidence proving the miracles, inability to reproduce the miracles in it, errors in the bible, inconsistencies in it. It is not because of prejudice.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Wow and you’re doing the explanation for the word “bird” for an all-knowing god. Ironic isn’t it? If he was real and did not want us to doubt, he would not have inspired such silly errors.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">7. So you do believe the earth is 6000 years old or do you not? The bible doesn’t say anything about the age of the earth though. Again, it’s a very unclear book.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">8. (Please don't presume things foolishly. Read the Bible, the charge of blasphemy was precisely because Jesus claimed to be God!) EXACTLY! People wanted to stone him because he blasphemed! NOT BECAUSE HE WAS GOD! Hahahahah. Where’s the link??? Hahaha. They convict him because of his crime, not because he was god literally!</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">9. You assume for me that I am patronizing other religions? I am open to other religions more than you, im quite sure of that. And I don’t mind visiting a temple, mosque or even a church. How about you?

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. Yes, indeed the doctrine of the incarnation is clearly taught. And the verse I showed you is crystal clear. You are just playing daft here.</p>
              <p>2. Typo error re the point about Jews rejecting the OT, I meant NT.</p>
              <p>3. Creationism is NOT taught in secular schools at all. So what's with the irrelevant point about Hindu creationism?</p>
              <p>4. Creationism is labeled as pseudo-science, but if that is so, then evolutonism should also be labeled pseudo-science.</p>
              <p>5. Since when is confidence in what the Bible says about origins something to be considered wrong? It is entirely reasonable to believe that God created the universe. We have a local scientist here by the name of Dr Aw Swee Eng, in the department of nuclear medicine at SGH. Go check him out.</p>
              <p>6. Your dismissal of the Bible rests of spurious reasons. It is silly and absurd to expect Christians to reproduce miracles for you.</p>
              <p>7. The point about owyh is that it is a limitation of Hebrew language and a matter of translation. There is nothing wrong with calling a bat a winged animal, is there?</p>
              <p>8. Yes, I believe the earth is about 6000 years. You can add up the chronologies in the Bible and come to this conclusion as well. Else tell me how come prior to Darwin it was universally believed that the earth was 6000 years old?</p>
              <p>9. Pray tell what was the content of Jesus' blasphemy for which the Jews wanted to stone Him? Hint: John 10:33</p>
              <p>10. Are you open to other religions? Then you are clearly confused. As an atheist you should be saying that all religions are simply results of evolutionary processes, invented for survival purposes.</p>
