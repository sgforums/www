              <p>Father and son are 2 SEPARATE people in a family. The son is younger than the father, and the son is a result of the father having sex with the mother.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So you're saying the trinity is the same as a family? Are you insulting your own god?</p>

              <p>You are trying to be correct, for the sake of being correct. Why dont you put down your pride and look at the facts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A human father and son are 2 separate beings.</p>
              <p>Father god and jesus are one being</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A human son is a product of the human father.</p>
              <p>Jesus is not a product of Father god, according to christians</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A human family consists of fahter, mother, son, brother all of whom are SEPARATE beings.</p>
              <p>the trinity consists of father, son, holysspirt, all of whom are one being.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Do you see theere are so many differences?</p>

              <p>1. Throughout our conversation, you have only SHOWN me that the scriptures have not changed over a long period of time. That is good I say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. But when I tell you that other religions also have scriptures that have not changed over a long period of time, you tell me christianity is special because of unique points like grace, miracles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. THEN I tell you all religions have unique points and miracles and that does not make any religion MORE TRUE than the other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Then I ask if you could authenticate the miracles in the bible, to prove they did happen, you said you cant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Then I ask you to prove the trinity USING your own bible, you say there's no such verse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. Then you use the family idea FIRST, to try to prove the trinity, but I have shown you that the human family is very different from the trinity concept. Then you ask me why I am using the human family, WHEN YOU WERE THE ONE WHO FIRST SUGGESTED THE HUMAN FAMILY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7. Even though I dont believe in the bible, I have told u to show me a verse to prove that jesus is god, yet you cant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And now you say I am wrong. </p>

              <p>1. You just refuse to admit that your analogy is flawedd. When you use "tan the son, tan the father", yes they are all tans, BUT are they one person? You are very poorly trained in the concept of trinity. In the trinity concept, the father and son are ONE but different. (OMG why am i teaching you this) But when you use the "tan the son, tan the father" example, its still wrong because even though they are all the "same name", they are still 2 SEPARATE beings. I have met other christians who can even give me better analogies than you do..........Even my christian friend told me before the family analogy is wrong...........why are you so prideful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. I am NOT looking for an exact word my friend. If I am, I will ask you to show me the word " trinity" in the bible. But I am asking you to show me a verse that directly says that jesus is god. Listen my friend, IF the message of jesus being god is SO important, it should be somewhere in there. And if it isn't, something is very wrong.</p>
