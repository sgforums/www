              <p>Jesus is a man on earth with power given by God to perform miracles.   As such , Jesus was no ordinary man when he was on earth.    Thus he is not an equivalent of ordinary men and definitely not 100% human.</p>

              <p>2. IF you use the bible to prove his miracles, PLEASE provide evidence to prove that the scriptures in the bible are accurate and that those scriptures were really written by eyewitnesses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take note that Christian theologians and Christian historians have acknowledged that the originals and the oldest versions of the bible have not been found. So there's nothing to compare modern bibles with to determine if they are accurate. Of course if you guys have something to prove, I would gladly listen and learn. :)</p>

              <p><br>Christians who went to Israel or nearby , saw the tomb, cave where Jesus was resurrected.     The old testament scrolls were found many years back in dead sea.</p>
              <p>Sad to say, christianity is all base on faith, they don't encourage physical stuff to prove its existence.     They will tell you without faith it is blah blah blah.  Christians are discouraged to ask.    </p>

              <p>1. Yes people saw a tomb that was "supposedly" the place where Jesus resurrected. But where is the evidence that supports the claim that the tomb is the place? </p>
              <p>2. The scrolls that were found in the DEAD SEA (dead sea scrolls) were not the originals....When I say originals, I am talking about the scriptures that the disciples wrote themselves. These have never been found. Christian historians all know that the originals have not been found.</p>
