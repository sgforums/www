              <p>Precisely the BIG SPAN OF TIME that we should be aware that the scriptures could have been changed by word of mouth or by writing.</p>
              <p>It's 2000-3000 YEARS in between and anyone could have added or subtracted stuff in it.</p>

              <p>So you're saying no one can forge/fake a photocopy without the original?</p>
              <p>I can write an "original" and then photocopy it. Is that authentic then?</p>

              <p>for the accuracy part, theologians have concluded tat the bible is accurate simply cos copies of the same manuscripts have appearedin diff timezone from diff translators who didnt noe each other and had no access to each other's transalations...lkike the dead sea scrolls and mesoteric texts came from diff parts of the world but they recorded the similar things...so the qn is wad are the chances tat there was a collaboration or plagiarism when back then there were no airplanes and getting from one place to ano6ther can take days or even months??? so are we going to ask if these copiers/translators actually knew each other and had everyone fooled? also, they spoke different languages, copied oin different languages...</p>
              <p>its like this...there was an original...translations were made by man and circulated...then somewhere along the way, the originals are lost but the translations are alredi being circulated and this continued until today...its making copies BEFORE originals were lost...if they wrote their own originals then its hard to explain how come the ''originals'' from diff translators from diff countries, speaking diff languages and living in diff times can be similar in content and accounts...surely they must have come from a common source???</p>

              <p>While reading this thread, I'm curious why there is skepticism over the historical origins of the Bible when there are supposedly 'historical events' with far less evidence to support it than the Bible.</p>
              <p>Here's a most interesting article for your reading pleasure, but I've extracted the relevant parts for those who do not want to plough through the whole thing:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.catholic.com/magazine/articles/are-the-gospels-myth">http://www.catholic.com/magazine/articles/are-the-gospels-myth</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="headline3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p class="text"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Are the Gospels Myth?</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="text">January 11, 49 B.C. is one of the most famous dates in the history of ancient Rome, even of the ancient world. On that date Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River, committing himself and his followers to civil war. Few, if any, historians doubt that the event happened. On the other hand, numerous skeptics claim that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are myth and have no basis in historical fact. Yet, as historian Paul Merkley pointed out two decades ago in his article, "The Gospels as Historical Testimony," far less historical evidence exists for the crossing of the Rubicon than does for the events depicted in the Gospels:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>There are no firsthand testimonies to Caesar’s having crossed the Rubicon (wherever it was). Caesar himself makes no mention in his memoirs of crossing any river. Four historians belonging to the next two or three generations do mention a Rubicon River, and claim that Caesar crossed it. They are: Velleius Paterculus (c.19 B.C.–c.A.D. 30); Plutarch (c.A.D. 46–120); Suetonius (75–160); and Appian (second century). All of these evidently depended on the one published eyewitness account, that of Asinius Pollio (76 B.C.–c. A.D. 4)—which account has disappeared without a trace. No manuscript copies for any of these secondary sources is to be found earlier than several hundred years after their composition. (<em>The Evangelical Quarterly</em> 58, 319-336)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Merkley observed that those skeptics who either scoff at the historical reliability of the Gospels or reject them outright as "myth" do so without much, if any, regard for the nature of history in general and the contents of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in particular.</p>
              <p class="headline3"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Historical Evidence</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>First, there is the sheer number of ancient copies of the New Testament. There are close to 5,700 full or partial Greek New Testament manuscripts in existence. Most of these date from between the second to 16th century, with the oldest, known as Papyrus 52 (which contains John 18), dating from around A.D. 100–150. By comparison, the average work by a classical author—such as Tacitus (c. A.D. 56–c. 120), Pliny the Younger (A.D. 61–113), Livy (59 B.C.–A.D. 17), and Thucydides (460–395 B.C.)—has about 20 extant manuscripts, the earliest copy usually several <em>centuries</em> newer than the original. For example, the earliest copy of works by the prominent Roman historian Suetonius (A.D. 75–130) date to A.D. 950—over 800 years after the original manuscripts had been written.</p>
              <p>In addition to the thousands of Greek manuscripts, there are an additional 10,000 Latin manuscripts, and thousands of additional manuscripts in Syriac, Aramaic, and Coptic, for a total of about 24,000 full or partial manuscripts of the New Testament. And then there are the estimated one million quotes from the New Testament in the writings of the Church Fathers (A.D. 150–1300). Obviously, the more manuscripts that are available, the better scholars are able to assess accurately what the original manuscripts contained and to correct errors that may exist in various copies.</p>
              <p>Secondly, historical details are found in the Gospels and the other books of the New Testament. These include numerous mentions of secular rulers and leaders (Caesar Augustus, Pontius Pilate, Herod, Felix, Archelaus, Agrippa, Gallio), as well as Jewish leaders (Caiaphas, Ananias)—the sort of names unlikely to be used inaccurately or even to show up in a "myth."</p>
              <p>Then there are the specifically Jewish details, including references to and descriptions of festivals, religious traditions, farming and fishing equipment, buildings, trades, social structures, and religious hierarchies. As numerous books and articles have shown in recent decades, the beliefs and ideas found in the Gospels accurately reflect a first-century Jewish context. All of this is important in responding to the claim that the Gospels were written by authors who used Greek and Egyptian myths to create a supernatural man-god out of the faint outline of a lowly Jewish carpenter.</p>
              <p>Various modern archeological discoveries have validated specific details found in the Gospels:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>In 1961 a mosaic from the third century was found in Caesarea Maritima that had the name "Nazareth" in it. This is the first known ancient non-biblical reference to Nazareth. </li>
              <li>Coins with the names of the Herod family have been discovered, including the names of Herod the king, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee (who killed John the Baptist), Herod Agrippa I (who killed James Zebedee), and Herod Agrippa II (before whom Paul testified). </li>
              <li>In 1990 an ossuary was found inscribed with the Aramaic words, "Joseph son of Caiaphas," believed to be a reference to the high priest Caiaphas. </li>
              <li>In 1968 an ossuary was discovered near Jerusalem bearing the bones of a man who had been executed by crucifixion in the first century. These are the only known remains of a man crucified in Roman Palestine, and verify the descriptions given in the Gospels of Jesus’ Crucifixion. </li>
              <li>In June 1961 Italian archaeologists excavating an ancient Roman amphitheatre near Caesarea-on-the-Sea (Maritima) uncovered a limestone block. On its face is an inscription (part of a larger dedication to Tiberius Caesar) that reads: "Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judaea." </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Numerous other finds continue to demolish the notion that the Gospels are mythologies filled with fictional names and events. </p>
