              <p>Throughout my discussion with you, you pointed out a few points
              that you think help prove your God. --</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Scriptures</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Personal experiences</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Unique point of salvation through grace</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I have shown you that ALL other religions prove their
              respective Gods with the same points too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I am a bit confused.</p>

              <p>Since you have left christianity, do you think it is ok to let them be?   It is the choice of the christians to believe in Christianity.   </p>

              <p>creationism is simple, naive and absurd to say the least. its just doesnt made any sense. anyway creationism was the thought created 2 millennium ago, where science, knowledge and technology were at best rudimentary unlike now. we have the benefit of the doubt.</p>

              <p>1. Ask most jews today, they will tell you the word "sheol" in the Torah does not refer to hell but to death. Most jews do not believe in a literal hell.</p>
              <p>So what you know is misinformed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Like I already told you. OLDEST religion is NOT equals to the MOST TRUE. You said christianity is older than buddhism which I dont see how it can be. Jesus started christianity 500 years later than Prince Gautama Buddha. So if your logic says older means more true, than Buddhism is more true than Christianity? Don't tell me Christianity is also in the old testament, because the old testament is about Judaism and not Christianity. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. You keep saying that your unique point of "relationship with Jesus" makes your religion more true.</p>
              <p>I already told you. Every religion has its unique point. Yes your religion has a UNIQUE point. But so does every other religion. But your problem is you dont bother to study other religions in depth! </p>
              <p>A unique point does NOT make a religion more true.</p>
              <p>Why cant you try to get this into your mind or try to understand facts instead of having bias opinion?</p>

              myself...u dun have to follow it...the Antioch church in the bible
              were the 1st ppl to be called christians...like i said b4, it
              depends how u define christianity...to u it started from jesus, but
              to me it didnt...u see wd i mean by apple-orange argument? our
              platforms are different to begin wif...why am i the one misinformed
              abt jews? why cun u be the one misinformed? in wd way are the words
              of a jrew more accurate than a book i read written by a theologian
              who has studied religions???</p>

              <p>1. Well try to go online and ask a few practising jews? They can tell you the torah doesnt mention hell. Or if you have jewish friends. I talked to a jewish friend of mine. He told me. And also a few onlin epracticing jews. So I believe you're misinformed. But if you have talked to jews before, tell me about it? The theologian you read about is a christian and most christians know nothing about jjews, judaism and the torah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Yes our platforms are different. But I am coming from an objective, unbiased platform. I see all religions objectively and find the similarities and differences. Unfortunately, you seem to come from a very "christian" platform which is not very objective? Don't you think so?</p>

              <p>tats cos i have a religion alredi and found my own set of beliefs...its usually those who do not have a set of religious beliefs or are stil searching who can be more ''objective''...u also need to consider the nature of the religion...creationistic religions tend to be very ''biased'' cos they believe in a SINGLE creator...</p>
              <p>in case u dunno, theologians dun juz study christianity...they study religions...its a masters' degree in religious studies nt christianity alone...</p>

              <p>1. I have talked to jews. And they tell me what judaism is about. Yet you only read a theologian's writings who's probably a CHRISTIAN, and you say I am wrong but you are correct????? Is your pride getting in the way? It's ok to be wrong sometimes you know? Why dont you find out from jews instead of christians?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Thank you for agreeing with me that you are less objective. Why dont you strive to be more objective and fair?</p>

              <p>The 2nd kind jews are jews who practice judaism and read the torah. They wait for a HUMAN king to save them from their troubles. And the 2nd kind of jews see jesus as a "lost" man. They believe jesus had good intentions but was misguided.</p>

              <p>Jews who practised judaism believe that there was this man called Jesus 2000 years ago. But to them, Jesus was not the son of god. To them, Jesus was a misguided jewish prophet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Islam however, Jesus has a special status. He is a prophet but human nonetheless, not a God or Son of God.</p>
