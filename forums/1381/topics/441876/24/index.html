              <p>I never said I do not have to back up my claims. But you have no right to accuse me of that when you fail miserably to back up your claims. As it is right now you are denying making any claims at all to get yourself off the hook. You know, that's how Jesus answered His opponents. They wanted to trap Him and asked Him questions to catch Him in a dilemma. What did He do? He turned their questions on themselves and asked them to justify their questions. They refused to answer Him, and He says then that neither will He tell them the answer. Dude, if you cannot even justify your question, you have no right to demand for the answer.</p>

              So now you have changed your mind and say that miracles cannot be empirically proven? Aren't you glad to have learned something new through self-discovery? That's progress! But let's explore a little bit more. If empirical methods cannot be used, what methods should we be using then? Come on you can do it!

              <p>well well well, that is deflecting and diverting attention to your question. ya he is smart in doing this. why? he jolly well know he doesnt have the answers directed at him, since the bible didnt explain why god did this and that? even if it did, do you think it will answer satisfactorily? example. god send a flood and kill the baddies to punish for their sins. but then god fail to realise, not all are baddies. if it send a flood to punish them, wont the good people also be punished? see the paradox here.</p>
