              <p>OK, my bad. You are not anti-Christian, but anti-Christianity
              and anti-Bible. Better?</p>
              <p>OK, so you don't have a problem with people dying, so it's all
              good as far as you are concerned ya? People die, so be it. Good
              riddance, onward with evolution!</p>
              <p>So tell me, why are you so bothered with the Christian
              explanation that we live in a cursed and fallen world because of
              sin, and that is why people die from natural disasters? The Bible
              teach that death and suffering came about because of a moral
              failure, when Adam and Eve sinned. As such death is the enemy of
              life (which is why people grieve when their loved ones die), and
              something to be destroyed at the end. But the atheist cannot even
              explain WHY there is life in the first place, or why there is
              death.</p>
              <p>Re Plate tectonics, you seem to think that I am against that.
              Again you are just so wrong. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://creation.com/catastrophic-plate-tectonics-the-geophysical-context-of-the-genesis-flood">http://creation.com/catastrophic-plate-tectonics-the-geophysical-context-of-the-genesis-flood</a></p>
              <p>An answer can be both theological and scientific, so I wonder
              why you must insist that they be mutually exclusive. God can
              used natural processes, can He not? The global flood clearly
              followed the laws of nature, with fountains of the deep bursting
              open and rains falling. But it also had a theological cause, for
              God sent the Flood to punish mankind. Scientists can describe how
              natural disasters take place, but can never tell us why natural
              disasters happen at all. At each stage they are merely describing
              what is, but not why. People die from cancer. Science can tell us
              at each stage what cancer does to the patient. But can science tell
              us why there is such a thing as cancer? The origins of cancer? They
              can't even explain the origin of life for crying out loud! My
              point: Don't look down on theological answers and beware of
              scientism. It's not that you reject Christianity, you simply
              replaced it with another religion, scientism.</p>

              <p>a) God is allknowing and he knew adam and eve would cause the world to "fall" but yet he tested adam and eve. If I know that my kids would take a knife and stab each other, I wouldnt even place a knife beside them.</p>
              <p>b) And when the human race "fell", this God claims that he still loves us. Yet he is in control in all this natural phenomenon but wouldnt stop earthquakes and typhoons from happening. Allloving? I dont see how he is?</p>
              <p>c) Allpowerful? He is allpowerful but cannot prevent disasters from happening? You would say he chooses not to? For what weird reason would an allpowerful and allloving god not want to prevent his beloved people from suffering? Suffering to test us? Sure. Tell me that suffering is to test us when you see bloated baby corspes during the asian tsunami. Or when your loved ones die in an earthquake. There is nothing "beautiful" about allowing disasters to "test us". Will you put your child/gf/bf/mother into a lion's den to test him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if we take the allknowing, allloving, allpowerful Deity out of the equation, it makes sense. People die naturally.

              You are confused as ever.
              
              Yes, Christianity and naturalism do not mixed. Both worldviews are mutually exclusive. But Christianity and science mixed very well. In fact it was the Christian worldview that gave us modern science, a fact of history that you refused to acknowledge or be bothered to check it out for yourself. And there's nothing in science that says it is based on naturalism, though its methodology can only be limited to observing that which happens in the natural world. That is the constraints or limitations of science, and should not be taken to mean that only that which science can measure or test is real.

              <p>Explain to me why if science and the Bible contradict (assuming
              you even know what a contradiction is), that the founders of modern
              science were believers and that even secular writers can credit the
              Biblical worldview with being the impetus for modern science?
              EXPLAIN this please.</p>

              <p>1. I have shown you the unscientific stuff in the book before. Cant you recall? I can privately msg you the info again. :)</p>
              <p>2. Yes many scientists were christians, that I dont deny. But that has nothing to do with the contents in the bible. </p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. Feel free to post what you want here. I am confident that your claims will be tested and found wanting, and then you will lash out at me being anti-science and what not.</p>
              <p>2. You missed the point. It's not that many scientists are Christians, but that modern science stands upon the Biblical basis that an intelligent Being (God) created the universe and that this universe is orderly because God is a God of order and upholds this order because God is not capricious but that His nature is immutable. This refutes the claim that the Bible and science are at loggerheads.</p>
              <p>3. I already cited Loren Eisley and mentioned him twice. You can also check out Rodney Stark's books.</p>

              <p>1. Nah I wont. You are looking for a fight. Why dont you google "unscientific stuff in the bible"? It's that easy. I wont post it here. You christians might get offended. :)</p>
              <p>2. Baseless statements. Muslims also say modern science is coherent with Islam ,ALLAH and muhammed. Again, prove yours to be more true. You havent, up to now.</p>

              <p>1. Why are you running away from the challenge? Talk big only issit? I don't know about other Christians here, but I'm gonna give you a run for your money.</p>
              <p>2. On what basis you said I make baseless statements? Always hiding behind other religions huh?</p>
              <p>3. Accepted means what? Agree that you are wrong?</p>
