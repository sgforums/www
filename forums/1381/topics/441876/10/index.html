              <p>1. Actually the verses that you gave to prove that jesus is god are not clear. When jesus says he is one with god, it doesn't mean he is god. Do you have any more CLEAR verses to show that jesus is god?</p>

              <p>2. But you're the one using family to compare to god. Thats why i asked you how can you use a father,mother to compare with the trinity.</p>

              <p>1. You have NOT supported your trinity claims with ANY bible verses or any evidence, and yet you keep insisting the trinity is real. Isn't it blind faith? And I already told you that the family example you gave IS WRONG, because in a family a father and son are TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE, and yet you claim jesus and father are ONE god. How can you use the family example? It's wrong!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can't even find ONE SINGLE verse that says that jesus is god in the bible and yet you keep insisting he is god, because you heard from your pastor or because other christians agree with you. Isnt' that blind faith? Where is your supporting evidence that jesus is god?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOU MAKE A CLAIM, YOU MUST PROVE IT. Up to now you have NOT prove a single thing. Do you know what is proving and what is evidence?</p>

              <p>Of course you are wrong for this point! You use 2 COMPLETELY different things to compare analogies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are like using an apple to compare it with a car and saying both are similar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A family consists of a father, mother and son, and ALL 3 ARE DIFFERENT SEPARATE PEOPLE. The father and mother have sex with each other to reproduce a son.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The trinity, according to christians, consist of father, son and holyspirit (?) and all 3 are same one person. And do any of these reproduce each other? No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So your analogy is completely illogical!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course you are wrong.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, you can be wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And sometimes I CAN BE WRONG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But this time round, you are wrong,</p>

              <p>And no, I know sometimes I can be wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the thing is, despondent, you have not even USED YOUR OWN BIBLE to support the trinity claim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you expectme to believe what you say?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where did this trinity idea come from, if there'snot even a single verse that tells us that jesus is god?</p>

              <p>Please think properly.</p>
