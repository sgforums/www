              <p>1. It is not the same. You are saying jews are expecting jesus to come back to save them. But that's wrong. In judaism, jews do not expect jesus to come and save them because to jews, jesus was misguided. :) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Ok now you are talking about the trinity. But in the bible on many occasions, Jesus himself denies being God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In luke, <span style="color: #001320; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; background-color: #f9fdff;">"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.<br></span></p>
              <p>And this is not the only verse that tells us that Jesus isn't God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In another verse, it says that only the Father and not Jesus, knows the time of the end of the world. And since God has to be all-knowing, Jesus is obviously not God because he doesnt know the time of the end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark 24: 32-36:</span><br style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; background-color: #dce2c9;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only</span></strong></span></p>

              <p>Hi despondent</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Jews believe in the old testament (genesis) and they do not see the "let us" verse as an explanation for trinity. </p>
              <p>2. Why don't you trust what jesus said? He already very clearly said that only God is good and not him. </p>
              <p>3. So you are saying jesus was not all-knowing on earth? Then how could he have been 100% god and 100% man? Thats contradicting. Trinity concept contradicts itself</p>

              <p>A few reasons -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. When jesus said that, it doesn't mean he's god. It's like a girl who loves a guy. She will say she and him are one, but they are not the same person.</p>
              <p>2. Jesus did really mean that he is one with god, and part of the trinity</p>
              <p>3. The bible is contradicting, because some verses imply that jesus is god, yet many verses also imply he's not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which reason is it, you think? And why</p>

              <p>u see, u dun have a creationist mindset...i believed in creation and God rite from the start...and for God to be God(if he exist), he must be one who doesnt contradict himself cos tat would make him an uncertain God and hence imperfect...</p>
              <p>so yes, while there may be a few possiblities, these possibilities contradict each other...so as a believer of a God who doesnt lie and contradict his Word(bible), only one of these possibilities can be correct...</p>
              <p>remember the family concept i told u abt? the bible clearly states tat theres God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit...notice the word ''God'' is common among all 3 persons??? so a 3-in-1 God would mean a family consisting of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit...its like u and ur dad belongs to the same family, bearing the same surname...u are the son, he is the father...why would the son say on one is good except my father? cos although both father and son belong to the same family, its the father who bot the hse u lived in, see to everything in the family...in biblical terms, God the Father was the one who created everything good(according to the bible)...Jesus is not the creator, his rols is the Son who came as a sacrifice to unite man to God...his role is to do the works of God on earth...but think of this, who is the originator of good in this case? its God the Father not God the Son...so who is good...only God the Father since ultimately he is the one who made everything good...</p>
              <p>i mentioned earlier tat creationistic people will usually have a standard set of beliefs...reason being such ppl believe in a God who doesnt contradict himself so ther must be a correct set of beliefs among the contradicting possibilities...hope u understand wad i mean...</p>

              <p>1. But obviously the bible contradicts itself. <span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;">because some verses imply that jesus is god, yet many verses also imply he's not. If the verses contradict themselves, how do you conclude that trinity is right because some verses say that jesus isn't God? How?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Your example of family is wrong. In a family, the husband has sex with the wife to bear children. How can you use a family to compare it to Jesus-Father-Holyspirit?</p>

              <p>u are looking at it differently...Father and Son, wad does it remind u of? father having sex wif wife is looking at it from human pt of view...creationists see things from spiritual pt of view...</p>
              <p>i said b4, God cannot contradict himself so wdever verses tat seem contradictory must be contradictory cos they have been taken out of context, interpreted based on English translation and nt original greek/hebrew...a proper study of the bible would require cross-referencing across diff books, diff testaments etc...</p>
