              <p>1. So you say salvation by grace is the difference between christianity and other religions. That is the unique thing about Christianity. Is it correct?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Yes i am not a creationist, (pls note that creationists can come from islam, christianity, judaism, sikhism or even taoism) but I want to kknow more about all the Creation Gods in all the different religions. It doesn't mean if I am an atheist, I cant question you on religion.</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p>Buddhism, Hindusim, Sikhism and Taoism are all seldom slammed
              because they are not so "aggressive" compared to Christianity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People put Christianity under more skepticism and scrutiny
              because Christians always try to "sell and spread" their religion,
              and this offends people some times.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>In all major religions, there are miracles and good testimonies

              <p>I think the human collective consciousness is more

              greater good, miracles will happen ! Irregardless of which religion
              you choose....as long as you believe wholeheartedly, good things

              <p>I agree with you.     Yes, same here I was taught to stay away from other religions and inevitably drove non christians away.   My friend told me more than once that when a person is too into christianity, he can cause some kind of tension and piss people off.   True!</p>
              <p>I have started to learn about buddhism and I am pleasantly surprised what it teaches.   It is not as bad as Christianty paints it to be.     </p>

              <p>Ahhh... yes it is the unique point of christianity, I agree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then, EVERY religion has its unique point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In islam, the unique point is to confess Allah as the only God and muhammed his prophet. Without doing so, no one can go to heaven, as the Quran claims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In hinduism, the unique point is there many Gods are the manisfestation of one God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In judaism (old testament Torah), the unique point is that there is no heaven or hell, just the belief in God </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So it doesn't mean if your religion has a unique point, it makes it the only true religion. Do you know what I am saying?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Throughout my discussion with you, you pointed out a few points that you think help prove your God. --</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Scriptures</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Personal experiences</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Unique point of salvation through grace</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I have shown you that ALL other religions prove their respective Gods with the same points too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I am a bit confused.</p>
