              <p><strong>Hearing delayed as judge has to decide if HPL, fresh group of owners can take part</strong> &lt;!-- Author --&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">By Tan Hui Yee, Housing Correspondent</span></p>
              <p>&lt;!-- more than 7 paragraphs --&gt;&lt;!-- story content : start --&gt;</p>
              <p>IT HAD all the elements of a classic courtroom drama - big bucks at stake, anxious owners and more lawyers than you could poke a stick at - but yesterday's Horizon Towers hearing was far from a stirring showdown.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The owners had gone to the High Court in a bid to overturn a Strata Titles Board (STB) ruling that aborted the collective sale of their Leonie Hill estate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But lengthy argument involving a scrum of legal eagles - at least four senior counsel and six law firms turned up - over who could actually be involved in the proceedings threw a hefty spanner in the works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two groups wanted to be included but four other parties protested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After about three hours of legal to and fro, Justice Choo Han Teck is expected to rule on Monday whether these groups can take part, which will mean the actual appeal hearing can start.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It centres on the STB's Aug 3 ruling that the sale application for the 210-unit condo was defective due to procedural errors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th para --&gt;The majority owners who signed the sale deal, represented by senior counsel Chelva Rajah from Tan, Rajah &amp; Cheah, want that decision overturned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But two other parties said they wanted to have their say as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium; color: #800000;"><span style="font-size: small;">One is a group of individuals - including pop star Ho Yeow Sun and her husband, Kong Hee - who own 13 units. All signed the sale deal and said they wanted to participate in the hearing to ensure the sale goes through.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other is the consortium led by Hotel Properties (HPL) that signed the $500 million deal in February to buy the estate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It maintains that the appeal outcome could affect the breach of contract suit it filed against the majority owners last month claiming lost profits of $800 million to $1 billion from the botched deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It had that suit adjourned on Thursday after the owners extended the sale deadline to Dec 11 but it is still 'alive'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its lawyer, Mr K. Shanmugam from Allen &amp; Gledhill, argued that if the court ruled that the STB was wrong, it could be used by majority owners to 'white-wash' their alleged breach of contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We, the purchaser, are the only real parties interested in seeing this contract through,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This rankled Mr Rajah, who argued that the majority owners were trying to get an appeal against the STB decision in order to fulfil the contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The consortium's application irked the group of more than 30 owners at court. At one point, murmurs of discontent rose from the gallery when Mr Shanmugam rose to speak.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, three separate lawyers for the minority owners who did not sign the sale agreement argued against the two groups joining the proceedings. They said it was unnecessary and would raise costs for everyone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An owner, 53-year-old real estate developer Victor Ow, said later that he had not expected things to get so complicated.</p>
              <p>'All of us like to be treated fairly...We shouldn't, as owners, be known in the market as greedy and as villains.'</p>
              <p>Wonder if they used the church fund to buy the condo. </p>

              at stake, anxious owners and more lawyers than you could poke a
              stick at - but yesterday's Horizon Towers hearing was far from a
              stirring showdown.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The owners had gone to the High Court in a bid to overturn a
              Strata Titles Board (STB) ruling that aborted the collective sale
              of their Leonie Hill estate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But lengthy argument involving a scrum of legal eagles - at
              least four senior counsel and six law firms turned up - over who
              could actually be involved in the proceedings threw a hefty spanner
              in the works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two groups wanted to be included but four other parties
              protested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After about three hours of legal to and fro, Justice Choo Han
              Teck is expected to rule on Monday whether these groups can take
              part, which will mean the actual appeal hearing can start.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It centres on the STB's Aug 3 ruling that the sale application
              for the 210-unit condo was defective due to procedural errors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th para --&gt;The majority
              owners who signed the sale deal, represented by senior counsel
              Chelva Rajah from Tan, Rajah &amp; Cheah, want that decision
              overturned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But two other parties said they wanted to have their say as
              well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: small;">One is a group of individuals - including pop
              star Ho Yeow Sun and her husband, Kong Hee - who own 13 units. All
              signed the sale deal and said they wanted to participate in the
              hearing to ensure the sale goes through.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other is the consortium led by Hotel Properties (HPL) that
              signed the $500 million deal in February to buy the estate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It maintains that the appeal outcome could affect the breach of
              contract suit it filed against the majority owners last month
              claiming lost profits of $800 million to $1 billion from the
              botched deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It had that suit adjourned on Thursday after the owners extended
              the sale deadline to Dec 11 but it is still 'alive'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its lawyer, Mr K. Shanmugam from Allen &amp; Gledhill, argued
              that if the court ruled that the STB was wrong, it could be used by
              majority owners to 'white-wash' their alleged breach of
              contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We, the purchaser, are the only real parties interested in
              seeing this contract through,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This rankled Mr Rajah, who argued that the majority owners were
              trying to get an appeal against the STB decision in order to fulfil
              the contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The consortium's application irked the group of more than 30
              owners at court. At one point, murmurs of discontent rose from the
              gallery when Mr Shanmugam rose to speak.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, three separate lawyers for the minority owners who
              did not sign the sale agreement argued against the two groups
              joining the proceedings. They said it was unnecessary and would
              raise costs for everyone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An owner, 53-year-old real estate developer Victor Ow, said
              later that he had not expected things to get so complicated.</p>
              <p>'All of us like to be treated fairly...We shouldn't, as owners,
              be known in the market as greedy and as villains.'</p>
              <p>Wonder if they used the church fund to buy the condo. </p>

              <p>STop pointing fingers at me, I merely posted the article
              here.   Whether it is one unit or 13 units as reported in
              the article,go ask SPH, don't attack me.  Damn it.</p>
              <p>You are barking at the wrong tree.  Stop your
              nuisance!   </p>

              <p>while i do agree with dukedracula, i also do not want to be dissing u, nor am i interested in defending the character of kong hee and spouse. </p>
              <p>this is a classic example of reading our presuppositions into the "evidence", in this case, the article. From your post above, you didnt just merely post the article here, you claimed, as in another earlier post that they did own 13 units, "<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">Read the article below on the purchase of 13 Units of condo by kong hee and ho.   Don't tell me SPH published fake news." </span></p>
              <p>SPH reported correctly. It was your interpretation that was flawed. There is a way in which it can be construed that the couple did own 13 units but this is not it. </p>
              <p>In any case, just wanted to highlight this as careless reading due to our prejudices. This happens to everyone (including scientists and theologians). no malice intended here. </p>
