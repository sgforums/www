              <p>i have not check out the links u gave, jus back from lunch..i had the chance to compare a JW bible and a normal NIV bible that most churches uses..other then the common words choices. the more significant difference is JW used God's name instead of titles like lord etc..</p>
              <p>btw, can tell me what other significant differences are there? or all are found in the links?? thanks</p>

              <p>7day adventist willing to go NS without handling arms is similiar to JW stand on killing. but JW has went the xtra mile in not takin sides with politics. hence not serving NS and kena jialat jialat frm SG govt lor.</p>

              <p>7day adventist willing to go NS without handling arms is similiar to JW stand on killing. but JW has went the xtra mile in not takin sides with politics. hence not serving NS and kena jialat jialat frm SG govt lor.</p>

              <p>hehe...i like your points..</p>
              <p>sounds like im a JW here..but nope..at least not nw..as for paying back caesers coin, JW do pay taxes and are very law abidding so much that (i mentioned this b4) LHL likes them if not for NS issue..in this NS thingy, what we actaully do is serving the nation..this in their view is the same as pickin a side in the human govt.</p>
              <p>and of cuz no 1 govt can please everyone cuz humans are imperfect.</p>
              <p>as according to constituional law, it is clearly stated that citizens of SG have the freedom of choice with regards to worship.in extreme debate, it actually allows even satanic worships if we were to  the law strictly.</p>
              <p>also,constitude laws are the core of laws and no lesser laws can overwrite it. but the govt here has done it lor..tats y i say twisted their very law.</p>
              <p>the illustration you gave is correct on its own.total freedom leads to chaos. hence when God gave us freewill, he also gave us laws. however,the govt gave us little freedom and also twist the law to govern the freedom..get my drift?</p>
              <p>as for the extra mile done by JW and done by certain moslems are extreme opposites so cant actually phrase like what u had. for one, JW have been known to be totally peaceful and docile and never willing to pick up arms. or they would had done so during WW1 and WW2 without so many JWs dying.</p>
              <p>as for the moslems extremists, they are well known for killing already. little wonder to wear strap ons ya? jus like a sheep (JW) and a wolf (moslem xtremists) 2 ends of extremnity ya?</p>

              <p>as per your speculation and earlier mention of the 7day adventist. it would seem(no offence to anyone i hope) the latter took an easier way out. the JW stood firmly in their stand here and got what they stand for. no need to serve NS in return to go DB for 3 years. fair and square..i dont see any disturb to public order in this case.</p>
              <p>we all know that NS especially in Sg consists of wearing a state issued uniform,taking pledges to the state,pickin up of arms. also i am pretty sure that IF there is another way of serving NS like cleaning up singapore roads and pruning without the need to take pledge and the state uniform, the JW will gladly do it. it isnt just about killing,u r right. they just dont wanna pick a side on any human govt. the govt factored in the JW will never bend to their will in this manner so they came up with the DB thingy which the JW accepted. the 3 years also calculated the damn reservist we need to serve. their lives in the DB basically differs from the regular punks who got sent in.</p>
              <p>patriotism still seems very much like taking and loving this world that satan loves. mayb its just me i guess.</p>
              <p>the cult you mentioned..yes.just didnt wanna mention names. i had a brush with mormons before..they mentioned to me apparently the US also have divine scriptures..compared to JW, i think they sound more crappish. not mentioning Mormons also usually target niche markets to preach.</p>

              <p>i wouldn't say that the 7 day folks "took the easier way out" just because serving the NS did not violate their beliefs.</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, the JWs are not unaware of the consequences, so what you decide do, you reap the results. hence it is not fair to say that the government tweak the constitution to whack the JWs. that's all i am saying with regards to this.</p>

              <p>i am slightly offended by the statement in bold. note that it's God that created the world, and just because one is patriotic then one is deemed to be on Satan's side.</p>
              <p>JWs also have their version of "sacred writings" and members are all asked to read them - The Watchtower. I've read some of them and they are equally crap.</p>
              <p>having said all that, i am not dissuading you from joining a JW group. We all do as we please. For whatever that has happened to JW globally, it is a result of their own choices (or doctrines), it has nothing to do with the government of Singapore.</p>

              <p>so far frm what i see in the bible..it means stay away from politics as one of the main thing.</p>
              <p>i defend them cuz i always defend the more persecuted..its just me on this.the wiki link u gave, i already went thru it. the treatment they get far exceeds what they did wrong if any. beaten savagely because they refuse to buy political cards..wat logic is this?</p>
              <p>if one would see, the more persecuted the JWs are, they more they feel they are doing what the bible teach. and draw strength from that.</p>
