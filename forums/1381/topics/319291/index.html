              <p><br>your assumption is that there are NO churches built in third world country? perhaps you'd like to do more research before shooting off your mouth like this.</p>
              <p>there are many churches growing in third world countries because of efforts by churches in Singapore.</p>
              <p>my own church is building these small churches in Fujian and we have a missionary/social concern/medical team that goes Batam weekly to do good work.</p>
              <p>... i cannot comment on why a mega-church will want to spend, as you say, $25,000,000 for a super structure in Singapore. they will have to account to God their own way.</p>

              <p>hmm did u see their living state?</p>
              <p>their apartments very small and jialat wan, unless u're very rich. so.. i consider them.... 2nd world la.</p>
              <p>lol anyway my point is.. in hong kong, churches are like plants. they are EVERYWHERE! small churches here and there.</p>
              <p>hmm, yeah, they will account to God, but personally i don't think it's a "bad" thing you know.</p>
              <p>humans we look at things at a human perspective.. we see things in from a limited resources viewpoint. so we will say things like, shouldn't spend money like that, it can be spent elsewhere.. etc. But God isn't limited ah.. I don't think just because there are 2-3 mega churches in singapore, the churches in the 3rd world countries are gonna starve and die out. God provided the mega churches the means to be a mega church, He will provide for the churches in the 3rd world countries too. =)</p>

              <p>unfortunately... christians are only asked to sow the seeds, water the plants.. God is the one who makes everything grow. =)</p>
              <p>God, in his own timing, will make the churches everywhere grow, so long christians continue to sow and water the seeds.</p>
              <p>i think you're looking at the perspective on human effort. like.. we're the ones who did everything etc. "wah, we only go batam, 1 island.. the other 16,999 cham liao" u know? =) don't worry.. I think God's not an inactive God, He's active in mission work too. in His time, as long as there are sowers, He will make things grow. who knows? maybe 20 years time, batam christians will double the number? =)</p>
              <p>Again, like i said above. christians should switch from their "limited resources" mindset to God's "limitedless resources" mindset. not that we're suppose to be spendtrift, but don't be worried about running out, if it's for God.</p>

              <p>Since you have already done your research.... then your research has already <strong>invalidated</strong> your original question because it has already been answered. To query over the number of islands that exist in the Indonesian archipelago and why isn't all of them reached is really nit-picking.... only yesterday, the newspaper reported a previous unknown tribe in South America....</p>
              <p>but perhaps, the intent of your question is NOT about the $25,000 economy-class church, but the $25,000,000 first-class church.</p>
              <p>If that is your intent, then you should GO to the first-class church and ask them why not spend their money in another way.</p>
              <p>It's their money, they can spend it the way THEY see fit. Having said that, they will still need to account their expenditure with the master auditor in heaven.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>I feel that it is not neccessary for a church to have a physical building. I'd rather use that money to fund missionaries and send church members overseas to help reach out to non-believers. I mean isn't that what God commanded us to do? To preach the gospel to the nations (Matthew 28:19,20) and not cosy up in our nice comfy church building and give each other holy hugs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I sometimes don't really agree at the way megachurches work. I agree with what domonkassyu posted.</p>

              <p>hmm i think of it in this perspective.</p>
              <p>if the mega churches are only interested in building big buildings, and not doing the work of God, then it's a problem</p>
              <p>but if they are, i think it doesn't matter if they build nice buildings or not.</p>
              <p>sure, the problem is ppl keep talking about the funds for the church building could be better used elsewhere, but these people forget to put God in the equation, so starts nit picking</p>
              <p>God willing, He will provide.</p>

              <p>Like recently I heard, one of the megachurches actually asked their people to contribute to their building fund when their church is already so big and nice! Is it really necessary? Wouldn't it be better to split the church up, appoint pastors to lead them and move to other places in Singapore? By doing this, we can reach out to masses even more effectively! I've always thought, the smaller a church, the better. I come from a small church, but we relate to other churches as well. And my pastor really interacts with every one of us personally, even making time to meet for lunch!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a church gets too big, how can the pastors effectively relate to his or her members? A church = spiritual family. I've heard from friends that their pastors don't help them as much (i'm not talking about helping financially) or have the time for fellowship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know what megachurches are interested in doing anymore, even if they say its God's work, it doesn't seem like it to me. It's like there is ulterior motives. Anyone from a megachurch care to share?</p>
