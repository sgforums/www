            <div class='col-md body'>oh i think i hv the ans!! lol, frm the same book again!<br><br>erm,lets see......<br><br>Adam and Eve did not have sinful natures as we had. So the temptation of sin must come from outside. The bible describes this source as the serpeant(gen3:1) used by the devil to aliniate man from God.<br><br>Why did God not prevent evil from entering the universe since He knew in adv wad wld happen? Why did he not make man incapable of sinning? God <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> have done so but we wld not have the image of God or be humans with freedom if God had done so.<br><br>so its all about sinful nature. Sin was outside them. They <strong>chose</strong>.</div>
