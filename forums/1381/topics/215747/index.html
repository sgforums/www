            <div class='col-md body'>actually each and everyone of us has demons in our body...but is just the level of purity and the level of faith that you have in God controls it..take for example...the spirit of failure, you will have thinkings that you are nt going to do this certain project and and you kip thinking that you will fail. There are many types of demons...they even have names like spirit of fear, spirit of lust etc etc...To be frank, even pastors or reverend have demons but is whether the willingness and how strong are you in God controls these demons...Rem even DEMONS tremble at name of Jesus!</div>

No!<br><br>So if a person stumble and succumb to sin, does this person stop being a Christian? also No!<br><br>The question is WHY is a person demon possessed?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">1.

Is it because his faith his weak, and his psyche is weaker?<br><br>So to answer your original question: it depends. Scenario 1, I'd say no, no Christian should dabble with the occult after his acceptance of Christ.<br>Scenario 2 is quite situational.... some converts are still financially dependent on other members of his family, so he cannot move out.<br>Scenario 3 probably can still be considered as Christian.<br><br>Having said all that,  they are just my personal opinions.<br><br>Thanks yous.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, from wad i noe christians of the reformed faith usually take the stand tat christians cun be demon-possessed...n christians in their case r defined as those predestined to be christians...hence leading to the belief tat salvation cun be lost...so the issue tat separates christians abt demon-possession is whether man has the choice to choose to allow the demon to stay in his body...many reformers in their beliefs in calvinism take the stand tat since God is in control, He wun allow His own child to be demon-possessed...so its a qn of man's freewill vs God's sovereignty...</div>
