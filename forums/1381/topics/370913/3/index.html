              <p>soul =/= spirit...soul are people(the physical body) + spirit(the invisible driving force)..just think of an electric fan thats is working normally as a soul..when i unplugged it..the electricity goes out and the fan stop turning..same as living things..hope it clears the confusion of souls and spirits..</p>

              <p>About crucifixes in Catholic churches - when people keep a picture of their loved ones in their wallets, do they love the ink and paper of the picture or the person that the picture shows? And if they kneel to read a prayer from a prayer book, are they worshipping the prayer book or just using it as a prayer aid?</p>
              <p>The crucifix is a timeless reminder of the single greatest thing that Jesus did for all of us out of love. The cement or wood in the crucifix itself can't help us, but such stark visual imagery often draws Christians into a closer relationship with Jesus Christ, now abiding in heaven (and on earth) in all glory and majesty. </p>

              <p>hmm..thanks ya..i wouldnt really think that we cant see angels cuz we are too sinful..but rather we are not made to see spirits unless they manifest themselves to us..recounting the many incidents in the bible where men saw both angels and demons..so i guess we can see them if they choose to show us..however...Jehovah/Yahweh is totally different level..just like being near the glory of the sun is enough to kill us..even when moses saw the back of God requires an angel to be like a shield for him..hmm..maybe..just maybe when humans are restored to perfection after the 1000 years reign of christ will humans be able to see God again..and i do believe if im not wrong that all angels..even satan and gang had direct access to God..and no min requirement..otherwise it would be kinda unfair isnt it??? (im a low rank angel so i cant see God??sheesh..why bother creating me then..you get my drift right...)</p>
              <p>hmm..actually i do agree with bro brey that the church(not restricted to the rcc) have been misguided themselves and misguided others in the worship of the true living God.seeing the idol of christ on a cross in a church and having congregation of people performing acts of worship in front of it really looks way too similar to si beh lor guan yin temple...we just need the joss sticks and urn to complete it..i guess bro brey had seen some form of the truth about the bible..a comprehensive version of jew i would call it..but even so..jews are no longer privillaged too..it is now  the spiritual Israel that will be saved...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>think you i would forget such a thing..no..but neither do i seek revenge against them..haha</p>

              <p>the crucifix is used too in ancient paganistic egyptians and other cultures..co incidence huh..likewise when people kneel in front of a statue say guan yu or wukong..they are praying to the "deities" the statue represents..just another prayer aid i guess..worship God in spirit for God is a spirit..never was any prayer aid being mentioned as a tool to worship God..so again i bring up this point..if JC died by electric chair...do christians nowadays wear a symbol of the electric chair??and to keep using the thing that killed and shamed him as a rememberance...i can only see how pleased JC will be...</p>

              <p>i agree with what you said..IF there is a congregation that teaches people as according to the bible..so far i dont see any...and sorry if i offend you bro..IMO..RCC is definitely not the church that teaches people the way of God..right secular values like dont commit crimes and murder, im sure RCC did a good job at it..but cant say for the gay priests =p ...but with that, almost all other religions does the same..religions for people was that it should teach good values..but for higher level..it must be the true way of God..so that when one believes in it..praises God..</p>
              <p>i can only guess what bro brey believes in about Jesus..many jews doesnt accept Jesus as being the messiah..but i though i saw brey saying he does..so that makes him an updated jew..in order to draw closer to Jehovah/Yahweh...Jesus is the only way..none other..not even mary..Jesus is the only intercessor...</p>
