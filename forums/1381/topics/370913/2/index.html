              <p>these are all your explanations, not bible or Jesus or god. I feel that its too simple using the creator concept to explain all things. if thats the case, there will be no progression of society, everything are acts and will of god.</p>

              <p>S.gal83, seriously asking questions abt God here would not provide u any rock firm answers as there r too many opinions here dat divides.</p>
              <p>a wise person might tell u to seek answers from the bible. but on top of dat, u require faith to unlock God's mysterious ways of doing things. </p>

              Yes actually there's truth to that God did promise to give rest to those whose lives honored Him.<br><br>
                                
              As for God helping by not existing...well in everything dwells God the Lord. Had the Lord stopped to exist  right now which is impossible the whole things would be gone too. Time and space and material will all be gone. Worlds(heaven, hell the world of the dead or any other) will be gone too. All living things included will be gone too. In fact all awareness will be destroyed. So evil and satan would have stopped existing too. No living things that are not connected to God. The connection is through our soul the deepest level of our consciousness or rather sub-consciousness.
                                
                                <br><br>
              But the truth is even when all things disappear God would have still existed because He has no beginning and no end. The source of all things cannot perish even when all things created do.

              You know this may be a little of relevance but if you are familiar with the movie Matrix. In the last of the trilogy when agent smith was having a duel with Neo, Smith asked Neo Why did he persist if it was obvious that he was going to lose. In which Neo answered because he choose so! We always have a choice!

              Herzog Zwei there's no person who is born without a soul. A soul is not the same with conscience. A soul is a person essence, his spirit. Nobody alive is without a soul. I don't know who told you that but everyone has a soul. A soul is also not a person emotion. A person may be numb in his feelings due to one or many reasons but it doesn't mean he doesn't have a soul.

              It is the soul that connects a person to the creator. Some usually religious people are more in tune with their soul due to one reason or another such that they develop what ordinary people now refer as psychic abilities. They are of course are not psychic but they are in tune with the spirit and in tune with their soul and the source.
                                <br><br>
              As for other people who seem to have demonstrate psychic abilities without religious context I do not know what to say but I personally believe that they are in tune too but most probably not with the creator but with other spirit. Everything supernatural comes from the spirit after all.
                                <br><br>
              Of course those people who have demonstrated psychic abilities without religious context cannot by all means to be compared with those people who are showing similar 'abilities' but with a religious context. I mean there's a clear line between what people called 'psychic' and unexplainable higher supernatural phenomenon such as bilocation or having survived without nourishment for decades.
                                <br><br>
              Meditation helps people to connect to their sacred interior where God dwells. It usually needs at least like an hour or even more such as one and a half or two of perfect nothingness. Peace would generate as you connect to the sacred interior where God dwells. Usually after the session right away. Be still and look inside of you. But I'm no expert on meditation at all. And too lazy to practice it.
