              <p>simple..because there is no hell..because there is no such thing as torment in eternity..because it is explicitly written in the bible when a person dies, s/he is conscious of nothing at all..akin to sleeping..so how can anyone be repentent when dead??it has to be when they are still alive..only when one is alive does s/he have the ability to think and act..when judgement comes..billions will be called up from their sleep so they may make their choice..for or against God..for God then live on and help out..against God then go back sleep..</p>
              <p>satan and friends wasnt chased out of eden..everyone was..but satan and friends had access to the heavens for a long time..satan often appeared in the heavely court to mock God and challenge God..until in the book of revelations where satan the original serpent, the dragon was hurled down to earth with his friends..</p>
              <p>based on your questions..if they realized their folly after adam and eve and truly repent..God will forgive them..however, they do not repent and got worse..soon angels started having sex with humans to birth nephilims..things got so bad that the flood has to come..and God knows that satan and friends will never ever repent..its now just a matter of how many humans or angels will join them in doom..</p>

              Satan and his fallen angels cannot repent. Their fall is forever.
                                                                    <br><br>
              As for people. The window to repent will close after one dies. A dead person can no longer relate to God(not able to remember God) aside from not being able to be aware of him or herself and not being able to register the passage of time. To help a death person he or she needs another person who is still alive to pray for her to God. Note that not to pray to her but to pray to God for her salvation. The very next thing that the dead would realize is that at the time of judgment but this would already be too late to repent. But a lot of people would go against what I wrote here but let it be.<br><br>
              But the primary means of being saved rests in the person's life. Life is a TREASURE of innumerable values. TREASURE your life! <b>Be aware that we don't really own anything. Our home, cars, job, money and everything else including even our own husband, wife and children ARE NOT our own really. We will depart of these things. What we really are given is TIME.</b>. <br><br>
              We can still remember God in life. So honor Him, give Him praise. I know that I fall too many times but I admit my sins in front of God in my prayer each day. I know that I'm weak and a sinner but I admit that I'm weak and a sinner. I'm always sorry that I'm weak and a sinner and I always ask for God's forgiveness one ach single day. It's important to admit our mistakes and sins!<br><br>
              Cheers

              <p>precisely..if God aint compassionate and loving..he would have wiped out every thing after the eden incident..even kill off jesus and all the angels and keep only himself alive..and recreate..treat nothing had happend..he destroyed nations that were truly bad..think nineveh..people had commented that God had destroyed it too late..you have to throw away rotten apples from the good ones right?or would you prefer to have a whole basket of rotten apples when you could have good ones?</p>

                                You fail to realize that even God's judgment is holy.  His punishments are holy. Many people miss the point that God is actually the source(the highest) authority there is. This translates to power!<br><br>
                                While the ruler of this world are not perfect or even evil and unjust God who holds the highest authority (whether you acknowledge that or not) is a holy God. In fact what makes God is so terrifying and so powerful with full authority over things is His holiness. Holiness is authority in the realm of God and we are always be in the realm of God no matter where we go. Blessed those who truly live a holy life. They will be paid by the repayer of holiness(God) and the reward is unimaginable.<br><br>
                                I can tell you for certain that many people will literally envy what His holy and chosen people are going to receive at the time of judgment. Such that they would want so much to be them. I never envy anyone in this world because I never wanted to be like them but I will envy His chosen people. In fact I already did and will always be. I live with the knowledge of what these people would receive: Unimaginable POWER. Unimaginbale even by this world's standard of ETERNAL Power. It will all boils down to power. You'll see.

              <p>then i got the answers...He allowed bad things to happen even to so called innocents like babies and children..for so many millenia so sentient beings can fully test who is right and wrong..plus he has the power to restore..then people will think he is just being selfish..will anyone let his or her parents be maglined and do nothing??do we as children not suffer too??when everything has been proven...he will do as he promised..remove death and tears of sorrow and sickness..which are all scienctifically possible..</p>

              <p>this is where man's teaching warp God's....he created heaven for his spirit creatures..all was happy..even satan and gang loves God then...all was cool..then God decide to create earth for humans...so all forms of lives were created..dinos and such to prepare the earth for humans..and so adam was born....he has a biologist's dream job...every life form imaginable was his to name..the joy of discovery nature and appreciating nature in its purest form...he cant be sad can he..</p>
              <p>but God wanted him to be even happier so he created Eve..and they were both happy until some people got vain and ruin everything..notice that God gave freewill and not created robots...satan,demons,adam and eve chose to be unhappy on their own..and God has promised the original state of happiness will be restored..thats why he sent Jesus to prepare the way..</p>
              <p>and he can foresee things..but it aint about if he can foresee or not..but rather he wants to foresee or not..</p>
