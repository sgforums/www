Why make other people pay the price as well? There are a lot of people forced into the streets as prositutes. They don't do it out of their free will. Sometimes even kids.

Why can't we try to persuade smokers to quit smoking AND provide them with filter? Quiting smoking doesn't take place over nite you know?<br><br>Same thing with AIDS. Getting people to stop having multiple sex partners is not going to be an easy task. Why can't we first use condoms to stop the spread and prevent more deaths while Vatican persuades them?</div>
