            <div class='col-md body'>I think honeybunz need to have a reality check to see tat abstinence is not working, and in future, not going to work as well. People r getting more liberal and think of sex as nothing great and the trend is likely to continue. And the assumption u made is tat tis trend is fueled by the use of condom or contraceptives.<br><br>U need to realise tis important fact. <strong>A lot of people having casual sex do not wear protection</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> They do not like the feeling etc etc etc and tat is why there is a lot of people trying to promote people to use condom and have safe sex. If everyone wear condom when they r having casual sex etc, why will anyone wanna encourage the use of condom ? Worse still the church is not helping either even though they r at the same side of the fence by trying to reduce sickness etc. Instead of comparing abstinence with condom, why don't u compare safe sex and non-safe sex ? Which will u prefer the masses to do ?<br><br>Not having sex doesn't kill u. Neither do starvation for a few days or not having a proper shelter from the weather or thirsty for a long period of time. U got to admit tat it is one of men basic instinct and people do experience a urge for such matters.</div>
