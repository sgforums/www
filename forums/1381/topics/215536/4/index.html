            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with SIS that to throw out all safeguards in hope that everyone will wake up from their idea is far lesser than ideal.<br><br>The Catholic Church knew that most people are not ideal but yet they are deploying an "ideal strategy" that is doomed to fail in reality.<br><br>ObiterDicta gave an example of not expect a student to get 100% in a physics test. Let me try to give another example. Say you take away re-tests in hope that students will work harder for the actual test. Indeed, some will. However, there will always be quite a handful who will not heed the advice and fail the first test anyway. So are you just going to fail them or give them another chance?<br><br>By the same analogy, condoms provide a safeguard for those who fail to abstain, for whatever reasons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my own personal opinion (treat this as a crazy ranting)<br><br>1) The Vatican's statement of faith in regards to condoms is only influencial to the members of the Roman Catholic Church, not to anyone else, if I am not wrong, this is just one of many instructions in regards to sex (which also includes abstinence, faithfulness to spouse ....etc)<br><br>2) Its true that the condoms do offer a certain level of protection, but its not 100% fool proof method. Though I am in a sense agreeable that 90% is better than 0% (that is if 10% failure rate can also interpret as 90% success rate?)<br><br>3) Ultimately its still up to individual responsibility when it comes to commutable deseases (HIV, STD, SARS ....etc), futhermore, sex is not the only way where HIV can be transmitted, tainted blood is another (one which that even abstinence cannot prevent).<br><br>ok...

What the church is doing is way beyond spreading their faith.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kaister:</div><div class="quote_body">In Lwak, near Lake Victoria, the director of an Aids testing centre says he cannot distribute condoms because of church opposition. Gordon Wambi told the programme: "Some priests have even been saying that condoms are laced with HIV/Aids."</div></blockquote>When they start interfering with the actions of secular governments/health organisations, that's why things start going wrong. Misleading the public is wrong no matter what angle you look at it.<br><br>And again, how can you selectively make sure such messages don't get to the non-believers? You can't. As a result, people in poverty with little education will shun condoms or be very confused when there's 2 different organisations telling them different things.<br><br>Imagine you're a villager with no access to tv/media in a rural area and missionaries come along to tell you all the misinformation about condoms. It would be hard to imagine how a lowly educated villager will not heed to their advice even though he/she might be a non-believer.<br><br>That is why the church should always just encourage abstinence instead of discouraging condom use. Don't leave a trail of destruction all in the name of spread their faith or practices.</div>
