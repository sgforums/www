              <p>Icemoon:</p>
              <p>You've answered yourself and those who ask why Jesus doesnt come out right and declare, "Hey world! I'm God, come get me!"</p>
              <p>If he doesnt grab the bull by the horns, im sure you'll know why. To people, this verse and others clearly indicate that He's claiming equality to God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did people worship Him in the book of John? Certainly, Icemoon! But im sure you'll say thats not evidence of His deity.</p>
              <p>Did he correct Thomas when he exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" Nope, he didnt. You know how Jews are not supposed to take the name of God in vain, so to say Thomas exclaimed that in surprise is groundless. Jesus went on to bless him.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Your statements are sweeping. And your argument is pretty much recycled. :P</p>
              <p>For example, you mentioned about Thomas invoking the name of God. But are we sure Thomas is invoking the name of God whom we know as Hashem? If you check the Greek, the words are Kyrios and Theos. None of them is a one to one mapping for Hashem!</p>
              <p>The above illustrates just one problem of Hebrew-Greek-English translation.</p>
              <p>Interesting you quoted John 9. I wonder have you checked Strongs or done your homework before quoting it?</p>
              <p>The Greek word for 'worship' in John 9 is <strong>proskuneo</strong>. Before we continue, do you want to bet your last cent that 'worship' in the NT is always proskuneo? Never mind the context even.</p>
              <p>If you are afraid to bet your last cent, smart ass. At least you aren't thinking like a simpleton!</p>
              <p>Because there is another Greek word for 'worship', called <strong>latreuo</strong>. Heh.</p>
              <p>Let me quote from Strongs:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><a href="http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=greeklexicon&amp;isindex=3000">http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=greeklexicon&amp;isindex=3000</a></strong></p>
              <p><strong>3000.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">latreuo</span> <em>lat-ryoo'-o</em> from latris (a hired menial); to minister (to God), i.e. render religious homage:--serve, do the service, worship(-per).</p>
              <p><strong><a href="http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=greeklexicon&amp;isindex=4352">http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=greeklexicon&amp;isindex=4352</a></strong></p>
              <p><strong>4352.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proskuneo</span> <em>pros-koo-neh'-o</em> from 4314 and a probable derivative of 2965 (meaning to kiss, like a dog licking his master's hand); to fawn or crouch to, i.e. (literally or figuratively) prostrate oneself in homage (do reverence to, adore):--worship.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The Lexicon listings are quite long, so I leave you to read yourself:<br><a href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=4352&amp;t=KJV&amp;page=1">http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=4352&amp;t=KJV&amp;page=1</a><br><a href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3000&amp;t=KJV">http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3000&amp;t=KJV</a><br><br>Suffice to say, when worship is used in reference to Jesus, latreuo is never used! When there is a clear reference to Hashem, latreuo is used. See the pattern?</p>
              <p>I shall not say much. Read, discern and be skeptical. :P</p>

              <p>They were both indeed perfect(sharing the image of God). Eve took the bite not out of imperfection but out of disobedient. Remember free will? So it was more like rebellion than imperfection. She thought she knew better. Sounds familiar with even today's people?</p>

              <p>They were both indeed perfect(sharing the image of God). Eve took the bite not out of imperfection but out of disobedient. Remember free will? So it was more like rebellion than imperfection. She thought she knew better. Sounds familiar with even today's people?</p>

              <p>Your statements are sweeping. And your argument is pretty much
              recycled. :P</p>
              <p>For example, you mentioned about Thomas invoking the name of
              God. But are we sure Thomas is invoking the name of God whom we
              know as Hashem? If you check the Greek, the words are Kyrios and
              Theos. None of them is a one to one mapping for Hashem!</p>
              <p>The above illustrates just one problem of Hebrew-Greek-English
              translation.</p>
              <p>Interesting you quoted John 9. I wonder have you checked Strongs
              or done your homework before quoting it?</p>
              <p>The Greek word for 'worship' in John 9 is
              <strong>proskuneo</strong>. Before we continue, do you want to bet
              your last cent that 'worship' in the NT is always proskuneo? Never
              mind the context even.</p>
              <p>If you are afraid to bet your last cent, smart ass. At least you
              aren't thinking like a simpleton!</p>
              <p>Because there is another Greek word for 'worship', called
              <strong>latreuo</strong>. Heh.</p>
              <p>Let me quote from Strongs:</p>
              <p>The Lexicon listings are quite long, so I leave you to read
              yourself:<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=4352&amp;amp;t=KJV&amp;amp;page=1">http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=4352&amp;t=KJV&amp;page=1</a><br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3000&amp;amp;t=KJV">http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3000&amp;t=KJV</a><br> <br> Suffice to say, when worship is used in reference to Jesus, latreuo
              is never used! When there is a clear reference to Hashem, latreuo
              is used. See the pattern?</p>
              <p>I shall not say much. Read, discern and be skeptical. :P</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You've not made any case.</p>
              <p>Just because latreuo is used of God and not Jesus - whats your point?</p>
              <p>How do you render "sacred service" to God? How do you want to differentiate between these 2 words which render "worship"?</p>
              <p>By
              the way, you're wrong to say worship was never used to refer to Jesus.
              In Rev 22:3, Christ is latreuo along with God, referred as a <strong>singular</strong> pronoun and on <strong>the throne</strong>. Does that give u a clearer picture of the Trinity?</p>

              <p>Proskeuno <em>and</em> latreuo.</p>
              <p>From your lexicons, there is a type of <em>proskuneo </em>that is worship reserved to God alone, and there is a type of <em>proskuneo </em>that
              can be done with men--a bowing down, a courtesy, a sign of deference
              and respect, a tipping-the-hat, so to speak. In other words, sometimes
              it's okay and sometimes it isn't. What's the difference?</p>
              <p>There is a type of <em>proskuneo </em>that cannot be mistaken for mere courtesy. In Acts 10:25 Cornelius fell at Peter's feet and <em>proskuneo </em>("worshipped") him. In Revelation 19:10 and 22:8 John fell at the angel's feet twice and <em>proskuneo </em>("worshipped") him. Both Cornelius and John were seriously reprimanded. Why?</p>
              <p>The reason they were reprimanded is that <em>proskuneo </em>is generally translated to bow down <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but if a person is already down, the addition of </span><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">proskuneo </span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">must indicate worship</span>.
              Cornelius didn't fall at Peter's feet and then bow down, he was already
              down. John didn't fall down at the angel's feet and then bow down, he
              was already down. They both fell down and worshipped. Ergo the strong
              words of correction: "Worship God, not me."</p>
              <p>Matt 4:9 again, <a href="http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=1437">if</a> thou wilt fall <a href="http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=4098">down</a> (<a href="http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/extras.cgi?number=5631">5631</a>) and <a href="http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=4352">worship</a> (<a href="http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/extras.cgi?number=5661">5661</a>) me (Satan wanted not just a polite proskeuno, but one with full worship)</p>
              <p>Matt 2:2-11, Matt 28:9 --&gt; all indicate falling on the feet before worshipping Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>And of course the other references where Jesus is <em>proskuneoed</em> to. <em>Worshipped</em>.</p>
              <p>Grant it to you that there are times when the word <em>proskuneo </em>is used of Jesus
              and other men and it doesn't refer to worship. But the context tells us (which you told me to ignore, hmm).</p>
              <p>We
              looked at the context and especially the use of the phrase "falling
              down and worshipping." It seems hard to escape the conclusion that
              Jesus is being worshipped.</p>
