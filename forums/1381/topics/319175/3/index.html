              <p>through him all things were made..etc..it appears that JC was a
                      medium between the forging power and the items being forged. just
                      like how a manufactuer makes products based on clients orders.</p>
              <p>then came a man from God,hes john.does not that part also
                      describe JC role? to witness God's right of sovereignty.(besides
                      the main quest of dying for us) and again it was stated JC came
                      from the father.</p>

              <p>hmm, it doesn't support the trinity, but it supports that Jesus is God. the trinity isn't found in the bible actually. it's just a term to explain how God is 1, but yet 3 persons.</p>
              <p>because if you agree that Jesus is God, then in our... limited understanding, we are now seeing.. 3 Gods - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And God distinctively said He is One God.</p>
              <p>I'm speaking about trinity, not triad.. i think the conflict you're feeling about 3 "gods" is this. you're thinking it in terms of the mormon's believe.</p>
              <p>don't be mistaken, the trinity doctrine, isn't the same as the triad doctine.</p>

              <p><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;amp;chapter=45&amp;amp;verse=15&amp;amp;version=31&amp;amp;context=verse">Isaiah 45:15</a></strong><br> Truly you are a <strong>God</strong> who <strong>hides</strong> <strong>himself</strong>, O <strong>God</strong> and Savior of
              Israel.</p>
              <p>I do not really know why God decided to hide Himself from
              humanity. Perhaps because God for reasons that I do not understand
              have decided to put faith into a very important part of having a
              relationship with Him. You see God could work on everyone despite
              the person being faithless. Had He wanted to let every living men
              on earth to see Him now that would not be a problem imo. And even
              when God reveals something of Himself to anyone that revelation
              would likely not to be complete so that no one has a complete
              picture of understanding of God.</p>
              <p>I know that Jesus is God because I had been given a vision of
              Jesus when I was in my 7th grade. From what I saw I know that Jesus
              is God. Of course there is no way I could show you what I saw so
              this remains a personal revelation for me.</p>
              <p>You see you cannot approach God with logic. Do you think we
              humans are a very logical being? Tell me then why have we destroyed
              our own planet? For the sake of our wealth? What's the logic of
              destroying our planet for the sake of personal gain?</p>
              <p>Do you know that most people buy things not because they need it
              but because they think they need it for whatever reason. You see
              even our spending habit doesn't reflect us as being of logic.</p>
              <p>Do you know that the very concept of hobby is illogical?</p>
              <p>You know the most logic could do is to exploit its observation
              of the law of nature. It could not answer everything on any subject
              of study. So logic is the observance of the law of nature and
              technology is the appliance of logic into machinery to exploit the
              knowledge gained from the observation derived from logic.</p>
              <p> I do not write this to belittle logic or technology but
              come on logic is not everything, actually it is everything if we
              could have perfect understanding of everything but that is not
              possible thus our logic is not everything.</p>
              <p>And I believe that if men could have perfect understanding of
              everythng then the existence of God would be very very logical
              indeed.</p>

              <p>a good guess of the month of JC's bday is on the nisan, same mth as he died. btw,the only 2 a/cs of bday celebration in the bible resulted in tragedies. one is a king who used the sacred cup or sth..den God's hand appear and vandalize his wall or sth..the 2nd a/c is nebuca-watever-u-spell-it if not wrong.</p>

              <p>that's why i don't believe immediately when ppl say they saw an apparation. it depends on the situation. like i remember i read this book, where this apparation appeared, a woman and a child, who claimed he is Jesus and gave some instructions etc.</p>
              <p>firstly, Jesus always appeared as He is, a fully grown man. suddenly a child appears and claims He's Jesus, surely will have warning bells ringing in our heads, but some people believe la. and adopted the instructions into their belief system.</p>

              resulted in tragedies. one is a king who used the sacred cup or
              sth..den God's hand appear and vandalize his wall or sth..the 2nd
              a/c is nebuca-watever-u-spell-it if not wrong.</p>
              <p>as for worshipping God, did not JC gave the know-how??</p>

              <p>honestly i wouldn't know. because i don't know Jesus's birthdate. i'll find out for you after my exam ba. =)</p>
              <p>but as for.. your fears that pagan spirits will benefit from this celebration.. on that day, we spread the truth about Jesus' coming to die for our sins, we spread the good news, i'm not seeing how... pagan spirits or pagans will beneift from it.</p>

              <p>if no one ask this question, there wouldn't be a need to answer in the ideal of the trinity. so in the end, you have to blame those who question it. =)</p>
              <p>don't use the word trinity lor, just understand that there is only 1 God, but He exists in 3 persons. as the bible suggests.</p>

              <p>Hullo,</p>
              <p>I'll try to use ur examples.</p>
              <p>According to ur scale, 1 perfect man on one end, 1 perfect man on the other. Then are all the sins of the world redeemed? Can one <em>created</em> being save another created being? If Jesus was that perfect man, <em>created</em> nonetheless, he can only redeem the sins of another man at best.</p>
              <p>THe sins of the world, is something that only something on a God-scale can do. Or someone with the fullness / nature of God. Jesus was begotten, not made. Man was made (created), as was angels, in God's image (not bestowed with His nature). In this case, the analogy of the father and son (family) playing with clay makes sense. We're that clay.</p>
              <p>Hence we (Christians) affirm they're of ONE substance / essence. 3 of 1, not 1 of 3. Pls don't fret, we're still monotheistic.</p>
              <p>DA Carson says this of the Trinity, 1 + 1 + 1 =3. But infinity + infinity + infinity = ??</p>

              <p>You wouldnt know the process of how God begets God, would you? We're mere creations, and some of these things are hidden mysteries to us, till God reveals Himself. This is something common in all faiths. We follow what He chooses to tell us through His Word.</p>
              <p>God has no beginning, Genesis starts with God already in the picture and how He began the work of creation. John starts with similar picture but except he says The Word was also there with God from the beginning. This suggests the preexistence (before the beginning of human-time) of Jesus.</p>

              on the other. Then are all the sins of the world redeemed? Can one
              <em>created</em> being save another created being? If Jesus was
              that perfect man, <em>created</em> nonetheless, he can only redeem
              the sins of another man at best.</p>
              <p>THe sins of the world, is something that only something on a
              God-scale can do. Or someone with the fullness / nature of God.
              Jesus was begotten, not made. Man was made (created), as was
              angels, in God's image (not bestowed with His nature). In this
              case, the analogy of the father and son (family) playing with clay
              makes sense. We're that clay.</p>
              <p>Hence we (Christians) affirm they're of ONE substance / essence.
              3 of 1, not 1 of 3. Pls don't fret, we're still monotheistic.</p>
              <p>DA Carson says this of the Trinity, 1 + 1 + 1 =3. But infinity +
              infinity + infinity = ??</p>

              <p>my "scale' was the point that it took 1 perfect man to bring sin into the world. to redeem that, it takes another perfect man to counter it. y else would JC being called the last adam? now since God is only one, it would normally be impossible to beget anything else. therefore,he has to create the prehuman JC. fast forward that to mary's time, God then transfered JC down to earth. thus "creating" the human JC. that JC is also charged with the authority to erase man's sin. surely when God says you can do this and that means you can do it right?</p>
              <p>as for the clay thingy, yes we are,as are all other but God.</p>
              <p>DA Carson analogy of 1+1+1=3 but 00+00+00=00 is valid.undisputed. however, infinity also meant no end or beginning. JC has a beginning not from mary but begotten from God. thus he is no longer infinite. HS wiese, heck, it doesnt even have tat much media coverage in the bible as the father and son. you tell people abt lky and lhl people know. u tell people about gct, they say goh who again? in fact HS wasnt even being refered to as a he or she, not tat it really matters, but obviously like i said b4, 1 supreme, 1 lesser and 1 xtra lor.</p>

              <p>.....do you not see that they are the sons of devil?</p>
              <p>as for your vision of God, you are not the only one i heard nor
                                  will you be the last i guess..</p>
              <p>but also refer back to the bible that
                                  since completing revelation, no mortal man  will have such
                                  visions.</p>
              <p>which is another point why so many people claim to see
                                  this and that vision..also remember that satan in order to deceive
                                  WILL and OFTEN turn himself into an angel of light. the very same
                                  light that mere mortals will regard as the LIGHT of God.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes I'm sure not the only living man who had been given the vision as God is the living God and God of the living too. I don't think the bible ever mentioned that no mortal men would be given vision of God or Jesus. Besides I know what I saw or what I experienced was not my own fantasy.</p>
              <p>Yes the devil would deceive men but get some sense and get real...the devil would not repeat would never  try to imitate God Himself. Besides God gave me a surge of  total love for Jesus  right before I was given(I asked to see the face of Jesus) the vision of Jesus. That love was real and I would never think that the devil able to give me such great love for Jesus. Don't be paranoid as to think everything miraculous that happens is from the devil.  Again it was personal so I knew what I saw and what Ifelt while other people may be suspicious because they don't know.</p>
              <p>I too once thought Jesus was lesser than the Father so I asked to see
                              Jesus face and instead got a glimpse of His glory that hurted my
                              eyeballs literally in the end as I tried too hard/forced myself to
                              penetrate the light that was coming from His face.</p>
              <p>Yes many people claim to see that vision or this vision I would not trust them so easily too unless I know what kind of person he/she is. People lie all the time so don't take people who claim that they've been given this vision or that vision easily.</p>
              <p>I too for several years have been 'allowed' sometimes though not very often to feel what other people feel literally. And sometimes but quite rare to know what would happen ahead of time. I approach these with caution as the trick of the devil is real. My take is as long as it doesn't hurt my faith and my salvation and gives me strength and add to my faith I do not see them the work of the devil. Of course this too is personal and I don't force nor I'm trying to make anyone to believe me. I'm simply telling you what it is from my own experience.</p>

              <p>the fullness of God through JC isnt even justified much less in him. however, that does not mean i belittle JC. JC no doubt is the only one who can imitate God as well as none other can due to they being the closest.</p>
              <p>as for terms describing God's nature might not be in the bible word for word, but the context do. however in terms of trinity. everything immeidately comes to a conflict and blur.</p>
              <p>as u said 1 man brough sin in and 1 man bring sin out. the point being refused here is that 1 man gave the whole world sins. so its fair to say 1 man bring all tat sins away. tat there shall be no more sins thereafter( dont really mean literally disappear but terms and conditions apply).</p>
              <p>lastly, the way u phrase it for the God willing it part, it sounds like the lame qn of can god create a stone so heavy tat he cant lift it.</p>
              <p>and he did begets the son and declared their r/s. clear as anything can be when JC was baptised by john.</p>
