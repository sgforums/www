              <p>hi all..i was discussing about religious harmony the govt worked so hard to maintain with my friend. and we kinda got stuck when we talk about islam,judaism and christianity.he's a muslim that wants to quit his religion and im still observing religions.</p>
              <p>what we found was....</p>
              <p>islamic allah is the God of abraham</p>
              <p>judaism God is the God of abraham</p>
              <p>christianity God( at least 1 of the 3) is the God of abraham.</p>
              <p>so the qn is,do they worship the same God? is it just a war of different sects like within christianity?</p>
              <p>hope to get some informative replies from here. thanks</p>

              <p> i guess it depends on which perspective ba.</p>
              <p>i definitely know the jews and christians are more linked. no idea about islam.</p>
              <p>and i agree.. it's hard for jews and christianity to get along, because of the appearance of the Christ.</p>
              <p>They are still waiting for the Christ, and they don't believe in the idea that Jesus is God too. Which is probably why they conspired to kill Him (aided by satan)</p>

              <p>ahz..Gackt has a very common view(btw gackt the jap singer dam awesome) the religious wars thingy has been around for too long.biasness that deep hard to root out.</p>
              <p>in biblical point, it was foretold since the moving out of babylon and end with God using man to destroy all false religions.</p>
              <p>in worldly view, say if u r a buddist and the govt suddenly announce they are goin to ban all religions including patriotism. what would you feel? especially if they say start with banning buddhist 1st. sub diff religions in for all your needs to feel.</p>

              <p>Hi d,</p>
              <p>what would be a reliable way of ensuring reliability? the closer the historical record is to the event rite?</p>
              <p>we accept the authencity of  many works of antiquity, for instance, we accept the authenticity of Thucydides’ historical work (460–400 b.c.) even though we have only <em>eight</em> manuscripts and a few papyrus scraps.</p>
              <p>With Thucydides, Caesar, Tacitus, Sophocles, or Euripides—we have gaps of
              hundreds or even over a thousand years from the time of writing to the
              earliest extant manuscripts. </p>
              <p>But with the NT, it has close to 5,000 manuscripts and manuscript fragments, larger than any work of antiquity. </p>
              <p>By comparison, the gap between the writing of the New Testament books
              and the earliest manuscripts of the New Testament we possess is far
              narrower.</p>
              <p>Take, for instance, the famous John Rylands papyrus fragment
              of John 18:31–33; 37–38, which dates to around a.d. 140; the manuscript
              was written only <em>fifty</em> years after John wrote his Gospel. This
              is just one of many such examples.</p>
              <p>Another evidence comes from the Dead Sea Scrolls Cave 7. Jose
              Callahan discovered a fragment of the Gospel of Mark and dated it to
              have been written in A.D. 50. He also discovered fragments of Acts and
              other epistles and dated them to have been written slightly after A.D.
              50</p>
              <p>So from a textual point of view, the
              Gospels are excellent, reliable ancient documents.</p>

              <p>do you trust the account of A person of another person, written 140 yrs after birth of Christ? not only is it not first hand  information, the original version may have been watered down or exaggerated many times over.</p>
              <p>even 50 years is also very long. many statements, memories may "change" during these 50 yrs.</p>
              <p>look at the autobiographies of Fidel Castro. he kept changing his stance in each of his autobiographies.</p>
              <p>if Christ is already divine when he's alive, wouldn't there be any records of his divinity from that brief period of time when he is alive?</p>

              <p>hang on, what i said was "the famous John Rylands papyrus fragment of
                                      John 18:31–33; 37–38, which dates to around a.d. 140".</p>
              <p>What im comparing is if people area able to take those works of antiquity as authentic, why cant they afford the same privilege to the NT documents?</p>
              <p>People copy manuscripts and pass them around. What that papyrus did was that it was identical to that portion of John - it demonstrated the acuracy of the documents in circulation.</p>
              <p>Jesus' ministry was from A.D. 27-30. New Testament scholar, F.F.
              Bruce, gives strong evidence that the New Testament was completed by
              A.D. 100.Most writings of the New Testament works were completed twenty to forty
              years before this.</p>

              <p>Hi googoomuck and domon,</p>
              <p>Jesus did claim to be GOD. In fact, he made it very obvious in</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>John 8:58, "before Abraham was born, i am".</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Using that very distinct name God reserved for Himself in Exodus 3:14 and throughout the OT, to leave no room for misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>In fact, it was so obvious that the Jews stoned him (refer to Lev 24:16), cuz that was the punishment for those guilty of blaspheming the name of God. I dont think Jews would stone him just because they thought he meant he <em>existed</em> before Abraham.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>John 10:30 "I and the Father are one." --&gt; </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This isn’t talking about unity in purpose or vision because later in v33, the Jews said they stoned him for blasphemy because he claimed to be GOD.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>John 10:33 "We are not stoning you for any of these," replied the Jews, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Ok, even if i dont' use the Gospel of John to make this point. Let's look at Mark</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Mark 2:5, "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your sins are forgiven</span>."  Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,  "Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who can forgive sins but God alone</span>?" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?  Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Very strong statement of divine authority. Everybody knows that only God can forgive sins, yet Jesus says it like it is right in front of them!</p>
              <p>Did Jesus say he was God? Certainly! He did what only God can do. Not merely simple stuff like making the Pharisees angry.</p>

              <p>To Islam, Jesus Christ is their most beloved prophet and he will come back in the last days to help mankind fight against evil. Note that even Prophet Muhammed died, but Allah, by His grace, saved Jesus from the death penalty and whisked him to heaven. So Jesus did not die technically, and he will come back again. ^^</p>
