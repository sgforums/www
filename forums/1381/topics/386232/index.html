            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi all. I am currently attending City Harvest Church. Dun flame me or this thread, or post any irrelevent post. But I have a question. Why do they speak in tougues? Can all give their view on it, best if it based on the Bible. If want to debate on the topic, please don't ask I just want to have more ideas on this practise. Espically wheter it is according to the word of the Gospel, and other churchs (regardless of it place, flamablitiy and status) do it too?</p></div>

              <p>Dark_Zero,</p>
              <p>Just curious, did you ask your pastor or church mates whether they can do pray in tongue outside church? </p>
              <p>So far I do not see such activity outside church. If there is, either it will be very disturbing or funny sight to watch.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>'Mega' Churches such as New Creation and City Harvest do have certain doctrines that do not apply to other churches in Singapore. Often, people are quoted as saying that speaking in Tongues draws u closer to God during prayer than using normal language. My church does not believing in tongues, simply because it is by God's grace that we are able to pray and talk to such a personal God, and not by our own strength. that is why it is not our right to speak in tongues. Another reason is because by speaking in Tongues, it is as if we placing God in a position where he cannot understand english, and only understands Tongues, which is obviously degrading.</div>

              <p>Dark_zero,</p>
              <p>Speaking in tongues is a characteristic of charismatic churches. It is a practice in other charismatic churches as well.</p>
              <p>Christianity has two main 'branches' right? One is Catholic and the other is Protestant (the one we always say 'Christian').</p>
              <p>For Protestant churches, there are many denominations (branches again): anglican, methodist, charismatic etc. I use 'etc' becos there're others that I also don't know.</p>
              <p>Now, from what I know of my limited experience, anglican and methodist churches don't speak in tongues, but charismatic do.</p>
              <p>The charismatic churches believe that the tongues are gifts from the Holy Spirit, also known as God. It's a form of communication with the Holy Spirit. No, no. It's not becos God doesn't understand English that we need to speak in tongues.</p>
              <p>My knowledge is not perfect. I'm just sharing with you what I know, or assume to know.</p>
              <p>Don't feel that you're dragged into it. Nobody shackles you or drag you into the church at knife- or gun-point. If you don't like it, leave the church.</p>
              <p>As a new believer, or perhaps a non-believer still, you'll have a lot of questions about the faith. I'm sure your cellgroup leader will be happy to answer your questions if you would care to ask.</p>

                          <p>Just curious, did you ask your pastor or church mates whether
                          they can do pray in tongue outside church? </p>
                          <p>So far I do not see such activity outside church. If there is,
                          either it will be very disturbing or funny sight to watch.</p>

                          <p>The only time I know when they pray in tougues outside is during
                          their quiet time, during Bible study (at riverwalk so far), during cell
                          group and during prayer meeting. It is really kinda disturbing to see
                          them speak in such way that why I ask here lor =)</p>

                      <p>‘Mega’ Churches such as New Creation and City Harvest do have certain doctrines that do not apply to other churches in Singapore. Often, people are quoted as saying that speaking in Tongues draws u closer to God during prayer than using normal language. My church does not believing in tongues, simply because it is by God’s grace that we are able to pray and talk to such a personal God, and not by our own strength. that is why it is not our right to speak in tongues. Another reason is because by speaking in Tongues, it is as if we placing God in a position where he cannot understand english, and only understands Tongues, which is obviously degrading.</p>

                  <p>Speaking in tongues is a characteristic of charismatic churches.
                  It is a practice in other charismatic churches as well.</p>
                  <p>Christianity has two main 'branches' right? One is Catholic and
                  the other is Protestant (the one we always say 'Christian').</p>
                  <p>For Protestant churches, there are many denominations (branches
                  again): anglican, methodist, charismatic etc. I use 'etc' becos
                  there're others that I also don't know.</p>
                  <p>Now, from what I know of my limited experience, anglican and
                  methodist churches don't speak in tongues, but charismatic do.</p>
                  <p>The charismatic churches believe that the tongues are gifts from
                  the Holy Spirit, also known as God. It's a form of communication
                  with the Holy Spirit. No, no. It's not becos God doesn't understand
                  English that we need to speak in tongues.</p>
                  <p>My knowledge is not perfect. I'm just sharing with you what I
                  know, or assume to know.</p>
                  <p>Don't feel that you're dragged into it. Nobody shackles you or
                  drag you into the church at knife- or gun-point. If you don't like
                  it, leave the church.</p>
                  <p>As a new believer, or perhaps a non-believer still, you'll have
                  a lot of questions about the faith. I'm sure your cellgroup leader
                  will be happy to answer your questions if you would care to
                  ask.</p>

              <p>cos mary gave birth to Jesus. symbolism that mary has given birth to god in human form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>question to ask, if god is born as a human, is he still god or a human being? if he is a human being, why is he so frail and suffer from sicknesses, tiredness, hunger like all of us do?</p>
