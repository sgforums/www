              <p>The only time I know when they pray in tougues outside is during
              their quiet time, during Bible study (at riverwalk so far), during
              cell group and during prayer meeting. It is really kinda disturbing
              to see them speak in such way that why I ask here lor =)</p>

              <p>If you have an interest in the bible, go and study it carefully. And post any question you may have. I will not interfere with your current interest now.</p>
              <p>Also check out the history/origin of the religion too to further your thoughts. Check out the book "A history of the world's religions / David S. Noss, John B. Noss." in the national library.</p>
              <p>Regarding the speak in tongue, it is worthy to think deeply why certain sect of that religion behave as such? Is it dictated by their spiritual leader ? Man made ? Why don't they do it publicly ? Why don't they just pray silently to appear saner ? So many questions to ask.</p>

              <p>Well to answer the question of speaking in tounges is simply opening a communication channel with you and the Lord himself. And while doing so, this language is a language that only you and the Lord can understand. Off course, this is not something that we have in us, it is a gift given by the Lord. <strong>Do not attempt it unless you are allowed to do so for what you deem as "tounges" might be the words of the devil.</strong></p>
              <p>Reading Acts 2:1-12 would help you understand this gift that God have given you more.</p>

              <p>Catholicism is bad. It seems to be a blasphemy against God.
              Everytime you enter a catholic church, all you hear is ''Mary Mary
              Mary Mary''. Where does God stand in catholicism? In the toilet as
              a toiler cleaner or a non-existent person? -_-</p>

Can all give their view on it, best if it based on the Bible. If want to debate on the topic, please don't ask I just want to have more ideas on this practise. Espically wheter it is according to the word of the Gospel, and other churchs (regardless of it place, flamablitiy and status) do it too?</p>

              <p>Lets put it tis way. A person can fake speaking in tongue. Anybody can fake it. If u put in effort, nobody can tell it is true or not. And nobody can understand it.If u do not speak, people around u think u r not blessed enough, not have enough faith, do not have a strong belief.</p>
