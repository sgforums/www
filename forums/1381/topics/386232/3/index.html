              <p>I know many Anglicans, including Rev. Dr. Canon James Wong who speak in tongues (I'm quite sure he doesn't mind me quoting him). You can evidently see this at FOP, an annual event for Singapore Christians.</p>
              <p>A former Methodist bishop I know, speak in tongues too.</p>
              <p>Its not true that only 'megachurches' speak in tongues. More than half of Christians today speak in tongues, all over the world.</p>
              <p>There're many misconceptions about speaking in tongues. Speaking in tongues is the allowing the Holy Spirit to pray through you. You can start/stop at your own will, but it is allowing the Holy Spirit to use your mouth to pray through and for you.</p>

              <p>Lets say praying in tongues is a miracle, what purpose does it serve? It is not as if god only speaks one language. If it was to draw more to christianity, god should have done something more obvious. At some hindu festivals people walk on fire without getting burnt, proof of their god? Others claim to know a place very well, with proof, though they have never been there before, proof of reincarnation? My point is that if one accepts such religious stories wholesale, then one must explain the "miracles" that happen with people not of the faith. Either that, or the mind is more powerful than we think it to be</p>

              <p>Its better to get into the debating mood rather than to pull out assertions into the open. As we feel frustrated with the claims of christianity, to us baseless, they too would feel the same. Then everyone gets into defensive mode. Ultimately people would see which side is more logical and reasonable, and follow what they think.</p>

              <p>Not every church practises tongue.   Speaking in tongue is a gift from God.    It is different from praying in tongue</p>

              <p>Hi TS,maybe, U would want to check back with the leadership in your church. cause I do believe you will have many more questions in your walk, and it is better if U seek the right avenues.</p>
              <p>A religion/belief is something personal. You, yourself, will know whether it is right fit.</p>
              <p>just my two cents.</p>
