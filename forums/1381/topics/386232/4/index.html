              <p>Speaking in tongues can possibly be viewed from a psychological perspective. Perhaps the person has heard before, even once only, about the words spoken. Realised in the subconcious, it appears that the person is speaking in tongues. Such a system may also be used to show the improbabilty of rebirth when someone claims to know a place they have never been before</p>

              <p>Hi all. I am currently attending City Harvest Church. Dun flame
              me or this thread, or post any irrelevent post. But I have a
              question. Why do they speak in tougues? Can all give their view on
              it, best if it based on the Bible. If want to debate on the topic,
              please don't ask I just want to have more ideas on this practise.
              Espically wheter it is according to the word of the Gospel, and
              other churchs (regardless of it place, flamablitiy and status) do
              it too?</p>

              Malachi (christian, correct me if the spelling is
              wrong).   Personally, to me 10% is a lot.   In
              the past, when I was a christian I gave 10% for  a couple of
              times and thereafter did not find that I could afford this much to
              give.   </p>
