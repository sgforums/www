The ten commandments was not given without a reason contrary to the twist given by Ps Prince. But we cannot be too legalistic &amp; forget the true purpose of following the ten commandments which is to love God &amp; to love our neighbours. Would u want to kill your neighbour if u love him?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">No, the situation is this.<br><br>It is very hard to change people's misconception about grace because, as you know, NCC is famous for "cheap grace". The kind of message being preached inside more or less give people the impresson grace is cheap. Even Christians from other churches have this impression.<br><br>Also by saying grace is not cheap because it comes at the price of Jesus is shifting the goalpost somehow, because you're changing the focus now to God.<br><br>By the way, if grace is free for everyone, then there is this connotation that it is cheap. Use your common sense. (free == low/no price == cheap)</div></blockquote>I thot Ps Prince preached we focus on God not on ourselves. How can we focus on ourselves? We are told to remember what Jesus has done for us not what we can do by ourselves. So grace isnt cheap after all. It's ppl who abuse it &amp; treat it as cheap. It's cheap on their parts but expensive on Christ's part. That doesnt negate grace which is not cheap. It costs the dear Saviour's life!<br><br>If grace is not free, then it's not grace anymore but wages of works! Then we earn our way into heaven! Free = no price but not = cheap!</div>
