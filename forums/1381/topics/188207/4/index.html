            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fallin:</div><div class="quote_body">This again is related to the question of the balance between works and faith. How on earth does a Christian escape the 2 traps of cheap grace and legalism. Cheap grace is obviously worshipping a false God while legalism really sucks the joy out of being a believer. </div></blockquote>Your question is about license and legalism. Cheap grace is the wrong view and use of grace. Legalism is the wrong view and use of the Law. Both are extremes denounced in the Word of God.<br><br>About cheap grace:<br><br>Paul answered that question in Romans 6:1-23.<br><br>About legalism:<br><br>He answered that mostly in Galatians.  There we see of two kinds of legalism:<br><br>a)	Legalism with regards to justification  and  b) legalism with regards to sanctification. The former says: Â“We are justified by faith plus worksÂ”, the latter says: Â“we will be sanctified and will be made perfect [mature] by the LawÂ”.<br><br>The right balance<br><br>We who have trusted in Christ alone for salvation are not under the law. We are under grace. But being under grace does not mean that we are lawless [antinomianism, cheap grace]. No. We are married to a higher Â‘lawÂ’: Christ. He is our all our justification, our sanctification and our glorification.<br><br>We are justified by faith in Christ alone. We are progressively sanctified through growing in GRACE and knowledge of Christ [through the Word as made effective by the Holy Spirit. We are glorified positionally and we will be glorified bodily in death or during the Rapture because of Christ resurrection from the dead.<br><br>1Co 1:30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God--and righteousness and sanctification and redemption--<br><br>Note: it doesnÂ’t also mean that since we are not under the law, that the Law has no more use to us Christians. No. the Law still has itÂ’s ministry today. God designed it for a special purpose and function. [we will not be discussing this right now for this is a very long topic].<br><br>We are free IN Christ. We are free to do anything that are in the sphere of Christ. Free to do anything Christ-like. Cheap grace and legalism throws you off Christ. To maintain the right balance, you must focus on Christ. Be preoccupied with Him.<br><br>How to be preoccupied?<br><br>1) You must keep on knowing that you [the old man] enslaved by sin died with Christ and therefore sin shall not have dominion over you.<br><br>2) You must keep reckoning this truth.<br><br>3) You must act on this truth always.<br><br>Be engrossed with these truths. Be preoccupied with Christ.<br><br>As you do this the Holy Spirit in unison with you knowing, reckoning and yielding will enable and empower you to have dominion over sin. As a result the requirements of the law are fulfilled IN you.<br><br>Read these verses and take note of verse 4.<br><br>Ro 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.<br><br>2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.<br><br>3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh,<br><br>4 that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IN</strong></span> us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.<br><br>P.S. i am willing to help you fallin with your questions. But i will be out for about two to three weeks. if you want you can e-mail me. I will be giving you my e-mail add through PM.<br><br></div>

So you see, people like me will look at what Jesus means by everlasting life; what does believing in Jesus means...<br><br>Because Christians are sold the idea that Jesus is GOD; a lot of what Jesus says then becomes nonsense or interpreted in error.<br><br>I have no such problems. I try to see what as a man Jesus meant when he said those things. I do not come with baggage. If you like, we can look at specific points.<br><br>You see when I try to counsel gamblers, I sometimes have to recommend them to a religion and I am like, what religion do you practise? How can I do my job if i have no idea what the religions are preaching? So I empathise rather than sympathise with Christianity and Buddhism and Hinduism.<br><br>I attend Buddhist ceremonies, Hindu worship service; Christian Mass... Holy Communion (some churches tell you you cannot) but Rock Auditorium seems not to have any problems with it. I go to forums and discuss religion with people.

I try to see what as a man Jesus meant when he said those things. I do not come with baggage. If you like, we can look at specific points.<br><br>You see when I try to counsel gamblers, I sometimes have to recommend them to a religion and I am like, what religion do you practise? How can I do my job if i have no idea what the religions are preaching? So I empathise rather than sympathise with Christianity and Buddhism and Hinduism.<br><br>I attend Buddhist ceremonies, Hindu worship service; Christian Mass... Holy Communion (some churches tell you you cannot) but Rock Auditorium seems not to have any problems with it. I go to forums and discuss religion with people. So hey I know quite a bit about Christianity and I certainly have a different perspective from the "believers."</div></blockquote>May I ask which religion is most effective? Have u done a statistical study into this? How many Christians have u counselled already? Very interesting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
