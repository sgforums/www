              <p>the orthodox jews are very strict. For gentiles they need to
              take a few years to read the torah be be taught carefully, verse
              for verse before converting to jews. Becaus they are serious about
              life.</p>
              <p>Singapore rabbi abigal mordecai dont do conversions. You can
              speculate about this ruling but in the US you can look for a rabbi
              to convert.</p>
              <p>after conversion you know and must follow all the mitzvots
              (laws) pertaining to you. There are a total of 613 laws, not all is
              pertaining to an individual. some are for women, some for priest,

              <p>Even if you work past 5pm friday, you still have the whole of saturday to keep Shabbat at the very least.

              <p>Be very careful about what you say of Rabbai Abegel, if you are goy and if you seek in earnest, he is one of the most open Rabbais that has passed through Sg in a long time. He will most certainly sit down and have a discussion with you. It is very misunderstood that Jews do not welcome goyim who are seeking for the truth. If all your intention is to attack the Jewish faith, then of course Rabbai Abergel will not waste his time.</p>
              <p>All I am saying is you had better have hard proof about things you say about Rabbai Abegel because he is so not like what you have made him out to be. When you name names in a forum especially since you claim to be believing in the faith, you don't need to be saying things about people which you cannot prove, the Jewish people have been oppressed enough and they don't need people like you to add to that oppression by giving people a false idea of who they really are.</p>

              <p>All I am saying is you had better have hard proof about things
              you say about Rabbai Abegel because he is so not like what you have
              made him out to be. When you name names in a forum especially since
              you claim to be believing in the faith, you don't need to be saying
              things about people which you cannot prove, the Jewish people have
              been oppressed enough and they don't need people like you to add to
              that oppression by giving people a false idea of who they really
              are.</p>

              <p>I approached him 3 times. He ask me to email him once. then he didnt follow up. I called him the second time, he said busy, prepareing for one of the festivals, the yom kippur I think a few years ago. I went down to the synagouge and was told by the security guard not to enter and ask for the rabbis appointment. The last time I spoke to him on the phone, he asked me if I know the hebrew language I said no, he said he's shorthanded and busy at the moment. I cant rememeber what was the ending message but its definitely him not able to meet up with me. All the time in a respectful and calm manner I spoke.</p>

              <p>if you really want it, you have to push in and let him know that you are sincere... remember that he is only one rabbai in Singapore... make sure you don't call him during any of the feasts... and if you call him now he would be busy preparing for Hannukkah. Being busy and not welcoming you are two totally seprate things...everyone knows that the Synagogue in Singapore is not open to the public...</p>
              <p>Well you know my id name and you know I believe in the G_d of Avraham, Yitzak and Yakov. So that is my introduction and my belief already right?</p>

              <p>The orthodox jews dont take kindly to Jews who believe in Jesus. This is not me, but the website stances. As a goy or noahide, I am perplexed myself the complexity of WHY?</p>
              <p>Numbers 15:15 brings up the issues of the destruction of the temple hence, the offering issue. blood sacrifice is not essentially required as brought out in the website quoting Hashem is instances requiring that we repent and pray. strangers sojourned and having one law with the israelites that were given the land. Laws ERRORED (not taught?) vs Laws Intentionally broken.</p>
              <p>Comparing those jews who actually experience god himself and actually given land and yet still despise Him! I cannot fathom. And to day the goyim is being microscoped.</p>

              <p>First, as you do not wish to mention if you are a jew by birth I
              would assume you are not one. </p>
              <p>The orthodox jews dont take kindly to Jews who believe in Jesus.
              This is not me, but the website stances. As a goy or noahide, I am
              perplexed myself the complexity of WHY?</p>
              <p>Numbers 15:15 brings up the issues of the destruction of the
              temple hence, the offering issue. blood sacrifice is not
              essentially required as brought out in the website quoting Hashem
              is instances requiring that we repent and pray. strangers sojourned
              and having one law with the israelites that were given the land.
              Laws ERRORED (not taught?) vs Laws Intentionally broken.</p>
              <p>Comparing those jews who actually experience god himself and
              actually given land and yet still despise Him! I cannot fathom. And
              to day the goyim is being microscoped.</p>

              <p>B'midbar 15:15 states that there shall be one Torah for both the goy and the Israelite. So whether we are goy or a child of Yisrael, we still have to follow Torah. You make too many assumptions.</p>
              <p>I do not believe in jesus, I believe in Yeshua. There is a difference.</p>

              <p>wait a minute, I told the truth, what have I said that you
              consider me the slightest slandering?</p>
              <p>I approached him 3 times. He ask me to email him once. then he
              didnt follow up. I called him the second time, he said busy,
              prepareing for one of the festivals, the yom kippur I think a few
              years ago. I went down to the synagouge and was told by the
              security guard not to enter and ask for the rabbis appointment. The
              last time I spoke to him on the phone, he asked me if I know the
              hebrew language I said no, he said he's shorthanded and busy at the
              moment. I cant rememeber what was the ending message but its
              definitely him not able to meet up with me. All the time in a
              respectful and calm manner I spoke.</p>
