              <p>I find it odd that the Bible's authencity is questioned when it has existed since the 4th century (eg Codex Vaticanus is one of the oldest copies of the Bible in existence today) and it has been widely accepted and used by academic scholars and the public alike for more than a millenia.</p>
              <p>Anyway, here's an interesting article that shows the evidence for the Bible, ancient as well as present day -  <a href="http://www.catholic.com/magazine/articles/are-the-gospels-myth">http://www.catholic.com/magazine/articles/are-the-gospels-myth</a>. I've taken the liberty of putting some extracts below for easy reading.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">First, there is the sheer number of ancient copies of the New Testament. There are close to 5,700 full or partial Greek New Testament manuscripts in existence. Most of these date from between the second to 16th century, with the oldest, known as Papyrus 52 (which contains John 18), dating from around A.D. 100–150...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">In addition to the thousands of Greek manuscripts, there are an additional 10,000 Latin manuscripts, and thousands of additional manuscripts in Syriac, Aramaic, and Coptic, for a total of about 24,000 full or partial manuscripts of the New Testament. And then there are the estimated one million quotes from the New Testament in the writings of the Church Fathers (A.D. 150–1300)...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Anyone who denies that Jesus existed or who claims that the Gospels are filled with historical errors or fabrications will, in good conscience, have to explain why they don’t make the same assessment about the historical works of Pliny the Younger, Suetonius, Julius Caesar, Livy, Josephus, Tacitus, and other classical authors...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Secondly, historical details are found in the Gospels and the other books of the New Testament. These include numerous mentions of secular rulers and leaders (Caesar Augustus, Pontius Pilate, Herod, Felix, Archelaus, Agrippa, Gallio), as well as Jewish leaders (Caiaphas, Ananias)—the sort of names unlikely to be used inaccurately or even to show up in a "myth."...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Then there are the specifically Jewish details, including references to and descriptions of festivals, religious traditions, farming and fishing equipment, buildings, trades, social structures, and religious hierarchies. As numerous books and articles have shown in recent decades, the beliefs and ideas found in the Gospels accurately reflect a first-century Jewish context...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Various modern archeological discoveries have validated specific details found in the Gospels:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #000080;">In 1961 a mosaic from the third century was found in Caesarea Maritima that had the name "Nazareth" in it. This is the first known ancient non-biblical reference to Nazareth. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000080;">Coins with the names of the Herod family have been discovered, including the names of Herod the king, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee (who killed John the Baptist), Herod Agrippa I (who killed James Zebedee), and Herod Agrippa II (before whom Paul testified). </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000080;">In 1990 an ossuary was found inscribed with the Aramaic words, "Joseph son of Caiaphas," believed to be a reference to the high priest Caiaphas. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000080;">In 1968 an ossuary was discovered near Jerusalem bearing the bones of a man who had been executed by crucifixion in the first century. These are the only known remains of a man crucified in Roman Palestine, and verify the descriptions given in the Gospels of Jesus’ Crucifixion. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000080;">In June 1961 Italian archaeologists excavating an ancient Roman amphitheatre near Caesarea-on-the-Sea (Maritima) uncovered a limestone block. On its face is an inscription (part of a larger dedication to Tiberius Caesar) that reads: "Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judaea." </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Third, there are extra-biblical, ancient references to Jesus and early Christianity. Although the number of non-Christian Roman writings from the first half of the first century is quite small (just a few volumes), there are a couple of significant references:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Writing to the Emperor Trajan around A.D. 112, Pliny the Younger reported on the trials of certain Christians arrested by the Romans. He noted that those who are "really Christians" would never curse Christ.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">The historian Tacitus, in his <em>Annals</em> —considered by historians to be one the finest works of ancient Roman history—mentioned how the Emperor Nero, following the fire in Rome in A.D. 64, persecuted Christians in order to draw attention away from himself. The passage is noteworthy as an unfriendly source because although Tacitus thought Nero was appalling, he also despised the foreign and, to him, superstitious religion of Christianity.</span></p>

              <p>And speaking of science, the evidence affirms the authencity of the Bible <strong>as a whole.</strong> I'm not sure there are credible scientists or historians who say, "Yes, this document is authentic, but hey, this part sounds a little crazy, so let's exclude it." And by the way, the crazy or 'magic stuff' as you put it, is your own arbitary standard.   </p>
              <p>I'm sorry, but science and historical research doesn't quite work this way.</p>

              <p>Since the wealth of evidence shows the Bible to be an authentic document, then we can infer that the many writers of the Bible believed in what they were writing and more importantly, <strong>who</strong> they were writing for. And I think that is enough for Christians, especially when the Bible relates the actual occurence of Jesus Christ walking on this very Earth 2000 years ago, a fact that is also affirmed by archaeological evidence and extra-biblical sources.</p>

              my line of reasoning...</p>
