              <p><br>bible is special to christians as much as quran is special to muslims, scriptures is special to buddhist. They all have their own supernatural claims. How could it be that only the bible which is "special" can have its own supernatural claims been true whether others aren't. Its the same as how can their god be the only true god but others arent.</p>

              <p>To repeat what I said on 17 May 2012 (let's try underlining the
              bold words, maybe that will make a difference):</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even if the historical and
              archaeological evidence says otherwise? Sorry, I thought we are
              supposed to be scientific :)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And speaking of science, the
              evidence affirms the authencity of the
              Bible <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">as a
              whole.</span></strong> I'm not sure there are
              credible scientists or historians who say, "Yes, this document
              is authentic, but hey, this part sounds a little crazy,
              so let's exclude it." And by the way, the crazy or 'magic stuff' as
              you put it, is your own arbitary
              standard.   </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'm sorry, but science and
              historical research doesn't quite work this way.</span></p>
              <p>You can either choose to make progress in this discussion, or
              waste everyone's time. Your choice.</p>
