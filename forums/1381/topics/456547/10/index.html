              <p>What is general fact source proving? I don't understand this phrase. Anyway it doesn't sound important so nevermind.</p>
              <p>Disregarding your typo, claiming that pro-evolution websites are more convincing is a subjective claim. You are entitled to that opinion which I certainly disagree with. In any case, the evidence can be interpreted in either a pro-evolution or pro-creation way. However, I would argue that interpreting the evidence in a pro-creation way makes better sense of the evidence compared to evolution.</p>

              <p>Your view on Augustine is overly simplistic. See <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/arj/v4/n1/examining-augustine-genesis-commentaries">http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/arj/v4/n1/examining-augustine-genesis-commentaries</a> and  <a href="http://creation.com/augustine-young-earth-creationist">http://creation.com/augustine-young-earth-creationist</a></p>
              <p>All you see is "exegrete" is because that's all you know. Duh...</p>
              <p>So how is a man made 24 hours day DIFFERENT from the literal day in Genesis 1? </p>
              <p>So you say those pro-evoution arguments (that would argue for cosmic, chemical, and biological evolution) were solid, and evolution does not conflict with God's creation, and yet you deny being an evolutionist? You must be one confused bloke!</p>
              <p>BTW, how has evolution been observed?</p>

              <p>Go through all my postings where I have links inserted and see for yourself whether I ONLY get evidences from creation.com.</p>
              <p>BTW, even if I do, what's the problem? Creation.com is staffed by numerous scientists and Christians and also host many articles written by other believers who are not employees. It is not as if Creation.com is a one-man-organisation. Beware the genetic fallacy.</p>
              <p>I would NOT expect a non-Christian to hold to a young earth view in today's world. But prior to Darwin, that would have been pretty much how it was, at least in the Western world.</p>

              <p>Ask him how old the earth is. Saying "I don't know" is a

              or it is 4.5 billion years as currently believed. If there is a
              middle age view held, then he had better be giving some evidence

              <p>Did I even say anything about Augustine being infallible? Irrelevant point again. Don't you find it embarrassing that I have to keep pointed out your irrelevant things you bring up?</p>
              <p>Evidence I have provided. Question is, have you?</p>
              <p>Still playing evasive. Just tell us how long a day is in Genesis 1, in clear language. Assume for the sake of argument that I am wrong lah. You say you believe in six days creation. You claim that each day is a literal day. So tell me how long each day is. Simple as that, why must weasel about here and there?</p>
              <p>Laughing and scoffing only tells me what kind of person you are, not a refutation of my views. Your ignorance that evolution is applied to other areas is not my problem. You seem confused because you really are, and you don't even know it. That's how confused you are.</p>
              <p>How does evolution (which you reject) not conflict with God's evolution? BTW, it would be helpful (to me, probably not to you) if you can tell me what you mean by evolution, in clear unambiguous language please.</p>

              <p>Why would that be a false dichotomy? Demonstrate the fallacy, if you can.</p>
              <p>As expected, a cop out answer. Don't claim anything. Say you believe in Biblical creation, but refuse to say what that entails. So no need to defend anything. Cop out is cop out. Lame is lame. Can't even say (lack intellectual honesty and integrity?) which group you are in, YEC or OEC. If you can make the case for an MEC, maybe you still can fault me for false dichotomy. But I don't think I will be holding my breath for this.</p>

              <p>LOL, now you distance yourself from Augustine after you realised that he isn't going to be of much use to you.</p>
              <p>How does your point stand when you refused to make any stand? So to who does Rev refer to? What is the significance of the phrase "the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ancient serpent</strong></span>, who is the devil and satan" (NET Bible)?</p>
              <p>Go google on cosmic evolution and chemical evolution. It's only good this way. I am having the last laugh.</p>
              <p>I know an evening and a morning means a day. I take it to mean 24 hours. You say I am wrong. Fine, ignore what I say and just assume I am wrong. So what do YOU say? How long is a day? Man-made or not, just tell us how long it is in terms of hours, or any time measurement you prefer since you so scared to commit. Duh.</p>
              <p>I see a red herring. Asking me to find out what the ToE is about is not the same as you telling me what you believe about it and why it does not conflict with the Bible.</p>
