              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Doesn't it ever occur to you that to speak of evil "coming from" sin is incorrect? Consider how 1 Kings 16:19 puts it thus, "because of the sin he committed by doing what was evil in the </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">’s sight and by following the example of Jeroboam and the sin he caused Israel to commit.""</span></p>
              <p>Has it occured to you that I was paraphrasing you to get a clearer picture? Trying to get a definition of evil here... You are saying there can be no "evil" when there is no sin and "evil" is when sin is.What is the distinct feature of "evil" from sin?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I already defined good, you failed to read. God IS good. To know God is to know Good. Does God's goodness depend on Satan? Yes or No?"</span></p>
              <p>No you did not...  Food is good. To know food is to know good. Does food's goodness depend on rubbish? Yes or no, do you see the meaninglessness of your attempted definition? What you did was just saying "good" is an attribute of God.... Just as "good" is an attribute to God's creation.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">God's omniscience and omnipotence is clearly taught in Scripture, what do you really want to defend anyway? Every attack on God's attributes will fail inevitably. The existence of evil does not call into question God's omnipotence and omniscience. "</span></p>
              <p>My God is all powerful, all knowing and benevolent, this is the objective truth. Anything against such, is evil. Any believer of the 1st commandment of love would act, respond or react to repel any effort to desecrate. Even after God had judge, "evil" still is. Does your God allow "evil"?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Why does evil exist is not to be answered by impugning the attributes of God, certainly not for the Christian who wants to give a Biblical answer."</span></p>
              <p>In case you did not notice... the question is not why does "evil" exist but why God. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">.... I think you are much better at it than me."</span></p>
              <p>Thank you. I hear only the good stuff.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"Anyway, where did you get your idea that Jesus have to die for our sins? The Bible? The Scriptures? Which one? Duh...."</span></p>
              <p>Are you insinuating that Jesus (the Saviour) don't have to die for our sins? Just correct me if I'm wrong. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">To know what is good you look at God, not the devil."</span></p>
              <p>Who had ever looked at God and lived. I look at His creations and its "good". Why did you invoke the devil?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">To know the Truth you look at Jesus, not Satan. So what is this nonsense about referencing good to evil? "</span></p>
              <p>1st you referenced God to devil in a sentence then you referenced Jesus to Satan in a sentence and call referencing "good" to "evil" nonsensical... I hope you see some form of conflict or irony there. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Well, you did write, "This sense of guilt I believe is the sin, contrary to conventionally believed." So why would it be a misinterpretation on my part?"</span></p>
              <p>Oh I did, my bad. Apologies. Edited</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"Adam rejected the truth in a way since God's instruction is also truth."</p>

              <p>Your argument just discounted Anti-matter. Anti-matter has a mass. It's an "inverse charge", the same as velocity - it has a (+) and a (-) . Stationary-ness is the "nothing". It exists as "nothing" - the absence of any change of position over a period of time.</p>
              <p>The opposite of magnetism is the inverse charge of whatever charge the magnet is imposing. The absence of magnetism is the blank state. Nothing, nada, zilch.</p>
              <p>So is light. It is a form of electromagnetism - it has a (+) and a (-) and moves in oscillations in a form of what we call a "wave". Even if you inverse that wave to cancel it, it still exists; it will still show up as light, because the electromagnetic wave is still there. The absense of light is the blank state. Nothing, nada, zilch.</p>
              <p>Gosh! Scientific discussions are annoying. Maybe I'll stick to the Bible.</p>

              That no one is there is the atheist explanation. That God says "no" or "wait" is the Christian's explanation. And within the the Christian worldview this is perfectly coherent and consistent with what we know about God.
              
              <p>For the atheist he has to look at every answered prayer and cavalierly dismiss it as mere coincidence even though such a dimissive explanation is ridiculously absurd.

              when sin is.What is the distinct feature of "evil" from sin?</p>

              defined good, you failed to read. God IS good. To know God is to

              No?"</span></p>
              <p>No you did not...  Food is good. To know food is to know
              good. Does food's goodness depend on rubbish? Yes or no, do you see
              the meaninglessness of your attempted definition? What you did was
              just saying "good" is an attribute of God.... Just as "good" is an

              you really want to defend anyway? Every attack on God's attributes
              will fail inevitably. The existence of evil does not call into

              the 1st commandment of love would act, respond or react to repel
              any effort to desecrate. Even after God had judge, "evil" still is.

              <p>Your food analogy fails. Food can be bad or good. But God IS good.</p>

              <p>In case you haven't noticed, the issue the atheist raised is that the existence of evil is proof of the non-existence of God, of the Bible to be precise.</p>
              <p>I am not insinuating anything about the death of Christ, I am asking you where you get your ideas from. Which Bible? Has it ever occurred to you that this is a little bit of giving you a taste of your own medicine?</p>
              <p>I invoked the devil? Has it ever occurred to you that I was only extending your argument about referencing the good to the evil? But since you apparently take issue with this, then you should realise for yourself why it is wrong to talk about referencing the good to the evil, or that one can only know good with reference to evil. You have put the cart before the horse, the egg before the chicken.</p>

              <p>I am not insinuating anything about the death of Christ, I am
                  asking you where you get your ideas from. Which Bible? Has it ever
                  occurred to you that this is a little bit of giving you a taste of
                  your own medicine?</p>
              <p>I invoked the devil? Has it ever occurred to you that I was only
                  extending your argument about referencing the good to the evil? But
                  since you apparently take issue with this, then you should realise
                  for yourself why it is wrong to talk about referencing the good to
                  the evil, or that one can only know good with reference to evil.

              <p>You mean there is no such thing as objectively good and
              objectively evil? So you don't believe in the existence of
              objective moral values? The Bible speaks of good and evil, all
              subjective and appeal to emotions?</p>
              <p>Sin was first conceived in the devil himself. In his pride he
              led a rebellion against God.</p>
              <p>Which part of my description is meaningless? Why?</p>
              <p>I disagree that evil is inevitable. Anyway, the fact remains
              that <span style="color: #333333;">times that the existence of evil
              is taken as an argument against the existence of God, especially
              that of the God of the Bible. How do you deal with this? Just say
              it is a fruitless debate to the atheist?</span></p>
