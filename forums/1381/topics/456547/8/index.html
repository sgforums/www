              <p>So you believe that the serpent just happened to be a creature that talked to Eve? And that other Biblical references have absolutely NOTHING to say about this serpent?</p>
              <p>I already told you that the serpent was a real serpent, but that it was no mere serpent. It was also literally the devil in the form of the serpent, or possessing the serpent, just like how the demons could enter into the pigs.

              <p>Do you believe the Bible or do you depend on what historians can prove before you can trust the Bible? Do you assume the Bible to be false until proven true?

              <p>I don't care if you do not believe in time as we know it, you have to live by it and you even order your life around it. You can say you don't believe in gravity or air but you live on it whether you acknowledge it or not. So in this instance you choose not to believe in human concepts but when it comes to Biblical chronology you believe in what historians say about lack of solid evidence and thus have to abandon Biblical chronology regarding Abraham?</p>
              <p>Now, since you agree that the days in Genesis 1 are normal ordinary days, why then do you not agree that it is a young earth? Because that is the only logical conclusion.

Do you assume the Bible to be false until proven true? Because it seems so to me that this is your approach. If so, it is flawed. Godly historians and scholars have worked hard on this and have laid out the chronologies and genealogies from the Biblical data, regardless of whether every bit is supported by secular evidence. A fine example is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ntslibrary.com/.../Jones%20-%20Chronology%20of%20the%20OT.pdf">Chronology of the OT</a>."</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"I don't care if you do not believe in time as we know it, you have to live by it and you even order your life around it. You can say you don't believe in gravity or air but you live on it whether you acknowledge it or not. So in this instance you choose not to believe in human concepts but when it comes to Biblical chronology you believe in what historians say about lack of solid evidence and thus have to abandon Biblical chronology regarding Abraham?"</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Time is really a human concept, unlike gravity, air, etc which can be felt and measured. Time can only be recorded. Without a set reference, it is meaningless. There is a time for everything. When its time to be revealed, it will.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"Now, since you agree that the days in Genesis 1 are normal ordinary days, why then do you not agree that it is a young earth?

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Normal ordinary days as in literally "evening and morning makes a day". Young or old relative to what? Each other?</p>

I suspect that the sun is 4.5 billion years old. However, given some new and unexpected results to the contrary, and some time for frantic recalculation and theoretical readjustment, I suspect that we could live with Bishop Ussher’s value for the age of the earth and sun. I don’t think we have much in the way of observational evidence in astronomy to conflict with that.”</em> (Dr. John A.

              <p>Regardless of what you think about how humans make sense of time or delineate time, the fact remains that we all live by the same measurement of time. Yes, time CAN be measured. The set reference would be the sun and the moon which are for signs and seasons. Not reading your Bible eh, even the first chapter of the first book? And if you insist it is meaningless, so be it, but you still check your watch or be on time for your appointments. So what's the fuss about?</p>
              <p>Playing daft still huh? Since we know that Biblical genealogy means that Adam to Abraham was about 2000 years, and that Adam was created on Day 6 which is an ordinary day with an evening and a morning, then you only need to add another 5 days to that period to mark the beginning of creation week. Still cannot conclude that it must be a young earth RELATIVE to 4.5 billion years according to evolution? In fact, 6000 years is considered old already!</p>

              <p>Your listing of ad hominem reasons to believe that the serpent in Genesis 3 was the devil is fit to be only brushed aside.</p>
              <p>And talking about the Masoretic text is really digressing. The fact of the matter is that Abraham was believed to have lived about 1900s BC, BC means Before Christ, not Bagels and Cookies.</p>
              <p>Still playing daft about measuring time and day? Even if you live in the polar regions where you see the sun mos tof the time, you would still know the meaning of what a day is and how long it is.  The amount of sunlight one receives each day is no doubt dependent on where one resides on earth, but that in no way negate the notion of a 24 hour day. You have confused daylight with duration of a day. Yes, it is God's POV what a day is, and it is the same POV as man's. If God wanted to tell us a day means a day, this would be the way to say it.</p>
              <p>Being a YEC does not mean having all the answers to your questions answered. You also cannot answer questions I raised, so? The point is whether the Bible teaches a young earth (which it does) and not whether YEC can answer all your questions. Such a simple point you also cannot grasp. *face/palm*</p>
              <p>You are guilty of quoting Matt 11 completely out of context and which is IRRELEVANT to the issue with regards to Genesis. God has NOT hidden from us the information concerning HOW long He took to create the heavens and the earth and all that is in them. He has told us how long He took, you simply refuse to believe what God said.</p>

              <p>I know what the Masoretic text is, but again this is completely IRRELEVANT to the issue about how long the time period between Abraham to Jesus. As mentioned more than once, Abraham lived about 2000 BC. From Adam to Abraham is also about 2000 years. So how old is the earth? Do your math and stop throwing red herrings.</p>
              <p>And I am telling you that to harp about time being a human concept is a red herring. That's not even the issue.  So what if 24hrs is a human concept? Does that change the argument or invalidate my point? Not at all. The issue is that the Bible defined the each day of creation as bounded by an evening and a morning with an ordinal number, and this always means an ordinary day as we know it. And how have I been deceived by the idea of a 24 hr day?</p>
              <p>Yes, I will continue to point out your misuse and misquoting of Scripture, and your misquoting of Augustine. How does that Augustine quote invalidate or refute the young earth view?  See http://creation.com/augustine-young-earth-creationist</p>
