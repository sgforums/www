              <p>Answer is very simple and clear, God's Word was revealed in history through the writings of men who lived thousands of years ago at different times in different places under different circumstances in different languages in different cultures, so much so that we today who read these writings are so far removed in time that we would need to understand the different times in different places under different circumstances in different languages in different cultures in order to correctly interpret the Bible. This is the same for ALL documents of antiquity, not just the Bible.</p>
              <p>Not only that, each person that comes to the Bible have different knowledge base. You may need a lot of explanation but someone else more diligent to find out more about historical contexts and word meanings may not need as much explanation.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: God's Word is written to us and meant to be understood. Much of the mystery has already been taken out of the original languages by those faithful men who laboured hard to give us the Bible in modern English. So be thankful that you can even get to read it for yourself.</p>

              <p>Who told you the Bible has much editing and got mistakes?</p>
              <p>Did I have to weave my way through? Not at all. I have spoken to kids that dragons was the label used on dinosaurs before the word "dinosaur" was invented in 1841. Their eyes lit up and they understood. You just need to renew their thinking on this. Many people's minds simply are filled with caricatures and trash ideas about the Bible. I just need to correct the false ideas. </p>

              <p>Hi there, it's been a while.</p>
              <p>Between an atheist and a theist, the most important thing to debate over is the issue of God's existence. The rest are peripheral to this. As such I would love to continue our debate that was terminated. I am sorry that I am unable to acede to your condition. Migration of topic to another forum to lock it down is not something I would do or can do. I have no idea why the issue of God's existence cannot be debated or discussed on Sgforums. It's a topic that is always included in any book on philosophy.</p>

              <p>And you were really expecting me to present what the link to argue for you... Possession or influence?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">In Rev 20, what comes to your mind when you see the word "dragon" which was referring to Satan? You picturing a Chinese dragon? Duh..."</span></p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">I know what the Masoretic text is, but again this is completely IRRELEVANT to the issue about how long the time period between Abraham to Jesus. As mentioned more than once, Abraham lived about 2000 BC. From Adam to Abraham is also about 2000 years. So how old is the earth? Do your math and stop throwing red herrings."</span></p>
              <p>If you knew what its is and the implications that the dead sea scrolls brings, you wouldn't deemed it to be irrevelant with caps. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">And I am telling you that to harp about time being a human concept is a red herring. That's not even the issue. So what if 24hrs is a human concept? Does that change the argument or invalidate my point? Not at all. The issue is that the Bible defined the each day of creation as bounded by an evening and a morning with an ordinal number, and this always means an ordinary day as we know it. And how have I been deceived by the idea of a 24 hr day?"</span></p>
              <p>God defined <span style="color: #333333;">"evening and morning makes a day". </span>You dropped the red herring(24hr/day) here, not me. Unless you can show me where in the bible states there are 24hrs/day.</p>

              <p>For the nth time, tell me what the article says concerning WHO the serpent in Genesis 3 was?</p>
              <p>Wow, must really lay it out for you. OK lah, since you are so reluctant to say I am right (ego issue perhaps?) I will cut and paste the answer from the article, say ahhhhhhhhhh:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">The work of the serpent is thus the enactment of everything that Jesus ascribed to ‘<span class="scripture">the devil</span> ’ in </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=ESV&amp;passage=John%208:44"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">John 8:44</span></span></a><span style="color: #ff6600;">. Furthermore, there is no other event in recorded history that better fulfils this description of the devil than does the account of the temptation by the serpent in Genesis 3. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">A further tie-up between the serpent of Genesis 3 and Satan, or the devil, is given in </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=ESV&amp;passage=rev%2012:9,20:2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Revelation 12:9 and 20:2</span></span></a><span style="color: #ff6600;">:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Likewise demons can, under certain conditions, indwell either human bodies or animal bodies—for example, the time when Jesus cast out a legion of devils from a man, and they then entered a herd of pigs which ran down a steep place into the sea (</span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=ESV&amp;passage=mark%205:1-13"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Mark 5:1–13</span></span></a><span style="color: #ff6600;">). It is therefore proper for us to conclude that Satan appropriated and used the body of a specific serpent on this occasion to carry out his subtle purpose of tempting Eve to sin.</span></p>
              <p>Your quip about the Masoretic text is indeed IRRELEVANT. Why do I need to know that when the issue is about the time period between Abraham and Jesus which anyone with the initiative can easily find out? <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_years_between_Abraham_and_Jesus">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_years_between_Abraham_and_Jesus</a></p>
              <p>Pray tell why would saying that 24hrs make up the evening and a morning be a red herring? Just because the Bible does not say "an evening and a morning, 24 hours" means we cannot conclude it is a literal ordinary day then as we know it today? The Bible calls it "evening and morning" while we today calls it a 24 hour duration. Both refer to the same thing n question, the meaning of a day. Or are you saying we cannot conclude because you have alread sold out to the evolution story?</p>
              <p>So your point about Augustine was just you showing off but really has no relevance to what is being discussed. *face/palm*</p>

              <p>Indeed, the truth is that there are many Christians who are ignorant of such things, which is why organisations like AiG or CMI or ICR etc are around to communicate the information.</p>
              <p>God said a day is defined as "an evening and a morning" no less than SIX times. Is that unclear? Misguiding? Misleading? Not at all. People who take God's Word seriously can even work out a Biblical chronology of about 6000 years. You feel misguided because you chose to BELIEVE man's fallible opinions over God's infallible Word, simple as that.</p>
              <p>Don't you know that the meaning of words change over time? It's not just the word "unicorn" but many other words as well. God's Word did not change. The Hebrew text remains the same, it is the English translation and choice of words used that may cause some confusion. But then again, do you just read the KJV when there are other translations that do not have the word unicorn in them? You never read the NLT before? Try it! Your complaint is with English, not the Bible! <a href="http://carm.org/bible-unicorn">http://carm.org/bible-unicorn</a></p>

              Augustine, in his commentary on chapter 3 inÂ "The Literal Meaning of Genesis", states "This serpent, however, could be called the wisest of of the beasts not by reason of its irrational soul but rather because of another spirit - that of the Devil - dwelling in it."Â

              <p>Some theists would like to refute this point by saying that we
              have sinned and misused the free will God had given us, thus evil
              happens, or something of that kind.</p>
              <p>The fallacy in the above sentence, however, is apparent when you
              think about it. God is he all-knowing and all-powerful being right?
              Now if he knows what you think, and he knows the future, do we have
              free will actually? So did Adam have free will, or did God already
              know that Satan would tempt Adam to eat the fruit?</p>
              <p>Some theists might call this God's test of faith. However, if
              God already knows what you want, or what you will do, then is the
              test of faith not necessary at all? If so, then why did God went to
              the extent of blaming Adam for something that He knew Adam would
              do? Why would he create Satan?</p>
              <p><strong>Food for thought.</strong></p>
              <p>Now if this has offended any of you, I would like to say I am
              sorry. I know science cannot necessarily disprove or prove God, but
              it shows that many wonders of nature can be done naturally, and
              without the aid of a creator. Hence I have decided to use the
              philosophical problem of evil. </p>

              <p>The theistic approach assumes that God is the sole determinant of all events. Ergo, man has no free-will - this dogma is a given. While the atheists/agnostics, or anyone else for that matter may argue from the perspective of a hard determinist, compatibilist or libertarian. </p>
              <p>What's your point? </p>

              <p>No compulsion to interpret what literally? If you even had the initiative to check out what Augustine wrote, that entire chapter was about the usage of the word "wise" in referring to the serpent. Later in that chapter Augustine wrote,</p>
              <p>"If the Devil, therefore, entered the serpent and possessed it, communicating his spirit to it in the manner in which the prophets of demons are usually possessed, it would be no wonder if he made it wiser than all beasts, which have a living but irrational soul."</p>
              <p>In short, epic failed on your part to read.</p>
              <p>Again the issue of the mechanics as to how the Devil used the snake is IRRELEVANT to the point that a real snake was the form in which the Devil presented himself to tempt Eve. Do you agree or not? Or are you saying that the serpent was actually the devil in bodily form, as in the devil materialised himself as a serpent?</p>
              <p>It seems that when the evidence is on my side you cavalierly dismissed it as being trendy, rational and mainstream. That is so lame a response.</p>
              <p>OK, so you say you believe in 6 days creation. By what do you mean by six days? Ordinary days? Non-ordinary days? Literal days? Figurative days? Any bloke can say he believe in 6 days creation. Even progressive creationist Hugh Ross says that, while clearly adopting a nonliteral meaning of that word. So can you CLEARLY and UNAMBIGUOUSLY tell us what you mean by 6 days and how long each day is in clear language without any vagueness and ambiguity?</p>
              <p>You said you don't believe in evolution, so you telling me you reject ALL of evolution, from cosmic to chemical to biological goo-to-you evolution? And how come you use pro-evolution websites like talkorigins to argue against my views? Do you really believe those pro-evolution websites? It's YOUR problem that you don't see.</p>
