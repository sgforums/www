              <p>Nevertheless the fact remains that you misinterpreted Augustine, as I have clearly shown.</p>
              <p>Has it ever cross your mind to just answer a simple question of why Rev 20:2 mentioned the words "ancient serpent" and what was that alluding to?</p>
              <p>Still laughing at your failure to understand the term evolution and what fields it has been applied to. In fact, it is an entire worldview. See <a href="http://www.iscid.org/encyclopedia/Evolution">http://www.iscid.org/encyclopedia/Evolution</a></p>
              <p>Your false accusation is noted. I have repeatedly said that God created in six literal ordinary days, and that each day is a normal 24 hr day. Asking me to define time is again a red herring. I am asking you how long a day is in Genesis 1 and you have repeatedly evaded the answer. It is obvious that you are trying to avoid this issue because you KNOW very well that only the young earth view is exegetically tight. So now you just stall for time and try to create a diversion. You can throw red herrings all you want, I ain't biting.</p>
              <p>Again your lack of initiative to search things for yourself is not my problem.</p>

              <p>It there in your link..."In 1967, the second was redefined in
              terms of the wavelength of light, and it became the SI base unit of
              time". Nothing to God commandment, an evening and a morning makes a
              day... If you insist 24hrs make a day is what Genesis meant, you
              are taking human inventions more than God's literal words.</p>

              <p>Well, you would have to actually demonstrate that Augustine utterly rejects Biblical 6 days creation and did not believe in a universe/earth about 6000 years old.</p>
              <p>Like I said, feel free to ASSUME that I am wrong about Rev 20:2. Now YOU tell me what you think the "ancient serpent" was about. Surely your belief is not dependent on mine, right? So quit the evasive tactics and answer the question.</p>
              <p>I laugh at your notion that evolution means ONLY the Theory of Evolution. At its most basic meaning it means "change over time". Context determines meaning when a word can have more than one meaning. Obviously you did not learn that in school.</p>
              <p>You are obviously being ridiculous. What is taking man's invention over God's Word is for you to accept the ideas of evolution over God's Word that He created in six literal days, ordinary normal days as we have them today. Do I insist that it is 24 hours day? Yes. But if you are nitpicking on the fact that a day is not EXACTLY 24 hours but slightly less, this only shows how immature you are.</p>
              <p>I already given the answer. Is it too much for you to connect the dots, or even to check it up for yourself?</p>

              <p>So satan took the form of a dragon with legs and got his legs busted and has been crawling on his belly ever since? Satan is older than creation? Who told you that? Where is your source?

              <p>That your interpretation of Augustine is shown to be wrong has NOTHING to do with any notion of Augustine's infallibility, a notion that no one to holding on to anyway. Why should Augustine be infallible just to be able to say you are wrong? Like I said, you can quote Augustine, so can I. You can appeal to him, so can I. Deal with it. I have already shown how your interpretation of "could be" was already off which cannot be denied.</p>
              <p>It's easy to see how your view crumbles upon scrutiny. If you say that Satan assumed a serpent form to tempt Eve, and God judged his serpentine form, then it means that satan can undo God's judgement by changing back to his original spiritual nature. But if you say serpent is just a symbol then explain why God would want to curse a symbol and make it eat dust? All land animals were created on Day 6 i.e. the snake was created on Day 6 along with all other land animals and also humans. So what is the big deal you are making about being created before the wild animals? Completely irrelevant!</p>
              <p>But I asked you for your sources for your interpretation of Rev 20:2 and you went silent on that. So you anyhow gasak one ad hoc interpretation one issit?</p>
              <p>You complaining about me being ambigious in my replies? That's really a shameless double standard thing accusation on your part.</p>
              <p>Ad nauseum! I have already stated that I take a plain sense reading of Genesis regarding what the day is, that it is an evening and a morning. I take the view that this day is the same as our 24hrs day. Setting aside whether you think I am right or wrong, I am asking YOU (more than once already) to tell me how long that day is by our measurement, man-made or not. Stop your evading tactics on this. Or are you afraid to be shown to be in error if you make known your views? Saying "I don't know" is a cop out, and ignorance is not a basis to say that my views are wrong. </p>
              <p>Just because you are ignorant of what "teh gong" means does not mean it is unintelligible. You may well lack the intelligence to find out what that means. Even more ironic is the fact that I have already told you what it meant. You need to be more perceptive.</p>

              <p>I believed i already explained previously. An evidence or a proof or anything christianity coming from a largely bias christian source made up of scientist/writers who are christians inclined to support the christian worldview are a bias source by itself. This makes the proof very less reliable. Even in secondary school students are taught to cross reference from other sources to prove something.</p>
              <p>While it is not wrong for christians to support and write about christians worldview, but using that to prove whatever in the christians worldview as the factual truth is in itself wrong.</p>
              <p>you are still the same... forever getting overly defensive. It makes things hard for ppl to have a good discussion here.</p>

              <p>I believed i already explained previously. An evidence or a proof or anything christianity coming from a largely bias christian source made up of scientist/writers who are christians inclined to support the christian worldview are a bias source by itself. This makes the proof very less reliable. Even in secondary school students are taught to cross reference from other sources to prove something.</p>
              <p>While it is not wrong for christians to support and write about christians worldview, but using that to prove whatever in the christians worldview as the factual truth is in itself wrong.</p>
              <p>you are still the same... forever getting overly defensive. It makes things hard for ppl to have a good discussion here.</p>
              <p>I will stop here for now. Do not think you will take what i've said.</p>

              <p>It is still the genetic fallacy. The allegation of being unreliable must be proven, not assumed. Do you consider the accounts of the Holocaust written by the surviving Jews as unreliable because it was written by Jews to support the plight of the Jews? If you have bothered to check out the more than 7,000 articles on Creation.com you would not fail to see the cross-references and citations provided. Your objection is really without merit. And on what basis do you say it is wrong to use the information provided by Creation.com? I think you are simply being biased and prejudiced.</p>
              <p>I am not being overly defensive anymore than you are being overly attacking. Why should I not defend my views from your criticism if I consider it unfair or erroneous? I did not dismiss your views out of hand, I actually show you why I disagree and point out where your problem lies.</p>
              <p>And for what it's worth I also do not think you will take what I have said.</p>

              <p>You may know how to validate your sources but you do not know how to read properly. How about you provide a coiple of examples to back up your allegation? A few out of 7,000 over articles shouldn't cause you much difficulty if your allegation has legs to stand.</p>
