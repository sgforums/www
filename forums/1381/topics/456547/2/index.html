              <p> </p>
              <p>Everything was perfect until Eve and Adam took the fruit of knowledge of "good" and "evil". Which meant that "good" and "evil" was existing and was perfect before the original duo knew of it. The 1st thing the realize is that they were naked and they thought it was "evil" so they hid themselves when hearing God.<br>They became stupid with the knowledge of "good and "evil". What is so wrong about nakedness when they were naked before and they were the only humans around and God is omniscience knowing where they'd hide.<br>This awareness of guilt caused them to act stupidly. This sense of guilt I believe is the sin, contrary to conventionally believed.</p>
              <p>The hypothesis above is based on the dilemma I had with the existence of "good" and "evil" and their deduced "existence" before the fall. What is "good" without reference to "evil" and what is "evil" without reference to "good". It became clear to me that "good" and "evil" is nothing but subjectivity of humans.</p>
              <p>Epicurus's trilemma setups with this subjectivity of "evil".</p>
              <p>Sidenote: freewill is a myth.  </p>

              <p>Of course no where does the Bible defines sin as a sense of guilt. Some people have their conscience seared and sin with impunity with no sense of guilt. So is sense of guilt the sin? Not according to the Bible. It is the act of rebellion that is sin, which is missing the mark of God's standard of moral perfection. </p>

It is not me begging the question but you again playing daft. God IS good. You don't judge the goodness of God by looking at evil or referencing evil. God always existed. Not evil. I shudder to think what kind of theology you hold to, if any.</p>

              <p>You failed to get what I was trying to say. Evil is not a thing to be created. The same with good. Good is not a thing to be created. God IS good. If good is a thing to be created, then it means God is created since God is good. But God is eternal. Everything that God does flows from that goodness in Him. The free will that God endowed His creation with is also good. See <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/did-God-create-evil.html">http://www.gotquestions.org/did-God-create-evil.html</a></p>
              <p>As to poisoning wells, I think you are much better at it than me. Anyway, where did you get your idea that Jesus have to die for our sins? The Bible? The Scriptures? Which one? Duh....</p>

Some people have their conscience seared and sin with impunity with no sense of guilt. So is sense of guilt the sin? Not according to the Bible. It is the act of rebellion that is sin, which is missing the mark of God's standard of moral perfection. "</span></p>
              <p>Misinterpretation: implying that I said sense of guilt = sin... I call strawman.<br>God is perfection. God's creation is perfect. If its not, it opens the question to God's omniscience. </p>

              <p>To know what is good you look at God, not the devil. To know the Truth you look at Jesus, not Satan. So what is this nonsense about referencing good to evil? Again I wonder where you get your theology from, the Bible or the dictionary.</p>
              <p>Well, you did write, "This sense of guilt I believe is the sin, contrary to conventionally believed." So why would it be a misinterpretation on my part?</p>

              <p>No, evil cannot be created.</p>
              <p>Non-Diametrical model...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Dia" = in 2 directions (eg. Dialogue, Diameter)</p>
              <p>"Metric" = measurement</p>
              <p>Diametric = measurable in 2 directions. +10/ -10 relationship.</p>
              <p>Non-diametric = not measured in 2 directions.</p>
              <p>Stationary-ness cannot be meaured. (How still is it?) It is the blank state. Therefore based on this model, evil cannot be created anymore than stationary-ness can be created. It is the blank state.</p>
              <p>Evil is simply the rejection of God, rejection of light, rejection of love, rejection of truth. (can substitute "rejection" with "absence of")</p>
              <p>Before Adam, there was Lucifer who became Satan. He rejected God and rejected light (hence darkness is associated with Satan, and he's also called the "father of lies" since there is no truth in him)</p>
              <p>Adam rejected the truth in a way since God's instruction is also truth.</p>
              <p>Opposite of love isn't hate. It's apathy. So the diametric model explains it quite well.</p>

              <p>Doesn't it ever occur to you that to speak of evil "coming from" sin is incorrect? Consider how 1 Kings 16:19 puts it thus, "because of the sin he committed by doing what was evil in the <span class="small-caps divine-name" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>’s sight and by following the example of Jeroboam and the sin he caused Israel to commit."</p>
              <p>I already defined good, you failed to read. God IS good. To know God is to know Good. Does God's goodness depend on Satan? Yes or No?</p>
              <p>God's omniscience and omnipotence is clearly taught in Scripture, what do you really want to defend anyway? Every attack on God's attributes will fail inevitably. The existence of evil does not call into question God's omnipotence and omniscience. Why does evil exist is not to be answered by impugning the attributes of God, certainly not for the Christian who wants to give a Biblical answer.</p>
