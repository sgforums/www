              <p>Yes I did literally dissect the words to guess at its meaning, since any intelligent person can see that it is made up of two known words. Does one really need a dictionary to know what it means as a figure of speech? Like I said, only the linguistically challenged like you. Of course you FAILED to see that my reply about my butt not hurting was meant to be a facetious rebutt. Oh and you may wish to check that word up too. Hint: Nothing to do with poo poo.</p>
              <p>So now you want to start answering questions? How about the earlier questions which you refused to be subjected to in order to affirm what the Bible teaches? You know lah, those that even the devil also believe one? Duh..</p>

              Why should I answer your questions here when you refused to answer mine there? I am still dealing with you, not as if you are another person because it is another thread. The issue is that you refuse to answer questions, which thread is IRRELEVANT. You can describe me anyway you like to poison the well. It is your forte to do just that.

                  Obviously you cannot take no for an answer since you could only reconcile that fact by engaging in personal attack of your opponent. Talk about taking issues personally, you should learn to reflect on the kind of caustic remarks and personal attacks you engage in. And I know you still refuse to answer simple questions, an issue that has totally nothing to do with your professed supposed allegiance to Christ.

              It is caustic because it reflects you. I have always put up the fact that I am a Christian and defending Biblical truths, unlike you who suppressed and withheld your beliefs and after all the attacks on the faith suddenly claim to be a follower of Christ, one who denies Biblical creation no less. If anyone is putting up a false frontit would be you. Since when is the denial of Christ commandments the issue? Throwing red herrings again?

              And I believe in creation... but you cannot accept that people who

              <p>That is true.    Don't give up.   There is no end to learning.   Once you have love for God first, things will fall in place.    Love will flow from your love for God to touch lives.</p>
