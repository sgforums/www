              <p>Precisely because God is ALL knowing and you are not, that you should humbly acknowledge that there are things God knows. God did not tell us, and neither is He obliged to tell us, why this or why that, to everything that happens. God sees the beginning to the end, you don't.

              <p>Rev 12:9, Rev 20:2, Scripture interprets Scripture. In any case,
                              you FAILED to show that I was wrong to say that the serpent in the
                              Garden who spoke to Eve was the devil.</p>
              <p>I stand by my bold claim. Now you tell me that it isn't so. Why
                              do you believe the earth is 4.5 billion years old? Because the
                              Bible tells you so?</p>
              </div>

              <p>God removed the serpent's legs and made to crawl for the rest of its life in Genesis. How did you interprete that the dragon were crawling without legs? </p>
              <p>I don't believe the earth is 4.5 billion years old, because the  bible does not say so.</p>

              <p>Still being evasive and refusing to answer the question? Surely your answer does not depend on whether I can explain it or not, right?</p>
              <p>Why don't you believe it then? The genealogies of Jesus in Luke and Matthew, taken with Genesis 5, 1 Chron 1 can established such an age. This has already been done. I have already provided the necessary links to demonstrate the time between Abraham and Jesus. If you think that is wrong, then tell me what you believe.</p>
              <p>Why play games still? Trying to avoid the conclusion? Red herring thrown in? Do you or do you not take the days in Genesis as literal days, ordinary days of 24 hours each? Yes or No? YECs say yes. OECs who subscribe to the evolutionary age of the earth says no. What about you?</p>

              <p>Still being evasive and refusing to answer the question? Surely
                  your answer does not depend on whether I can explain it or not,
                  right?</p>
              <p>Why don't you believe it then? The genealogies of Jesus in Luke
                  and Matthew, taken with Genesis 5, 1 Chron 1 can established such
                  an age. This has already been done. I have already provided the
                  necessary links to demonstrate the time between Abraham and Jesus.
                  If you think that is wrong, then tell me what you believe.</p>
              <p>Why play games still? Trying to avoid the conclusion? Red
                  herring thrown in? Do you or do you not take the days in Genesis as
                  literal days, ordinary days of 24 hours each? Yes or No? YECs say
                  yes. OECs who subscribe to the evolutionary age of the earth says
                  no. What about you?</p>

              <p>I <strong>believe</strong>, taking Genesis literally, the serpent is literally the serpent, nothing else. Unless you can show me otherwise. You were adding to the literal meaning of the serpent when you said "...<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">asks the same question the devil asked Eve..." </span>which I corrected but you fail to accept but insist on the story that the literal serpent is the devil, by referencing to the dragon in Revelations, as the literal serpent in Genesis where the dragon had legs... textually incorrect story I say.</p>

              <p>I have made my believe and disbelieve quite clearly(see bold) now. What do you want me to believe?</p>
