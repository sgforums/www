              <p>I have no faith in most churches in Singapore anymore.    I wonder if the church my friend goes to is like what you said.     I am surprised to hear that the pastor in my friend's church cannot be bothered to ask whether if the non christians want to accept Jesus as Lord and Saviour.  She went on to ask them to follow her pray the sinners' prayer.  Thereafer she told them they are christians and will talk to them about baptism later.  These are most China Chinese non believers.</p>
              <p>wth!    This is a small baptist church, not the conventional type of baptist church.</p>

              <p>I honestly don't take that as a serious post.</p>
              <p>Still I just wish to comment, that what has happened here in this forum really should not be considered persecution. It is really an insult to call it persacution when in the past and even now, people bleed and die for what they believe in or for the moral stands they make.</p>
              <p>Even today, there are women who have to suffer purely because they are women. Like the women we hear about in extremist Arab areas who are stoned or killed just because they try to go to school to get an education.</p>
              <p>Human rights activists who are locked up unfairly without trial because they are asking for better treatment of others.</p>
              <p>That is real persecution to me. Real suffering for things they truly believe in.</p>

              <p>On another point, the bible does say that just because you become a Christian, it does not mean you will no longer have sadness or have pain in your life. It does not mean you will no longer have problems or difficulties in your life.</p>
              <p>He didn't say there'd always be rainbows, that that'd always be sunshine. Rains and storm will still enter your life.</p>
              <p>Also, to be a true disciple of Jesus you must take up the cross. Not every person who calls himself or herself a Christian has or is able to take up the cross and what comes with it.</p>

              <p>Suffer does not mean poverty, mental suffering, physical suffering, or sufferings in everyday life. But suffering for the sake of Christianity/ God.
