              <p>There are no stupid questions. Only stupid people.</p>
              <p>Okay. Now. On the less serious note however, fellow Christians of all denominations, please answer Hasene properly with love and non-bias, you can give your opinions, but nothing in anyway as to make him FEEL as if we are condencending him.</p>
              <p>How do u do that ? I really dont know. Cause I know for certain, any replies given that he doesnt want to hear he will call u judgemental , no love for God, not a Christian and all that.. WHILE still DEMANDING Christians give him explainations on the matter of salvataion. lol</p>
              <p>Its like people who are genuine get used and abused. And as if thats not bad enough, after being found out that the bastard is just using and abusing, you tell the son of a bitch off, but that s.o.b comes back telling you are not living the way of Jesus, because Christians forgive and love and all the Jesus stuff.</p>
              <p>Riiiighttt....</p>
              <p>Just because u know another's faith, albelt not too deeply unfortunately, does not mean u come in an abuse the system for your own personal satisfaction. Cause I know where this is going.</p>
              <p>I am sure u know I know u know I know, but u are just going to say I am a Troll. =)</p>

              <p>I am sure u are as learned and intellectually capable enough to discern and understand your emotions that leads you to realize that the "trolling" is only manifest 
                  in response to your beliefs.</p>
              <p>I am also sure you can and able to understand  right from wrong, good or 
                  bad, and will be naturally as offended when you are wronged.</p>
              <p>But if you look at this thread as a whole, you will be able to realise that  beliefs in what is true head on and seeing them for what they are (not 
                  fact, but simply a fervent wish for something to be true) you are able to 
                  rid your psyche of these beliefs (or rather the particular belief you are 
                  concentrating on).And to you since the past 3-4 yrs is Christians trolling non-christians and never the other way round. You may justifiable have your reasons, no doubt, but there is opposing for the sake of opposing, and opposing because you know the very person you support is actually not as right as you think he is.</p>
              <p>You may say "Irrelevant" but if you really think so, then perhaps you do not really understand what I am trying to say. And that will be a fact.</p>
