            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I would prefer to separate the concept of religion and God.<br><br>I come to agree pretty much with Ito who said..."Religions are established as evolving guidelines for different societies in order to function and survive, in a state of competition against people of other faith in the purpose of proving the superiority of one society against another and the following of a mutual co-existence with a competitive nature. e.g. a deity of a village is treated as a demon in another rival village. People are not pure from the start, how can religion be pure if it is a product of our social progression?<br><br>Perhaps, there is no such thing as a pure heart from the beginning, and never will be. "<br><br>Religion, after all is a social institution by man, established due to countless which matters little. But what I wish to emphasis and expand on what Ito's said, religion, being a human-based social institution can't be pure. Catholics during the Middle Ages had taken serious bashing due to some atrocities they did in past. Islam started early with a chain of wars linking all the way to Spain in past; possibly seeing that as a mistake to being with, and now condemns the Islamic extremists reponsible for the recent terrorism and violence. --- Some doctrines taught now at this very instant in any great religion could be seen as wrong or godless and change in future. you'll never know.<br><br>The popular question of many christians to non-christians...ARE YOU SAVED?<br><br>Looking out from yourself, if you're the non-christian, how does that make you feel? I recall once when an Evangelical used to ask me that - immediately i shut myself off from that guy. Arrogance, nuts, assumes himself as God, assumes that once we've turned christians - we are saved. Taking a more rational approach, I thought...if there really is a God, who are we to decide who's saved? Much less popping this question to someone else. --- My point is, let God decide who's to be saved...just as we can never be safe to assume that non-christians will or not be saved.<br><br>Like iveco mentioned..just do good, which also encompass not harming people, not bearing malice, seek vengence, satisfying our own conscience is truly enough given our human limits.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in the first place, what is this whole thing about being "born again"? I can't help but be reminded of cycle of life, karma...<br><br>i presume the whole talk is if mother theresa is going heaven. by human standards, indeed, we would all like to think that she's already up in heaven, beside whoever God is. However, it can't seem to be stressed enough that these are all, our very own guesses and speculations. Since she's a christian, specifically a roman catholic, it truly jesus christ himself to judge her, and by his grace, bring her into heaven...<br><br>christians and roman catholics alike, despite their differences, they still fundamentally believe in the same God, albeit denominational differences in some minor denominations that do not have the same understanding of God. again, who goes to hell, who goes to heaven, it's really hard to guess.</div>

Some other evidences would be eye witnesses which pass on and on... well I know you would not believe that.
