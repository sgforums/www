            <div class='col-md body'>Take it easy man. We need a variance of views in this forum &amp; in Singapore. We can't simply have everyone talking the same thing. So neither the views abt banning is wrong cos there are valid reasons. Nor the views supporting the airing of the show bcos there are valid reasons also.<br><br>I think Singaporeans are a thinking lot. Look at the recent political debates among the young &amp; old. Just great! This is a good opportunity to let people be interested in Christianity &amp; God will turn what satan meant for evil into our good.
