              <p>I don't see any reason why this should be the case beyond personal fancy, pretty much like how an ex-pastor of mine told me dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex did not exist and were mythical creations (like dragons or other fantasy animals), and he seemed quite serious about that.

              <p>So they were all faked for kicks? Some guy had a fancy idea there ought to be a T.rex and made some fake bones and then got the entire paleontological community who is often cash-strapped (Jurassic Park cost most money to make then the entire annual amount of cash paleontology in America recieves to conduct it's research) to be along in the conspiracy to fake out over 3,000 other different species of dinosaurs just for the fun of it?</p>
              <p>Er, I don't know, but I think my ex-pastor's ideas probably holds less water then the people who believe the moon landing was a hoax. But the thing that did disturb me a bit was that he believes in it, and believes in it truly. </p>
