              Dont you know whoever made friend with the world and its way is an enemy of God.<br><br>
                                                                    
              But then again most people don't know God so how can they care. They're passing by in this life only to be forgotten forever and to become nothing. Not a trace of them would be found tomorrow yet here they are today boasting who is like me?<br><br>
                                                  
              They are nothing but the wind felt today but gone tomorrow but in their arrogance they live a life of insult to God. They are animals foolish and without wisdom. They rely on their wealth and their wickedness and evil ways. They thought they were invincible. yet they all fall into nothingness unable to help themselves in the end. What dread that awaits them cannot even be imagined. What good is a great name without grace from God. What good is wealth without God's grace.<br><br>
                                                  
              They are lost people and they mislead others into their lost ways.
                                                  <br><br>
              The second death is what awaits them. They are nothing.
                                <br><br>
              They've forgotten that what they are really given is time. Mere time.
                                <br><br>
              Let all the angels shout to mock them whenever each one of them fall into nothingness. Raise yourself up! Fight against the Most high as you boasted in life. There would be no answer. They have even forgotten who they were and where they are now.

              If you think that being a follower of Christ is easy and cheap you're not aware of the bible.
              <br><br>
              This is but a verse of the cost of being the follower of Christ<br><br>
              John 15:18-22<br><br>
              If the people of this world hate you, just remember that they hated me first. If you belonged to the world, its people would love you. But you don't belong to the world. I have chosen you to leave the world behind, and that's why its people hate you. rem,ember how I told you that servants aren't greater than their master. So if people mistreat me, they will mistreat you. If they do what I say, they will do what you say. People will do to you exactly what they did to me. They will do it because you belong to me and they don't know the one who sent me. If I hadn't come and spoken to them, they wouldn't be guilty of sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin.
              <br><br><br>
              Do you ever wonder why so many people do not know God? Even many Christians do not know God personally though every Christian is called God's children and what kind of children that don't know their father? Why? Because they are not truly Christian at heart! They don't know God and when the occasion arose in which they have to choose side they would fall since they do not know God. Many of these people are cowards, faithless and stupid and weak.
