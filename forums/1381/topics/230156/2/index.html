Joseph is an old man thats why he died fast haha.<br><br>An important historical document which supports the teaching of MaryÂ’s perpetual virginity is the Protoevangelium of James, which was written probably less than sixty years after the conclusion of MaryÂ’s earthly life (around A.D. 120), when memories of her life were still vivid in the minds of many.<br><br>However, due to considerations of ceremonial cleanliness, it was eventually necessary for Mary, a consecrated "virgin of the Lord," to have a guardian or protector who would respect her vow of virginity. Thus, according to the Protoevangelium, Joseph, an elderly widower who already had children, was chosen to be her spouse. (This would also explain why Joseph was apparently dead by the time of JesusÂ’ adult ministry, since he does not appear during it in the gospels, and since Mary is entrusted to John, rather than to her husband Joseph, at the crucifixion).<br><br>According to the Protoevangelium, Joseph was required to regard MaryÂ’s vow of virginity with the utmost respect. The gravity of his responsibility as the guardian of a virgin was indicated by the fact that, when she was discovered to be with child, he had to answer to the Temple authorities, who thought him guilty of defiling a virgin of the Lord. Mary was also accused of having forsaken the Lord by breaking her vow. Keeping this in mind, it is an incredible insult to the Blessed Virgin to say that she broke her vow by bearing children other than her Lord and God, who was conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Here are the quotes:<br><br>The Protoevangelium of James</strong></span><br><br>"And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by [St. Anne], saying, Â‘Anne! Anne! The Lord has heard your prayer, and you shall conceive and shall bring forth, and your seed shall be spoken of in all the world.Â’ And Anne said, Â‘As the Lord my God lives, if I beget either male or female, I will bring it as a gift to the Lord my God, and it shall minister to him in the holy things all the days of its life.Â’ . . . And [from the time she was three] Mary was in the temple of the Lord as if she were a dove that dwelt there" (Protoevangelium of James 4, 7 [A.D. 120]).<br><br>"And when she was twelve years old there was held a council of priests, saying, Â‘Behold, Mary has reached the age of twelve years in the temple of the Lord. What then shall we do with her, lest perchance she defile the sanctuary of the Lord?Â’ And they said to the high priest, Â‘You stand by the altar of the Lord; go in and pray concerning her, and whatever the Lord shall manifest to you, that also will we do.Â’ . . . [A]nd he prayed concerning her, and behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him saying, Â‘Zechariah! Zechariah! Go out and assemble the widowers of the people and let them bring each his rod, and to whomsoever the Lord shall show a sign, his wife shall she be. . . . And Joseph [was chosen]. . . . And the priest said to Joseph, Â‘You have been chosen by lot to take into your keeping the Virgin of the Lord.Â’ But Joseph refused, saying, Â‘I have children, and I am an old man, and she is a young girlÂ’" (ibid., 8Â–9).<br><br>"And Annas the scribe came to him [Joseph] . . . and saw that Mary was with child. And he ran away to the priest and said to him, Â‘Joseph, whom you did vouch for, has committed a grievous crime.Â’ And the priest said, Â‘How so?Â’ And he said, Â‘He has defiled the virgin whom he received out of the temple of the Lord and has married her by stealthÂ’" (ibid., 15).<br><br>"And the priest said, Â‘Mary, why have you done this? And why have you brought your soul low and forgotten the Lord your God?Â’ . . . And she wept bitterly saying, Â‘As the Lord my God lives, I am pure before him, and know not manÂ’" (ibid.).</div>

No Christian argued James was Christ brother till perhaps this few decades. Protestant Reformers and Church Fathers who breathed sleep and perhaps went to the toilet with Scriptures were unanimous that James was his cousin as his Mother is Mary sister, Mary of Clopas.<br><br>Give me ur scholar list and I will provide a list of Church Fathers, your reformers and modern day theolgicans.<br><br>Mt 10:2-3, "...'JAMES' the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddeus." Alphaeus is an alternate translation of Cleophas (Clophas) and so he is the same person.<br><br>Acts 1:13, "...JAMES, the son of Alphaeus, and SIMON Zelo'tes, and JUDE the brother of JAMES."<br><br>Mk 15:40, "There were also women looking on afar off: among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of JAMES the less and of JO'SES, and Salome." These people were at the crucifixion.<br><br>Jn 19:25, "Now there stood by the cross of Jesus <strong>His mother (Mary) and His mothers sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas</strong>, and Mary Magdalene."<br><br>---Cleophas-(Alphaeus)--Mt 10:2-3, Jn 19:25, Acts 1:13------<br><br>+ &gt;------begat------James (the less), Joseph (Joses), and Jude---------<br><br>---Mary----the other Mary, Mt 27:56,61, 28:1, Jn 19:25------<br><br>Common sense LOL.<br><br>I hereby see the double standard of Sola Scriptura being employed.

We cannot condemn any doctrine as unimportant. If that is the case wouldnt there be only one Church???<br><br>To a catholic, an argument whether speaking in tongue has ceased is hardly important to HIM but he should not dismiss it as unimportant as a charismatic view it with the outmost importance.<br><br>Hence we should not dismiss a doctrine on the outcome that it does not corresspond with your idea of salvation.
