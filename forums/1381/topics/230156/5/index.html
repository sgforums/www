Which assuredly she would not say, unless she had before vowed herself unto God as a virgin</strong>. But, because the habits of the Israelites as yet refused this, she was espoused to a just man, who would not take from her by violence, but rather guard against violent persons, what she had already vowed. Although, even if she had said this only, How shall this take place ?' and had not added, seeing I know not a man,' certainly she would not have asked, how, being a female, she should give birth to her promised Son, if she had married with purpose of sexual intercourse. She might have been bidden also to continue a virgin, that in her by fitting miracle the Son of God should receive the form of a servant, but, being to be a pattern to holy virgins, lest it should be thought that she alone needed to be a virgin, who had obtained to conceive a child even without sexual intercourse, she dedicated her virginity to God, when as yet she knew not what she should conceive, in order that the imitation of a heavenly life in an earthly and mortal body should take place of vow, not of command; through love of choosing, not through necessity of doing service. Thus Christ by being born of a virgin, who, before she knew Who was to be born of her, had determined to continue a virgin, chose rather to approve, than to command, holy virginity. And thus, even in the female herself, in whom He took the form of a servant, He willed that virginity should be free." Augustine, Of Holy Virginity, 4 (A.D. 401).<br><br>Matt 1:25<br><br>"And when he had taken her, he knew her not, till she had brought forth her first-born Son.' <strong>He hath here used the word till,' not that thou shouldest suspect that afterwards he did know her, but to inform thee that before the birth the Virgin was wholly untouched by man. But why then, it may be said, hath he used the word, till'?</strong> Because it is usual in Scripture often to do this, and to use this expression without reference to limited times. For so with respect to the ark likewise, it is said, The raven returned not till the earth was dried up.' And yet it did not return even after that time. And when discoursing also of God, the Scripture saith, From age until age Thou art,' not as fixing limits in this case. And again when it is preaching the Gospel beforehand, and saying, In his days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace, till the moon be taken away,' it doth not set a limit to this fair part of creation. So then here likewise, it uses the word "till," to make certain what was before the birth, but as to what follows, it leaves thee to make the inference.Â” John Chrysostom, Gospel of Matthew, V:5 (A.D. 370).<br><br>St Chrysostom argument is the same as John Salza with the Raven example.<br><br>John:<br><br>"For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother,<strong> Woman, behold thy son,' and not Behold you have this son also</strong>,' then He virtually said to her, Lo, this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.' Is it not the case that every one who is perfect lives himself no longer, but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, Behold thy son Christ.' What a mind, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears?"

No one knows who is the real author though the works is authentic.<br><br>Its strange because Modern day protestants scorn Tradition (understandable) and their Reformers as well (i dont understand why). The Reformers even called a 4th century dude, Heldivus, who argued against the perputual virginity, a pig-head. So my question is why do Protestants reject the thier own Reformers. Surely as creators of Sola Scriptura, they would have reject the perputual virginity if it wasnt strong scripturially.<br><br>Anyway, the 3 intepretation of the scripture verse is to show Icemoon, that Church Fathers holds Apologist John Salza (and my) view as well. </div></blockquote>the idea of Sola Scriptura is regarding comparing what is taught against the Scripture, it was design/formulated to weed out errant and non scriptural teachings and traditions (be it from Church Fathers or Reformers).<br><br>one such teaching is the legalised selling/buying of indulgence by Pope Leo X in 1517 to raise funds to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica in Rome (this is the incident that provoked Martin Luther to write his 95 theses, protesting what he saw as the purchase and sale of salvation).<br>For the record. this practice was subsequently outlawed by By decree of Pope Pius V in 1567, following the Council of Trent, it is forbidden to attach the receipt of an indulgence to any financial act, including the giving of alms (which shows that the church teaching/practice regarding this issue at that time was indeed in error).<br></div>
