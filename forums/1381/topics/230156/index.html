            <div class='col-md body'>According to the Protoevangelium, Joseph was required to regard MaryÂ’s vow of virginity with the utmost respect. The gravity of his responsibility as the guardian of a virgin was indicated by the fact that, when she was discovered to be with child, he had to answer to the Temple authorities, who thought him guilty of defiling a virgin of the Lord. Mary was also accused of having forsaken the Lord by breaking her vow. Keeping this in mind, it is an incredible insult to the Blessed Virgin to say that she broke her vow by bearing children other than her Lord and God, who was conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit. <strong>I cannot imagine Joseph hjaving intercourse with the Spuose of the Holy Spirit and vessel of the Word. Such an act would have been sacrilegous.</strong><br><strong>Here it is:</strong><br><br>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by [St. Anne], saying, Â‘Anne! Anne! The Lord has heard your prayer, and you shall conceive and shall bring forth, and your seed shall be spoken of in all the world.Â’ And Anne said, Â‘As the Lord my God lives, if I beget either male or female, I will bring it as a gift to the Lord my God, and it shall minister to him in the holy things all the days of its life.Â’ . . . And [from the time she was three] Mary was in the temple of the Lord as if she were a dove that dwelt there" (Protoevangelium of James 4, 7 [A.D. 120]).<br><br>"And when she was twelve years old there was held a council of priests, saying, Â‘Behold, Mary has reached the age of twelve years in the temple of the Lord. What then shall we do with her, lest perchance she defile the sanctuary of the Lord?Â’ And they said to the high priest, Â‘You stand by the altar of the Lord; go in and pray concerning her, and whatever the Lord shall manifest to you, that also will we do.Â’ . . . [A]nd he prayed concerning her, and behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him saying, Â‘Zechariah! Zechariah! Go out and assemble the widowers of the people and let them bring each his rod, and to whomsoever the Lord shall show a sign, his wife shall she be. . . . And Joseph [was chosen]. . . . And the priest said to Joseph, Â‘You have been chosen by lot to take into your keeping the Virgin of the Lord.Â’ But Joseph refused, saying, Â‘I have children, and I am an old man, and she is a young girlÂ’" (ibid., 8Â–9).<br><br>"And Annas the scribe came to him [Joseph] . . . and saw that Mary was with child. And he ran away to the priest and said to him, Â‘Joseph, whom you did vouch for, has committed a grievous crime.Â’ And the priest said, Â‘How so?Â’ And he said, Â‘He has defiled the virgin whom he received out of the temple of the Lord and has married her by stealthÂ’" (ibid., 15).<br><br>"And the priest said, Â‘Mary, why have you done this? And why have you brought your soul low and forgotten the Lord your God?Â’ . . . And she wept bitterly saying, Â‘As the Lord my God lives, I am pure before him, and know not manÂ’" (ibid.).<br><br><strong>Church Fathers:</strong><br><br>Â“And indeed it was a virgin, about to marry once for all after her delivery, who gave birth to Christ, in order that each title of sanctity might be fulfilled in Christ's parentage, by means of a mother who was both virgin, and wife of one husband. Again, when He is presented as an infant in the temple, who is it who receives Him into his hands? Who is the first to recognize Him in spirit? A man just and circumspect,' and of course no digamist, (which is plain) even (from this consideration), lest (otherwise) Christ should presently be more worthily preached by a woman, an aged widow, and the wife of one man;' who, living devoted to the temple, was (already) giving in her own person a sufficient token what sort of persons ought to be the adherents to the spiritual temple,--that is, the Church. Such eye-witnesses the Lord in infancy found; no different ones had He in adult age." Tertullian, On Monogamy, 8 (A.D. 213).<br><br>"For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, Woman, behold thy son,' and not Behold you have this son also,' then He virtually said to her, Lo, this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.' Is it not the case that every one who is perfect lives himself no longer, but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, Behold thy son Christ.' What a mind, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears?" Origen, Commentary on John, I:6 (A.D. 232).<br><br>"Therefore let those who deny that the Son is from the Father by nature and proper to His Essence, deny also that He took true human flesh of Mary Ever-Virgin; for in neither case had it been of profit to us men, whether the Word were not true and naturally Son of God, or the flesh not true which He assumed." Athanasius, Orations against the Arians, II:70 (A.D. 362).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets look at some of the other places where this word 'aldephos' are also used<br><br><blockquote><br>Matthew 4:18<br>As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.<br>Mark 12:19<br>"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.<br></blockquote>Its quite obvious that its was also used when describing a brother and not just a cousin.<br><br>On the other hand<br><br><blockquote><br>1 Corinthians 8:11 So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge.<br>2 Peter 3:15Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.<br></blockquote>the same word 'aldephos' are being used (obviously not really  brother, not as fellow brethens in the Lord)<br><br>according to Strong's concordance<br>the greek word 'aldephos' can be used to refer to as a brother, both near or remote (ie. cousin).<br><br><blockquote><br>Mark 6:3<br>"Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.<br>Galatians 1:19<br>I saw none of the other apostlesÂ—only James, the Lord's brother.<br></blockquote>Some arguments is that the brother ('aldephos') used here is refering to a cousin and not a brother, others argue that No, its refering directly to as a brother not just a cousin.<br><br>many traditions uses<br><blockquote><br>Matthew 17:55-56<br>Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.<br></blockquote>To show that that Mary the mother of James and Joses is just an auntie, as she was not at the cross with Christ but standing from a distance (a deduction based on the thought that no mother will want to be at a distance watching her child being excuted instead of by His side).<br>logical? yes<br>but a questioning mind would also ask, perhaps she was at a distance unwillingly, being unable to<br><br>The best argument which I have come across is<br><blockquote><br>John 19:25-27 Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son," and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.<br></blockquote>If James is the Brother of Christ, Son of His mother Mary, why did He (Christ) asked John to take care of Mary, His mother and not James?<br>or is it because he have something else for James to do?<br>questions, questions, questions?????[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now we have four 'brothers', JAMES, JO'SES, SIMON, and JUDE to account for as written in Mk 6:3...<br><br>Mk 15:40, "There were also women looking on afar off: among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of JAMES the less and of JO'SES, and Salome." These people were at the crucifixion.<br><br>Jn 19:25, "Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother (Mary) and His mothers sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene."<br>Note that if in this verse the word "sister" meant blood sister, that she is not named here. The context and placement of the commas preclude that there were two girls in the same family, both having the same name of Mary. Would not this cause much confusion in the family? By careful comparison to Mk 15:40 it is seen that Mary the Mother of Jesus is not mentioned, but Salome is. Also Salome is indirectly mentioned in Matt 27:56 as the mother of the sons of Zebedee. It can therefore be assumed that Salome is the unnamed sister of Mary in this verse.<br><br>Mt 10:2-3, "...'JAMES' the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddeus." Alphaeus is an alternate translation of Cleophas (Clophas) and so he is the same person.<br><br>Acts 1:13, "...JAMES, the son of Alphaeus, and SIMON Zelo'tes, and JUDE the brother of JAMES."<br><br>From these four passages, we see we have another 'Mary', who was the wife of Cleophas (Alphaeus), and the mother of three of Jesus's 'brethren', JAMES (the less), and JO'SES, and JUDE. This clearly shows that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was not the mother of JAMES, JO'SES, and JUDE of Mk 6:3. To keep Mk 6:3 in harmony, since three are not children of Mary, the mother of Jesus, then SIMON is not either. SIMON is the Canaanite Mk 3:18, also called the 'Zealot' (Zelo'tes), Mt 10:4, Lk 6:15, Acts 1:13. Jude, who authored the Epistle of Jude, says he is the brother of James in Jude 1:1. Jude was also called 'Thaddeus' in Mt 10:3, and in Mk 3:18. This was to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot. Lk 6:16 further distinguishes the two by saying, "And Judas (Jude) the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor."<br><br>---Zebedee------Mt 4:21,Mk 1:19, Mk 3:17----------------<br><br>+ &gt;------begat--------James and John-------------------------<br><br>---Salome------------Mt 27:56, Mk 15:40--------------------<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>---Cleophas-(Alphaeus)--Mt 10:2-3, Jn 19:25, Acts 1:13------<br><br>+ &gt;------begat------James (the less), Joseph (Joses), and Jude---------<br><br>---Mary----the other Mary, Mt 27:56,61, 28:1, Jn 19:25------<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>---THE HOLY SPIRIT------Lk 1:35-38----------------------<br><br>+ &gt;------begat------JESUS THE CHRIST--------------------<br><br>---Mary---------------------Lk 1:30-38-----------------------<br><br>I did...but its biblical proven that James is the cousin of Jesus as above.
