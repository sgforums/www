How it happened we do not know. And since the Holy Spirit has told us nothing about it, we can make of it no article of faith . . . It is enough to know that she lives in Christ.<br><br>The <strong>veneration of Mary </strong>is inscribed in the very depths of the human heart. (Sermon, September 1, 1522).<br><br>[She is the] highest woman and the noblest gem in Christianity after Christ . . . She is nobility, wisdom, and holiness personified.<strong> We can never honor her enough.</strong> Still honor and praise must be given to her in such a way as to injure neither Christ nor the Scriptures. (Sermon, Christmas, 1531).<br><br>No woman is like you. You are more than Eve or Sarah, <strong>blessed above all nobility, wisdom, and sanctity</strong>. (Sermon, Feast of the Visitation, 1537).<br><br>One should honor Mary as she herself wished and as she expressed it in the Magnificat. She praised God for his deeds. How then can we praise her? The true honor of Mary is the honor of God, the praise of God's grace . . . Mary is nothing for the sake of herself, but for the sake of Christ . . . <strong>Mary does not wish that we come to her, but through her to God.</strong> (Explanation of the Magnificat, 1521).<br><br>Luther gives the Blessed Virgin the exalted position of "Spiritual Mother" for Christians:<br><br><span class="large">It is the consolation and the superabundant goodness of God, that man is able to exult in such a treasure. Mary is his true Mother .. (Sermon, Christmas, 1522)</span><br><br>Mary is the Mother of Jesus and the Mother of all of us even though it was Christ alone who reposed on her knees . . . If he is ours, we ought to be in his situation; there where he is, we ought also to be and all that he has ought to be ours, and <strong>his mother is also our mother</strong>. (Sermon, Christmas, 1529).<br><br><span class="large">Martin Luther had the belief of Mary's Immaculate Conception, Luther's words follow:</span><br><br>It is a sweet and pious belief that the infusion of <strong>Mary's soul was effected without original sin</strong>; so that in the very infusion of her soul she was also purified from original sin and adorned with God's gifts, receiving a pure soul infused by God; thus from the first moment she began to live she was free from all sin" (Sermon: "On the Day of the Conception of the Mother of God," 1527).<br><br>She is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin- something exceedingly great. <strong>For God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil.</strong> (Personal {"Little"} Prayer Book, 1522).<br><br><span class="large">Martin Luther on Mary's Perpetual Virginity</span><br><br>Christ, our Savior, was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb . . .

I am supposed to have preached and written that Mary, the mother of God, was not a virgin either before or after the birth of Christ . . .</strong><br>{Pelikan, ibid.,v.45:199 / That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew (1523) }<br><br><strong>Scripture does not say or indicate that she later lost her virginity </strong>. . .<br>When Matthew [1:25] says that Joseph did not know Mary carnally until she had brought forth her son, it does not follow that he knew her subsequently; on the contrary, it means that he never did know her . . . This babble . . . is without justification . . . he has neither noticed nor paid any attention to either Scripture or the common idiom.<br><br>{Pelikan, ibid.,v.45:206,212-3 / That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew (1523) }<br>Editor Jaroslav Pelikan (Lutheran) adds:<br><br>Luther . . . does not even consider the possibility that Mary might have had other children than Jesus. This is consistent with his lifelong acceptance of the idea of the perpetual virginity of Mary.<br>{Pelikan, ibid.,v.22:214-5}<br>". . . she is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin. . . . God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil. . . . God is with her, meaning that all she did or left undone is divine and the action of God in her.

Thus it would seem "morally correct" that Mary as the "wife" of the Holy Spirit is a virgin.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is blasphemy </strong></span>as it suggest that the Holy Spirit is bound by human desires, had sexual relations with Mary to conceive Jesus, then gave his "wife" away to another man to co-habit together.<br><br>Heed the warning of Jesus...if you choose to ignore the plain text of the bible and confine the power of God to human terms then you are wrong.<br><br><blockquote>Matthew 22:29 ESV<br>But Jesus answered them, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God</strong></span>.</blockquote>Mary is not the spouse of the Holy Spirit because she is Joseph's wife as commanded by God.

Doesn't Jesus' cousins have their own mothers?)<br><br><blockquote>Matthew 1:20 ESV<br>But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife</strong></span>, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</blockquote><blockquote>Matthew 1:24-25 ESV<br>When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but knew her not until she had given birth to a son</span></strong>.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Pope Nicholas:<br>And ur exegis of Scripture is flawed. Apologist John Salza uses Greek to explain why.<br><br>Matt. 1:25 - this verse says Joseph knew her "not until ("heos", in Greek)" she bore a son. Some Protestants argue that this proves Joseph had relations with Mary after she bore a son. This is an erroneous reading of the text because "not until" does not mean "did not...until after." "Heos" references the past, never the future. Instead, "not until" she bore a son means "not up to the point that" she bore a son. This confirms that Mary was a virgin when she bore Jesus. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are other texts that prove "not until" means "not up to the point that</span></strong>":<br><br>Matt. 28:29 - I am with you "until the end of the world." This does not mean Jesus is not with us after the end of the world.<br><br>Luke 1:80 - John was in the desert "up to the point of his manifestation to Israel." Not John "was in the desert until after" his manifestation.<br><br>Luke 2:37 - Anna was a widow "up to the point that" she was eighty-four years old. She was not a widow after eighty-four years old.<br><br>Luke 20:43 - Jesus says, "take your seat at my hand until I have made your enemies your footstool." Jesus is not going to require the apostles to sit at His left hand after their enemies are their footstool.<br><br>1 Tim. 4:13 - "up to the point that I come," attend to teaching and preaching. It does not mean do nothing "until after" I come.<br><br>Gen. 8:7 - the raven flew back and forth "up to the point that" [until] the waters dried from the earth. The raven did not start flying after the waters dried.<br><br>Gen. 28:15 - the Lord won't leave Jacob "up to the point that" he does His promise. This does not mean the Lord will leave Jacob afterward.<br><br>Deut. 34:6 - but "up to the point of today" no one knows Moses' burial place. This does not mean that "they did not know place until today."<br><br>2 Sam. 6:23 - Saul's daughter Micah was childless "up to the point" [until] her death. She was not with child after her death.<br><br>1 Macc. 5:54 - not one was slain "up to the point that" they returned in peace. They were not slain after they returned in peace.<br></blockquote>This does not prove anything.  John Salza is shooting himself in the foot, thinking to confuse us with his command of English.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Because "did not...until after" and "not up to the point that" mean exactly the same thing.</span></strong><br><br>Consider...<br><blockquote><br>Matthew 1:25 NIV<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but knew her not until she had given birth to a son</span></strong>.

(direct substitution in line with John Salza's examples - sounds grammatically wrong, but the meaning is correct)<br><br>Note that if we add a comma to break up the sentence it becomes more palatable linguistically speaking.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Joseph knew Mary(sexually) not</span></span>, up to the point that Mary gave birth to a son.<br><br>Now to show how cunning John Salza is....  If we had not compared like and like as shown above, but attempted to correct the grammatical error subconciously.  The sentence would look like this...  i.e adding an additional "did not" by mistake to "not up to the point that" to make it "did not...not up to the point that"<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using wrongly "did not...not up to the point that",</span></strong><br>Joseph <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not </span></strong>have sex with Mary <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not up to the point that </span></strong>Mary had given birth to a son.<br><br>Here there are two "not"s in the same sentence which "sounds" correct, but actually have no real meaning.<br></div>

Thus, according to the Protoevangelium, Joseph, an elderly widower who already had children, was chosen to be her spouse. (This would also explain why Joseph was apparently dead by the time of JesusÂ’ adult ministry, since he does not appear during it in the gospels, and since Mary is entrusted to John, rather than to her husband Joseph, at the crucifixion).<br><br>According to the Protoevangelium, Joseph was required to regard MaryÂ’s vow of virginity with the utmost respect. The gravity of his responsibility as the guardian of a virgin was indicated by the fact that, when she was discovered to be with child, he had to answer to the Temple authorities, who thought him guilty of defiling a virgin of the Lord. Mary was also accused of having forsaken the Lord by breaking her vow. Keeping this in mind, it is an incredible insult to the Blessed Virgin to say that she broke her vow by bearing children other than her Lord and God, who was conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit.</blockquote>On the contrarty, I have shown u the reformers exegis of Matthew 1:25 which many Protestants here are hyping about.<br><br><strong>JOHN CALVIN -- </strong><br><br>"There have been certain STRANGE folk who have wished to suggest from this passage [Matt 1:25] that the Virgin Mary had other children than the Son of God, and that Joseph had then dwelt with her later; BUT WHAT FOLLY THIS IS!<br><br>"For the gospel writer did not wish to record what happened afterwards; he simply wished to make clear Joseph's obedience and to show also that Joseph had been well and truly assured that it was God who had sent his angel to Mary. He had therefore NEVER dwelt with her nor had he shared her company....<br><br>"In the Hebrew manner relatives of any sort are called 'brethren'...It is therefore very ignorant to imagine that Mary had many sons because there are several mentions of Christ's brethren." (John Calvin NT Commentaries Vol. 3, p. 71)<br><br>"And besides this, our Lord Jesus Christ is called the first-born. This is NOT because there was a second or a third, but because the gospel writer is paying regard to the precedence. Scripture speaks thus of naming the first-born whether or no there was any question of the second. Thus we see the intention of the Holy Spirit. This is why to lend ourselves to FOOLISH SUBTLETIES WOULD BE TO ABUSE HOLY SCRIPTURE...." (Sermon on Matthew 1:22-25, published 1562)<br><br>"We have already said in another place that according to the custom of the Hebrews all relatives were called 'brethren.' Still Helvidius [a 4th century heretic] has shown himself to be IGNORANT of this by stating that Mary had many children just because in several places they are spoken of as 'brethren' of Christ." (Commentary on Matthew 13:55)<br><br>"Concerning what has happened since this birth the writer of the gospel SAYS NOTHING...certainly it is a matter about which NO ONE will cause dispute unless he is somewhat curious; on the contrary there never was a man who would contradict this in obstinacy unless he were a PIG-HEADED and FATUOUS [i.e. foolish and stupid] person." (Commentary on Matthew 1:25)<br><br><strong>Thus saith MARTIN LUTHER -- </strong><br><br>"Christ our Savior was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb...This was without the cooperation of a man, AND SHE REMAINED A VIRGIN AFTER THAT." (LUTHER'S WORKS 22, 23)<br><br>[Luther preached the perpetual virginity of Mary throughout his life]<br><br>"...A virgin before the conception and birth, she REMAINED a virgin also AT the birth and AFTER it." (February 2, 1546 Feast of Presentation of Christ in the Temple)<br><br><strong>Didymus the Blind (Church Father)</strong><br><br>"It helps us to understand the terms Â‘first-bornÂ’ and Â‘only-begottenÂ’ when the Evangelist tells that Mary remained a virgin Â‘until she brought forth her first-born sonÂ’ <strong>[Matt. 1:25]; </strong>for neither did Mary, who is to be honored and praised above all others, marry anyone else, nor did she ever become the Mother of anyone else, but even after childbirth she remained always and forever an immaculate virgin" (The Trinity 3:4 [A.D. 386]).<br><br></div>

Mary responds by saying, "How shall this be?" Mary's response demonstrates that she had taken a vow of lifelong virginity by having no intention to have relations with a man. If Mary did not take such a vow of lifelong virginity, her question would make no sense at all!!!</div>
