You can find it in the four gospels. They are Jews no doubt, but note that Jesus is always targeting one group of Jews - the Pharisees and the temple Priests. This is hardly surprising because the Jews in the 1st century are not united.<br><br>Furthermore the Apostle Paul, a Jew himself, did not think highly of the Jewish Laws. So when he triumphed the Jerusalem Council, the faith was offically opened to the gentiles. From then on, the gentiles would control Christianity.<br><br>Jews were hated because they were the Christ killers. Judas was hated most becaue he betrayed Jesus and his name has been linked to Jews ever since.<br><br>Edit: And the casual student of bible should know, Jerusalem was sacked in CE70. So the Jerusalem Church officially disintegrated. Its head, Apostle James, was martyred. The Jewish control on Christianity was over before the turn of the century. So when we say Church Fathers .. they are almost always gentiles!!</div>
