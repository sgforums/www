              <h3>Be Doubtful To Understand, And Believe Because You
              Understand.</h3>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Faith<br></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Belief that does not rest on logical proof or
              material evidence.</span><br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br> Believe</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">To have faith, confidence, or
              trust.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Doubt</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">To be uncertain, disbelieving, or
              skeptical about.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Comprehending the needs,
              feelings, problems, and views of others.</span><br></div>
              <p><br> I had an epiphany. I realized that the words "Believe" and "Doubt"
              has their own stereotypes. How so.? Well...<br> <br> For example, when you ask your really good friend to do something
              for you. Like run an errand.? Have you ever heard that
              "<span style="font-weight: bold;">cynical</span>" side in your head
              whisper to you.? Making you doubt the very friends you
              trusted.?<br> <br> Then later, you brush it aside because you are "<span style="font-weight: bold;">supposed</span>" to <span style="font-weight: bold;">believe</span> your friends because
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">doubting</span> them is
              "<span style="font-weight: bold;">bad</span>". And you force that
              "<span style="font-weight: bold;">cynical</span>" voice inside your
              head to shut up and stop putting "<span style="font-weight: bold;">bad</span>" thoughts and contemplation in your
              mind.?<br> <br> Familiar.? Well that <span style="font-weight: bold;">is</span> the
              stereotype. It is a large misconception that doubting is bad, cause
              we've always been reassured by our loved ones that we should trust
              them.<br> <br> However, it is having <span style="font-weight: bold;">faith</span> that is "<span style="font-weight: bold;">bad</span>" . Cause faith
              is "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Believe</span>" without
              "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Logic</span>". You're essentially
              believing in something <span style="font-weight: bold;">blindly</span>.<br> <br> When you have <span style="font-weight: bold;">faith</span> in the
              ones you love, You're actually not bothering to understand them.
              You're willing to <span style="font-weight: bold;">believe</span> them without <span style="font-weight: bold;">understanding</span> why you believe them, and why they earned your <span style="font-weight: bold;">trust</span>.<br> <br> And it is when you <span style="font-weight: bold;">doubt</span> them, you'll get to truly <span style="font-weight: bold;">understand</span> them. And it is only after
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">understanding</span> where you'll
              get to <span style="font-weight: bold;">believe</span>.<br> <br> And personally, i would <span style="font-weight: bold;">LOVE</span> to have a reason and explanation
              for the "cynical" voice in my head about why i <span style="font-weight: bold;">trust YOU</span>.<br> <br> I wrote this post in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://itsjustnc.blogspot.com">my blog</a> awhile back ^^"</p>

              <p>i'm naive that way, i trust my friends too much.</p>
              <p>i think i'm someone who gives the benefit of the doubt about a person's trustworthiness until i am proven wrong</p>
              <p>and yes, i agree, faith is a belief which doesn't rest on material evidence. which is why Jesus said to doubting Thomas, "<span style="font-family: 'Charis SIL'; line-height: normal;">Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed"</span></p>
              <p>and of course : <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span>faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see</span>.</span></p>
              <p>and yet, I believe that our faith isn't totally without any evidence, that God left every of his children here, abandoned to this world to figure Him out on our own, to find our own way.</p>
