              To me,
              Faith means believing in God's promises. God has made promises through His covenant in Christ. Believing in God;s promises is having faith.
              
              Believing God existence is not enough to be called having faith but believing God's promises is what I believe is the core of faith.
              
              One may even saw God but if he didn't believe in God's promises he doesn't have faith in him.

              <p>Hebrews 11:1 is a DESCRIPTION of faith. Faith [its definition] is actually TRUST.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Paul says in Acts 16:31: "BELIEVE in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved...." He means TRUST in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many intellectually believe in the Lord Jesus Christ but their trust is in their good words for salvation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many do not question the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior but their trust and reliance is not in Him. Their trust and reliance is in the prayer they made to the Savior instead of trusting and relying in the Savior through that prayer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Illustration:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are in the sea of life on a little boat of yours called good works, religion and morality. The sea is unfriendly, the winds are harsh, dark clouds are hovering over the sky.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suddenly…..suddenly a flash of lightning and then a blast of thunder cracked the sky wide open. Heavy rains are now starting to fall from the sky. And you are sinking….sinking real fast. You are desperate and helpless. You look around and you see all other boats are sinking…….all other boats except one…..the Life Boat called Jesus Christ.<br><br><br>You’ve heard about this boat before. You’ve heard it preached before. Like the Devil amongst his fallen angels, you do not question the fact that this is indeed the Life Boat. But it is only now that you see the absolute value, the preciousness and the necessity of this boat…now that you see and realize that you’re boat is sinking and you can’t do anything about it.<br><br><br>And as you stepped off from your sinking craft, as you are in mid-air going down, one of the two will happen. There’s no turning back now: either the Life Boat will sink or the Life Boat will float, carry you and take you safely home. But there is no fear in your heart. Because you know that the Life Boat is God-ordained. It will never sink. It will take you safely home. <br><br><br>And as expected, as you land in the boat, Lo and Behold, the Life Boat does not sink and is taking you safely home. My friend that jump that you took into the boat is what is meant by the word “believes” in the New Testament. It means to trust or rely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take another illustration:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take an illustration of Faith<br><br><br>One time in the city of Rock, torrents of fire poured out from heaven. People here and there were burned to ashes. In the midst of that city there stood a huge Rock standing strong and mighty like Gibraltar. You knew that the Rock would keep you safe.....you believe that it could withstand the onslaught and the downpour of fire from heaven. But here you are with your umbrella on, just standing there doing nothing. Within seconds you were turned into a heap of ashes. You knew about the Rock. You acknowledged and assented to the truth that the Rock could keep you safe.<br><br><br>But you did not trust in it. If you did….you would have had thrown away your umbrella and hid safe under the mighty Rock. Many people intellectually believe that Christ alone is the Savior but have not trusted in Him for salvation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that helps</p>

              <p><br>Not so... I think what you're talking about is blind faith, talking about people who follows blindly regarding things like "Being a Christian makes you rich, being a Chirstian can lead a happy life, etc"</p>
              <p>Faith is knowing there is a God and believe strongly in His existance and what was written in the Bible (its totally different from accepting mindlessly what was being preached)...</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">faith isn't something which you credit to yourself, "oh, i have great faith.", or "that pastor has great faith.". faith is what God says you have, when you start seeing God for who He is.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">faith is knowing that you have a big God, in good or bad times, and that's when God turns and says "You have great faith"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">in the bible, Jesus only said that to a few ppl, notably to the centurion and a woman whose daughter was demon possessed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">These ppl were gentiles, non-jews, who didn't know much about God. But the centurion recognised the authority Jesus holds, that if Jesus pronounced healing, it will be done.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">The woman recognised the goodness Jesus has, that even if it is true that Jesus came down for the jews, He is so good that even "crumbs" are enough for her, and put aside the insecurity of her social status to claim that healing.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">now compare this with the jews who knew God, and claimed that they had faith,notably the people whom Jesus grew up with. They saw Jesus as the carpenter's son, a normal human of no speciality. and Jesus didn't work many miracles among them. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">so ya.. that's what i think faith is.. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">if someone ask me, if God appeared to me, what would I ask for, I said i would ask for faith. but i was enlightened.. faith isn't credited like someone bank in money in my account. but rather, faith is how you see God.</p>

              <p><br>I had an epiphany. I realized that the words "Believe" and "Doubt" has their own stereotypes. How so.? Well...<br><br>For example, when you ask your really good friend to do something for you. Like run an errand.? Have you ever heard that "<span style="font-weight: bold;">cynical</span>" side in your head whisper to you.? Making you doubt the very friends you trusted.?<br><br>Then later, you brush it aside because you are "<span style="font-weight: bold;">supposed</span>" to <span style="font-weight: bold;">believe</span> your friends because <span style="font-weight: bold;">doubting</span> them is "<span style="font-weight: bold;">bad</span>". And you force that "<span style="font-weight: bold;">cynical</span>" voice inside your head to shut up and stop putting "<span style="font-weight: bold;">bad</span>" thoughts and contemplation in your mind.?<br><br>Familiar.? Well that <span style="font-weight: bold;">is</span> the stereotype. It is a large misconception that doubting is bad, cause
              we've always been reassured by our loved ones that we should trust them.<br><br>However, it is having <span style="font-weight: bold;">faith</span> that is "<span style="font-weight: bold;">bad</span>" . Cause faith is "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Believe</span>" without "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Logic</span>". You're essentially believing in something <span style="font-weight: bold;">blindly</span>.<br><br>When you have <span style="font-weight: bold;">faith </span>in the ones you love, You're actually not bothering to understand them. You're willing to <span style="font-weight: bold;">believe </span>them without <span style="font-weight: bold;">understanding </span>why you believe them, and why they earned your <span style="font-weight: bold;">trust</span>.<br><br>And it is when you <span style="font-weight: bold;">doubt </span>them, you'll get to truly <span style="font-weight: bold;">understand </span>them. And it is only after <span style="font-weight: bold;">understanding </span>where you'll get to <span style="font-weight: bold;">believe</span>.<br><br>And personally, i would <span style="font-weight: bold;">LOVE</span> to have a reason and explanation for the "cynical" voice in my head about why i <span style="font-weight: bold;">trust YOU</span>.<br><br>I wrote this post in <a href="http://itsjustnc.blogspot.com">my blog</a> awhile back ^^"</p>
