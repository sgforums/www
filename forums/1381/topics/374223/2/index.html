              <p>mm wrong answer. You're being sarcastic about the 'fairy tale' part, which is exactly what i expected. Your argument against the 'fairytale' label is that your 'life is so much better'. This justification for christianity with "life is so much better" is exactly what im pointing out. Masses taken in by the whole "life is good" notion.</p>
              <p>SPDCP just for your note, the sarcasm was irrelevant. =)</p>
              <p>And Fantagf, good call.</p>

              <p>mm wrong answer. You're being sarcastic about the 'fairy tale'
              part, which is exactly what i expected. Your argument against the
              'fairytale' label is that your 'life is so much better'. This
              justification for christianity with "life is so much better" is
              exactly what im pointing out. Masses taken in by the whole "life is
              good" notion.</p>

              <p>I think many of us have gone through too much of life to have

              <p>I do not know the context of the pastor, who said it and why,
              but if i were to make a guess, it was aimed at christians telling
              people they would not make it cos they have not followed the "right
              methods"..    By placing themselves higher than the
              others who have failed in some areas, they are doing no service to
              the Kingdom.</p>
              <p>God says " I will be their God, and they shall be My

              <p>If you cannot rely on God to make ALL things good, then He is
              God for what?</p>
              <p>Dont even use the phrase "God helps those who helps themselves"
              since Isaiah 25:4 declares, "For You have been a defense for the
              helpless, a defense for the needy in his distress, a refuge from
              the storm, a shade from the heat..."</p>
              <p>God helps those who cannot help themselves... a struggling man
              will cause both rescuer and victim to drown...
