              <p>again it will be best to see what the bible says about this honouring stuff that u mentioned..u make very valid worldly views.</p>
              <p>sorry as i dont remember every word the bible says, just tat maybe it slipped my mind that we can actually have such holy artifects being built to remind people in worships.neither do i remember JC mentions anything about having honoury idols to serve as reminders. what he did said was to keep doing what he done during the last supper with regards to the bread and wine being his body and blood..</p>

              <p>even many jewish traditions n supertitions will conflict with God's words..</p>
              <p>consider again what did God says about divination,spiritism n the likes..does not the translation lies with God alone?so where did the human fortune teller gets his ability to tell the "future" from??bear in mind that mighty as Jesus is,he too does not know when God's planed to end this system..</p>
              <p>is the "future" foretold by that man really beneficial even if it really happens??does it not lure men away from the true God?</p>

              <p>many objects datin way back b4 christian era were marked with crosses with diff designs in many parts of the old world like india,syria,eygpt,persia. use of crosses as a religious symbol outside of christianity is almost universal and usually connected to nature worship.</p>

              <p>ard 3rd century, churches either departed or travestied some doctrines of the christian faith. to increase the prestige of apostate ecclesiastical system,paganism were received into churches apart from regeneration by faith. n were largely permitted to retain pagan signs n symbols.so the T in Tau stayed on as the cross of christ.</p>

              <p><br> For a guy with no formal Christian affiliation you sure take a lot of offence with 'idols'. Instead of shunning the instrument of death which your friend has died upon, you should look upon it which your friend suffered for the sake of a sinner. Perhaps you think your friend a fool? Yes, he is a fool in the eyes of the world. But so was Jesus.</p>
              <p>Simply put you cannot comprehend the scandal of the Cross. A Cross without Christ on it, makes it a mere torture instrument. Christ without His Cross would not have accomplished anything or saved anyone. No death, no resurrection, no salvation for anyone.</p>
              <p>It is true that the cross was found in pagan religions. But such is Jesus Christ that He brings redemptive value to everything, even pagan symbols. He is able to reclaim the fallen and unite all things to Himself. Yet He could only do this by uniting himself with His Cross, and not shunning it. "But it behooves us to glory in the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is our salvation, life, and resurrection; by whom we are saved and delivered" Galatians 6. 14</p>
              <p>For your hatred against paganism, I think you have potential to become Apostle to the Pagans. We shall pray for you.</p>

                  of the holy Cross : grant that we who have acknowledged the mystery of 
                  redemption here on earth, may rejoice in the everlasting fruits thereof in 
                  heaven.  Through Christ our Lord who liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, One God forever and ever, Amen.</p>

              <p><br> For a guy with no formal Christian affiliation you sure take a lot
              of offence with 'idols'. Instead of shunning the instrument of
              death which your friend has died upon, you should look upon it
              which your friend suffered for the sake of a sinner. Perhaps you
              think your friend a fool? Yes, he is a fool in the eyes of the
              world. But so was Jesus.</p>
              <p>Simply put you cannot comprehend the scandal of the Cross. A
              Cross without Christ on it, makes it a mere torture instrument.
              Christ without His Cross would not have accomplished anything or
              saved anyone. No death, no resurrection, no salvation for
              anyone.</p>
              <p>It is true that the cross was found in pagan religions. But such
              is Jesus Christ that He brings redemptive value to everything, even
              pagan symbols. He is able to reclaim the fallen and unite all
              things to Himself. Yet He could only do this by uniting himself
              with His Cross, and not shunning it. "But it behooves us to glory
              in the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is our salvation,
              life, and resurrection; by whom we are saved and delivered"
              Galatians 6. 14</p>
              <p>For your hatred against paganism, I think you have potential to
              become Apostle to the Pagans. We shall pray for you.</p>

              <p>well,i aint takin offense,jus curious why christians are doing something God forbade them to do..well, shunning the object of death to the close fren doesnt mean im takin the fren as a fool,nor can i comprehend how u arrive in this conclusion..</p>
              <p>the big issue is more of jesus' death right?sory if i sound cold or crude,but so long as jesus dies,does it matter if he dies on a cross of due to a 16 wheeler truck?so supposed back then,the way of execution is by stabbing the victim with a knife.will mordern christians wear a knife while catholics wear a knife with jesus on it?doesnt make sense right?</p>
              <p>now we all know pagan stuffs does not originates from God,this is undisputable truth.also,God detest such things.now, jesus dies on a pagan cross.will tat in turn bring value to the cross or will God detest it more?eg, u hate drugs.yet ur own beloved son dies due to drugs.now, will u come to value drugs more now because ur son died due to it or will u detest it more?</p>
              <p>ur last paragraph says i have potential to b an apostle for paganism n u shall pray for me.the way i read it means u r praying that i become an apostle of pagans fast instead of praying for me to accept God..im simpler terms, u r praying for me to be away from God rather den for accepting God??</p>
              <p>n no thanks, i have no intention to b an apostle for the catholic church... =)</p>

              <p>To date you have not proven that we cannot have religious images or statues. Use the Scripture that you love so much. We want to see.</p>
              <p>Do you hate the Cross? Jesus did not hate His Cross, so why are you hating it? Yes, the fact that Jesus did die matters. But it does matter why Jesus had to die on a Cross and not get thrown off the cliffs by madmen. Why must God die die choose to let Jesus die on a cross? All these has happened in real-time, not merely in books. God uses history and current events in the world to work. To make an example out of Him, the most excruciating and shameful form of execution existing at that time, in that locality, was used. Hanging would not suffice. Beheading would not suffice. Poison would not suffice. If Jesus is here making the ultimate sacrifice, surely there must also be the ultimate way of execution. This is the ultimate example, in that context. That makes wearing a 16 foot truck or a knife around my neck irrelevant.</p>
              <p>I already said, Jesus is able to turn bad things into good things. The Cross is no longer a symbol of paganism, but a symbol of faith. It is no longer a symbol of suffering, but a symbol of hope. Jesus is even able to make suffering, a good thing. The Crucifxion is supposed to be a unique event which has changed the history of Man. His destiny is supposed to be changed. Even the way we see things must be changed.</p>
              <p>I said, Apostle TO the Pagans, not Apostle OF the Pagans. I actually meant to praise you for fighting paganism, but since I was taken the wrong way.. Oh well.</p>
              <p>Well neither did St Paul choose to become a Apostle. But I believe you have potential to be God's instrument.</p>
