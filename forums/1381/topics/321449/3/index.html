              <p>Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, while before Thy face I
              humbly kneel, and with burning soul I pray and beseech Thee to fix deep
              in my heart lively sentiments of faith, hope and charity, true
              contrition for my sins, and a firm purpose of amendment; while I
              contemplate with great love and tender pity Thy five wounds, pondering
              over them within me, having in mind the words which David Thy prophet
              said of Thee, my Jesus: "They have pierced my hands and my feet; they

              <p>To date you have not proven that we cannot have religious images
              or statues. Use the Scripture that you love so much. We want to
              see.</p>
              <p>Do you hate the Cross? Jesus did not hate His Cross, so why are
              you hating it? Yes, the fact that Jesus did die matters. But it
              does matter why Jesus had to die on a Cross and not get thrown off
              the cliffs by madmen. Why must God die die choose to let Jesus die
              on a cross? All these has happened in real-time, not merely in
              books. God uses history and current events in the world to work. To
              make an example out of Him, the most excruciating and shameful form
              of execution existing at that time, in that locality, was used.
              Hanging would not suffice. Beheading would not suffice. Poison
              would not suffice. If Jesus is here making the ultimate sacrifice,
              surely there must also be the ultimate way of execution. This is
              the ultimate example, in that context. That makes wearing a 16 foot
              truck or a knife around my neck irrelevant.</p>
              <p>I already said, Jesus is able to turn bad things into good
              things. The Cross is no longer a symbol of paganism, but a symbol
              of faith. It is no longer a symbol of suffering, but a symbol of
              hope. Jesus is even able to make suffering, a good thing. The
              Crucifxion is supposed to be a unique event which has changed the
              history of Man. His destiny is supposed to be changed. Even the way
              we see things must be changed.</p>
              <p>I said, Apostle TO the Pagans, not Apostle OF the Pagans. I
              actually meant to praise you for fighting paganism, but since I was
              taken the wrong way.. Oh well.</p>
              <p>Well neither did St Paul choose to become a Apostle. But I
              believe you have potential to be God's instrument.</p>

              <p>Yes, God forbade the <em>worship</em> <em>of</em> statues, but he did not forbid the <em>religious use</em> of statues. In fact, he even <em>commanded</em> the making of statues <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/oh.png" alt="oh.png"> - that of two GOLD cherubims (angels) for the ark of the covenant. David's plan for the temple given by God also included statues of angels.</p>
              <p>One would realise immediately that God does not have an issue with statues per se. It is only when we treat statues as God himself and start worshipping statues that problems begin.</p>

              <p>Why not ? I don't see how worshipping God in spirit and in truth is impeded in any way by having a statue of say Mary with the infant Jesus in her arms which obviously we can see with our physical eyes.</p>

              <p>it was based on an earlier claim by another forummer that such idolatry was used not as obects of worship but just as a reminder..it was an answer to him/her. the only thing that jesus wanted us to remember him was the evening meal shared by him and his disciples b4 his death.nth was mentioned to the effect of wearing the thing he died on(with or without him on it). the building of the cherubims given as an instruction by Jehovah God was not repeated again. also of interest is that his own throne was described as having covered by wings of cherubs.so it looked like the case of the cherubs were nth more then parts of a furniture.</p>
              <p>even if the cross can be regarded as legal. what about idols of jesus,mary,saints to be venerated???there is but one intercessor jesus. for he himself said so..does not the other idols count in idolatry??</p>

              <p>I have a figurine of Boba Fett (StarWars character) in my house, and quite a big one of Mr M&amp;M. If I go to Greece for a holiday, I might buy a statue of Zeus (chief Greek god) as a souvenir and possibly a Buddha head as a souvenir when I visit Cambodia. Do having all these make me an idol worshipper if I do not attach any religious significance to them ?</p>
              <p>The only downside I can think of having them (other than spending $ buying them) is that I might 'cause scandal' to some 'ultra-sensitive' (and might I add illogical) folks who think a Catholic like myself also worships Boba Fett, Mr M&amp;M, Zeus and Buddha when they see those figurines/statues in my home <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">. It would then be necessary to explain to them that no, a Catholic only worships the one true God (including Jesus who is the 2nd person of that one God). Of course if I start believing that my Boba Fett figurine somehow has divine properties to bring me wealth, then that would not be right.</p>

              <p>Yes, at the last supper, Jesus asked his disciples to "do this in memory of me". But <strong>no where</strong> did Jesus say that the last supper was to be the <em>only</em> way that we should remember him by ! Did Jesus say "do <em>only</em> this in memory of me <em>and nothing else</em>" ? <em>No</em>.

              <p>Does it matter whether the building of the gold cherubim statues was repeated ? Are you implying that Almighty God made a mistake in commanding the casting of the first set of cherubims ? The bottomline is that God does not have an issue with statues per se. </p>
              <p>And for your info, if you have seen a picture of the ark of the covenant, the two gold cherubims stood on top of the ark in full prominent view of everyone. They were certainly not hidden as 'parts of a furniture'.</p>

              <p>I would rather that we settle on the issue of statues and idols first before we move on to other issues you have with Catholic Christian teachings and practices. For now, I would just say that yes, there is but one mediator between God and the human race who is Jesus Christ. But the bible also encourages us to pray for one another, ie: act as intercessors for one another (1 Tim 2:1-6; James 5:16), for the "prayer of a righteous person is very powerful". That's what Catholics do when they speak to Mary and the Saints.</p>

              <p>... I do have to agree that sometimes as we are Chinese, there are lot of Chinese customs that may conflict our religion... for one, fortune tellers that do not invoke the power of spirits or the supernatural. There is one i know that always station at Riverside Point. he only read your fortune based on your chinese name. the characters to be precise and he knows your fortune... is that really a sin?</p>

              <p>Regarding fortune telling, my view is that there are four possibilities. Either 1) the fortune teller is a hoax, 2) the fortune teller does indeed have powers but these are not from the one true God (you may not want to know where the powers come from), 3) the powers are indeed given by the one true God, or 4) the fortune teller has discovered a scientific truth that one's future is somehow correlated with one's chinese name.</p>
              <p>Unless we can be certain of (3) and/or (4), it is best that we avoid fortune telling. Trust in the Lord and you need not have fear of the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>The fact that one can differentiate between a Church and a temple says volumes of the differences.</p>
              <p>God never says we cannot have statues and in fact, ordered to build them as in Nm 21:9 "Moses then made a serpent out of bronze and raised it as a
              standard, and anyone who was bitten by a serpent and looked at the
              bronze serpent survived." Is God ordering idolatry then? This is after Moses interceded for the people. But it was not the statue of bronze serpent that saved the people - it was God!</p>
              <p>To conclude that the presence of statues equal to idolatry is too simplistic.</p>
              <p>For statues of Saints, these are people that are very important to
              the Church. Where else do we honour them but in the Church? In the past
              Churches are build to honour Saints and thus named after them. But what
              made these people Saint in the first place? Are there values that we can learn from these Saints? If you go to the Church and see a statue of St Paul, will you mistaken him as God or would that remind you of the work that he has done for God?</p>
              <p>Looking at the Crucifix today, it seems like a replacment for the serpent made out of bronze....or sort of. Depending on which side you are on, looking at the Crucifix does give different meanings.</p>
              <p>For domonkassyu, it is a warning against idolatry and that idolatry is wrong (we all agreed). For others, it is reminder of Christ's love and sacrifices to save us. Looking the Crucifix alone help comfort many as they feel the presence of God and His love.</p>
              <p>Either way, the Crucifix is there and served the purpose. But certainly did not and will not contribute to idolatry.</p>

              <p><br>What I meant is that they made a point to repudiate teachings which they considered to be untrue. During the Reformation, the Reformers of Old eg Luther, Calvin etc attacked the Catholic dogmas and even each other theologies especially the Eucharist. Even today, the Catholic Church highlights what teachings it considers false and what is true. The CC attacks the SSPX and Traditionalist Catholics positions while holding firm to Nulla Salus Extra Eccelsiam as a basis for Ecumenism. Ergo, the Catholic/EO system allows for a 'infallible' teaching body.</p>
              <p>So my question is when 2 Christian contradict each other, who do they seek recourse to?</p>

              <p>So the difference arise because of separation and one claimed the other is wrong. God gave us the grace of wisdom and it is up to us to discern and decide which is more appropiate and sensible to us.</p>
              <p>Take the example of this thread. If having a crucifix helps us "stay closer" to God in our prayers and constantly remind us of Jesus' sacrifice for us, then it is helping us isnt't it? But should we be afraid to wear, carry or have a crucifix in Church just because some said that this is idolatry (when it is not)? In fact, they still cannot proved it is and a visit to a Catholic Mass will solve "all mysteries".</p>
              <p>So, you can decide which stand you want to take - having statues is idolatry OR it is not. And if God did allow statues (He ordered to build one too)?</p>
              <p>Differences comes about due to the interpretations and some mis-guided ones...This lead to another problem as some highly paid pastors seems untrained at all. All priests and pastors should be properly trained before they are allowed to preach so that there are basis for their teachings.</p>
              <p>It is a fact that on our own, we will not be able to completely understand the bible since they are written at different times and under different conditions. Moreover, there are translations issue etc... the Church is there to help us understand it. This is why there are so many differences from people of different churches (sometimes even within the same denominations or no demoninations).</p>
              <p>Even though arguments will always be there....you can discern and decide which Church is teaching you to love your God and your neighbour (the 2 commandments that Jesus gave us). Not just by lips service but by leading the way and doing it by example. Just giving 10% of the taking to charity does not mean it is responsible and doing what they preach (though any giving to charity is noble) as money is not everything.</p>
              <p>Being a true disciple of Christ is what matters.....which is why Jesus said not all who call me Lord....Lord will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven but only true disciple who listen and act on His words. The question we got to ask oursleves - do we?</p>

              <p>Interestingly enough, Jesus speaks of something similar in the bible (Mat 18:15-18):</p>
              <p><em>"If your brother sins (against you), go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won over your brother. If he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that 'every fact may be established on the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If he refuses to listen to them, tell <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the church</span>. If he refuses to listen even to the church, then treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector. Amen, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."</em></p>
              <p>So it appears that the church is to be the final arbiter of disputes at least in faith and morals, and that the church's judgement will be ratified in heaven. But to do so, the church would have had to be a visible, unified and infallible entity, in existence since the time of the apostles. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to do what Jesus commanded. An 'invisible' body of all believers on earth just would not work at least for the purposes of what Jesus spoke about.</p>
              <p>Is such an entity still around today ? Certainly. The Catholic Church continues to preach the good news to the faithful and has been in existence since the time of the apostles. (We could also sort of include the Eastern Orthodox Churches but that is another story).</p>

              <p><br> going by my argument,u have misunderstood it. when we pray with a

              eyes closed,it is also not a reminder to God.same with the wall and

              <p>but altars erected to house statues as reminders and

              <p>If bible do not remind you of God, what does it remind you of?</p>
              <p>Alters errected in houses or Churches remind one of God and what's wrong with that? Praying in front of them does not equal to praying to the statues as God. It is exactly the same as having a bible in front, or the pastor or the wall etc....</p>
              <p>It is God that we worship and not the item in front.</p>
