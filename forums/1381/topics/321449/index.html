              <p>The cross is one of the holy artifacts of christiandom. many christians claims that they do not worship the cross as they claim they only worship God. certain sects even have altars for statues of "holy" persons and even a statue of the christ.</p>
              <p>they claim such artifects are nothing more than items to remember the persons and christ. usually devotees are found in prayer in front of the artifects or holding the cross while praying. these kinds of worshipping behaviour is also found in all other false religions. only short of incense offered as wave offering to make it look like a chinese temple.</p>
              <p>so if the claim of using the cross as rememberance only is true, if christ died on say an electric chair or died by hanging..will mordern christians use the electric chair or rope as a rememberance instead?</p>

              <p>Actually, incense is also used (but not in joss stick form only)....go and check it out.....</p>
              <p>Some belived that GOD is in the statues they are worshipping while others know that there is only 1 GOD and the statues are just there - God is not in that statue. The statue is not God.</p>
              <p>Just like Christ is not in that statue, Sir Stamford Raffles is not standing along Singapore River but if you see that statue along the river, you remember him right?</p>
              <p>Of course you don't need the statue to remind you....but why is it there? To honour Sir Stamford Raffles? Maybe....</p>
              <p>As for electric chairs, quite interesting and I wonder what happen if Christ died on an electric chair........</p>

              <p>then we'd be wearing elec chairs instead of crosses.</p>
              <p>i think that if you use the catholic version, the focus is on the death, the empty cross to me, focuses that Jesus is already up and running around.</p>
              <p>this is apart from the teachings that forbid worshipping idols.</p>
              <p>some ppl do take it as a reminder, like.. i've got a friend whose parents are catholics, they don't have so much stuff around their house, just a small statue of apostle paul, i think she said that it reminds him of how paul is always eager to reach out to the non believers.</p>
              <p>and he reminds himself to do the same or smth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but some catholics, walk fire enter demon lor, forget that it's just a "reminder".</p>

              <p>and that's why it's hard to explain to non believers to new converts why they should get rid of their old idols. especially if you have like 10 different saints in your house.</p>
              <p> it's better not to have any, and take the absolute stand against idols, christian based or otherwise.</p>
              <p>my catholic friend his family wah lao, got all kinds of idols, got catholic ones, got fu luk shou, got this got that. tsk.. i think it's time to make a decision, and make your stand on biblical grounds?</p>

The Israelites out fought the Amalekites as long as Moses held up his arms, but they started losing whenever he had to lower them.

              <p>God never did tell Moses to hold up his staff during the course of battle against the Amelikites. Yet the Israelies believed so much in the power of the staff that they were winning whenever they see Moses arms held up the staff high and losing whenever Moses lowered his arms/staff.

              <p>Furthermore Moses used the staff to perform his miracles. But it wasn't the staff which did the miracles but it was God. It was just an ordinary walking stick. Yes it turned into snake but did the staff turned itself into snake?. My point is all those statues, rosary are just a tool to help the Catholics perform their miracles like Moses did. A tool of help means if you think you need them use them otherwise you are not obliged to. If a man finds that by praying in front a a statue of Jesus helps him to focus his mind in his prayers by all means pray in front of the statues. If a catholic think his prayers would be answered faster with an intercession by what he thought a holy man by all means ask for intercession.</p>
              <p>You know in the bible angels proclaim that they intercede prayers for God's chosen people. And each of these angels is a saint. I mean that they have no sin. So even when we do not ask for intercession, it will still be given. We never know.</p>
              <p>But personally I never pray for intercession to any saint and I'm a Catholic or perhaps an angel or a saint that I don't know intercedes my prayer for me to God. So not all catholic pray for intercession from saints though those who do are not at fault.</p>
              <p>Christians should not be divided in that there should not be enmity between Christians. If there are differences they are not in the critical issues. They are more into the minor theological interpretation differences.</p>
              <p>Every Christian is a walking miracle bringer. Amen? Whether he or she realizes that or not.</p>

              <p>seriously i didnt know angels are the same as "saints". as far as i know, JC is the medium in which God accepts prayers now.</p>
              <p>like what u say, a man praying in front of a statue of JC is just needing a focus in his mind..it is exactly the same act as the guy in the next street praying in front of a buddha statue isnt it??</p>
