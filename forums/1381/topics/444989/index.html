              <p>The purpose of this is to provide short and quick answers to the common "Why won't God Heal Amputees" collection of questions.</p>
              <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong><br>1. Non-Christians who are sincerely seeking truth, who are looking for objective and solid evidence to believe in the God of the Bible (see especially question 7).<br>2. Christians who are looking to for answers to these questions from the Bible, with the intended purpose of strengthening their own faith.</p>
              <p><strong>This topic is not intended for:</strong><br>People who have already decided beforehand that they do not want to believe in God, regardless of the evidence.  For such people, I cannot help you. God Himself will deal with you.<br><br>Of such people, the Bible already says that they suppress the truth by wickedness. Jesus said this in the Bible "This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil." <em>Examine your own heart. What is the <strong>true </strong>reason you want to reject God? Is it because you have examined and tested the Bible?  Or is it because you are afraid that God will take up your time and make it inconvenient for you to practice what you do in secret, in thought, word and deed?</em></p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>A few biblical guidelines to keep in mind as we go through each question:<br><br>    1. God does not owe us anything.<br>       * If God did not heal anybody, He would still be perfectly good and righteous.<br>       * If we were all in hell right now without any chance of salvation, it would be exactly what we deserve for our sins.<br><br>    2. God is not a vending machine.<br>       * Just because we pray for something, even if we use the words "in Jesus's name" like a magical formula, God does not have to say yes.<br>       * In Jesus's name = Amen = according to the will of God, because Jesus always did the will of the Father.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #1: Why Won't God Heal Amputees?</strong><br><br><em>[Romans 5:12] Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned.<br>[Romans 9:15] I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.</em><br><br>Sickness, death, amputations, wars.  All these started happening after sin entered the world through the disobedience of Adam and Eve.  It is exactly what we deserve.  In no way can God be blamed for a person having an amputation nor can He be blamed for not healing an amputee.<br><br>God is the boss of the universe, and it is His right to do as He wills.  If God heals anybody, it is because He has mercy and gives good things that the person does not deserve. <br><br> The very fact that we are able to breathe, to see and to be on the Internet right now, it is a result of God being merciful.  In no way do we deserve any of these good things.  <br><br>If God were to give us exactly what we deserve, we would all be in hell right now.  But He delays His judgment and gives us time to repent.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #2: Why are there so many starving children in our world?</strong><br><br><em>[Romans 5:12] Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned.<br>[Romans 9:15] I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.</em><br><br>Starvation and lack of food are not God's fault.  God created the world perfect.  In his perfect world, there would never have been any starvation, nor would there be any amputees.  But because of our sins, this is no longer a perfect world. <br><br>The question we should ask is why isn't everybody starving?  The reason anyone has food to eat is because God has had mercy and compassion on him, and has provided good things such as food.  This is why Christians give thanks to God for a meal.  This is why Christians give thanks to God for every good thing, because every good thing is from God.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #3: Why does God demand the death of so many innocent people in the Bible?</strong><br><br><em>[Ezekiel 18:4] For every living soul belongs to Me, the father as well as the son - both alike belong to Me. The soul who sins is the one who will die.<br>[Romans3:10] As it is written: There is no-one righteous, not even one; there is no-one who understands, no-one who seeks God.<br>[Psalm 51:5] Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.</em><br><br>The people were not innocent. They had sinned.  The punishment for sin is death.  Every soul belongs to God, and it is His right to decree when each person will die.  If God decreed that I died tonight, He would still be perfectly good and righteous and just.<br><br>Surprise, surprise.  All have sinned.  Therefore, all deserve to die.  Do you know that you are doomed die?  It is God's right to decide the time and date.  You have until then to repent and believe in Jesus Christ.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #4: Why does the Bible contain so much anti-scientific nonsense?</strong><br><br><em>[2 Peter 3:3] First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation." But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.</em><br><br>The Bible does not contain anti-scientific nonsense.  If you have trouble believing that God created the earth in six days or that there was Noah's flood, I would recommend you take a look at www.creation.com. They have some very scientific articles there written by highly-qualified scientific people.  And if you do not like reading scientific articles, they even have videos that make things easier to understand.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #5: Why is God such a huge proponent of slavery in the Bible?</strong><br><br><em>[Romans 6:20] When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.</em><br><br>Do you know that you are a slave?  Everybody is either a slave to sin or a slave to God. There is no middle ground. Slaves to sin receive death.  Slaves to God receive eternal life.  Sin is a bad master.  God is a good master.<br><br>The references to slavery in the Old Testament clearly demonstrate this concept.  Slaves who had a good master even wanted to stay with their master though they may choose to go away. I have tasted and found that my Master, God, is good.  Therefore I will always want to stay with Him.  It is my desire that you be a slave of the good Master.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #6: Why do bad things happen to good people?</strong><br><br><em>[Ezekiel 18:4] For every living soul belongs to Me, the father as well as the son - both alike belong to Me. The soul who sins is the one who will die.<br>[Romans3:10] As it is written: There is no-one righteous, not even one; there is no-one who understands, no-one who seeks God.<br>[1 Peter 4:12-13] Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed.<br>[1 Peter 3:19] So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.<br>[1 John 5:19] We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.</em><br><br>There are no good people. Bad things happen to bad people.  I am a bad person.  So are you. We may not be bad according to man's standards, but we are bad according to God's standards.  The very fact that we are not in hell right now is evidence of God's mercy.<br><br>This is a fallen world.  God made the world in a perfect state.  But now it is fallen, and it is not God's fault.  It is perfectly reasonable to expect bad things to happen to bad people in a fallen world.<br><br>Guess who has control over this fallen world?  The Bible even describes the devil as the god of this world who blinds the mind of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.  But a time is coming when God will create a new heaven and a new earth.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #7: Why didn't any of Jesus' miracles leave behind any evidence?</strong><br><br><em>[John 20:29] Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</em><br><br>Many people have believed in Jesus Christ without seeing any evidence.  But for those who need to see some evidence, He has been kind enough to leave some evidence in various categories.  The following may be useful for you.  Please study, and then believe, for your own sake.<br><br>Archaeological Evidence:<br><a title="Archaeological Evidence" href="http://www.formerthings.com/israelstele.htm">http://www.formerthings.com/israelstele.htm</a><br><br>300+ Messianic Prophetic Evidence (things written hundreds of years before Jesus was born were fulfilled by Him):<br><a title="Messianic Prophetic Evidence" href="http://lastdayscalendar.tripod.com/messianic_prophecies.htm">http://lastdayscalendar.tripod.com/messianic_prophecies.htm</a><br><br>Scientific Evidence:<br><a title="Scientific Evidence" href="http://www.creation.com">http://www.creation.com</a></p>

              <p>Last Days Prophecies (things written in the Bible that you can see fulfilled with your own eyes today):<br><a title="Last Days Prophetic Evidence" href="http://www.eternal-productions.org/101prophecy.html">http://www.eternal-productions.org/101prophecy.html</a><br><br>Historical Evidence (written by secular historians):<br><a title="Historical Evidence" href="http://www.facingthechallenge.org/outside.php">http://www.facingthechallenge.org/outside.php</a><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #8: How do we explain the fact that Jesus has never appeared to you?</strong><br><br><em>[Exodus 33:20] But you cannot see My face, for no-one may see Me and live.<br>[1 Corinthians 13:12] Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.<br>[Colossians 1:28] We proclaim Him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.<br>[Philippians 3:12]Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.<br>[John 20:31] But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.</em><br><br>One reason is because we are still connected to the sinful flesh.  With the exception of the time between Christ's birth and His return to heaven, nobody has seen Him perfectly, face-to-face.  But the Bible promises that we shall see Jesus face-to-face, when we are glorified after death.  <br><br>For now, we have the Bible to help us believe.  It has been tested and found to be trustworthy.  If you have not read the Bible, and you are thinking that it is too thick to read, you can limit yourself to just one or two books.  I think the book of Romans gives a pretty good description of the big picture of God's salvation plan.  And any one of the four gospel accounts gives a good peek into the life of Jesus on earth.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #9: Why would Jesus want you to eat his body and drink his blood?</strong><br><br><em>[John 6:51] I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.<br>[Luke 22:19] And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body given for you; do this in remembrance of Me."<br>[1 Corinthians 11:26] For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.<br>[2 Corinthians 5:21] God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.</em><br><br>Jesus gave His perfectly lived out life and offered it to us. To His followers, His perfect righteousness is imputed to them.  Jesus gave His blood to atone for our sins.  The followers of Jesus have their sins erased from them, paid for in full.<br><br>God knows how forgetful we are.  Therefore, the Lord's Supper helps us to remember the focal point of the entire Bible - that Jesus Christ gave His blood to atone for our sins and His life that we have His perfect righteousness.<br><br>Whenever we partake of the Lord's Supper, we proclaim to all witnesses that Jesus Christ has done this great deed for our salvation.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Question #10: Why do Christians get divorced at the same rate as non-Christians?</strong><br><br><em>[Matthew 7:13-14] Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.<br>[Matthew 7:7] Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.<br>[Luke 13:23-24] Someone asked Him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them, "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to."</em><br><br>Not everyone who says that they are a Christian is really a Christian.  Just because a person's parents are Christian does not make one a Christian.  Just because it is printed on a person's passport that the religion is "Christian" does not make the person a believer, especially in today's modern world.  Church today has become fashionable.  Pop and rock styles of worship have made church attractive to the young people.  I do not mean to say that a certain style of music is necessarily a bad thing, because the Bible actually encourages lively music to worship God [Psalm 150].<br><br>However, with so many people coming in the front door, it is difficult to tell the sheep from the goats.  Many people go to church for social reasons, or they want to make business contacts.  The preaching of a prosperity gospel results in many people running around who think that Jesus wants to help them strike lottery or wants to give them a BMW.  There are many who miss out on the main point, which is that Jesus Christ came to die for our sins and purchase our life back to God.<br><br>There are many people who want to go to heaven.  But not all of these people want God to be there when they get to heaven.  In other words, they want a heaven without God, probably because they have no desire to obey Him.  But a true Christian will want to please God.  This happens as the Christian continues to receive grace from God to grow in obedience, which makes him or her less likely to get a divorce.<br><br>However, not every person who gets a divorce is a non-Christian.  Christians do go through times of weakness.  Or perhaps the divorcee was a new Christian who had not yet learned to obey God.  Nevertheless, unless we can look into the hearts of people, we are unable to discern who is really a Christian and who is just for show.<br><br>Now, the surveys conducted probably segregated Christians from non-Christians based on what was printed on their passport, which is not a very accurate indicator.  If the surveys conducted had segregated Christians based on whether a person desired to obey Christ, then the results should show that Christians who get divorced are very few indeed.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br><br>1. God is holy, holy, holy.<br>2. You are evil, evil, evil.<br>3. Jesus Christ paid the penalty for your evil and gave you His perfect righteousness<br>4. The evidence that number 3 is true is that, within this lifetime, you repent of your sins and believe in Jesus Christ.<br><br>Still think that you are not evil?  Take the test to find out if this is true.<br><br><strong>The Good Test:</strong><br>http://www.eternal-productions.org/thegoodtestvideo.htm</p>
              <p>I plead with you, together with all the apostles and saints, to come to Christ, urgently.</p>

              <p>yes spot on. there are alot of inconsistencies and paradoxes. starting from evil. evil was from SATAN, but why does an angel like lucifer have evil thought in the first place.free will? if lucifer can betray god, other angels can also betray god isnt it. so lucifer have evil thought and the rest of the angels doesnt? when god created lucifer, doesnt god knows lucifer will become SATAN? if god knows and he created lucifer anyhow, what was god thinking of? can god stop lucifer from becoming SATAN before it happens?  this is just but 1 example of the paradox.</p>
              <p>you will never understand the irrationality of their beliefs, however warped and inconsistent it is.</p>

              The Bible says God is our Creator so you owe God your very life and He will call you to account for how you have lived it. As to preaching the Gospel to others, that is what God wanted us to do so you just have to live with it. Just politely say no if someone approaches you on the street ya?

                      <p>yes spot on. there are alot of inconsistencies and paradoxes.
                      starting from evil. evil was from SATAN, but why does an angel like
                      lucifer have evil thought in the first place.free will? if lucifer
                      can betray god, other angels can also betray god isnt it. so
                      lucifer have evil thought and the rest of the angels doesnt? when
                      god created lucifer, doesnt god knows lucifer will become SATAN? if
                      god knows and he created lucifer anyhow, what was god thinking of?
                      can god stop lucifer from becoming SATAN before it happens? 
                      this is just but 1 example of the paradox.</p>
                      <p>you will never understand the irrationality of their beliefs,
                      however warped and inconsistent it is.</p>

              Jesus is an expereince of the heart (being, soul spirit - it is a knowing). Christianity is of the head (dogma, doctrine and beliefs - it is knowledge). To delude oneself and simply parrot scriptures is utter folly.
              
              Perhaps one needs to understand this - which u seem not to - i m talking about a subjective existential happening - that was what Jesus was.  prattling on about the Bible and always parroting and quoting - it is objectifying something that is infinite and subjective.
              Can what is true be compressed into a box? 
              
              what is rite now can become a wrong the next instant. What is true now may become untrue.

              <p><br>Jesus is an expereince of the heart (being, soul spirit - it is a knowing). Christianity is of the head (dogma, doctrine and beliefs - it is knowledge). To delude oneself and simply parrot scriptures is utter folly. Perhaps one needs to understand this - which u seem not to - i m talking about a subjective existential happening - that was what Jesus was. prattling on about the Bible and always parroting and quoting - it is objectifying something that is infinite and subjective. Can what is true be compressed into a box? what is rite now can become a wrong the next instant. What is true now may become untrue. Hence I uttered what is true, not truth – what is true – is a continuous tense, eg My being rude can end , my being polite can end. However when I m labelled as stupid, clever or smart – i am already reduced into a thing, a labelled product is finished. Hence, this word ’’being’’ may appear like another concept – on closer srutiny it is akin to a river flowing (rivering). it is existential and always moving and yet not moving (it is a paradoxical phenomenon).

              <p>You don't seem to know much about Christianity, only seeking to reinterpret it according to your existentialist worldview. Jesus quoted Scriptures to His hearers. Was He guilty of parrotting Scriptures? Absolutely not. And if Jesus, who is Truth, can be personified in human flesh, then why can't truth be clearly communicated in words, limited as words may be? Again I see no good reason for your false dichotomy. One can talk about love AND be loving at the same time. One can claim the label of Christian AND be-ing a Christian at the same time. A Christian is to love God with all his heart, soul and mind. God does not compartmentalise the Christian, so why should you?</p>

               I am not agreeing or disagreeing with what Jesus was - it could have been true and assuming that it was true,  he shared the truth of his experience thru his being ...?. He had a knowing!
                   It can be likened to this predicament - eg. someone tells me that a flower near my house is beautiful. He/she expereienced it, and now telling me that it is so. I can believe it, but till I have really experienced it, it means nothing. If I go around telling someone that this particular flower is beautiful without existentially experincing it, i must be a hypocrite lah. At the most, it is psychological and socially possible. 
                   
                  As for God's existence? No one knows, and if there is a God - who created God.

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Question #1: Why Won't God Heal Amputees?</strong><br> <br> <em>[Romans 5:12] Therefore, just as sin entered the world through
                                      one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all
                                      men, because all sinned.<br> [Romans 9:15] I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will
                                      have compassion on whom I have compassion.</em><br> <br> Sickness, death, amputations, wars.  All these started
                                      happening after sin entered the world through the disobedience of
                                      Adam and Eve.  It is exactly what we deserve.  In no way
                                      can God be blamed for a person having an amputation nor can He be
                                      blamed for not healing an amputee.<br> <br> God is the boss of the universe, and it is His right to do as He
                                      wills.  If God heals anybody, it is because He has mercy and
                                      gives good things that the person does not deserve.<br> <br>  The very fact that we are able to breathe, to see and to be
                                      on the Internet right now, it is a result of God being
                                      merciful.  In no way do we deserve any of these good
                                      things. <br> <br> If God were to give us exactly what we deserve, we would all be in
                                      hell right now.  But He delays His judgment and gives us time
                                      to repent.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This reply misses the point of the "God hates amputees" challenge by quite some distance. A more complete way of framing the challenge is this: If God can and does heal people of various ailments such as cancer, leprosy or even death, why doesn't he also heal amputees?</p>
              <p>There are two possible answers:</p>
              <p>1. God <strong>does</strong> heal people of other ailments, but for some reason has no interest in restoring the limbs of amputees. Does he discriminate against them?</p>
              <p>2. God <strong>does not</strong> heal people of other ailments. E.g. when someone recovers from cancer, it may be due to the administering of medical treatment, misdiagnosis in the first place, or simply fakery. There is less ambiguity about amputees (it's harder to fake a missing limb), hence there are no claims of a regrowth of limbs through prayer.</p>
              <p>Maybe there's a third possible answer, but you'll have to enlighten me on that. Otherwise, you have to concede either (1) or (2) to solve the challenge.</p>
