              <p>I hope you realize that the doctrine of original sin is theologically ambiguous. In fact, noted Christian apologist William Lane Craig believes that when infants or small children die, they go to heaven. He uses it to justify the God-sanctioned genocide of the Canaanites.</p>
              <p>But if you truly believe in Original Sin, you have to explain whether it is fair and just that someone who has never heard of Christianity is condemned to eternal hell for not believing in Jesus.</p>
              <p>I also think the parent-child analogy is fraught with flaws. Go ask any parent if they would be willing to condemn their children to eternal punishment for one bad decision. Maybe a parent will accept a life in prisonment, or even the forfeiture of life itself, for a grievous crime commited by the child. But eternal hell just because, say, your child chose Buddhism (and a life of kindness)? Come on.</p>

              <p>Most falls in love with the god that they wanna worship... very much akin to people choosing the wrong partner for a relationship.</p>
              <p>Being zealous, jealous for the minute reasons. Define what is your subjective "true love" and test it if it can flow from self. With love, comes patience. With patience, comes deliberate slowness in acting out of anger. </p>
              <p>Sadly... Heaven inevitably is for a select few chosen ones... Any Christian who denies this, is bound to contradict self. What God is looking for are those who has certain particular traits. Love is paramount whereas faith is the motivating factor. When God's love does not match one's subjective definition of it, faith suffers.... consequently negatively affecting those traits. </p>

              <p>The doctrine of original sin is NOT theologically ambiguous. In fact, even an atheist like Richard Bozarth is clear about what it is! He wrote, <em>"Christianity has fought, still fights, and will continue to fight science to the desperate end over evolution, because evolution destroys utterly and finally the very reason Jesus’ earthly life was supposedly made necessary. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Destroy Adam and Eve and the original sin</span></strong>, and in the rubble you will find the sorry remains of the Son of God. If Jesus was not the redeemer who died for our sins, and this is what evolution means, then Christianity is nothing."</em></p>
              <p>See also <a href="http://creation.com/alexander-original-sin">http://creation.com/alexander-original-sin</a></p>
              <p>It is misleading to claim that William Lane Craig justified the "genocide" of the Canaanites with the reason that infants go to heaven when they die. He did not do this. In fact, he justified it by saying that God sanctioned a total extermination of the Canaanites by the Israelites because of their depravity. Here you have 400 years of Canaanite children being born and brought up just as sinful as their fathers, something the Bible critic overlooks. And for those Bible critics who are "genuinely" concerned for these infants and young children, Christian apologists reply that they will go to heaven to be with God.</p>

              Why lah, everybody seems to b ullshitting, heaven  and hell are existential expereinces. It was never geographical and can never be found. it is a consequence of one's choices and the feeling that shadows that choices.
              Hell is when one is all tensed up and utterly worried and expereinces anguish and anxiety. one who is simply abiding to what is or what is not and relaxing to without fighting .... is having a heavenly experience.
              Beware of those who simply parrot scriptures and quotes sources and worse is that of cutting and pasting. it is deception!

              <p>Your 'test' is still trying to find meaning and purpose for your own existence. If you can truly be... and be without 'being'. So it just depends on how high or how low the parameters you set yourself to be.</p>

              Muse over this
               This is meant for those who are on the journey of â€™â€™discoveringâ€™â€™/ â€™â€™recognisingâ€™â€™ the source of oneâ€™s creation (heaven n hell, resurrection and or so on so forth â€“ which are merely labels n concepts). This entails being a lion, being courageous, willingness to question and examining of beliefs and being open to finding out. This entails seeing, one cannot conclude n how to conclude that which is an existential happening (not to be confused with dictionary meaning).
              
              It is never meant for followers. Following entails being sheep, cos those who follow without questionig or exploring are simply too weak-minded and there is no journeying at all, simply parroting and quoting â€¦. This simply entails looking for â€¦ and one can only look for something already concluded, definitions, concepts and â€¦ and look for it in something to reaffirm and repeat â€¦. 
              
              Who is being the â€™â€™lionâ€™â€™ or who is being the â€™â€™sheepâ€™â€™ â€“ oneâ€™s intuitve heart never lies.
              
              Ps â€“ when one gets offended or feels threatend about oneâ€™s beliefs/traditions, then jolly  know this, one is  simply identifying with â€¦ to ''prop'' oneself up. Oneâ€™s sense of self is threatened and hence the straw-cluthcing stance of being defensive.

              <p>Well, unless you are omniscient, you will never ever truly know. Even if you continue on with your discoveries and 'recognising' the 'Truth'. we can only grasp such a thread, and words cannot even describe such an experience.</p>
              <p>Like an ameoba pondering a whale.</p>
              <p>It takes as much faith in yourself in believing what you 'experience' to percieve what 'IS' and what 'Is Not' . Therefore there will forever be 'threats' to one's 'belief', because either you are one with the universe already, or just a dense rock.</p>
              <p>Hence if words cannot explain and the mind cannot comprehend, then it is not wrong to pursue one 'belief' and from there on begin such a journey like how u just gave the analogy of the Lion and the Sheep when journing through 'discovery' and 'recognising'.</p>

              What is true does not need maintenance, what is untrue nees to be maintained. What is a belief, where does it come from. it is repeating what could have been true for someone or borrow from books, scriptures or .... to reaffirm one's position.
               till that is knowinly expereinced by oneself - it amounts to nothing. to quote, to repeat is lying to oneself! it belies this prejudice and bigotry and when that is present, nothing matters except bleating away like sheep!

              That which is pyschological is not eternal (herenow, existential) and that which is psychological is time-bound ( past n future). The thread is entitled eternal hope. Hope is futurizing. Perhaps what was meant was everlasting (which is time-bound) Intellect is acquired thru learning from outside of oneself thru books, parents, schools or theology/ideology and it bound to react to what is. That which transcends psychology is spirit soul or god or whatever one feels resonates with oneself. It is a knowing, a surrender (not to a person or a theology or ..) to what is; an acceptance of what is. When one is being kind, being loving, being , a process, in being so one is already emobodying the qualities so very much espoused in religion or what-have-you. This person has transcended the duality of what is good, what is ugly or ... (the latter are divisive and a consequence of conditioning or ...)
              
              Jesus was spiritual. How? His being kind, his being .... So it was with Buddha, Krisha and so many others, too numerous to mention here. Theirs was a spiritual experience shared with human beings. Of course, those around them were open and willing to surrender. The mistake or the erroneous assumption is that it was a surrender to a person or ... No it is in the disappearnce of one 'self" that the ''merger'' happened or happens. Buddha, Jesus embody the nameless, the formless!
              
              My standing in a garage does not make me a car nor does my standing in a church or t emple make me spiritual, in the latter it may make me religious, spirituality all said and done is transcendence of all creeds, dogmas, theology, ideology and it is thru the unlearningof one 'self' that it may happen or at least an understanding , a knowing. It is the synthesis of poralities that one is free - eg love n hate (actually it is fear!) are not two but non-dual. Human mind divides and chooses and in choosing the split happens within. Hot and cold are not two but one. One can choose and deny or keep the other at bay. How long? It is mere suppression and it woud surface. It is the nature of existence! Religion is learning .... and spiritual is unlearning .... and hence the word spirit! Religion is collective and spirituality is individual. Truth is collective hence the talking about it and what is true is an individual experience and a partaking of what unfolds. 
              
              
              When one assumes that something/someone higher is above us - it is negating oneself, it is disrespecting oneself. It is bondage, it is servitude. It has come about cos of the utter folly of man creating god in his own image (man'' image of ...).
              
              Lest it is misconstrued - i dont believe or disbelieve and it matters that one is willing to question oneself and be open to possibilites. However and whatever it is unwise to blindly imbibe or follow ....
              
              PS - Take the eg of prayer, if god created man in his own image, then why pray and ask for this and that - is this not in other words saying that there is something that is lacking in the process of creating ...
              why is this transpiring - cos man has created god according to his own prejudices n bigotry. hence, the labelling, the excluding, the ...
              
              Prayer if and when it is of gratitude - is being thanful for all that is transpiring and that includes the excluded ....

              <p>So what if Jesus did experience Heaven and Hell. And what if Buddha did experiences re-incarnation too ?</p>
              <p>Since we are open to possiblities, maybe perhaps it is possible that we are wrong ?</p>
              <p>Now neither of us have even attained such spirituality and such 'experience', who are we hence to claim that which is 'true' and that what we know is 'truth ? I know I haven't. Now if you have already attained such an experience, and 'spirituality', then your mission on this earth is already complete. Hence you should be travelling down the path of those Enlightened before us. The long hard road, not to mention a good decent amount of followers too.</p>
              <p>Now consider that what they experienced is real, should we not therefore follow.. or attempt to comprehend and contemplate their 'being' ?</p>
              <p>While reading the Bible or Experiencing Christianity does not make one Jesus, it at least is a path towards who and what Jesus 'Is'and attempt his 'experience'.</p>
              <p>Therefore, What is Hot.. is Hot. What is Cold is Cold. Even if they are words, and what u feel is cold is hot and what is hot is cold, it still does not negate the fact that you 'feel' pain. Whether it is 'Hot' or 'Cold'.</p>
              <p>While I am open to your possibilties, you therefore must also be open to the possibilities of Jesus's 'experience' being 'true'. But there is always a problem in what we 'experience' may not even be 'true', due to our own limited intellect. While I do agree that we not blindly follow, but following is also not wrong either.</p>

              I am open to anything that resonates of what is true, hence the stance of questioning and expereincing instead of simpy repeating and quoting something of the past that could have been true or untrue. Existence never repeats itself Existence is allergic to any sort of dogmas, doctrines or idelogies
              
              however it is funny and ironical is that why organized religion must be the mediator. One can find a Christian mind, A Buddhist Mind , can one find a christian heart, a Buddhsit heart ..... 
              
              One can still commune with ''god'' or even meditate in a toilet! why the need for a mediator - unless it is assumed one is  non-thinking and too stupid that I need someone to guide me.
              
              Ps - Truth here is not as defined in the dictionary, truth here is that which can only be partaken of existentially, not boxed in
