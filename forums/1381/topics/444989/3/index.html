              Using logic of the mind and looking for logic in something that the human mind cannot grasp is fighting with what is not.

               Transformation happens from the inner knowing. Change always from the outside. Change is akin to pruning the leaves and branches of a tree, it is superficial. Transformation is examining the roots and making the change from within. It has depth and there is a difference.
              
              
              These are not absolutes, these are relative and not literal and methaphorical and meant for those who are keen and earnest to know. It is meant to introspect.

              <p>Truth is truth whether you know or agree with it. The law of gravity holds regardless of your view about it. But how can you talk about truth when you already say that it is relative? The moment you think you found it you will have to disown it because you have no rational basis for believing in relative truths.</p>
              <p>Harping about transformation and change can be mere semantics since both can be used interchangeably. Prison life has transformed him is also the same things as saying that he is a changed person after having been in prison.</p>

              <p>1. Let's put the biblical accounts aside. The reliability of the Bible is a separate issue that I don't want to go into here. We should just focus on modern-day accounts of God-assisted healing.</p>
              <p>2. You need to figure out whether you think God takes an <strong>active</strong> hand today in healing the sick and wounded. Does he (a) sit back and let medical science do its thing, or does he (b) actively pick and choose people he wants to heal?</p>
              <p>3. If your answer is (a), then we don't have to bother with praying.</p>
              <p>4. If your answer is (b), then you have a whole host of challenges. But relevant to the "God heals amputees" challenge is this: you have to explain why he allows a child's severed finger to work again, or why he cures someone's mother of cancer, and <strong>yet</strong> he doesn't let a person's amputed limb regrow.</p>

              <p>Why just focus on modern day accounts of healing? Why ignore historical records?</p>
              <p>Why the fallacy of false dilemma? Why can't God uses both direct intervention and indirect intervention through medical science to accomplish healing?</p>

              By what logic do you employ to say that just because we are created in God's image it means prayer is redundant? We are free willed beings and God delights in our prayers and supplications to Him. It is not telling God what to do at all. Your idea of prayer is totally contrary to Scripture.

              The flower is beautiful, whether or not you experience it or believe it. 
              How do u know? It is not real for u, u have not expereinced it, then u are simply parroting what has been told to u. It is real for u cos u have made it a belief - it is real in ur mind only
              
               The carrot cake is fantastic, whether or not your friend tasted it. The same here - how do u know, have u had an experience of it, it seems u are parroting.
              
              Has anyone found hell or heaven - it seems like a fiction lah.  it not geographical in nature, - it is consequence of unwise/wise choices and the ''results'' in a state of mind. Ways of living!
              
              Substituting knowledge with beleifs is simply accumulation of what is acquired from outside of oneself. God is one's inner being - which entails going in and diving into the depths of one's being. No preist, no pastor, no book, is needed. Dialogue is possible only between two persons, and God is not a person but a presence â€“ beauty,peace joy and ...,  can one find one's inner being? One can be kind or one is being kind? 
              
              Hence I say this - when one is being present to one's being ..., one is being present to another's being ... - a communion (two emptinesses, can it be counted as two?) However, when one is present to one's self one can only be present to another's self (this are two persons cannot become ''emptinesses'')
              
              PS - the flower and the carrot cake are methaphors not to be interpreted in its literal sense lah.
              A belief is always a concept. egs God, a heaven hell, theology or a certain system of ideas. Belief is mind. Faith is of the ''heart''. Belief is borrowed, faith is one's own experience. Eg One can have faith in the trees. can one believe in the trees? Faith is existential, experiential phenomena (happening and yet not happening - a paradox cos it is a herenow phenomenon) Faith is expereincing ''God'' as it happens!

              <p>Lots of people pray for their illnesses to be healed. Presumably, some amputees pray to regain the function of their limbs as well. Why is it that plenty of people talk about being cured of cancers through divine intervention, or even coming back from the dead through the "grace" of God, but amputees never have their limbs regrown? Why cancer or even HIV victims? Why not amputees? You've never addressed this question.</p>
              <p>As for the invitation to church, I've been to quite a number in my life. I'm primarily interested in understanding and sharing the truth, but a church is an unfair and unequal environment -- where I'd be forced to stand and passively listen to a message, and where open conversation is difficult. Instead, to my Christian friends who make the same invitation, I usually propose a one-on-one or small group discussion, even if all the others are Christians.</p>

              I think he meant that to pray is to find fault with God because it means God's creation is lacking. But such an idea of prayer is completely foreign to the Bible.

              Looking in as in saying that there is a divine spark in us? Sorry the Bible does not teach this. The Bible says we are dead in sin. Sin is in us. But when we come to God through Christ, the Holy Spirit is given to us and indwells us.

              It seems that your worldview is one that is fully absorbed with yourself. This is real for you, that is real for you. This is real for me, that is real for me. What about the question about whether a thing is real, regardless of you or me? You have boxed reality to only that which you have experienced.
