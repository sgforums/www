              Hi fugazzi
              
              Perhaps the following book containing Buddhist wisdom can answer your puzzle.
              
              Awareness bound and unbound: Buddhist Essays by David Loy, Sunypress.
              
              The above title is a good read highly recommended for both Buddhists and non-buddhists.
              
              For non-buddhists, your attention are directed, particularly, to the last two chapters 1) The West against the rest? : a Buddhist response to the clash of civilisations, and 2) Terrorism as Religion: On identity crisis of secularism.

              <p>You are merely engaging in special pleading by saying everybody is bullshitting except you. From where do you get your ideas about heaven and hell, that they are mere existential subjective experiences (feelings) with no objective reality? No one is saying that heaven or hell are literal geographical physical places on earth where you can find them. Your notions of heaven and hell is bereft of Scriptural support. And why beware of the Scriptures and not of you? You have cited no sources except that of your own existential musings. Why should anyone trust what you say?</p>

If you are having an experience, that experience is personal to holder. Whatever feelings you are feeling is yours, not anyone's else.

              <p>That which is pyschological is not eternal (herenow, existential) and that which is psychological is time-bound ( past n future). The thread is entitled eternal hope. Hope is futurizing. Perhaps what was meant was everlasting (which is time-bound) Intellect is acquired thru learning from outside of oneself thru books, parents, schools or theology/ideology and it bound to react to what is. That which transcends psychology is spirit soul or god or whatever one feels resonates with oneself. It is a knowing, a surrender (not to a person or a theology or ..) to what is; an acceptance of what is. When one is being kind, being loving, being , a process, in being so one is already emobodying the qualities so very much espoused in religion or what-have-you. This person has transcended the duality of what is good, what is ugly or … (the latter are divisive and a consequence of conditioning or &amp;#8230<img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"></p>
              <p>Jesus was spiritual. How? His being kind, his being …. So it was with Buddha, Krisha and so many others, too numerous to mention here. Theirs was a spiritual experience shared with human beings. Of course, those around them were open and willing to surrender. The mistake or the erroneous assumption is that it was a surrender to a person or … No it is in the disappearnce of one ‘self” that the ’’merger’’ happened or happens. Buddha, Jesus embody the nameless, the formless!</p>
              <p>My standing in a garage does not make me a car nor does my standing in a church or t emple make me spiritual, in the latter it may make me religious, spirituality all said and done is transcendence of all creeds, dogmas, theology, ideology and it is thru the unlearningof one ‘self’ that it may happen or at least an understanding , a knowing. It is the synthesis of poralities that one is free – eg love n hate (actually it is fear!) are not two but non-dual. Human mind divides and chooses and in choosing the split happens within. Hot and cold are not two but one. One can choose and deny or keep the other at bay. How long? It is mere suppression and it woud surface. It is the nature of existence! Religion is learning …. and spiritual is unlearning …. and hence the word spirit! Religion is collective and spirituality is individual. Truth is collective hence the talking about it and what is true is an individual experience and a partaking of what unfolds.</p>
              <p>When one assumes that something/someone higher is above us – it is negating oneself, it is disrespecting oneself. It is bondage, it is servitude. It has come about cos of the utter folly of man creating god in his own image (man’’ image of &amp;#8230<img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink">.</p>
              <p>Lest it is misconstrued – i dont believe or disbelieve and it matters that one is willing to question oneself and be open to possibilites. However and whatever it is unwise to blindly imbibe or follow ….</p>
              <p>PS – Take the eg of prayer, if god created man in his own image, then why pray and ask for this and that – is this not in other words saying that there is something that is lacking in the process of creating …<br>why is this transpiring – cos man has created god according to his own prejudices n bigotry. hence, the labelling, the excluding, the …</p>

              <p>When I look beneath the multitude of often confusing words you post that confounds the reader more than anything, I think I can nail down your ideology or religion to what I call the "ing-ism". All one needs to do is to add "ing" to the words you use! For example, to know, love, talk, eat, think, feel, etc is inferior to knowING, lovING, talkING, eatING, thinkING, feelING etc. Not only that, there is this attitude of not committing to anything, as in, neither believe nor disbelieving, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, not this not that etc.</p>
              <p>You keep speaking out against blindly following dogma, that is all well and fine. No one should blindly follow what anyone says. But the problem is that you simply conclude that all religious people are merely blindly following religious leaders or books. It seems that for you, unless someone agrees with your existentialist worldview musings, then he must be a blind religious follower parroting sacred Scriptures. In short, for you there is no such thing as a religious person who has examined his own religious beliefs.</p>

              <p>What do you mean when you said that it is probably true that God created man in His image? Are you affirming the Bible's teaching on this, or are you having your own private musings on this that has nothing to do with the Bible's teaching except for using the words of the Bible?</p>
              <p>What do you mean by Christians creating God in their own image? Please elaborate and provide some support.</p>
              <p>Every belief that is questioned or challenged will always be met with a variety of responses depending on the person. A seasoned defender of the faith will not be easily fazed by the typical charges of the village atheist or Bible critic but a novice may pound on the panic button. Everyone needs to defend his beliefs at one time or another. Even YOU do that too when it comes to your existentialist view of life. If your belief is not worth defending then it is not worth believing.</p>
              <p>BTW, is it necessary to flare up or be upset when one's beliefs are being questioned or challenged? The answer is NO. The response need not be anger. One can just as well be motivated to dig deeper and find out the answers and emerge from that inquiry more rooted in his faith.</p>
              <p>A person who has NO beliefs, disbeliefs etc does NOT exist in reality. You show me such a person and I will show you what his beliefs are in less than 5 minutes after I have cross-examined him. Either that or this person is lying.</p>
