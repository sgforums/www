              I posted about debate and it was premised on this stance - and it was meant for those who are on the journey of ''discovering''/ ''recognising'' the source of one's creation. That entails being a lion, being courageous, willingness to question and examining of beliefs and being open to finding out. This entail seeing, one cannot conclude n how to conclude that which is an existential happening (not to be confused with dictionary meaning).
              
              It was never meant for followers. Following entails being sheep, cos those who follow without questionig or exploring are simply too weak-minded and there is no journeying at all, simply parroting and quoting .... This simply entails looking for ... and one can only look for something already concluded, definitions, concepts and  ... and look for it in something to reaffirm and repeat .... 
              
              Who is being the ''lion'' or who is being the ''sheep'' - one's intuitve heart never lies.

              <p>Many times what happens is that people here ASSERT that I am wrong, but did not show where the flawed reasoning is. And why did I cling to my beliefs? Simply because the contradictions weren't proven at all. I believe I have confronted and addressed the so-called contradictions pointed out by Tcmc and some others.</p>
              <p>For what it's worth I don't think your English level is low, but I certaintly don't think Fuzzi's English level is so high that only the likes of him can know what is being said and the rest of us are awestruck by his cheemness. Not at all.</p>
              <p>Fuzzi hardly made any point that challenges my Christian beliefs, whereas I have made many points that undermine his, to the extent that he even admits holding to contradictions and see it as a virtue! That's bizarre to me.  And no, I don't think I am bashing him, more of bashing (demolishing) his views. And he sometimes simply parrots the same things from other threads and completely sidesteps the criticisms directed at his views.</p>

              <p>God does not owe us anything? Very wrong. God owe us everything. If God did not create us, we will not be in this state. Every day, people have to worry about food, if not we will go hungry and starve to death. Why food is not easily available to us, we have to work for it. There are many many more but food is the basic one that God owe us. Better still if he either did not create humans at all or created humans who do not need to eat.</p>
              <p>God will not owe us anything if he did not create us. Just like parents give birth to their children. The responsible parents will provide food without conditions and bring up the children. Look at the Africans, they were starved to death in millions.</p>

              Indeed God does not owe us anything at all. We are in this state ie fallen and cursed world, because of man's sin. Fact is, God has entrusted man with the stewardship of the whole earth, but it is again the sinful heart of man that has largely resulted in exploitation and unequal distribution of wealth and resources.

              Since God does not owe us anything at at, that already excludes everything. But then I would not expect an atheist troll like you to be able to figure that out. BTW, without God there will be no humans.
