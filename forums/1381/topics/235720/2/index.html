It covers sins on credit for the future sacrifice of Christ but it does not take away sins. The Lamb of God when He came takes it away.<br><br>Heb 10:4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.<br><br>Heb 10:11 And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.<br><br>This way God is able to "wink" at sins done in the previous ages. However when Christ came to sacrifice Himself, He took all of it away. The sin question was settled at the cross.<br><br></div>
