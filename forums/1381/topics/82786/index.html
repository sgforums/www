            <div class='col-md body'>Nope Baptism does not save u in the Chrisitian context. It is not necessary for salvation to come to you. Salavtion happens for you once you acknowledge your sins and asked what Jesus had done and ask Him to come into your life.<br><br>Baptism is a command from God and is just an outward expression of our faith. Even if you receive Christ today and dies tomorrow without baptism, you will still have salvation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Baptism is one of the two sacraments in most of the Protestant churches. The other being the Lord's Supper also known as Holy Communion or Eucharist.<br><br>It is an outward sign of an inward grace of what Christ has already completed. It symbolises the death of old self and new life in the risen Christ. It is a public declaration of an invisible Christian faith. It is also an act of obedience to Christ since He being the Son of God dwent thru the waters of baptism so as to be identified with common sinners alike.<br><br>It should NOT be seen as a magical ritual to remove or forgive our sins because the scripture makes it plain to all that we are cleansed solely by the blood of the Lamb without blemish- Jesus's Blood shed on the cross. Baptism thus is the external sign of what happens internally - repentance,removal and washing of sins.So baptism is one of the two ways Christians publicly celebrate,observe and remember the wonderful salvation Christ came to bring and openly acknowledges Him in our lives.<br><br>For more detailed info, pse<br><br><a href="http://www.bebaptized.org/" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE</a><br><br>note: Please resd site with biblical discernment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christians have always interpreted the Bible literally when it declares, "Baptism . . . now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 3:21; cf. Acts 2:38, 22:16, Rom. 6:3Â–4, Col. 2:11Â–12).<br><br>Thus the early Church Fathers wrote in the Nicene Creed (A.D. 381), "We believe in one baptism for the forgiveness of sins."<br><br>And the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: "The Lord himself affirms that baptism is necessary for salvation [John 3:5]. . . . Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament [Mark 16:16]" (CCC 1257).<br><br>The Christian belief that baptism is necessary for salvation is so unshakable that even the Protestant Martin Luther affirmed the necessity of baptism. He wrote: "Baptism is no human plaything but is instituted by God himself. Moreover, it is solemnly and strictly commanded that we must be baptized or we shall not be saved. We are not to regard it as an indifferent matter, then, like putting on a new red coat. It is of the greatest importance that we regard baptism as excellent, glorious, and exalted" (Large Catechism 4:6).<br><br>Yet Christians have also always realized that the necessity of water baptism is a normative rather than an absolute necessity. There are exceptions to water baptism: It is possible to be saved through "baptism of blood," martyrdom for Christ, or through "baptism of desire", that is, a conscious or even unconscious desire for baptism.<br><br>Thus the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: "Those who die for the faith, those who are catechumens, and all those who, without knowing of the Church but acting under the inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, are saved even if they have not been baptized" (CCC 1281; the salvation of unbaptized infants is also possible under this system; cf. CCC 1260Â–1, 1283).<br></div>
