            <div class='col-md body'>1. There was a church that had problems with outsiders parking in its parking lots, so they put up a sign:<br><br>CHURCH CAR PARK - FOR MEMBERS ONLY Trespassers will be baptized!<br><br>2. "No God - No Peace. Know God - Know Peace."<br><br>3. "Free Trip to Heaven. Details Inside!"<br><br>4. "Try our Sundays. They are better than Baskin Robbins."<br><br>5. "Searching for a new look? Have your faith lifted here!"<br><br>6. An ad for one Church has a picture of two hands holding stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments are inscribed and a headline that reads, "For  fast, fast, fast relief, take two tablets."<br><br>7. When the restaurant next to a Church put out a big sign with red<br>letters that said, "Open Sundays," the church reciprocated with its own  message: We are open on Sundays, too."<br><br>8.  "Fight truth decay -- study the Bible daily."<br><br>9   "Dusty Bibles lead to Dirty Lives"<br><br>10. "Come work for the Lord. The work is hard, the hours are long and the pay is low. But the retirement benefits are out of this world."<br><br>11. "Do not wait for the hearse to take you to church."<br><br>12.  "If you're headed in the wrong direction, God allows U-turns."<br><br>13. "If you don't like the way you were born, try being born again."<br><br>14. "Looking at the way some people live, they ought to obtain eternal fire insurance soon."<br><br>15. "This is a ch_ _ ch. What is missing?" (U R)<br><br>16. "In the dark? Follow the Son."<br><br>17. "Running low on faith? Step in for a fill-up."<br><br>18. "If you can't sleep, don't count sheep. Talk to the Shepherd."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In RC and Anglican liturgy,  it is the usual practice that the Priest when he meets the congregation during service to say ' The Lord be with you' and the rest reply 'And also with you'....<br><br>One day before the service starts, a Priest uttered the first few words..but as the microphone is faulty that day and the people cannot hear him at first.
