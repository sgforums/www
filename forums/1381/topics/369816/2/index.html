              <p>sakyamuni relied on his brahmin teachings in the end..so he still used reincarnation as a basis...zoroatrianism..well, they had some ideas which are not wrong..and reflected in a way consistently in the bible..</p>
              <p>God didnt screw up with the jew..the jews gave him up..he focused alot on the jews because of a promise he made..that doesnt mean he didnt care about other nations..zhuang zi meeting up with Yahweh..not likely..all who see Yahweh face to face will surely die..</p>
              <p>the thing is..all humans have the ability to display good qualities..they tend to love family be it selfishly or otherwise..they love themselves...they might be upset when unjust things happen..they like beautiful things..where did all this abilities came from if not from him??</p>
