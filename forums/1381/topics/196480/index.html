            <div class='col-md body'>Accepting "Indulgence" would be like:<br><br>1. Telling God that Jesus's Life, Death and Resurrection is not Perfect.<br><br>2. Telling God that the justification of those who come to Him through Christ can be "bought and sold" through the hands of those created by God Himself.<br><br>"Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an <strong>eternal covenant</strong>, our Lord Jesus, make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, <strong>through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory</strong> forever and ever" - Hebrews 13: 20-21<br><br>______________<br><br>Hebrews 13: 9 - 14 speaks volumes against such man-made practices.<br><br>"Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by ceremonial foods, which are of no value to those who eat them. We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.<br><br>The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp. And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood. Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore. For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come. "</div>

That in turn seems to imply that Catholics are still wallowing in the alleged errors that precipitated the Protestant Reformation.<br><br>For example, point 6 highlights 'punishment of sins', but failed to highlight to word 'temporal', which to Catholics is THE critical word in the sentence.  To me, this seems like an attempt to wrongly attribute to Catholics the belief that indulgences can save us without the need of Christ.  'Salvation apart from Christ' is of course ludicrous for anyone with a modicum of knowledge of Catholic teachings.   The Catholic teaching on sin as disturbing the natural order of the universe and hence having temporal (as opposed to supernatural) effects is completed ignored.<br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta.</div>
