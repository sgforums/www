Jesus answered. "No one is goodÂ—except God alone.<br>and Paul?<br>Romans 3:23<br>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,<br><br>the word is ALL, meaning no exception, if Mary is without sin, then there will be exceptions<br><br>2) If Mary is without sin, then she do not need a savior, hence that means there is another way to God aside from Christ, making the following statement false, implying Jesus lied (which is an insult to Him)<br>John 14:6<br>Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.<br><br>3) if God made Mary without sin, what stops Him from making everyone without sin, thus spare Christ His Son from the cross? If God can remove sin with the sheding of blood, then He had just nullified His Laws.<br><br></div></blockquote>and our Church Fathers say this:<br><br>Even before the terms "original sin" and "immaculate conception" had been defined, early passages imply the doctrines. Many works mention that Mary gave birth to Jesus without pain. But pain in childbearing is part of the penalty of original sin (Gen. 3:16). Thus, Mary could not have been under that penalty. By GodÂ’s grace, she was immaculate in anticipation of her SonÂ’s redemptive death on the cross. The Church therefore describes Mary as "the most excellent fruit of redemption" (CCC 50<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>The Ascension of Isaiah<br><br>"[T]he report concerning the child was noised abroad in Bethlehem. Some said, Â‘The Virgin Mary has given birth before she was married two months.Â’ And many said, Â‘She has not given birth; the midwife has not gone up to her, and we heard no cries of painÂ’" (Ascension of Isaiah 11 [A.D. 70]).<br><br>The Odes of Solomon<br><br>"So the Virgin became a mother with great mercies. And she labored and bore the Son, but without pain, because it did not occur without purpose. And she did not seek a midwife, because he caused her to give life. She bore as a strong man, with will . . . " (Odes of Solomon 19 [A.D. 80]).<br><br>Justin Martyr<br><br>"[Jesus] became man by the Virgin so that the course which was taken by disobedience in the beginning through the agency of the serpent might be also the very course by which it would be put down. Eve, a virgin and undefiled, conceived the word of the serpent and bore disobedience and death. But the Virgin Mary received faith and joy when the angel Gabriel announced to her the glad tidings that the Spirit of the Lord would come upon her and the power of the Most High would overshadow her, for which reason the Holy One being born of her is the Son of God. And she replied Â‘Be it done unto me according to your wordÂ’ [Luke 1:38]" (Dialogue with Trypho the Jew 100 [A.D. 155]).<br><br>So can we agree to disagree?</div>
