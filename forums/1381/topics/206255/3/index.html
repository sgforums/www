            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by vince69:<br><strong><br>lets see if I remember correctly (think its something like this, can't remember the exact wordings)<br><br>"The righteous shall live by faith", faith in the finished of Christ [b]alone</strong> for our salvation.<br><br>on the scripture, the Bible alone as the sole authority in all things that leads to righteousness.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> [/b]</blockquote>very cheeky ah vince... u add in the alone after u quote the verse. But technically, the word alone was never there in the bible. although Martin luther added the word 'alone' in his translation (or at keast that was what i was taught, i havent actually looked at a protestant bible on this point yet)<br><br>cutting a part out from catholic.com<br><br>But Evangelical and Fundamentalist Protestants, who place their confidence in Martin LutherÂ’s theory of sola scriptura (Latin: "Scripture alone"), will usually argue for their position by citing a couple of key verses. The first is this: "These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:31). The other is this: "All Scripture is<br>inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be equipped, prepared for every good work" (2 Timothy 3:16Â–17). According to these Protestants, these verses demonstrate the reality of sola scriptura (the "Bible only" theory).<br><br>Not so, reply Catholics. First, the verse from John refers to the things written in that book (read it with John 20:30, the verse immediately before it to see the context of the statement in question). If this verse proved anything, it would not prove the theory of sola scriptura but that the Gospel of John is sufficient.<br><br>Second, the verse from JohnÂ’s Gospel tells us only that the Bible was composed so we can be helped to believe Jesus is the Messiah. It does not say the Bible is all we need for salvation, much less that the Bible is all we need for theology; nor does it say the Bible is even necessary to believe in Christ. After all, the earliest Christians had no New Testament to which they could appeal; they learned from oral, rather than written, instruction. Until relatively recent times, the Bible was inaccessible to most people, either because they could not read or because the printing press had not been invented. All these people learned from oral instruction, passed down, generation to generation, by the Church.<br><br>Much the same can be said about 2 Timothy 3:16-17. To say that all inspired writing "has its uses" is one thing; to say that only inspired writing need be followed is something else.</div>

He was forced to "join Liangshan".<br><br>Luther said these words that were since immortalized:<br><br><blockquote>Unless I am convinced by proofs from Scriptures or by plain and clear reasons and arguments, I can and will not retract, for it is neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience.
