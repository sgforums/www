Some<br>Church historians define the major issue as a dispute over the<br>sale of indulgences, payments made to the church to reduce the<br>time spent in Purgatory. Purgatory is wrongly believed to be the<br>place of temporary punishment where deceased persons were<br>purified from their venial sins. However, <strong>subsequent events<br>reveal that the major issue was one of authority. The issue at<br>hand was the locus, or seat, of authority of the Christian religion.</strong><br>Some were persuaded that the locus of authority was<br>found in the Bishop of Rome, in his office as the supposed successor<br>of Peter. Others believed the supreme authority rested in<br>Church councils that were convened to settle controversial<br>issues. However, Luther rejected both of these positions and<br>declared that the supreme authority of the Church was located<br>solely in the Word of God.<br><br>Technically this should not have been a matter for dispute<br>because high regard was ascribed to the Sacred Writings. The<br>problem occurred when the word sola (alone) was linked with<br>Scripture. Over the course of centuries additional books called<br>the Apocrypha had been added to the Bible and the unwritten<br>tradition of the apostles had been elevated to a position of equal<br>authority with Scripture. Teachings and practices of the<br>Medieval Church, including the doctrine of Purgatory and the<br>power of indulgences to free souls from it, were based on these<br>additional writings. When the teachings contained in these doctrines<br>could not be located in the books recognized as Scripture<br>from the earliest times, the truthfulness of Medieval religion was<br>called into question. This is what caused Luther to question the<br>power of indulgences and led to the Reformation of the sixteenth<br>century.<br><br>..<br><br>The stage was thus set for the clash of the two authorities.<br>Only one of them could be correct. Luther was concerned that<br>the ChurchÂ’s teaching be in agreement with what the canonical<br>Scriptures taught. <strong>There is no evidence to believe that he had set<br>out deliberately to challenge the authority of the Church. To the<br>contrary, there is every reason to believe that Luther was convinced<br>that Pope Leo X sincerely desired the reformation of the<br>Church but was being hindered by other church officials in<br>Rome.</strong> He remained confident that when Leo saw the truthfulness<br>of what he had protested against, he would take the lead in<br>bringing about reform.<br><br>However, rather than heeding LutherÂ’s protest, the Pope<br>demanded that Luther recant. Through a period of nearly three years, including preliminary discussions held in the cities of<br>Heidelberg and Leipzig, Luther remained convinced that reform<br>would come from the Papal seat. We can imagine his crushing<br>disappointment when a Papal bull was issued against him<br>demanding that he renounce his teachings. His response was to<br>burn the Papal bull and continue writing against the abuses of<br>the Church. In 1520, Luther penned three of his most influential<br>tracts that outlined his beliefs: The Address to the German<br>Nobility, The Freedom of the Christian Man, and The<br>Babylonian Captivity of the Church. In each of them he<br>reinforced the principle that only the pure Word of God is<br>authoritative for matters of faith and practice.</div>
