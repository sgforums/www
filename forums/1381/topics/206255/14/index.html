I ever saw a "shrine" in the city central of Cebu, dedicated to the worship of the Vigin Mary by the local catholics, really complete with flowers/incense/food stuff, the funny part is that among the offerings, are things like pacifier, milk (in baby bottles), toys for the Baby Jesus in her arms.<br><br>Can I says all catholics are like this? no, but I have to say, in this case, good doctrinal teaching/training is definitely lacking among the local church.<br>why, maybe local superstitions had been allowed to creep into the local church practices. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
