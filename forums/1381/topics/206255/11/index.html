The angel said to Mary, Â“Hail, full of grace!Â”  Sometimes this is translated as Â“Rejoice, highly favored oneÂ” but that is not really a good translation of the Greek in which Luke wrote his Gospel.  The particular word Luke used to describe Mary as Â“full of graceÂ” (kecaritwmenh) means that Mary was full of grace all her life.  (This is signified by kecaritwmenh being a perfect passive particle).  It means that Mary is full of grace not just at the moment the angel comes to her but that she is full of grace since the beginning of her life.  He could have used a different word to show that Mary was only full of grace at that particular moment as he did when he described Stephen as  Â“full of graceÂ” (plhrhV caritos) only for a moment in Acts 6:8 before he was stoned to death.  But Luke insists that Mary was full of grace all her life.  So indirectly we get a hint of MaryÂ’s Immaculate Conception in our Gospel today in the account of the angel GabrielÂ’s visit to Mary.</strong></blockquote></div>

The angel said to Mary, Â“Hail, full of grace!Â” Sometimes this is translated as Â“Rejoice, highly favored oneÂ” but that is not really a good translation of the Greek in which Luke wrote his Gospel. The particular word Luke used to describe Mary as Â“full of graceÂ” (kecaritwmenh) means that Mary was full of grace all her life. (This is signified by kecaritwmenh being a perfect passive particle). It means that Mary is full of grace not just at the moment the angel comes to her but that she is full of grace since the beginning of her life. He could have used a different word to show that Mary was only full of grace at that particular moment as he did when he described Stephen as Â“full of graceÂ” (plhrhV caritos) only for a moment in Acts 6:8 before he was stoned to death. But Luke insists that Mary was full of grace all her life.

(This is signified by kecaritwmenh being a perfect passive particle).</blockquote>The author insists that the original greek means "full of grace". Bear in mind other translations have it differently and he did not explain why his is the best choice. IMHO, this is fallacious and circular - you assume that Mary is sinless (full of grace) and you interpret the word accordingly.<br><br>Furthermore, if we go by a literal translation, "plhrhV caritos" actually means full of grace.<br><br>plhrhV,a  {play'-race}<br>1) full, i.e. filled up (as opposed to empty)  1a) of hollow vessels  1b) of a surface, covered in every part  1c) of the soul, thoroughly permeated with  2) full, i.e. complete  2a) lacking nothing, perfect<br><br>cariV,n  {khar'-ece}<br>1) grace  1a) that which affords joy, pleasure, delight, sweetness, charm,  loveliness: grace of speech  2) good will, loving-kindness, favour  2a) of the merciful kindness by which God, exerting his holy  influence upon souls, turns them to Christ, keeps, strengthens,  increases them in Christian faith, knowledge, affection, and  kindles them to the exercise of the Christian virtues  3) what is due to grace  3a) the spiritual condition of one governed by the power of  divine grace  3b) the token or proof of grace, benefit  3b1) a gift of grace  3b2) benefit, bounty  4) thanks, (for benefits, services, favours), recompense, reward<br><br><blockquote>It means that Mary is full of grace not just at the moment the angel comes to her but that she is full of grace since the beginning of her life.</blockquote>This point is moot in view of what I said earlier. The "full of" is not established, neither is the "grace". We don't even need to bother about his "perfect passive particle" argument.<br><br><blockquote>He could have used a different word to show that Mary was only full of grace at that particular moment as he did when he described Stephen as Â“full of graceÂ” (plhrhV caritos) only for a moment in Acts 6:8 before he was stoned to death. But Luke insists that Mary was full of grace all her life.</blockquote>This is hu2 shuo1 ba1 dao4 .. hun4 shui3 mo1 yu2.<br><br>Let me quote another verse that uses the same greek and demolish his argument.<br><br><blockquote>John 1:14 - kai o logoV sarx egeneto kai eskhnwsen en hmin, kai eqeasameqa thn doxan autou, doxan wV monogenouV para patroV, <strong>plhrhV caritoV </strong>kai alhqeiaV.<br><br>c.f. Acts 6:8 - stefanoV de <strong>plhrhV caritoV</strong> kai dunamewV epoiei terata kai shmeia megala en tw law. </blockquote>For those who never read their bible (like me), here are the english translations. Note that they are <span style="color: blue;">unequivocal</span> in their usage of "full of grace"!<br><br>NIV - 14The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only,[a] who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.<br><br>ESV -  14And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.<br><br>KJV - 14And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.<br><br>NKJV - 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.<br><br>NRSV - 14 And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a fatherÂ’s only son,* full of grace and truth.<br><br>Douay-Rheims - 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.<br><br>So what have you to say? That Jesus was only "full of grace" at that moment? Ah hah! Gotcha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><blockquote>So indirectly we get a hint of MaryÂ’s Immaculate Conception in our Gospel today in the account of the angel GabrielÂ’s visit to Mary.</blockquote>The author obviously never do his research. By trying to downplay the part about Stephen, may I say he has dragged his Lord into the picture and downgraded him below Mary. May I say that this is an affront to God.<br><br>It is time for him to do penance.<br><br></div>
