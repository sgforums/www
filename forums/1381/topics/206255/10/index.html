With His infinite power He can choose to make a person sinless by His Grace, if He want to. We all sinned and fall short of God's Glory, but if God wants, He can take away our sins, by His Grace.

That is full. All Christians (Catholics and Protestents alike) agree that salvation is by Grace alone. Which means, where there is Grace, there will be no sin. If we are to consider it mathematically, 50% Grace, 50% sin. 99% Grace, 1% sin. 100% Grace, 0% sin. Full means 100%.

You only stated sola gratia, but how about sola fide and sola christus?<br><br>And here is one fallacious argument you made - sola gratia does not mean all grace must relate to salvation and sinlessness. I give you one example:<br><br><blockquote>Genesis 6:6-10 - It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart, 7 He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them. <strong>8 But Noe found grace before the Lord.</strong> 9 These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God. (Douay-Rheims Bible)</blockquote>Using your logic, are you saying Noah is sinless?<br><br>You said "What stops Him from making everyone without sin? He is God. Do we want to question Him in this sense?". Before that, you said "Why not? He is God. With His infinite power He can choose to make a person sinless by His Grace, if He want to."<br><br>So are you saying God is not benevolent? He wants to see us suffer? Or rather, He wants to see us suffer, then send His Son Jesus Christ to a tragic death on Calvary.<br><br>Are you worshipping a sadistic God?</div>
