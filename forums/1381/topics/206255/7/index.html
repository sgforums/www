The Son of God, the second Person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance, and equal with the Father, <strong>did, when the fullness of time was come, take upon him man's nature</strong>, with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof; yet without sin: being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin Mary, <strong>of her substance</strong>. So that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion. Which person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only Mediator between God and man.</blockquote>I quoted two very authoritative creeds here.

Those issues are secondary.<br><br>I quoted this and I shall quote it again, Luther's courageous reply at the Diet of Worms:<br><br><blockquote>Since Your Majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply, I will answer. Unless I am convinced by Scripture and by plain Reason -- and not by Popes and Councils who have so often contradicted themselves -- my conscience is captive to the Word of God. To go against conscience is neither right nor safe. I cannot and I will not recant.</blockquote>It was not about any of those issues since Luther's belief on the Lord's Sacrament is arguably closer to the Catholic version than the quintessential Protestant version.<br><br>So the issue is about the authority of the Bible v.s. the authority of the Church.</div>

Okie, let me put this in Catholic's point of view.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Purgatory</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1 Cor 3:12-15</span><br><br>We believe that, on the hour of our death, our past works will be tested. If they passes the test, then we are rewarded, but if they fail, we will be passed through fire in order to be saved. This fire must not be Fires of Hell if we are promised to be saved. It cannot be the Eternal Fire of God in Heaven if our works fail the test, since everything in Heaven is pure and holy. So, there must have existed another kind of Fire which will purge our infirmities. The doctrine of Purgatory is built on the scriptural implication of "passing through fire".<br><br>Note that Paul prayed for Onesiphorous after he died, "may the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the lord on that day" (2nd Timothy 1:16-18 ). If he is either in Heaven or Hell, the prayer would not make sense, because the souls in Heaven don't need prayers anymore, and souls in Hell no longer have the ability to receive prayer. So where is the soul whom Paul thinks still in need of prayer?<br><br>Scriptural references:<br>Ps 66:12, Mt 12:32, Phil 2:10-11, Ecc 12:14, Lk 16:19-31, 1 Thess 3:13, Is 4:4 (cf.

Read my post - I think it's the longest post in the following page:<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=208844&amp;page=7<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Salvation by Faith and Works</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">James 2:14-26 - Faith without works is dead<br>Matthew 28:20 - The Great Commission, call to work for Christ's ministry - evangelize</span><br><br>Catholics believe well that by merely having faith is not enough. As James said, faith without works is dead. Many parables and stories in Jesus' time show that faith has to be accompanied with good works that celebrate God's Glory.<br><br>There are more scriptural quotes which states the importance of works. Here are some, copied from the web:<br>Matt 7:16-20, Matt 19:21, Matt 25:31-46, Matt 25:15-28, 2 Cor 5:10, Rev 20:12-13, Luke 19:6-9, Gal 6:2, Gal 6:4, 1 Cor 9:16, James 5:20, Jer. 17:10; 32:19<br><br>And lastly, especially to Icemoon:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mary Mother of God</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Luke 1:43</span><br><br>Elizabeth exclaimed "mother of my Lord". Who is "my Lord"? God, right? Anyway, by saying Mother of God, Catholics do not intend to place Mary as above God. Mary said herself that she is a handmaid of God (Luke 1:38, 1:48a). She even said that she needs God as her Saviour (Luke 1:47).</div>
