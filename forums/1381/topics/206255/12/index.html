(this is not directed at anybody)<br><br>When Atheists come into the forum and bombard the authencity and authority of the Bible, Protestants are quick to jump to it's defense. Can't we as Catholics do the same for our Sacred Tradition?<br><br>When Atheists challenges Protestants to use methods outside the Bible to debate on issues, Protestants stick to the Bible. (Which i respect)<br><br>But yet, Protestants use the same methods that Atheist uses to attack the theology and doctrine of the Catholic Church. We have mentioned countless time that we have 3 pillars. If Protestants expect Atheist to respect their use of the Bible, can we as Catholics ask for that same respect from Protestants?<br><br>It seems to reek of double standards somehow if you ask me. Again this post is not directed at anyone neither should it be taken in a negative light neither is this written with any connotation of offending anyone.</div></blockquote>I stand for truth and reason whether they are scientific or religious statements. I will not hesitate to denounce or correct anyone who tries to masquerade rubbish as truth.<br><br>I don't claim to have the truth, so I rely on the Socratic method to achieve my end.<br><br>I try to refrain from attacking the pillars.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But I try to catch whether anyone is mis-using the pillar. Which is why munyc thinks I am arguing for the sake of arguing.<br><br>I am not trying to boast or what but think of it this way - if you can't pass us "amateurs", i.e. challengers like me, skyfoo, nus etc. then forget about bringing your faith to the world which is getting more and more intellectual. You won't know, but the next person whom you try to defend your creationist belief might have a PH.D in evolutionary biology.<br><br>Is it any strange traditional Christianity does not appeal to the mass anymore?

The activities of Christ after his baptism, and especially his miracles, gave indication and assurance to the world of the deity hidden in his flesh. Being God and likewise perfect man, he gave positive indications of his two natures: of his deity, by the miracles during the three years following after his baptism, of his humanity, in the thirty years which came before his baptism, during which, by reason of his condition according to the flesh, he concealed the signs of his deity, although he was the true God existing before the ages" (Fragment in Anastasius of SinaiÂ’s The Guide 13 [A.D. 177]).<br><br>Irenaeus<br><br>"For the Church, although dispersed throughout the whole world even to the ends of the earth, has received from the apostles and from their disciples the faith in one God, Father Almighty, the creator of heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them; and in one Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became flesh for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit, who announced through the prophets the dispensations and the comings, and the birth from a Virgin, and the passion, and the resurrection from the dead, and the bodily ascension into heaven of the beloved Christ Jesus our Lord, and his coming from heaven in the glory of the Father to reestablish all things; and the raising up again of all flesh of all humanity, in order that to Jesus Christ our Lord and God and Savior and King, in accord with the approval of the invisible Father, every knee shall bend of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth . . . " (Against Heresies 1:10:1 [A.D. 189]).<br><br>"Nevertheless, what cannot be said of anyone else who ever lived, that he is himself in his own right God and Lord . . . may be seen by all who have attained to even a small portion of the truth" (ibid., 3:19:1).<br><br>Clement of Alexandria<br><br>"The Word, then, the Christ, is the cause both of our ancient beginningÂ—for he was in GodÂ—and of our well-being. And now this same Word has appeared as man. He alone is both God and man, and the source of all our good things" (Exhortation to the Greeks 1:7:1 [A.D. 190]).<br><br>"Despised as to appearance but in reality adored, [Jesus is] the expiator, the Savior, the soother, the divine Word, he that is quite evidently true God, he that is put on a level with the Lord of the universe because he was his Son" (ibid., 10:110:1).<br><br>Tertullian<br><br>"The origins of both his substances display him as man and as God: from the one, born, and from the other, not born" (The Flesh of Christ 5:6Â–7 [A.D. 210]).<br><br>"That there are two gods and two Lords, however, is a statement which we will never allow to issue from our mouth; not as if the Father and the Son were not God, nor the Spirit God, and each of them God; but formerly two were spoken of as gods and two as Lords, so that when Christ would come, he might both be acknowledged as God and be called Lord, because he is the Son of him who is both God and Lord" (Against Praxeas 13:6 [A.D. 216]).<br><br>Origen<br><br>"Although he was God, he took flesh; and having been made man, he remained what he was: God" (The Fundamental Doctrines 1:0:4 [A.D. 225]).<br><br>Hippolytus<br><br>"Only [GodÂ’s] Word is from himself and is therefore also God, becoming the substance of God" (Refutation of All Heresies 10:33 [A.D. 228]).<br><br>Hippolytus of Rome<br><br>"For Christ is the God over all, who has arranged to wash away sin from mankind, rendering the old man new" (ibid., 10:34).<br><br>Novatian<br><br>"If Christ was only man, why did he lay down for us such a rule of believing as that in which he said, Â‘And this is life eternal, that they should know you, the only and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent?Â’ [John 17:3]. Had he not wished that he also should be understood to be God, why did he add, Â‘And Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent,Â’ except because he wished to be received as God also? Because if he had not wished to be understood to be God, he would have added, Â‘And the man Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent;Â’ but, in fact, he neither added this, nor did Christ deliver himself to us as man only, but associated himself with God, as he wished to be understood by this conjunction to be God also, as he is. We must therefore believe, according to the rule prescribed, on the Lord, the one true God, and consequently on him whom he has sent, Jesus Christ, who by no means, as we have said, would have linked himself to the Father had he not wished to be understood to be God also. For he would have separated himself from him had he not wished to be understood to be God" (Treatise on the Trinity 16 [A.D. 235]).<br><br>Cyprian of Carthage<br><br>"One who denies that Christ is God cannot become his temple [of the Holy Spirit] . . .

There is one Lord, only of the only, God of God, image and likeness of deity, efficient Word, wisdom comprehensive of the constitution of all things, and power formative of the whole creation, true Son of true Father, invisible of invisible, and incorruptible of incorruptible, and immortal of immortal and eternal of eternal. . . . And thus neither was the Son ever wanting to the Father, nor the Spirit to the Son; but without variation and without change, the same Trinity abides ever" (Declaration of Faith [A.D. 265]).<br><br>Arnobius<br><br>"Â‘Well, then,Â’ some raging, angry, and excited man will say, Â‘is that Christ your God?Â’ Â‘God indeed,Â’ we shall answer, Â‘and God of the hidden powersÂ’" (Against the Pagans 1:42 [A.D. 305]).<br><br>Lactantius<br><br>"He was made both Son of God in the spirit and Son of man in the flesh, that is, both God and man" (Divine Institutes 4:13:5 [A.D. 307]).<br><br>"We, on the other hand, are [truly] religious, who make our supplications to the one true God. Someone may perhaps ask how, when we say that we worship one God only, we nevertheless assert that there are two, God the Father and God the SonÂ—which assertion has driven many into the greatest error . . . [thinking] that we confess that there is another God, and that he is mortal. . . . [But w]hen we speak of God the Father and God the Son, we do not speak of them as different, nor do we separate each, because the Father cannot exist without the Son, nor can the Son be separated from the Father" (ibid., 4:28Â–29).<br><br>Council of Nicaea I<br><br>"We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in being with the Father. Through him all things were made" (Creed of Nicaea [A.D. 325]).<br><br>"But those who say, Â‘There was a time when he [the Son] did not exist,Â’ and Â‘Before he was born, he did not exist,Â’ and Â‘Because he was made from non-existing matter, he is either of another substance or essence,Â’ and those who call Â‘God the Son of God changeable and mutable,Â’ these the Catholic Church anathematizes" (Appendix to the Creed of Nicaea [A.D. 325]).<br><br>Patrick of Ireland<br><br>"Jesus Christ is the Lord and God in whom we believe, and whose coming we expect will soon take place, the judge of the living and the dead, who will render to everyone according to his works" (Confession of St. Patrick 4 [A.D. 452]).<br></div>
