              <p>The first try he run into the law. next time he think he got more intelligent by preaching along with what gahmen preaches. he knows whatever garbish he say his church people will agree, what he said  about  other religions his followers and members will say okay forgiven mah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i urge all his followers to really sit down and ask whether this is a pasta you want to follow. why not contribute their money to other churches and join other churches instead. how can follow one who only tok nonsense?</p>

              <p>Perhaps the Pastor forgot to tell the church goer that even an AOG preacher can be a Homosexual. So who say that when you believe in Jesus mean YOU ARE ASSURED TO BE FREE FROM HOMOSEXUALITY.</p>
              <p>Frank Houston, founder of Sydney Christian Life Centre which subsequently become the famous Hillsong Church was a HOMOSEXUAL. It was known throughout Australia when his case surface in the media. Of course, the church try to cover up. (see article below)</p>
              <p>Hence sometime preacher are too quick to judge. However when their peers commit such act, they are silent about it. They chose hide the reality from their people.</p>
              <p>I am reminded of the Da Vinci Code in the last scene when the Catholic cardinal express his thank to Langdon and mentioned that the church is inperfect too. Time to cast the HOLIER THAN THOU ATTITUDE aside.</p>
              <h1><span style="color: #c04830;">Hillsong farewells a lost sheep pioneer </span></h1>
              <h3>Sydney Morning Herald/November 13, 2004 <br><span style="color: #3048c0;">By Stephen Gibbs </span></h3>
              <p>Frank Houston, considered the father of Sydney's Pentecostal churches, began preaching to nine adults and five children and built a congregation of thousands that is still growing.</p>
              <p>Mr Houston, who died on Monday aged 82, founded the Sydney Christian Life Centre in 1977 at Waterloo and spent 22 years building a movement that became the Hillsong church.</p>
              <p>He was the most senior Assemblies of God figure in NSW before was sacked by his own son after he admitted having sexually abused a boy in New Zealand more than 30 years ago.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Hillsong and Mr Houston's son, Brian, the national president of Assemblies of God, welcomed him back to the fold to send him out properly.</p>
              <p>"He was a man who perhaps made some big mistakes a long time ago," Brian Houston told more than 1000 mourners in Waterloo's Hillsong assembly hall. "But everyone here knows that he was a man who stood for what he believed in."</p>
              <p>Mr Houston was credited with helping to convert the jockey Darren Beadman.</p>
              <p>Mourners yesterday included were the federal MP for Greenway, Louise Markus - a member of Brian Houston's Baulkham Hills Hillsong church - and the federal MP for Mitchell, Alan Cadman.</p>
              <p>The Deputy Police Commissioner, Andrew Scipione, also attended.</p>
              <p>A friend, Jonathon Wilson, said one of Mr Houston's favourite sayings was "To hell with the devil". "I don't believe the church would be where it is today if it wasn't for his life and for his ministry," Mr Wilson said.</p>
              <p>William Francis Houston was born in Wanganui, New Zealand, and began training to become a Salvation Army officer shortly after turning 18.</p>
              <p>He founded his first Assemblies of God ministry at Lower Hutt in 1960, later became the superintendent of the New Zealand Assemblies of God, and set out for Sydney in 1977.</p>
              <p>The church he built at Waterloo merged with his son's church at Baulkham Hills to become Hillsong after he exposed himself as a pedophile.</p>
              <p>Brian Houston told mourners his father was the greatest evangelical preacher he had ever seen. "In my biased opinion, he was in a class of his own."</p>
              <p>Frank Houston, whose wife, Hazel, died six months ago, suffered a massive stroke last Sunday night and died about 8am on Monday.</p>

              <p>1st, I'm not a perfect person... Just findings.</p>
              <p>Those christians who never been the person never understands. I won't understand too. They only read the headline but never the details of the full story. I also saw christians shooting verses against each others on who is more right.... by that they are already.. signh... Still man... Of course leading all others to wrong perception.</p>
              <p>I respect the pastors whom i met were once the "person" but they had changed. Instead of criticising, they stepped out to help those in need. They Don't Talk the Talk BUT Walk the TALK too. Never tell how much we care but show it by "Hard work" because it involves sacrifice (moral works). Which this works were Only spoken by many but not ALLwork on it.</p>
              <p>Talk is not even cheap, IT IS worthless. Work shows everything. US ex president:" Don't ask what the country can do for me but what i can for the country".</p>
              <p>I see that if everything is only for (I, Me, Myself) liking... WAR will be everyday thing. Because i will be fighting with over 60++ billion people including my family.</p>
              <p>From study and review I learnt: Seeking should not be in the understanding of Man but God. Because All Man SINs, same for Pastors too. Who are we to judge others while we are Sinners OURSELVES? If I'm smoker but tell my children not to smoke.</p>
