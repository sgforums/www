              <p>They target young sch kids because at that age, these kids are
              the most impressionable. They think that going to such 'modern'
              churches is very 'cool' and 'hip'.</p>
              <p>And as most of the kids who joined have not previously attend
              any church before, they have no idea what a proper church is like.
              They are attracted by the disco lights, loud music and pastor who
              can speak well. Not to mention they can get to find bf/gf there
              too.</p>
              <p>Without any objective research done on the bible, these kids
              naturally do not question the pastor and his teachings. They are
              easily influenced and become willing members and givers very
              soon.</p>
              <p>Its not surprising that 60% of the members at city harvest are
              still teenagers.</p>
              <p>Seems like if you want to grow a church, the strategy is to
              target the young and 'harvest' them.</p>

              <p><br> When it comes to 'evangelizing' to the school kids by haressing them at
              their school gates and with the modern curse of technology like SMSs
              and mobile phones by the so-called church members, a LINE MUST be drawn
              here.<br> <br> For a while now we have seen and read about 'churches' like the NCC,
              the Cornerstones, City Harvest, whatever touting their 'riches' in money and cents
              terms in the newspapers. It is importnat for the leaders of these
              churches to recognize that Singapore is a multi-racial and
              multi-religious society. While you may have the BEST interest of the
              person your church is trying to reach out, IT must be done with proper
              respect to the person's wishes.<br> <br> It will be WRONG and immoral even if one keep pestering and harassing a
              YOUNG student, who have to study and pass examination in order to TRY
              to get a good job and make a good living and have a good family and be
              a contributing Singapore citizen, you are just distracting him or her.<br> <br> It may be high time that someone in authority take a look at these over
              zealous church members and their churches to assess: what is their
              agenda? how does the church get funded? were there any 'peer pressure'
              being subtly exerted to get the 'members' to 'contribute' to the fund?
              what did they do to the 'back sliders' (i.e. those who got in and then
              realized that it was not meant to be'? etc.<br> <br> This CAN be a serious issue if we pooh-pooh it. I have seen young
              Cornerstone members singing in their premise (not sure if I will call
              it a 'church' as it is in one of the Katong Odean Complex shop units)
              as if in trance!</p>
