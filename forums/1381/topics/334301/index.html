              <p>Few years ago,  I was lying in bed and thinking about death. How it would come and what happens after that. I freaked out and started wondering what I can do to feel better. Although agnostic, I prayed to god, telling myself that there is a heaven and I would go there (probably not). But during that split second, i felt a huge sense of relief.</p>
              <p>Few minutes later, I took a step back and thought about what just happened. Along with my other thoughts, I crafted my version of the meaning to the answer of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In our simplest form, without technology, clothes etc, we are no different compared to animals. Why have we evolved so well so far ? simply because our ability to transfer knowledge has always surpassed other living things. What is knowledge transfer ? every object you see around has is the result of knowledge transfer. From one craftsmen to another, billions of humans around the world in different field pass information from one to another, through scriptures, words, recorded words blah blah blah. We take someone's work and improve it further.</p>
              <p>What is the answer then, <strong>Each and every single living thing on earth's main objective is to procreate,</strong> <strong>including us.</strong></p>
              <p>But if the answer is so simple, why do we always give ourselves a higher sense of purpose then ? It's because men are egoistical creatures by nature. I am pretty sure no one will admit we are the same as dogs, ants, fishes. i am very very sure no one wants to believe our purpose is to just sit around, fornicate, eat, sleep and shit.</p>
              <p>How do religion come into play then ? aren't we decendents of adam and eve ?</p>
              <p>All forms of religion contain a scripted belief. eg. bible, qur'an etc etc   who wrote these beliefs ? men did. Why did men create such beliefs then?</p>
              <p>If I told you now, if you drop dead this second, everything about you cease to exist, your memory, your bio-energy (soul), your body, how would you feel ?</p>
              <p>Now, what if I told you when you die, you meet your loved ones, your family that passed on, that you go to a place where happiness is guaranteed a.k.a heaven, how would you feel?</p>
              <p>For the strong willled, They will probably just say lets enjoy life then kick the bucket. How about the weak willed ? what will they do ?</p>
              <p>I believe, centuries ago, some chap started worrying about his mortality. To settle his fears, he created a story about the afterlife and believed in it so much it spread to people around him. The story evolved and spread. After so many years, it evolved to the current state of belief, where people feel it is so much easier depending on a higher being for strength, reliance and eternal love.</p>
              <p>I for one am looking to believe in something. I hate to think everything comes to a grinding halt when i die.</p>
              <p>How about you ? What do you feel ? Is it easier to believe in something than realise it's harder to tackle things alone ?</p>

              <p>hmm. i have never been an athiest before. and became a christian from being a buddhist. and after me, my family came over too. and we're very happy with the change.</p>
              <p>maybe it's something about it which makes sense to me. the stillness of guilt and shame, the peace of forgiveness and the security of being loved (which is true, if you look deep into it).</p>
              <p>something which everyone needs, but which athiesm don't, and can never provide.</p>

                  question.</strong> How do we explain it? Jesus was a backwater peasant. He never
                  wrote a book, never held an office. He never journeyed more than two
                  hundred miles from his hometown. Friends left him. One betrayed him.
                  Those he helped forgot him. Prior to his death, they abandoned him. But
                  after his death they couldn't resist him. What made the difference?<br><br><strong>The answer.</strong> His death and resurrection.<br><br>For when he died, so did your sin.<br><br>And when he rose, so did your hope.<br><br>For when he rose, your grave was changed from a final residence to temporary housing.<br><br><strong>The reason he did it.</strong> The face in your mirror.<br><br><strong>The verdict after two millenniums. </strong>Herod was right; there is room for only one King.</p>

              <p>Bro... <strong>You have jus obtained wisdom</strong>... Life... Life is not complicated... If there is a god, he certaintly didnt make u to recognise him, so why go against him?... It is a figment of our need for comfort, the need to know the unknown that lead us to create god. we are gods creator...<br><br><br>Every organism on earth shares the same blueprint for life... Your job is to pass it down, keep the flame on... There is no why. <br><br>Is there a purpose in life? No, we do not know... it is wiser to admit our lack of knowledge than to believe in fiction. <br><br>Infact, I have come to the same conclusion with you some time ago...
              Live life with morals, not fear of god, love your neighbour, not
              because god loves you, but becasue you love your neighbour. Appreciate
              your surrounding, the dogs, the cattles, the ants, not because they are
              gods creation, but because you respect them... respect them becasue we
              are made of the same thing... <br><br></p>

              <p>You know religion is about believing in church doctines and teachings</p>
              <p>Faith is about believeing in Christ and hence the  bible.</p>
              <p>God is not a theory made up or fabricated by men long time ago. God really exists. Christ is really the Messiah. Christ really rose from among the dead in 3 days. Christ is really now alive and now glorified.</p>
              <p>I'm not indoctrinated really because I used to believe and now I know what I believe. Walk in faith and walk with God. It's the only way to find out to know what you believe. To have knowlege of what you believe even though it is bound to be partial. To have a personal relationship with God. To know that God is a living God.</p>
              <p>And not to waste this life but to know what God is offering to those He chose.</p>
              <p>I can testify to you what I've gone through with God but you are likely not to believe me. The only way is for you to know God yourself.</p>
              <p>PS: Yes death is grim make no mistake about it but faith makes it not so scary. Why? because God promised hope for the dead. That God would raise the dead from the imprisonment of death in His time.</p>
              <p>Here are 2 links if you are interested to read about death. The second one is basically a reference to the bible.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think that the meaning of life is to fulfill your dream. Dream is the driving source of a human, it doesn't matter whether you believe god or not, I personally don't, but I don't mind praying. Whether you die or not, if you didn't fulfill your dream, you will still die in vain, you will left an emptyness after you die. But, if you die after you fulfilled your dream, there is nothing left for you in the world. Although sometime the dream may be small, but do remember the dream and fulfill it. That, is my answer to the meaning of life, fulfilling dream.</p></div>

              <p>Hmm, you prayed to God, and then felt that all these beliefs are man's creation... Well, decide on who you believe- in God? or that 'its just man's imagination'? After your decision you'll certainly believe in something.</p>
              <p>How I view life: If there really is nothing higher to seek, then there is no reason for our existance. Don't all of mankind, clever or stupid, seek something above them. Perhaps its a dream, perhaps its the unexplainable mysteries, perhaps its God.</p>
              <p>Thus, I fear death. Why? Its the point I can go no further.</p>
              <p>However, the Bible writes that there is eternity for those who believe. I do, and I'm thankful. Death no longer haunts me. I just look forward and press-on in Life, seeking to understand God, seeking to fufill my dreams. I'll die without regrets. And I live without fear that everything comes to a grinding stop.</p>
              <p>My fear is that when my time comes, I've not done enough.</p>
              <p>You should just put all your heart and believe in God. Put aside all doubt, try it and I'm sure something about your views on death will change.</p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>Answers to some of your qns.</p>
              <p>If I drop death and there is nothing after that... I'd drop death right now.</p>
              <p>If there's an afterlife... Live to the fullest, I'd be able to tell ppl that I've done this and that in the afterlife.</p>
              <p>Also, the concept of God had exist since the start of mankind. No one came up with it, it was inside them.</p>

              <p>What is the answer then, <strong>Each and every single living
                  thing on earth's main objective is to procreate,</strong> <strong>including us.</strong></p>
              <p>But if the answer is so simple, why do we always give
                  ourselves a higher sense of purpose then ? It's because men are
                  egoistical creatures by nature. I am pretty sure no one will admit
                  we are the same as dogs, ants, fishes. i am very very sure no one
                  wants to believe our purpose is to just sit around, fornicate,
                  eat, sleep and shit.</p>
              <p>How do religion come into play then ? aren't we decendents of
                  adam and eve ?</p>
              <p>All forms of religion contain a scripted belief. eg. bible,
                  qur'an etc etc   who wrote these beliefs ? men did. Why
                  did men create such beliefs then?</p>
              <p>If I told you now, if you drop dead this second, everything
                  about you cease to exist, your memory, your bio-energy (soul), your
                  body, how would you feel ?</p>
              <p>Now, what if I told you when you die, you meet your loved ones,
                  your family that passed on, that you go to a place where happiness
                  is guaranteed a.k.a heaven, how would you feel?</p>
              <p>For the strong willled, They will probably just say lets enjoy
                  life then kick the bucket. <strong>How about the weak willed ? what will
                  they do ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I believe, centuries ago, some chap started worrying about his
                  mortality. To settle his fears, he created a story about the
                  afterlife and believed in it so much it spread to people around
                  him. </strong>The story evolved and spread. After so many years, it evolved
                  to the current state of belief, where people feel it is so
                  much easier depending on a higher being for strength, reliance and
                  eternal love.</p>

              <p>I for one, have thought about what TS have thought about too some time back. My belief was also that some stories were created to calm the fears of the weak-willed.</p>
              <p><strong>"Each and every single living
                  thing on earth's main objective is to procreate,</strong> <strong>including us."</strong></p>
              <p>However, as human being, technical our needs may be, we possess the capability to feel. To live life happily, or to live life gloomily, if there is only one choice out of the 2, I'm sure your choice would be obvious.</p>
              <p><em>"I for one am looking to believe in something. I hate to think
                                          everything comes to a grinding halt when i die."</em></p>
              <p>That's where I think human beings are actually above just their main objective to procreate. We have the capacity to feel. To feel curious, love, jealousy, anger, sorrow, elated, confused etc. The list goes on.</p>
              <p>So maybe it's not about the final destination - death. What if, it's about the journey? What if, it's to spread love and enjoy the people around you while you're still living? What if, it's about realizing we're more than just satisfying our basic needs? Life goes on, but do we choose to share and love and thus create a better environment for ourselves and for our children that we will procreate, the future generations to come, or do we just wait passively for death?</p>
              <p>If we can make our environment better living our same technical life, why don't we?</p>

              <p>I also think that, after death, entrophy (or is it entropy?) takes its role and all the little molecules we're made of split up and find their way back into the world again. (Hence I dont like the idea of keeping cremation dust in fancy vases..) And the molecules all go their seperate ways, some taken up in the soil as minerals to plants, some floating in the air to find their path to the lungs of some creature (or the stoma of some plant), some spending millions of years as the soil we tread on.</p>
              <p>Does this then mean that we are all made of... recycled materials? What, then, makes my recycled materials form me? What is the thing that bonds them together?

              <p>Right on to live is to exist.</p>
              <p>The meaning of your existence is answering why do you want to exist. . . .well at least that's how I put it.</p>
              <p>If you say because you don't want to stop existing question why you don't want to stop existing. And so on and on. Until you got the final answer. which you may not. But you are getting there if you pose this simple questions to yourself</p>
