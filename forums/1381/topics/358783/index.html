              <h3>Televangelist Joel Osteen Discusses Christianity with Larry King</h3>
              <p>First is Larry King’s impressive introduction of Joel Osteen:</p>
              <p><em>LARRY KING, CNN HOST: Tonight, Joel Osteen, evangelism’s hottest
              rising star, pastor for the biggest congregation in the United States…
              Pastor Joel Osteen is here for the hour…. Joel Osteen is the author of
              the number one “New York Times” best-seller, “Your Best Life Now.”
              There you see its cover. “Seven Steps to Living at Your Full
              Potential.” There is now a compendium been published called “Your Best
              Life Now Journal,” a guide to reaching that full potential. Joel Osteen
              is pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. His father before him.
              He has been called the smiling preacher. </em></p>
              <p>Larry King knows Joel Osteen Ministries is huge and tries to play nice with him throughout the interview.</p>
              <p><em>KING: Why are you a preacher?</em></p>
              <p><em>JOEL OSTEEN: You know, I never was for 17 years. I worked with
              my dad there at the church. He tried to get me to minister. I didn’t
              have it in me. I worked behind the scenes. I loved doing production and
              things. But when my father died, I just knew — I don’t know how to
              explain it, it sounds kind of odd, but I just knew down to here I was
              supposed to step up to the plate and pastor the church. And it was odd
              because I had never preached before. But I just knew I was supposed to
              do it.</em></p>
              <p>Hmmm… either God gave him the “calling” or he was scared of losing his father’s multi-million dollar preaching business.</p>
              <p><em>KING: But don’t you think if people don’t believe as you believe, they’re somehow condemned?</em></p>
              <p><em>JOEL </em><em>OSTEEN: You know, I think that happens in our
              society. But I try not to do that. I tell people all the time, preached
              a couple Sundays about it. I’m for everybody. You may not agree with
              me, but to me it’s not my job to try to straighten everybody out. The
              Gospel called the good news. My message is a message of hope, that’s
              God’s for you. You can live a good life no matter what’s happened to
              you. And so I don’t know. I know there is condemnation but I don’t feel
              that’s my place.</em></p>
              <p>Joel Osteen comes right out and says that he will refuse to condemn
              sinners. He is too afraid, it’s not his place, he just wants to spew
              bland niceties… hmmm.</p>
              <p><em>LARRY </em><em>KING: Where were you ordained? OSTEEN: I was ordained from the church there, Lakewood, under my dad’s ministry.</em></p>
              <p><em>LARRY </em><em>KING: So you didn’t go to seminary?</em></p>
              <p><em>JOEL </em><em>OSTEEN: No, sir, I didn’t.</em></p>
              <p><em>LARRY </em><em>KING: They can just make you a minister?</em></p>
              <p><em>JOEL </em><em>OSTEEN: You can, you can.<br> </em></p>
              <p>Wow. Joel Osteen never even attended Bible school or classes for
              future preachers. No wonder he is so clueless about Biblical theology.</p>
              <p><em>LARRY </em><em>KING: Is it hard to lead a Christian life?</em></p>
              <p><em>JOEL </em><em>OSTEEN: I don’t think it’s that hard. To me it’s
              fun. We have joy and happiness. Our family — I don’t feel like that at
              all. I’m not trying to follow a set of rules and stuff. I’m just living
              my life.</em></p>
              <p><em>LARRY </em><em>KING: But you have rules, don’t you?</em></p>
              <p><em>JOEL </em><em>OSTEEN: We do have rules. But the main rule to me
              is to honor God with your life. To life a life of integrity. Not be
              selfish. You know, help others. But that’s really the essence of the
              Christian faith.</em></p>
              <p>Of course its not hard for Joel Osteen to lead a Christian life.  BECAUSE HE’S NOT!!!</p>
              <p><em>LARRY </em><em>KING: What if you’re Jewish or Muslim, you don’t accept Christ at all?</em></p>
              <p><em>JOEL </em><em>OSTEEN: You know, I’m very careful about saying who would and wouldn’t go to heaven. I don’t know …</em></p>
              <p><em>LARRY KING: If you believe you have to believe in Christ? They’re wrong, aren’t they?</em></p>
              <p><em>JOEL </em><em>OSTEEN: Well, I don’t know if I believe they’re
              wrong. I believe here’s what the Bible teaches and from the Christian
              faith this is what I believe. But I just think that only God with judge
              a person’s heart. I spent a lot of time in India with my father. I
              don’t know all about their religion. But I know they love God. And I
              don’t know. I’ve seen their sincerity. So I don’t know. I know for me,
              and what the Bible teaches, I want to have a relationship with Jesus.</em></p>
              <p>The last exchange between Larry King and Joel Osteen hits the nail
              on the head of everything that is wrong with the Joel Osteen Ministry.
              All it is is fluff. He can’t even defend the single core belief of
              Christianity- that a personal relationship with Jesus Christ is a
              requirement to gain access to Heaven.</p>
