              <p>Good question, Once again this has to do with the black and white thing. The world
              isn't that simple and it is becoming a lot more complex with each
              passing day. God does not punish according to the old testaments ten
              commandments anymore, rather he punishes based on the sins of the heart
              and mind. Let me give two contrasting examples.<br> <br> You are born into a good society with good moral values, therefore you
              can decide easily for yourself what it is that makes a person "good" or
              rather "holy." However, there are many cases where people in the world
              are not as "blessed" as you are. So God has to judge from the light
              emitted from their souls, but then how is that fair to those who are
              born into unjust environments? Is God so cruel as to merely cast them
              away? No, hardly.<br> <br> The thing is that if you are a person born of the cruelest
              environments, and you had to steal, survive, and murder for a living,
              and that was all that you knew, then wouldn't that be extremely unfair
              to be condemned to a hell on earth, only to be condemned to hell for
              not knowing any better? For a lot of these people, it is what comes
              from inside of them that matters. If for one day, for even a single
              instance, this person who was raised in this environment can ever
              sympathize and refrain from killing a person, then in the eyes of God,
              this act of refraining from killing is worth more to God than anything
              I or anyone born of a good environment could ever do. For a person with
              no moral background, coming to his own senses and realizing the pain
              and sadness he brings to others is a greater act than anything you or I
              can do, who do know the difference between what is good and bad.</p>
