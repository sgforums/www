              <p>Part of the reason Christians are so dead set on their belief is
              that piece of hope that they cling to. That in the kingdom of
              heaven lies an eternal kingdom, one that will not falter, because
              it is perfect, because the ruler God is perfect. Totally
              understandable, since it is human tendency to hope for a fantasy
              world which is totally awesom.</p>

              <p>How does one know if heaven or hell exists in the form described in the bible? How do we even know if there is after life? Humans all have this fear of the unknown. It is the same fear we have when we walk pass a tombstone in the middle of the night.</p>
              <p>Credit though must go to those individuals several thousand years ago who capitalised on this basic human instinct and fear, codified their thoughts into a book, channeled this fear of heaven or hell concept into a religion, and made members pay a monthly fee in exchange for a more assured after life.</p>
              <p>Fear of afterlife is a recurrent theme in almost all ancient civilizations. I really applaud those few famous individuals who successful used their charisma and oratorical skills to build a mass of followers who will in turn propagate their teachings for eternity. Its natural that people do not want to be forgotten when they die. Those few individuals who created a religion must be the most successful at this. They will be remembered for eternity using the concept of God as a proxy.  </p>

              <p>Fear of afterlife is a recurrent theme in almost all ancient
              civilizations. I really applaud those few famous
              individuals who successful used their charisma and oratorical
              skills to build a mass of followers who will in turn
              propagate their teachings for eternity. Its natural that
              people do not want to be forgotten when they die. Those few
              individuals who created a religion must be the most successful
              at this. They will be remembered for eternity using the concept of
              God as a proxy.  </p>

              <p>What you said is right, its humans that caused all these shit. Religion itself is intangible. Thats why the idea of heaven comes, who wants to go to hell ? I bet no one. Thats why.</p>

              <p>It comes back to people preeching others to join and bla bla hell. I am now wondering is it really correct. Remember free will ? Christian institutions that are shoving their beliefs down others
              throats. Was it  meant to be that way ?  because approaching God is
              not something that can be forced, but one that is made of one's own
              free will.</p>

              <p>From my understanding, Having perfect example (aka Jesus Christ) is so that the Christians would have
              something to follow. Nobody can argue that Jesus was a harmful
              influence in any way, whether or not because history has thrown away
              his bad side or not does not matter, because having an example like him
              makes the so-called Christians today strive to be better than they are.

              <p>Actually you are right. Religion is related to Politics/ the government. During the Dark Ages, the church was so tied into politics and more
              or less was the local government, in most cases it should not be nor
              should it ever.</p>
              <p>Anyway i am also not a christain. All these just serve as a exchange of information.</p>
