              <p>of course not. creationist theories were created and invented in the ancient past, because science and technology were literally non existent, hence people readily accepted this kind of preachings with faith. but fast forward 2010 years later, science and technology is advanced that many of the myths and so called legends were dispelled. ancient people does not have the benefit of the knowledge we have now. they have no idea earth was round and not square. they thought that the natural diasters were the acts of god. we should know better this is not the case. the so called faith healing are in fact placebo effect, so its not so a miracle after all.</p>

              <p>for those non believers, we can treat this (going to hell thingy
              ) with contempt and utterly ridiculous. if one religion tell me, if
              I eat beef, I will go to hell for eternity? am I supposed to avoid
              eating beef for the rest of my life based on that religion when I
              am not even a believer. to hell with this preaching I say. it is
              not only rude, but utter nonsense. this is spreading intolerance
              with their followers and other faiths. I believe Rony Tan was let
              off very lightly by ISD, not even a fine. its like a slap in the
              wrist because he was a religious leader with a few thousand
              followers and this has the potential to create unrest
              among other faiths, esp when singapore is a multi cultural

              <p>Wrong about society. The Bible says that God grants forgiveness to all those that ask for
              it. Society punishes and labels criminals. Let's take a general example
              such as a person who was a child molester for a while. Suppose he
              genuinely repents and says that he will not do it ever again, he
              apologizes for it, he pays for it by serving time in prison, etc etc.
              Even when he is let out, he is put on a neighborhood watch program
              alongside a tracker list of people who are deemed dangerous towards
              society. When he is found with a child in the park alone, what are
              people to think of him?</p>

              <p>I also dunno why god bother creating us, where we have to go
              thru so much sufferings. if you borned as animals, its even worst.
              the existence of animals is comparable to those who go to hell,
              where hell being suffer the hell of fire and
              thunderstorms.</p>
              <p>so what are we actually? play things or experiments of god? I
              rather not exists at all if I have to go thru the shit of being
              born, study until university with the stress of doing homework,
              revision and exams, not to mention having to put up with those
              boring and monotonous teachers/lecturers in classes. after
              graduation, one has to work and work even though the work sucks and
              the pay is meagre and pathetic. imagine everyday go to work doing
              the same old routine and hapless and menials tasks. is there any
              meaning to all these? worse is, when you die, you are condemned to
              eternal hell if you do not accept their teachings.</p>
              <p>also one more thing. I dun understand why god needs to create
              bacteria and microbes for, those that are invisible to the naked
              eyes. those bacteria and microbes are the reasons why we fall sick
              and die of AIDS, SARs etc. so to add more excitement to our worldly
              existence and the amusement of god, god decided to add these
              organisms to add spice to our life to see us suffer and die. not
              contened seeing us to die, god condemned us to eternal hell some
              more.</p>

              <p>Once again about society, conditioning i will say. Conditioning exists everywhere. Our parents condition us to become
              children based on what they know, and you and I will do the same for
              our own children. We are conditioned beings. Even society raises us up
              from the ground up by putting us through 'education.' You always have
              to remember though, that society's goals through education may not be
              for the individual's best interest, but society's. That part though, is
              where Christianity IS supposed to be different, Christianity is
              supposed to focus on the person, not society, not the church, but the
              person.</p>
