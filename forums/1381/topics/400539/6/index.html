              <p>I know of a terminally ill man converted to christianity because he wants a christian funeral so as not to burden the wife with the more complicated buddhist or taoist funeral.   The wife follow suit, converted herself to christian.  She told me many times she became christian because of the husband.  Both are old couple.   I told her what she did was not right.</p>

              <p>Good question, Once again this has to do with the black and
              white thing. The world isn't that simple and it is becoming a lot
              more complex with each passing day. God does not punish according
              to the old testaments ten commandments anymore, rather he punishes
              based on the sins of the heart and mind. Let me give two
              contrasting examples.<br> <br> You are born into a good society with good moral values, therefore
              you can decide easily for yourself what it is that makes a person
              "good" or rather "holy." However, there are many cases where people
              in the world are not as "blessed" as you are. So God has to judge
              from the light emitted from their souls, but then how is that fair
              to those who are born into unjust environments? Is God so cruel as
              to merely cast them away? No, hardly.<br> <br> The thing is that if you are a person born of the cruelest
              environments, and you had to steal, survive, and murder for a
              living, and that was all that you knew, then wouldn't that be
              extremely unfair to be condemned to a hell on earth, only to be
              condemned to hell for not knowing any better? For a lot of these
              people, it is what comes from inside of them that matters. If for
              one day, for even a single instance, this person who was raised in
              this environment can ever sympathize and refrain from killing a
              person, then in the eyes of God, this act of refraining from
              killing is worth more to God than anything I or anyone born of a
              good environment could ever do. For a person with no moral
              background, coming to his own senses and realizing the pain and
              sadness he brings to others is a greater act than anything you or I
              can do, who do know the difference between what is good and
              bad.</p>
              </div>

              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">to put it simply, the Christian gospel is a very counter cultural one. In more ways than one. You won't like what you hear the first time, and it becomes even harder when you start to understand more. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The good news here is that God won't admit evil doers to heaven (including "christians" who cheat, lie and steal, rapists, murders, etc). The bad news is that God won't admit those who do good too. Why? Because there is no one who does good. Everyone's guilty of some sin one way or another. If you say you have no sin, you're a liar.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So how? The question to ask then is not "how can God let anyone go to hell" but rather, "how can a holy God allow anyone into heaven at all"? It's not about doing good deeds to earn your way into His good books. To think one can do that is delusional. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Jesus spoke on the beatitudes to inform his audience about the characteristics of a true member of the kingdom of heaven. The "blessed"-ness are more than just temporal fleeting feelings of happiness but a state of well being in relationship to God that belongs to those who respond to Jesus' ministry. The first one (Matt 5:3) that speaks about the "poor in spirit" are those who recognize they are in need of God's help and are spiritually bankrupt. Does this look like someone who claims to have no sin, no need for God's intervention, not just in the international state of affairs but in his current condition? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It's counter cultural because nobody likes to be totally vulnerable and be told they're no good. Worth nothing. Have come till the end of the road. Unable to help themselves at all. We've been taught to be self sufficient, that we're ok. Immediately, the first response of the Christian in taking their baby steps to faith is to recognize that apart from the grace of God (demonstrated by Christ's cruxificion and resurrection), they can do nothing. (Which is a far cry from the brash showmanship of the modern health and wealth preachers, or those who "brag" or "boast" about others going to hell and they're not) </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It's also further counter cultural because we're asked to wait, to be patient / long suffering and expect the second return of Christ. Who likes to wait? We want something, we want it now... What's more we're told to die to ourselves, reduce our previous nature more and more, place the other person higher than ourselves... you learn too that broad is the road that leads to death and destruction and narrow and hard is the road that leads to life. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So it's not a simple matter of doing good or refrain from evil that will help you to gain entry into heaven. When you think you've got the Christian God figured out, think again, not because He's unknowable but because His ways are really beyond our ways (counter cultural?). Being a "Christian" entails believing certain things (Christ's sacrifice and meaning) and living out the truth of those things that have changed. End of the day, it's still being able to believe as what the writer writes rhetorically in Genesis 18:25, "Shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just?"</p>
