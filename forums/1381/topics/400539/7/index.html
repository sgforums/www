              <p>It doesnt matter if the bible did really say did or dint. But actually the problem is should christains go around promoting all these ? Comes back to my question, if humans are free will, shouldnt it be left to affinty  to seek god and not the other way ? Should you really preech to non-believers and shove beliefs down their throat ?</p>

              <p>If you ask me: Woud you join the church XXX ? My answer would be : no. why? You have eyes, and you can see whether the church is good or bad. Yes, there are churches that focus <strong>too much </strong>on things that are not meant to be.

              <p>What does it mean the chance to know God? Buying bible to read @ home, asking friends on what is Christianity, self-reflecting on who exactly is God. Not necessary means going to the church. Basically means there are resources for you to know, but you choose not to know.</p>
              <p>It does not mean:</p>

              <p>Going to church in this way. = going for the sake of not going to hell. not for the sake of God. it is a self-centered way of thinking. It focuses on me, and not on God.</p>

              <p>This is it.   Did I not tell you to let people make their choice?  I did not want to be repeating what you said to respond.    Many are pissed off by negatively aggressive christians "forcing down their throat" by feeding christianity by compulsion.</p>
              <p>Action speaks louder than words.  Behaviour is the best that christians can preach their belief.  As I said it in this thread or other thread, I did come across non believers became christian because of one christian's behaviour.    Important that the words preached and action must complement each other.</p>

              <p>I do admit it's overboard to " shove beliefs down their throat " </p>
              <p>This is it.   Did I not tell you to let people make their choice?  I did not want to be repeating what you said to respond.    Many are pissed off by negatively aggressive christians "forcing down their throat" by feeding christianity by compulsion.</p>
              <p>Action speaks louder than words.  Behaviour is the best that christians can preach their belief.  As I said it in this thread or other thread, I did come across non believers became christian because of one christian's behaviour.    Important that the words preached and action must complement each other.</p>

I believe Rony Tan was let off very lightly by ISD, not even a fine. its like a slap in the wrist because he was a religious leader with a few thousand followers and this has the potential to create unrest among other faiths, esp when singapore is a multi cultural society.</p></div>

              <p>even society can give convicted criminals a second chance (not necessarily true) and the state is willing to rehabilitate those who commited minor and serious crimes by educating them so that they do not re-offend when released. spore even have the yellow ribbon and SCORE to help them look for a job when they are released.</p>
              <p>if god is being portrayed as merciful and compassionate, why doesnt god give second chance to those who does not believe in him and condemned him/her to eternal hell? and why are Jews (why not the chinese, indians, english, germans etc) are his favoured people. doesnt this smack of favouritism?</p>

              <p>i know that you are a christian.. sorry to ask are you a catholic? Have you read the CCC or cathechism of the Catholic Church?? </p>
              <p>While Christ is the way to etrenal life.. let's us not forget that God almighty is full of compassionate and hope.. Yr Beilef states that non christian will go to hell because of his non belifef in christ.. that's too judgemental..and worst is a sweeping statement.  .Who are we to judge a person  life after death.. only God knows his or her soul.. similarly a christian or catholic  who did a lot of evil in his lifetime and on his death bed may ask God for pardon and peace and God may grant him eternal life. We do not know the state of a person's soul after his or her death.. so in our catholic tradition we pray or offer Novena or mass for that's person soul hopeing that God in his mercy and goodness will grant him eternal life.. Btw, Novena is a latin word for 9. Thats why devotees of our lady goes to Novena church for 9 times to intercede or request for something..</p>
