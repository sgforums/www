              <p>Free will</p>
              <p>lol.</p>
              <p>Paradoxes ? </p>
              <p>Free will to touch the fire or not is up to you. But I told you that the fire is hot and u will get hurt and get burnt. </p>
              <p>Now u have the free will to choose to listen to me, or you can touch the fire. Its up to you. THAT is called free will. The free will for you to choose and do what u think you must. But like all actions there will be consequences. Just dont come bitching back to me saying that the fire is hot and I didnt tell you so.</p>
              <p>If by thinking that my advice to u is restricting your autonomy then you can do exactly the opposite by touching the fire. Before even attempting to talk about free will and paradoxes, maybe one should understand what exactly is free will.</p>
              <p>This implies that man is a responsible being, possessing freedom of 
              choice to obey or disobey. Man's actions, emanating from his will, are 
              his own, for which he is, therefore, accountable.</p>
              <p>But then what is <strong>free will</strong> ? Below will just be cut n paste.</p>
              <p>Judaism -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God tells Cain that although he is subject to powerful 
              emotions and sin "couches at the door; its urge is toward you, yet you 
              can be its master" (Gen. 4:7). After reviewing their history, <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/moses">Moses</a> tells the people of Israel that the key to their national destiny is 
              ultimately in their own hands: "I have set before you life and death, 
              the blessing and the curse, therefore choose life" (Deut. 30:19).</p>
              <p>This
               principle of man's freedom of will has been described as "a great 
              principle and pillar of the Torah and the Mitsvot (Maim., <em>Yad</em>, <em>Teshuvah</em> 5:3). The entire concept of repentance, Teshuvah, which is taught in 
              the Pentateuch (Deut. 4:30, 31, 30:11-14), emphasized by the prophets 
              (e.g. Hos. 14:2-3), and is the heart of the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/yom-kippur">Day
               of Atonement</a> service, presumes freedom of the will. This constant 
              call to man to return to God with the promise of Divine forgiveness 
              assumes that man has the power to free himself from his past, from his 
              set ways, and change completely. Indeed, God wishes man to come to Him 
              voluntarily, out of free choice. God does not overwhelm but waits for 
              man's response (Ex. 19:8)</p>
              <p>Biblical law clearly distinguishes 
              between intentional and unintentional acts (Num. 35:1-34). Jewish law 
              treats at length the limits of legal and moral responsibility and the 
              effects of various degrees of compulsion upon the individual (<em>BK</em> 8:4).</p>
              <p>Not all Jews accepted human free will. The <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/essene">Essenes</a> believed in predestination and held that everything was predetermined 
              by the Divine will, while the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/sadducee">Sadducees</a> denied Divine Providence and felt that everything occurred by chance. 
              The rabbis reiterate the biblical concept of man's freedom: "All is in 
              the hands of heaven except the fear of heaven" (<em>Ber</em>. 33b). "The 
              angel appointed over conception takes a seminal drop, sets it before the
               Holy One, Blessed be He, and asks, 'Sovereign of the universe, what is 
              to become of this drop? Is it to develop into a person strong or weak, 
              wise or foolish, rich or poor?' But no mention is made of its becoming 
              wicked or righteous." This is left to the person himself (<em>Nid</em>. 
              16b).</p>
              <p>The first challenge to the concept of free will came from 
              the sphere of theology itself, from the concept of God's omniscience or 
              foreknowledge. If God knows everything in advance, how could man have 
              freedom of choice? The talmudic rabbis simply affirmed both principles 
              without attempting any solution: "Everything is foreseen yet permission 
              (freedom) is given" (<em>Avot</em> 3:15). Maimonides (<em>Yad</em>, <em>ibid</em>.
               5:5) discusses the problem and suggests that God's "knowledge" is 
              completely different from man's knowledge. This has been interpreted to 
              mean that since God is above time, His is not strictly "foreknowledge." 
              God knows the future intuitively in that He sees the future as part of 
              an eternal present. Hence His knowledge does not conflict with man's 
              freedom of choice. Even when God providentially intervenes in history, 
              He does not interfere with the inner workings of man's volition and the 
              integrity of man's selfhood (Maim. <em>ibid</em>. 5:4). The "hardening of 
              the heart of Pharaoh" (Ex. 4:21) is construed as a restoration of 
              Pharaoh's own free will in face of the coercive effects of the plagues 
              (NahÌ£manides).</p>
              <p>Judaism's insistence upon the existence of human 
              freedom would seem to conflict with the implications of much of 
              contemporary psychology, which sees the mind of man, like the rest of 
              nature, locked into a tight causal nexus. This implies that were enough 
              known about the character, background, and circumstances of any 
              individual, all of his decisions could be predicted. The 
              biblical-rabbinic concept of moral responsibility, on the other hand, 
              seems to be compatible only with a libertarian concept of contra-causal 
              freedom and incompatible with any sort of deterministic theory.</p>
              <p>Modern
               Jewish thinkers have suggested, in reply to this challenge, that if 
              man, alone of all creatures, possesses categorical freedom in which the 
              self can originate changes, then this provides a dramatic manifestation 
              of man's having been created "in the image of God" (Gen. 1:26). Even as 
              God, the Prime Mover, created the world "out of nothing," so does man, 
              each time he makes a moral decision, act as a self-originating creative 
              power.</p>
              <p>These thinkers hold that with each moral decision man 
              experiences his selfhood, his ability to feel and act as an "I." 
              Furthermore, with each such decision, he builds and extends his own 
              character and personality. In short, in making moral choices in freedom,
               man works his <em>tselem</em> ("image of God") into <em>demut</em> (likeness of God) <em>(ibid.</em>) and thus fulfills his humanity (see 
              also <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/ethics-legal-term">Ethics</a>).</p>
              <p><strong>Philosophical Dictionary - Free Will</strong></p>
              <p>The problem is to reconcile our everyday consciousness of ourselves as 
              agents, with the best view of what science tells us that we are. <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/biological-determinism">Determinism</a> is one part of the problem. It may be defined as the doctrine that 
              every event has a cause. More precisely, for any event <em>e</em>, there 
              will be some antecedent state of nature, <em>N</em>, and a law of nature, <em>L</em>,
               such that given <em>L</em>, <em>N</em> will be followed by <em>e</em>. But if
               this is true of every event, it is true of events such as my doing 
              something or choosing to do something. So my choosing or doing something
               is fixed by some antecedent state <em>N</em> and the laws. Since 
              determinism is universal these in turn are fixed, and so backwards to 
              events for which I am clearly not responsible (events before my birth, 
              for example). So no events can be voluntary or free, where that means 
              that they come about purely because of my willing them when I could have
               done otherwise. If determinism is true, then there will be antecedent 
              states and laws already determining such events; how then can I truly be
               said to be their author, or be responsible for them? Reactions to this 
              problem are commonly classified as:</p>
              <p>(i) hard determinism. This accepts 
              the conflict and denies that you have real freedom or responsibility.</p>
              <p>(ii) Soft determinism or compatibilism. Reactions in this family assert 
              that everything you should want from a notion of freedom is quite 
              compatible with determinism. In particular, even if your action is 
              caused, it can often be true of you that you could have done otherwise <em>if</em> you had chosen, and this may be enough to render you liable to be held 
              responsible or to be blamed if what you did was unacceptable (the fact 
              that previous events will have caused you to choose as you did is deemed
               irrelevant on this option).</p>
              <p>(iii) <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/libertarianism">Libertarianism</a>.
               This is the view that, while compatibilism is only an evasion, there is
               a more substantive, real notion of freedom that can yet be preserved in
               the face of determinism (or of <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/indeterminism">indeterminism</a>).</p>
              <p>In <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/immanuel-kant">Kant</a>,
               while the empirical or phenomenal self is determined and not free, the 
              noumenal or rational self is capable of rational, free action. But since
               the noumenal self exists outside the categories of space and time, this
               freedom seems to be of doubtful value. Other libertarian avenues 
              include suggesting that the problem is badly framed, for instance 
              because the definition of determinism breaks down; or postulating a 
              special category of uncaused acts of volition; or suggesting that there 
              are two independent but consistent ways of looking at an agent, the 
              scientific and the humanistic, and it is only through confusing them 
              that the problem seems urgent. None of these avenues has gained general 
              popularity. It is an error to confuse determinism and <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/fatalism">fatalism</a>.

              <p><strong>Columbia Encyclopedia - Free Will</strong></p>
              <p><span class="hw">Free will,</span> in philosophy, the doctrine that an 
              individual, regardless of forces external to him, can and does choose at
               least some of his actions. The existence of free will is challenged by <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/determinism">determinism</a>.
               A denial of free will was implicit in <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/plato-philosopher">Plato</a>'s
               argument that, because no one would deliberately choose a worse over a 
              better course of action, people's decisions are determined by their 
              understanding (or ignorance) of what constitutes the good. <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/aristotle">Aristotle</a> disagreed; he distinguished between reason and desire, pointing out 
              that people sometimes do what they desire even when they know it will 
              harm themselves or others. Some Stoics sought to adapt the idea of free 
              will to their rigorous form of determinism; <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/chrysippus">Chrysippus</a> emphasized that action could be produced by choice which itself had 
              antecedent causes.</p>
              <p>In the Christian philosophical tradition a central 
              question regarding freedom of the will was this: is virtue within the 
              power of the individual or completely dependent on the power of God? St.
               <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/st-augustine-of-hippo">Augustine</a>,
               although he argued that God's foreknowledge of human actions (a 
              consequence of his omniscience) did not cause them, did hold that God's 
              omnipotent providence implied <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/predestination">predestination</a>:
               man was wholly dependent on divine grace. St. <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/thomas-aquinas">Thomas
               Aquinas</a> maintained the freedom of man's will in spite of divine 
              omnipotence, holding that God's omnipotence meant he could do all things
               possible or consistent with his goodness and reason, which did not 
              include the predetermination of human will. <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/william-of-ockham">William
               of Occam</a> affirmed free will but claimed it impossible for any human
               to comprehend how it is compatible with God's foreknowledge and 
              omniscience, which cannot be distinguished from his role as prime mover 
              and original cause. Martin <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/martin-luther">Luther</a> and John <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/john-calvin">Calvin</a> both followed Augustine's doctrine of predestination, but later 
              Protestant writers disputed their position. Advocates of free will have 
              usually begun with the overwhelming testimony of common practice and 
              common sense: people do believe they in some way determine their 
              actions, and hold each other accountable for them.</p>
              <p>Therefore advocates 
              of free will have argued that the human will, unlike inanimate things, 
              can initiate its own activity. This position has been called into 
              question by experiments, first undertaken by American neuroscientist 
              Benjamin Libet in the 1970s, that have shown that brain signals 
              associated with decisions concerning actions occur before a human being 
              is conscious of making a decision.</p>
              <p><strong>Free will</strong> is the purported ability of <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/agency-philosophy">agents</a> to make <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/choice">choices</a> free from constraints. Historically, the constraint of dominant concern
               has been the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/metaphysics">metaphysical</a> constraint of <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/determinism">determinism</a>.
               The opposing positions within that debate are <em><a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/libertarianism">metaphysical
               libertarianism</a></em>, the claim that determinism is false and thus 
              that free will exists; and <em>hard determinism</em>, the claim that 
              determinism is true and thus that free will does not exist.</p>
              <p>Both of these positions, which agree that causal determination is the
               relevant factor in the question of free will, are classed as <em><a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/hard-incompatibilism">incompatibilists</a></em>.
               Those who deny that determinism is relevant are classified as <em><a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/hard-incompatibilism">compatibilists</a></em>,
               and offer various alternative explanations of what constraints are 
              relevant, such as physical constraints (e.g. chains or imprisonment), 
              social constraints (e.g. threat of punishment or censure), or 
              psychological constraints (e.g. compulsions or phobias).</p>
              <p><strong>The principle of free will has <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/religion">religious</a>,
               <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/ethics-legal-term">ethical</a>,
               and <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/science">scientific</a> implications.</strong> For example, in the religious realm, free will implies 
              that an <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/omnipotence-2">omnipotent</a> <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/divinity">divinity</a> does not assert its power over individual <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/will">will</a> and <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/choice">choices</a>.
               In ethics, it may hold implications regarding whether individuals can 
              be held morally accountable for their actions.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The question of free will
               has been a central issue since the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/history-of-philosophy">beginning
