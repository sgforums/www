              <p>ok, this is becoming quite amusing.</p>
              <p>Let's assume this god exists ok, for the sake of argument-  What good is bringing you to heaven if you don't believe in him (to believe in him also means that you would have a meaningful personal relationship with him and that he loves you and has the best for you, etc...), because that would be hell for you then?</p>
              <p>Can you imagine spending an eternity with someone whom you don't love? Praising him for his goodness, singing about mercies, talking to him... doing all these when you don't love him? (horrors!) Sounds hellish ...</p>

              <p>not true. Read my analogy again. To bring them to heaven <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the first place</span> is not "kind", it's performing an act against the will of the individual. He's forcing these people to do something they don't want to do. If i remember correctly, this kind of "god" who forces people is not a very welcome concept too. SO damn if he does, damn if he doesn't. </p>
              <p>God didn't condemn these people. They "condemned" themselves (so to speak). Read the reply of the person who posted after me, "<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">if thats the case,<strong> i shall willingly go to hell</strong>. what is heaven when you live with someone youll never believe in?"  </span></p>
              <p>Once again, it would be "hell" to bring such people who don't believe unto him to heaven and worse, be in the (eternal) company of other people who would do nothing but talk about him all the time. I mean, there are already people in this forum channel who don't like the quoting of Scriptures. What's more of all places, in a Christian forum?!?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>technically, from what they believe, it's not blackmailing. They perceive a dichotomy and they're telling you about it. Taken from another perspective, they are as the topic suggests, "uneasy" about non Christians going to hell, and so out of a good heart, warn others about it. In that case, you can fault their message but you can't fault their intentions. </p>
              <p>In any case, i've not come across anyone who has come to believe because of their fears of hell or wanting to avoid hell. I would think there's a very low success rate with this way of "preaching", if not, it definitely won't be helping to make true converts. The gospel is not about hell but about how Christ has made atonement for the penalty of sins. </p>

              <p>hi imacatt,</p>
              <p>i'm a catholic..</p>
              <p>pls stop talking or imagine that non christians will go to hell if they dun believe in christ. That's utter rubbish..</p>
              <p>If at the end of the non christian life, he or she did good deeds or behave in a manner that is christ like and he or she is not even conscious of it.. she may have eternal life. While Christ is the only way to eternal life.. let's us not be judgemental towards others esp abt after death.. We are not God. and we can't decide his after life. That's for God to judge. We can only pray for him or her.</p>
              <p>Same thing for those who condemn catholics too! Please for goodness sake, we are christians .. believers of Christ. While non catholics may see that some catholics always pray to mother mary..seems idolatroy..but it is not they are asking her to pray for them..</p>
              <p>To be a good evangeliser, we need to be good listeners. Very impt.. We invite them to experience our "God" or "come and see" another way of living to know God.. Invite but dun pressurise or criticise  them.of their present religion. . let them have 1st hand knowledge of what christianity is all abt.. it can be just simple talk. a smile or invite them to mass or service. If they refuse.. stop at there.. maybe it's not time yet.. Just pray God will show the way..</p>

              <p>I take it that you read all my post on page 3. It was never meant to be like that. As time passes, people start to sell their soul to money/power/position/fame etc etc. Religion was never meant to be this way. Use religion as a means of moral guide lines to make yourself a better person. Thats what i can say.</p>
