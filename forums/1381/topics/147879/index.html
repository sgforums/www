How do you define a "bad" relationship... this statement is too sweeping and arbitary... what sort of covenant are you under? OT covenant is by salvation by law, which you will never attain unless you can keep all the law without failing in one little aspect... not just the ten commandments, but the other "commandments" which are also found in the book of deuteronomy which number over 300.<br><br>NT covenant is salvation by grace through faith. It is a gift from God so that no man may boast.<br><br>The Bible says, no man shall come to the Father except through Me. Ie...through Jesus. Unless you are a jew, then what basis do you have to say that you will go to Heaven or hell based on the relationship you have with God? The Bible also does say that in the end times, many will call upon the name of God and say that they did this or that thing in His name, but God will say to them, away with you evil doers for I do not know you.<br><br>The statement you make presupposes that you believe in the God of the Jews, the God in the Bible... not some other "god".... do you believe in God? If you do, then do you believe in Jesus? If you do, then do you believe that He died to save you from your sins? Do you belive that all are sinners... yourself included and thus need a saviour? Is your name written in the book of life? This will determine whether you go to Heaven or hell. Ball is in your court, your choice, you choose your path. Time is ticking.... Jesus is coming back SOON!<br><br>As a gentile (anybody other than a jew is a gentile) your relationship with God does not determine whether you go to Heaven or hell... only the jews have a standard by which God can judge them... and only they can lay claim to this covenant which will last forever...</div>

And that includes spiritual death.<br>But the gift of Eternal life is though Jesus Christ our Lord. Jesus tasted death for each of us to make it possible for each person to attain forgiveness of sins and be reconciled to God through faith in His shed Blood. But that is not automatic. It takes faith in Christ Jesus to appropriate what He did for us.<br><br>Sin cannot go into Heaven. And those who have unforgiven sins will not go to Heaven. So what is the solution for those who want to go to Heaven?<br><br>First of all, a person needs to recognize his/her need for Jesus Christ.<br>Those who do not acknowledge their sins are in a somewhat dangerous position because they do not see their need to be forgiven. Also,<br>they are usually quite prideful and do not want to acknowledge Christ.<br><br>Jesus died for our sins and rose again on the third day. We will be raised also someday. I look forward to Heaven. But, the peace with God now, through faith in Jesus Christ is something that I am very thankful for too.<br><br>Every day I feel thankful that Jesus dwells within my heart. The joy of the Lord is my strength. I am very thankful for everything that Jesus did for me.<br>And I hope that as you are reading this you will realize that God also loves you and wants to forgive your sins and get rid of that guilt and shame.<br><br>Also, blessings to those of you who already have Christ Jesus dwelling in your hearts through faith.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Kathreen<br><br>P.

            <div class='col-md body'>About the Jews and salvation:<br><br>In this dispensation - salvation is the same for them as it is for anyone else.<br><br>That is to say, they can be saved by grace through faith in Christ Jesus.<br>They also need their sins forgiven to get into Heaven.<br>But they stay stuck in the old Law it seems, at least those who do believe in God at all.<br>Many do not believe in God - just like the rest of humanity.<br>Jesus is the narrow way to God. The other ways lead to destruction.<br><br>Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. Pride caused Satan to get kicked out of Heaven.<br>And pride will keep many people from entering Heaven.</div>
