            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry ah.<br><br>Really not used to discussion without the verse. So there you go - the amplified version.<br>_____________________________________________________________________<br><br><strong>Genesis 3</strong><br><br>1NOW THE serpent was more subtle and crafty than any living creature of the field which the Lord God had made. And he [Satan] said to the woman, Can it really be that God has said, You shall not eat from every tree of the garden?(A)<br><br>2And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit from the trees of the garden,<br><br>3Except the fruit from the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.<br><br>4But the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die,(B)<br><br>5For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing the difference between good and evil and blessing and calamity.<br><br>6And when the woman saw that the tree was good (suitable, pleasant) for food and that it was delightful to look at, and a tree to be desired in order to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she gave some also to her husband, and he ate.<br><br>7Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves apronlike girdles.<br><br>8And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.<br><br>9But the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, Where are you?<br><br>10He said, I heard the sound of You [walking] in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.<br><br>11And He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?<br><br>12And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me--she gave me [fruit] from the tree, and I ate.<br><br>13And the Lord God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled (cheated, outwitted, and deceived) me, and I ate.<br><br>14And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all [domestic] animals and above every [wild] living thing of the field; upon your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust [and what it contains] all the days of your life.<br><br>15And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her [a]Offspring; He will bruise and tread your head underfoot, and you will lie in wait and bruise His heel.(C)<br><br>16To the woman He said, I will greatly multiply your grief and your suffering in pregnancy and the pangs of childbearing; with spasms of distress you will bring forth children. Yet your desire and craving will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.<br><br>17And to Adam He said, Because you have listened and given heed to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it, the ground is under a curse because of you; in sorrow and toil shall you eat [of the fruits] of it all the days of your life.<br><br>18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.<br><br>19In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you shall return.<br><br>20The man called his wife's name Eve [life spring], because she was the mother of all the living.<br><br>21For Adam also and for his wife the Lord God made long coats (tunics) of skins and clothed them.<br><br>22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man has become like one of Us [the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit], to know [how to distinguish between] good and evil and blessing and calamity; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live [b]forever--<br><br>23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.<br><br>24So [God] drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden the [c]cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep and guard the way to the tree of life.(D)<br><br></div>

Whatever's in the bible, taken out of context and only quoting certain parts of a whole, and literally just reading a certain statement, is very inaccurate.<br><br>Are u speaking of what the Church decree, or what God has decreed? And don't come tell me the bible is God's decree. The bible is MAN's decree, written by the hand of man, tainted by the hand of man, AND claimed to be the word of God. Don't be so quick to explictly trust everything in the Bible as THE word of God.<br><br>The Church has for years used the bible to subjudcate women, and I doubt if that is what God wants and I doubt if the bible is exactly the word of God. Certainly a memo from God, the bible is not. It's more like a reporter reporting on an event, different reporters write with different perspectives. What the report says does not change the truth of the event, and choosing to believe any event exclusively from one single report is stupid. and stupidity seems to be Adam's main sin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">according to the bible? Whatever's in the bible, taken out of context and only quoting certain parts of a whole, and literally just reading a certain statement, is very inaccurate.<br><br>Are u speaking of what the Church decree, or what God has decreed? And don't come tell me the bible is God's decree. The bible is MAN's decree, written by the hand of man, tainted by the hand of man, AND claimed to be the word of God. Don't be so quick to explictly trust everything in the Bible as THE word of God.<br><br>The Church has for years used the bible to subjudcate women, and I doubt if that is what God wants and I doubt if the bible is exactly the word of God. Certainly a memo from God, the bible is not. It's more like a reporter reporting on an event, different reporters write with different perspectives. What the report says does not change the truth of the event, and choosing to believe any event exclusively from one single report is stupid. and stupidity seems to be Adam's main sin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Some believe that being submissive means to simply obey and to deny personal feelings, desires, expectations, and dreams. They think a wife is not submissive if she shares her opinions with her husband.<br><br>Worse, countless women have been sent back to their homes and told to submit to abusive husbandsÂ— in some cases without anyone ever speaking to him about how he treats her. Some even believe that wives who are abused cause the abuse by their lack of submission.<br><br>This false concept of submission is often used to manipulate and control women. It advocates quiet obedience and subservience, and denies a womanÂ’s irreplaceable value in her marital relationship. It also ignores the potential for a man to be heavy-handed and unloving in his attempt to be the "ruler" of his home.<br><br>Unfortunately, some Christian leaders have contributed to this false concept of submission by overlooking the husbandÂ’s obligation to love his wife. This is an extreme misrepresentation of PaulÂ’s intent in Ephesians 5:22-30 .<br><br>Others have accused the apostle Paul of being a male chauvinist, one who didnÂ’t respect women or see their value. If we consider what Paul wrote within his culture, however, we see that Paul had a high view of men and women. He understood how they can best work together in marriage to reflect ChristÂ’s love for us.<br><br>In a day when men married for money, Paul strongly stated that husbands were obligated to love their wives (see also Colossians 3:19 ). PaulÂ’s words to husbands were revolutionary in Greco-Roman society. Most men married not for love but for financial gain. Marriages were usually arranged, and the father of the bride provided a dowryÂ— a portion of money, clothes, jewelry, and possibly slaves.<br><br>PaulÂ’s instructions for marriage were a breath of fresh air. His thoughts were not those of a man who degraded women and wanted to "keep them in their place." Quite the oppositeÂ— he elevated women to a place where they are to be loved as Christ loves the church. That is pretty radical thinking!<br><br>It is significant that Paul compared a husband and a wife to Christ and the church. He regarded marriage so highly that it is used as an analogy of Christ and His relationship to the church. If the husband is the head of the wife in the same way that Christ is the head of the church, we can safely draw conclusions from the comparison of ChristÂ’s relationship to His bride, the church.<br><br>Christ loves His bride and is her Savior. Christ gave His life for her. Likewise, the husband is to love his wife as Christ loves His church. A husbandÂ’s love should be sacrificial, nourishing, cherishing, and protective. A man should love his wife in the same way he loves his own body ( Ephesians 5:25,28 ).<br><br>The same level of devotion as required of the husband to love is required of the wife to submit ( Ephesians 5:22 ). Before looking at submission unique to a wife, though, we need to remember that Paul advocates mutual submission between believers ( Ephesians 5:21 ). No one is to demand or force another to yield; submission is voluntary. The Bible doesnÂ’t say that itÂ’s a husbandÂ’s responsibility to see to it that his wife submits to him.<br><br>A wifeÂ’s submission to her husband is in response to her love and devotion to the Lord first. She submits to the Lord out of a humble and grateful heart, not because she is a slave, but a servant. Likewise, biblical submission in marriage is servanthood, not enslavement. A godly wife is motivated to submit to her husband, not out of fear, self-interest, or self-protection, but out of love ( 1 Peter 3:6 ).<br><br>Scripture does not define submission as mindless obedience to a husbandÂ’s every wish or demand. Nor is it avoiding an argument at all cost. Instead, submission is a deep commitment to a person. It is choosing to work with oneÂ’s mate in a way that promotes oneness. A married couple becomes one flesh and must work as a team ( Genesis 2:26 ). Constant fighting and arguing works against a couple trying to become unified.<br><br>To illustrate, a team player must submit to the guidance of his coach. A good coach guides the team in strategy and utilizes the strengths of the players for the success of the team. A gifted player may debate a point with his coach, but there comes a point when, if they continue to disagree, the player must submit to his coach. Likewise, the wife, at times, must put aside her disagreements and follow the lead of her husband, whom God has placed in her life as the head. (Sometimes, it is not in the best interest of either the wife or the husband to submit, as in the case of abuse.)<br><br>Marriage, according to GodÂ’s design, is a relationship that returns love for love, service for service. Husbands and wives love and sacrifice for one another differently. Husbands love their wives by protecting, cherishing, and serving them. Wives submit to their husbands out of respect and love. Both the husband and the wife are given vast opportunities to show ChristÂ’s love to one another. It is not always easy, but marriages can best reflect GodÂ’s redemptive work in our lives by following the principles of Christlike love and submission.<br></div>
