She has sinned? </div></blockquote>I agree it was Eve that sinned and later on, Adam sinned too. Everyman is responsible for his own doings, we cannot tell God that it was another person who forced us to sin. We had a free will.<br><br>As for your argument, when she CONTEMPLATED - meaning that she is making a choice - she still has not sinned.  Take a look at Matthew 5:28<br><br>"But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."<br><br>The key word here is the word "LUSTFULLY".  The sin is not committed when we look at a woman - if thats the case - I think we would sin 1000 times a day haha - but when  look at the woman and choose to go one step further to lust after her.  When the choice is made, that is when we sinned.<br><br>Another example, I am very poor. My friend comes up to me and say, Hey, why not you help me sell off this batch of ecsatcy and I will give you $5000.  At this point of time, I am given a choice and I have to comtemplate between choices, I believe I have not sinned. But if I go a step further and agree to sell it, then I believe that is sin.<br><br>Thats my opinion anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
