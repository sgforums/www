            <div class='col-md body'>What I believed:<br><br>Origin of humanity's first sin = disobeying GOD by having doubt in what he said<br>(Adam and Eve listened to the serpent instead of having faith in GOD). This is the first instance when men turned from their faith and decided that they can control their own destiny and be like GOD, knowing good and evil.<br><br>I believed a lot is up to us men. No doubt, we can be tempted. But all of us are responsible for our own actions. By choosing to believe in a serpent and not the LORD, men had fall from grace and death is the consequence. But in Christ, when he gave us his grace this relationship was re-established with GOD. GOD is not and will not be angry with us forever. GOD is patient with us and love us. We just need to have a little faith in him. Even a little faith can grow. Which is why I believed we need to be motivated ourselves to know GOD.<br><br>Instead I believe it is men who are always angry with GOD, blaming him for all the wrongs in the world without realising their own actions.</div>
