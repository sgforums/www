              <p>What was their crime? They were distributing materials that were
              deemed offensive to other religions. Distributing
              tracts itself was NOT the offense they were indicted for. If I
              distribute Christmas tracts that preach Jesus as the reason for the
              season, you think this is against the law? Of course not. You can
              throw away the tract just like you throw away the housing agent
              tracts.</p>

              <p>To say aggressive is not saying much. If you are very sensitive, you can even say handing a tract to you is aggressive. And have you heard the complaint that talking about Christianity on forums is aggressive because it is shoving the Gospel down the throats of people? This is patently absurd because each person controls what he clicks and what he wants to read and see. But the point I am making is that whether it is aggressive or not very much depends and differs from person-to-person. So long as you are not held against your will or is physically manhandled or is being stalked like a hawk, I think it doesn't fit the idea of aggressive. Heck, some may even think singing carols is offensive!</p>

              <p>Like I said, it is the CONTENT of the message that gets one into trouble. Is preaching to a Muslim illegal? I don't know, can you cite a law saying that? Some actions may violate the religious harmony bill, and that really depends on a case-by-case basis. I don't think there is anything to say that one form of evangelism is illegal. But I am ready to be corrected if you can cite some law on that.</p>

              That should be for you to prove, not me. Please get this right: the reason why I say it is unlawful to ban evangelism is because the Constitution provides and protects for the freedom of religion and its propagation. To ban evangelism is to act against the Constitution. If you insist that doing so is lawful, then you have to prove it. It is really absurd to ask me to prove it is unlawful to ban evangelism when it should be you proving that it is lawful, and when I have already shown that evangelism is provided and protected by law.

              Don't waste my time lah. If banning evangelism is not a violation of the Constitution then I don't know what is. In any case, you JUST made the claim again that it is lawful, so you prove it.
