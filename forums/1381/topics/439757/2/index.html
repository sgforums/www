              <p>christians way of explaining if you ask them why this is so and so. this will make you flabbergasted even more, cos you know the answers to your questions are really illogical and irrational, not to mention irrelevance.</p>

              <p>the reason why I ignore them is this. they have turned aggressively and rude these days. once before I can say no thanks, that ass shouted at me, as though not to ignore him and give him the chance to elaborate when he saw my body language.</p>
              <p>so even if they were to shout or whatever, I cant be bothered anymore. what for they focus on someone who is not interested in their products or services, better concentrate on those who are interested isnt it better this way.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your advice.     I am interested in other religions, I mean finding out more about them.    I am not ready for any religious commitment.     I am thankful I do meet nice and kind christians though not many.     </p>
