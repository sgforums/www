              <p>I am not demonising christians, they are nice people in fact. but the fact is this, u go evangelise people of other faiths or even people with no religion in public, people will be put off, say you will go to hell when you die or your religion is false. dun u think this is really a put off, not to mention lack of respect for the person's religion. anyway alot of people doesnt have a good impression of christianity, thanks to the extreme evangelism in public.</p>
              <p>I ever went to Australia and heard this aussie guy on a friday evening at a tram stop, spouting christianity beliefs, blah blah blah. he was alone, as if giving a public talk, when no one bothered listening to him and carry on with their business waiting for the tram to arrive. another time i was in a tram, this aussie came up to me and asked for my name and contact number, as he wanted to invite me to his church on Sunday. I gave him a fake name and number (I shouldnt done that, should have told him no, thanks, period).</p>

              <p>Your decision is well respected. Take your time to search and find. Sorry if some Christians are too aggressive and may be offensive, but do look beyong people for human often misrepresent God.</p>

              <p>There are many over zealous believers, and there are many who use MLM methods to sell their religion. Christians are taught to share the gospel, not to preach.</p>
              <p>It is regrettable that with all these misrepresentations so many people are distracted by the behaviour of some Christians instead of listening to the good news.</p>
              <p>Your belief is well respected. We should engage in discussion about what we believe instead of running each other down. .</p>

              <p>not beggars, but once i attended a very big proselytising event
              at indoor stadium, many churches sent many buses of migrant Chinese
              workers to the event, and they provide lots of packet lunches to
              the Chinese workers, those Chinese workers were so happy and all
              rushed to the food</p>
