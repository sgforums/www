              <p>I think you have to think through this a bit more. Both in logic and law, you cannot willy-nilly pick one thing you don't like and make a rule for it.<br><br>Instead, you have to think about why you don't like that thing. Is it because it's a public nuisance?</p>
              <p>If so, what about other things that are also a public nuisance? Would you apply the same rules to those?</p>
              <p>In short, a rule cannot be adhoc. It has to be consistent. You cannot make up a rule to ban religious evangelism because it's a public nuisance, and yet allow other similar forms of soliciting that are just as annoying.</p>

              <p><br>Agree. We cant 'willy nilly' pick whatever we choose to, so you need to let me know specifcally what you wish for both of us to discuss on.

              Rooney,
              
              To say that God is incomprehensible is not to say that nothing can be known about God. At the very least it means we do know one thing about God, that He is incomprehensible. It is like saying that women are incomprehensible yet we do know some things about them. To know God requires that God makes Himself known to us. To know what a girl thinks you would have to hear what she said. Otherwise you are only guessing.

              <p>Rooney,</p>
              <p>I think you see my point but just did not want to admit it. Yes, I cannot read your mind. But there are certain things I can know truly about you. Among them that you are human, intelligent, can speak and write English. Other things about you I need to hazard a guess which may be right or wrong. Still other things I can never know unless you choose to reveal them to me. In the same way this applies also to talking about God.

              <p>Why do you suppose Christians have the answer to everything? You expect us to be omniscient? Duh! Even God who is omniscient does not owe us an explanation for everything or anything. He has told us what He wanted us to know. The rest we shall find out when we see Him. How is this in invalid answer? You don't like this answer? Fine. What's your better answer? If you don't have any better answer, or don't even know how to answer it, then you should not make trouble for those who claim not to know either. You want to be objective and fair? Then walk the talk.</p>

              <p>That's where you are wrong. God has told us MANY things in the Bible. To say God NEVER explain anything is blatantly false. Point is, if God explain would you believe? If not, are you again patronising the faith?</p>
