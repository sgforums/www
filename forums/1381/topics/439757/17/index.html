              Please explain to laurence why the govt will not ban evangelism. I think he needs another atheist to tell him why he is plain wrong. And while you are at it please explain to him also the Constitution Article 15(1).

              It is precisely because I live with the law that I am free to evangelise, unlike you who seeks to go against the law as it now stands to ban evangelism. You should learn to be more tolerant towards the Christian faith.
