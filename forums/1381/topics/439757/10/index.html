              <p>You misread me. I do not want evangelism to be banned. I am just saying evangelism that OFFENDS other religions should be kept out, because it might cause religious conflict.</p>
              <p>Buddhists/Christians/Hindus should be allowed to spread their religion so long as they dont insult or bring down other religions.</p>

              <p>Tcmc, I don't think narrowing it down changes very much.</p>
              <p>Conflict: In our current society, I think it is almost certain that promoting gay rights will create more conflict than promoting Christianity. There isn't very much of the former going on, but you could see what Vivian Balakrishnan was trying to do with his thinly-veiled attacks on Vincent Wijeysingha during the last elections.</p>
              <p>Value: Studies have shown that Christians tend to live longer (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10332617). Others have suggested that children of gay parents may suffer from psychological issues (http://www.amazon.com/One-Man-Woman-Catholics-Defending/dp/1933184299).</p>
              <p>By both parameters, therefore, I would conclude that Christianity deserves to be promoted, more so than gay rights.</p>

              <p>1. I beg to differ. Just last year, there were 3 cases of people "promoting their religions" that resulted in tensions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Vivian was trying to garner votes from conservatives and usually the religious people. Shouldn't read too much into politics campaign. It's just to garner votes.</p>
              <p>3. Similarly studies have shown kids of gay parents do just as well, if not better. : <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1994480,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1994480,00.html</a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>To you promoting religion is much more valuable. But to me promoting basic human rights for gays to have a house is more important.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually i am curious. What's so offending to you about asking the govt to give gays who are human beings equal rights?</p>

              <p>My issue is with laurence82, who wants a blanket ban on (a). My point is that if he wants a ban on (a), then depending on his rationale, he probably has to ban (b) as well.<br><br>I'm also saying that by your yardsticks (tensions, value), we cannot accept (b) and yet deny (a).</p>

              <p>Don't be daft. Since when does freedom to propagate one's religion means we go around insulting people's religions? Please read that weblink I gave to laurence. The right to propagate religion is also further constrained (not banned) by other standing laws, e.g. religious harmony bill.</p>

              <p>You have an open wound and it is very sensitive. Do you ignore it and not talk about it? Or do you treat it carefully so as not to inflame it? The same with religion. Banning talk on religion is not the way to go. Regulating discussion on it may be a better option. Regulating as in making sure that discussion is kept cordial and trouble-makers are identified and chastised.</p>

              <p>My issue is with laurence82, who wants a blanket ban on (a). My
              point is that if he wants a ban on (a), then depending on his
