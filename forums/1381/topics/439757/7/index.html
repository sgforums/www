              <p>"<strong>Singapore courts have not yet interpreted the word <em>propagate</em> in Article 15(1) of the Constitution.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Article 25(1) of the Indian Constitution, which is in the same terms as in Article 15(1) of the Singapore Constitution, guarantees to individuals the right to freely "profess, practise and propagate" their religions. The term <em>propagate</em> was considered by the</strong> <a title="Supreme Court of India" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Supreme Court of India</strong></span></span></a> <strong>in <em><a title="Stanislaus v State of Madhya Pradesh" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Stanislaus_v_State_of_Madhya_Pradesh"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Stanislaus v.

              <p>Not copying the rest of the paragraph for the benefit of someone's laziness</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence,banning evangelism/proselytism is nothing unconstitutional. Offending other religion <strong>is unlawful</strong> going by past/current cases.</p>
              <p>if the courts need to sit down to define it, or if its to be struck off the Constitution for being 'unconstituitional', so be it.</p>
              <p>So, dont talk big throwing up big words such as 'constitutional' and make yourself look silly.</p>

              <p>You are shifting goalpost here. You were clearly ignorant about the part on the freedom to propagate one's religion as enshrined under our Constitution. Whatever the word "propagate" means in legal terms, it definitely does not negate the dictionary definition. So because the courts did not interpret the word "propagate" we don't know what it mean? Now that would be a silly conclusion.</p>

              You are wrong. I would be happy (qiu zi bu de) if a buddhist or muslim approach me because it would also mean that I am free to share my views to them and they cannot accuse me of approaching them or pestering them!

              <p>But if we ban evangelism outright, we lose a key form of dialog -- that which is aimed at persuasion.

              <p>And the point about environmentalism or gay rights is to test your argument to ban evangelism. To rephrase, if you were to ban religious proselytizing, would you then also call for a ban on door-to-door advocacy on environmentalism, vegetarianism or gay rights?</p>
              <p>If your answer is yes, where does it end? Would you also ban attempts to persuade others that the free market is damaging, that IE is better than Firefox, that LoTR is better than Star Wars?</p>
