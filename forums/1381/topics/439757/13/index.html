              <p>That's where you are wrong. God has told us MANY things in the
              Bible. To say God NEVER explain anything is blatantly false. Point
              is, if God explain would you believe? If not, are you again
              patronising the faith?</p>

              <p>Rooney,</p>
              <p>Honestly, I don't know what God was thinking at the point of creation. Yes, if you ask me I also think it is unfathomable why God would even want to create anything at all, not just the angels. I can only guess at it since the Bible is silent on the specific reason. But I don't see how being unfathomable something is would somehow mean that this something is false and must be rejected. Rejecting something we do not understand is not a reasonable thing to do, in my view.</p>

              I guess you probably missed my point-by-point rebuttal which has been much maligned as breaking up people's posts. Anyway, I am flattered still by your compliments concerning the debates at HWZ. Not too sure why you still labour under the impression that this ID being used is shared by multiple users. I would think it is most cumbersome to do this as it lacks individuality.

              <p>Now we're getting somewhere. That's a good question. <br><br>The answer could be based on logical inference:</p>
              <ul>
              <li> An evangelist is knocking on doors of strangers. LIkewise the salesman. <br></li>
              <li>An evangelist is selling something that the prospect doesn't necessarily want. Likewise the salesman.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Therefore, you might infer that the door-to-door salesman and evangelist are similar in terms of annoyance.<br><br>Alternatively, the answer could be based on empirical data. How many complaints do we receive each year for religious evangelists versus salespeople?</p>
              <p>Either way, if you want to issue a blanket ban on evangelists because of them being public nuisances, you have to be prepared to ban door-to-door salesmen, flagsellers, tissue aunties, street surveyors, etc. if they are seen to be similarly or more of a nuisance.<br><br>You also have to be prepared to accept if, say, the evidence shows that evangelists are less of a nuisance than these other people. I personally have not encountered an evangelist in the past 10 years, whereas street surveyors are at least a weekly affair.</p>

              <p>I think you have to think through this a bit more. Both in logic

              make a rule for it.<br> <br> Instead, you have to think about why you don't like that thing. Is
              it because it's a public nuisance?</p>
              <p>If so, what about other things that are also a public nuisance?
              Would you apply the same rules to those?</p>
              <p>In short, a rule cannot be adhoc. It has to be consistent. You
              cannot make up a rule to ban religious evangelism because it's a
              public nuisance, and yet allow other similar forms of soliciting
              that are just as annoying.</p>

              <p>It's rare to see 'BroInChrist' and 'ReasonableAtheist' agree on anything. But this agreement is rightly so. Why ? Because it just shows that they both exhibit what their nick actually means. And under this context thier judgements correct. At least they can agree on commonality(at least the ethics of a debate) while agreeing in disagreeing on certain issues.</p>
              <p>Just want to point it out about Parliament and the Courts. First of all, for the parliament to intend to even allow BANNING in Propogation of Religion, and since its under the SG constitution for freedom of religion, any such ban have to be EXPRESSLY STATED. Such issues of constitutional importance has to be expressed. The courts will be the one intepreting how it applies.</p>
              <p>Hell, Parliement can enact a law to have all blue-eyed babies killed if they want to.</p>
              <p>However, while the Sg courts are mostly gagged on its constitutional interpretation. Parliament still have to expressly intend such a ban for it to be illegal. You are not guilty of any crime not prescribed by Parliament.</p>
              <p>So ladies and gentlemen, those that want to advocate the ban, be prepared to set out why u want it ban(And a damn good reason),how, and not look like you are a racist, anti-religion, anti-christian homo.</p>
              <p>Hope this clear things up.</p>
              <p>Like any proper constructive debate, sometimes you have to set up the prescribed meaning of the terms you are going to use. Failure to do so is just going to expose yourself from further misunderstanding or just plain ignorance, or like the saying goes.. kettle calling the pot black.</p>
              <p>Lets get this whole propogation thingy to rest.</p>
              <p>Below from WIKI</p>
              <h3><span id="Propagate" class="mw-headline"><em>'Propagate</em></span></h3>
              <p>Singapore courts have not yet interpreted the word <em>propagate</em> in Article 15(1) of the Constitution.</p>
              <p>Article 25(1) of the Indian Constitution, which is in the same terms 
              as in Article 15(1) of the Singapore Constitution, guarantees to 
              individuals the right to freely "profess, practise and propagate" their 
              religions. The term <em>propagate</em> was considered by the <a title="Supreme Court of India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India">Supreme Court of India</a> in <em><a title="Stanislaus v State of Madhya Pradesh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaus_v_State_of_Madhya_Pradesh">Stanislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a></em> (1977).<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_15_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> The Court adopted a dictionary definition of <em>propagate</em>,
               which was "to transmit or spread from person from person or from place 
              to place". Accordingly, it held that the word as used in Article 25(1) 
              confers on an individual the right to transmit or spread one's religion 
              by an exposition of its tenets. In other words, an individual has the 
              right to spread his or her religion by explaining to others the 
              principles and beliefs underlying that particular religion. However, in 
              the Court's opinion Article 25(1) does not confer the right to <a title="Religious conversion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion">convert</a> another person who holds a pre-existing religious belief to one's own religion as this would impinge on the "<a title="Freedom of thought" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_thought">freedom of conscience</a>"
               provided for in the Article, which accords each individual with the 
              freedom to hold or consider a thought, fact or viewpoint independent 
              from those of others. In short, the constitutional right to propagate 
              one's own religion is protected insofar as an individual who exercises 
              this right respects the freedom of persons following other religions. 
              The Indian jurist <a title="Hormasji Maneckji Seervai" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormasji_Maneckji_Seervai">Hormasji Maneckji Seervai</a> has criticized <em>Stanislaus</em> and has said it should be overruled. He argued that when a person 
              propagates his religion to another, that act does not violate the other 
              person's free conscience but allows that person an opportunity to freely
               choose a religion:<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_15_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>23<span>] '<br></span></a></sup></p>
              <p><strong>While you may argue that Singapore is not inclined to follow it's commonwealth counterparts, the fact is.. such interpretation can be drawn from it.</strong></p>
              <p>So unless you can show that Christianity or the spreading of their beliefs and tenets is a public order, public health or morality issue, Under Article 15(4) of the Constitution, a person's freedom of religion and the spreading of it is protected albeit under limited circumstances as set out under the article. And such ban is outright illegal, unlawful and unenforceable.</p>
              <p>Hence to finally put this topic to rest.. NO. YOU CAN NOT BAN EVANGELIZING.. at least NOT YET, Until Laurence82 is made a Member of Parliament and pushes such a bill through parliament with a majority support. That will happen if and only if it does not look like you are a racist, anti-religion, anti-christian homo. Unless your entire constituent are racists, ignorant and intolerant.But then again, doesnt such action warrant some form of sedition action too ?</p>
              <p>No point digging a bigger hole for yourself. You win some.. you lose some.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_15_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_15_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore</a></p>
              <p>Personally, the debate and exchange is all good until people start generalising. The ignorant generalise. And when the refusal to accept the meaning of another's without proper reasoned excuse is just gonna evidence of your character in real life.</p>
              <p>Its almost Christmas, how about we all focus on the spirit of Christmas instead of bickering on whether it is real or not. Those that believe in the message will believe. Those that dont, wont.</p>
              <p>And lastly.. this is  Christian Forum. You guys can talk as much crap as you want. But its akin to going into a vegan restaurant demanding why there is no meat! And start telling them how awesome meat is.</p>

              <p>It's rare to see 'BroInChrist' and 'ReasonableAtheist' agree on anything. But this agreement is rightly so. Why ? Because it just shows that they both exhibit what their nick actually means. And under this context thier judgements correct. At least they can agree on commonality(at least the ethics of a debate) while agreeing in disagreeing on certain issues.</p>
              <p>Just want to point it out about Parliament and the Courts. First of all, for the parliament to intend to even allow BANNING in Propogation of Religion, and since its under the SG constitution for freedom of religion, any such ban have to be EXPRESSLY STATED. Such issues of constitutional importance has to be expressed. The courts will be the one intepreting how it applies.</p>
              <p>Hell, Parliement can enact a law to have all blue-eyed babies killed if they want to.</p>
              <p>However, while the Sg courts are mostly gagged on its constitutional interpretation. Parliament still have to expressly intend such a ban for it to be illegal. You are not guilty of any crime not prescribed by Parliament.</p>
              <p>So ladies and gentlemen, those that want to advocate the ban, be prepared to set out why u want it ban(And a damn good reason),how, and not look like you are a racist, anti-religion, anti-christian homo.</p>
              <p>Hope this clear things up.</p>
              <p>Like any proper constructive debate, sometimes you have to set up the prescribed meaning of the terms you are going to use. Failure to do so is just going to expose yourself from further misunderstanding or just plain ignorance, or like the saying goes.. kettle calling the pot black.</p>
              <p>Lets get this whole propogation thingy to rest.</p>
              <p>Below from WIKI</p>
              <h3><span><em>'Propagate</em></span></h3>
              <p>Singapore courts have not yet interpreted the word <em>propagate</em> in Article 15(1) of the Constitution.</p>
              <p>Article 25(1) of the Indian Constitution, which is in the same terms as in Article 15(1) of the Singapore Constitution, guarantees to individuals the right to freely "profess, practise and propagate" their religions. The term <em>propagate</em> was considered by the <a title="Supreme Court of India" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India">Supreme Court of India</a> in <em><a title="Stanislaus v State of Madhya Pradesh" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaus_v_State_of_Madhya_Pradesh">Stanislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a></em> (1977).<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_15_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> The Court adopted a dictionary definition of <em>propagate</em>, which was "to transmit or spread from person from person or from place to place". Accordingly, it held that the word as used in Article 25(1) confers on an individual the right to transmit or spread one's religion by an exposition of its tenets. In other words, an individual has the right to spread his or her religion by explaining to others the principles and beliefs underlying that particular religion. However, in the Court's opinion Article 25(1) does not confer the right to <a title="Religious conversion" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion">convert</a> another person who holds a pre-existing religious belief to one's own religion as this would impinge on the "<a title="Freedom of thought" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_thought">freedom of conscience</a>" provided for in the Article, which accords each individual with the freedom to hold or consider a thought, fact or viewpoint independent from those of others. In short, the constitutional right to propagate one's own religion is protected insofar as an individual who exercises this right respects the freedom of persons following other religions. The Indian jurist <a title="Hormasji Maneckji Seervai" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormasji_Maneckji_Seervai">Hormasji Maneckji Seervai</a> has criticized <em>Stanislaus</em> and has said it should be overruled. He argued that when a person propagates his religion to another, that act does not violate the other person's free conscience but allows that person an opportunity to freely choose a religion:<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_15_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>23<span>] '<br></span></a></sup></p>
              <p><strong>While you may argue that Singapore is not inclined to follow it's commonwealth counterparts, the fact is.. such interpretation can be drawn from it.</strong></p>
              <p>So unless you can show that Christianity or the spreading of their beliefs and tenets is a public order, public health or morality issue, Under Article 15(4) of the Constitution, a person's freedom of religion and the spreading of it is protected albeit under limited circumstances as set out under the article. And such ban is outright illegal, unlawful and unenforceable.</p>
              <p>Hence to finally put this topic to rest.. NO. YOU CAN NOT BAN EVANGELIZING.. at least NOT YET, Until Laurence82 is made a Member of Parliament and pushes such a bill through parliament with a majority support. That will happen if and only if it does not look like you are a racist, anti-religion, anti-christian homo. Unless your entire constituent are racists, ignorant and intolerant.But then again, doesnt such action warrant some form of sedition action too ?</p>
              <p>No point digging a bigger hole for yourself. You win some.. you lose some.</p>

              <p>Personally, the debate and exchange is all good until people start generalising. The ignorant generalise. And when the refusal to accept the meaning of another's without proper reasoned excuse is just gonna evidence of your character in real life.</p>
              <p>Its almost Christmas, how about we all focus on the spirit of Christmas instead of bickering on whether it is real or not. Those that believe in the message will believe. Those that dont, wont.</p>
              <p>And lastly.. this is  Christian Forum. You guys can talk as much crap as you want. But its akin to going into a vegan restaurant demanding why there is no meat! And start telling them how awesome meat is.</p>

              <p>laurence,</p>
              <p>You should ask the question of conscience for yourself, seriously.</p>
              <p>I have already PROVEN what I set out to do when I first replied to you. Let me reiterate that to you. The freedom of religion and to propagate it is enshrined in our Constitution, the supreme law of the land. You wanna ban evangelism it is unconstitutional and will FAIL and it is illegal, unless you first amend the constitution by removing Article 15. I wish you all the best in trying to do so. As it stands right now you have NO case.</p>
