              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>The point is, we are dealing with the present! Talking about the future is really a moot point. I might as well argue that in future the law will decree that atheism is disallowed and should be banned. Anything is possible right? You wanna waste time arguing over that?</p>
              <p>Please check back if you are not sure why laurence is squabbling over a lost cause, as the law now stands. But if you can't be bothered to, let me recap for you, with creative liberty taken to reconstruct the chain of events. ; p</p>
              <p>laurence: Ban evangelism la! Public nuisance!</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: To do so is against the Constitution which provides for propagation of religion?</p>
              <p>laurence: Talk nonsense lah!</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: Go check the Constitution.</p>
              <p>laurence (<em>probably thinking to himself, "Darn, what is Constitution? Can eat one? Never mind, put on a brave front and try to call his bluff)</em>: Hey! Prove to me the Constitution specifically say can propagate religion.</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: Sure thing! See Article 15(1) which specifically says blah blah blah....</p>
              <p>laurence <em>(probably thinking to himself, "Jia lat, tio owned liao! Oh wait, Wiki also said Singapore courts did not interpret the word propagate so I can still bank on this to weasel myself out of this embarassing situation</em>): SO WHAT? Courts did not decide on the word propagate, so it means evangelism can be banned!</p>
              <p>(Of course one must also remember that reasonable.atheist did try to talk some sense into laurence's fallacious argument but he simply refuses to even see the fallacies being pointed out)</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: What the??? Argument from silence? Courts never interpret each word of the law means we can't know what that word means? Check dictionary, check Oxford, check internet, all will give the same basic meaning, a meaning that cannot be suka suka negated by the courts to mean something entirely different.</p>
              <p>laurence: LOL! Oxford cannot be used to determine the meaning of a word that the courts have not decided. Screw Oxford! And you as well! Therefore I win, we can ban evangelism! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: Like that also can? Constitution is clear that we can propagate religion but you say that I cannot say banning evangelism is unlawful? But you admit that court is silent on the word it means banning evangelism is lawful?</p>
              <p>laurence: Yes, and if you disagree with me you are nothing but a troll.</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: ??!!!???</p>
              <p>OK, that's all for now. Wait I kena whacked by laurence if I keep on going. But even you also agree with me that you cannot ban evangelism because the Constitution as it stands right now protects that as a right and freedom. Can laurence talk about banning evangelism? Of course he can. He can even sing about it on the roof top or shout it out loud on Bukit Timah Hill! I never say he cannot talk about it. All I am saying is that to ban evangelism is unlawful because of what the Constitution is saying right now. If Article 15(1) does not exist, I would not even quibble with his point in the first place. Can things change in the future? Of course, but like I said, it's a moot point.</p>

              <p>The point is, we are dealing with the present! Talking about the future is really a moot point. I might as well argue that in future the law will decree that atheism is disallowed and should be banned. Anything is possible right? You wanna waste time arguing over that?</p>
              <p>Please check back if you are not sure why laurence is squabbling over a lost cause, as the law now stands. But if you can't be bothered to, let me recap for you, with creative liberty taken to reconstruct the chain of events. ; p</p>
              <p>laurence: Ban evangelism la! Public nuisance!</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: To do so is against the Constitution which provides for propagation of religion?</p>
              <p>laurence: Talk nonsense lah!</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: Go check the Constitution.</p>
              <p>laurence (<em>probably thinking to himself, "Darn, what is Constitution? Can eat one? Never mind, put on a brave front and try to call his bluff)</em>: Hey! Prove to me the Constitution specifically say can propagate religion.</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: Sure thing! See Article 15(1) which specifically says blah blah blah....</p>
              <p>laurence <em>(probably thinking to himself, "Jia lat, tio owned liao! Oh wait, Wiki also said Singapore courts did not interpret the word propagate so I can still bank on this to weasel myself out of this embarassing situation</em>): SO WHAT? Courts did not decide on the word propagate, so it means evangelism can be banned!</p>
              <p>(Of course one must also remember that reasonable.atheist did try to talk some sense into laurence's fallacious argument but he simply refuses to even see the fallacies being pointed out)</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: What the??? Argument from silence? Courts never interpret each word of the law means we can't know what that word means? Check dictionary, check Oxford, check internet, all will give the same basic meaning, a meaning that cannot be suka suka negated by the courts to mean something entirely different.</p>
              <p>laurence: LOL! Oxford cannot be used to determine the meaning of a word that the courts have not decided. Screw Oxford! And you as well! Therefore I win, we can ban evangelism! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: Like that also can? Constitution is clear that we can propagate religion but you say that I cannot say banning evangelism is unlawful? But you admit that court is silent on the word it means banning evangelism is lawful?</p>
              <p>laurence: Yes, and if you disagree with me you are nothing but a troll.</p>
              <p>BroInChrist: ??!!!???</p>
              <p>OK, that's all for now. Wait I kena whacked by laurence if I keep on going. But even you also agree with me that you cannot ban evangelism because the Constitution as it stands right now protects that as a right and freedom. Can laurence talk about banning evangelism? Of course he can. He can even sing about it on the roof top or shout it out loud on Bukit Timah Hill! I never say he cannot talk about it. All I am saying is that to ban evangelism is unlawful because of what the Constitution is saying right now. If Article 15(1) does not exist, I would not even quibble with his point in the first place. Can things change in the future? Of course, but like I said, it's a moot point.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>What was their crime? They were distributing materials that were deemed offensive to other religions. Distributing tracts itself was NOT the offense they were indicted for. If I distribute Christmas tracts that preach Jesus as the reason for the season, you think this is against the law? Of course not. You can throw away the tract just like you throw away the housing agent tracts.</p>
