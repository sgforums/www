              <p>You don't have to doubt my position. I have plenty of posts on HWZ using the same nick, and had a lengthy debate with BIC ther. I also just posted a paper co-authored by Dennett on another topic in this forum.</p>
              <p>However, I will debate anybody -- including fellow atheists -- on issues I disagree on. On HWZ, I certainly have challenged other atheists on vegetarianism and free will. That, I think, is more valuable than blind support.</p>

              <p>Similar to my very simple analogy of washing my hair daily does
              it require same washing to the buttock or even armpits? Even you
              yourself have make the distinction from other atheists. Are all
              atheists the same and should hold same view?</p>
              <p>Your response is simply to prove they are one and the same
              thing. Its also akin to saying apple and orange are the same thing
              and should be treated with equal favour just because they are
              fruits.</p>

              <p>I didn't think I really had to respond to this, but I will now. One consideration is that the hygiene factor of your hair may be different from that of your armpits or buttocks. Not only are there differences, these differences are material to the issue at hand. The dirtier your hair is, relative to your buttocks, the more frequently you should wash it. This is a vast simplification, but I hope you get the idea.</p>
              <p>Apple and oranges are both fruit, but with different flavors. Therefore, if we are deciding which to eat, there is a real difference that depends on our taste preferences.</p>
              <p>Now the ball is in your court. Again, why does religion warrant bans that other belief systems do not? What is the difference here, and how is it material to our discussion?</p>

              <p>Again, you don't have to worry about me pretending to be daft. I have "reasonable" in my nick for a few reasons, and one of them is that I aspire to be reasonable in my interactions with both believers and non-believers.</p>
              <p>If we are looking to extend a certain law or regulation to an uncovered area (e.g. using broadcast rules to regulate the Internet), we ask a couple of questions:</p>
              <p>1. What are the differences between the covered area (e.g. broadcast) and uncovered area (e.g. Internet)?</p>
              <p>2. Are these differences material to the regulation (e.g. ban on pornography) we are considering?</p>
              <p>In my example, IIRC the regulators did decide that the Internet is different from traditional broadcast media in material ways. For example, it is virtually impossible to monitor, control and ban all pornographic content on the Internet. Therefore, the Singapore regulator eventually decided on a symbolic approach of banning a small list of sites.</p>
              <p>Now, in terms of our present discussion, one may argue that religion evokes strong emotive responses, and therefore requires a more careful and restrictive approach. However, the same can be said of gay rights: Many people feel strongly against gay sex and marriage in Singapore. There are also plenty of people who feel strongly about women's rights, one way or another. Therefore, if we choose to ban religious evangelism, we should also ban efforts to influence and persuade on other contentious issues.</p>
              <p>We may also argue that religion needs to be more carefully handled because of our Muslim population and neighbors. Now, this is a bit of a bogeyman argument, but I'll put it aside. Here again, the majority of the population in the region appears to be anti-gay, so we should also ban gay rights advocacy along with evangelism?</p>
              <p>There might be other differences that I haven't discussed, but at this point I'm just arguing on your behalf. My conclusion is this: I don't think there are material differences between religious evangelism and some other forms of advocacy, as far as a ban is concerned. Now, maybe we should ban the whole lot of them, but then we will be poorer in terms of our learning and understanding of alternative viewpoints.</p>

              <p>if it take whole paragraphs to have a discourse on religious evangelism, it takes one line for you to quickly lump evangelism with gay rights advocacy which you have barely touch on</p>

              <p>Laurence82, just because I disagree with you on one aspect doesn't mean that I'm a closet Christian or one in waiting. I guarantee that we disagree on other issues, such as free will and vegetarianism. If those debates come up, will you accuse me of being a closet Christian again and again?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, my religious position is almost irrelevant here. My arguments will stand or fall by themselves, whether I'm a Christian or atheist.</p>

              <p>2. Religious evangelism is a form of free speech.</p>
              <p>3.Therefore, I would not support a ban on religious evangelism. Caveats do apply in certain cases, e.g. no evangelising to children, mentally disabled, etc, since these concern other fundamental rights.</p>
              <p>You seem to disagree with me on (3), i.e. you're calling for a ban on religious evangelism. Now, is that because you disagree with me on (1) and/or (2)? Or is there another premise that I've neglected?</p>

              <p>It's not as simple as that. One of the key objections to gay sex and marriage is religion, specifically what the various holy books say about sodomy and so on.</p>
              <p>Therefore, advocates of gay marriage are advocating a belief that equal human rights are more important than the "sacred" word of God.</p>
              <p>Also, if instead of gay rights, what if we use environmentalism? Isn't that advocating a belief as well?</p>

              <p>One is biased, one isn't. I dont see how advocating equality is being biased. Straight ppl have 100 human rights. So I am asking for100 human rights for gay ppl. How isthat being biased?</p>
              <p>But religious evangelism is biased and  ppl are "taught" to favour  one god over the other.</p>

I disagreed because the propagation (which most certainly includes evangelism) of one's religion is a freedom provided under our Constitution. You then said that there is no such thing as freedom to propagate. I then showed you the actual Article 15, which you later also finally googled on Wiki. But instead of being grateful for being corrected and having your ignorance plugged, you went off on a tangent and gripe about the word not being interpreted by the courts. The only point that I wanted to establish, and you were obviously too puffed up with pride to concede that you did not know it, was that the freedom to propagate one's religion is a freedom enshrined by our Constitution.</p>
              <p>And why are you laughing when I talk about "secular" laws? Do you have a problem with that? Why?</p>

              <p>Firstly, i did not say the law does not allow for propagation. I merely asked for proof this is provided under the Constitution. Please do not change this fact. Hence i will disregard the remainder of your personal attack.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you should be grateful I asked you to read further. Propagation is not defined nor discussed in laws of courts in Singapore. I am not interested in your English dictionary. I am more interested in how the judges, appointed by the His Excellency the President of the Republic of Singapore, with the advice of the demoractically elected Prime Minister and his Cabinet, within the confines of legal discussions, define propagation. As of now, you have repeatedly fail to establish how banning evangelism is unlawful.</p>
              <p>Lastly, from xtian perspective, if evangelism is decreed by god (thats for you to prove), do you have to care if secular laws allow it or not? I am just aghast that you centre the entire conversation based on laws made by man.</p>
              <p>Its understood that godly laws dont hold up anyway. I guess secular laws is the centrepiece and source of moral authority?</p>

              <p><br> Apologies if i come across as branding you as xtian. I do
                  understand at times it can be offensive to some to be branded with
                  their lot. It just that your points are so confusing and contrary
                  to being an atheist. By all means disagree with me if you have
                  to.</p>
              <p>I think i made it clear - my stand is on banning religious
                  evangelism because its an act of public nuisance, along with
                  littering and spitting. We can deep dive into the metrits or
                  demerits of my stand. I cant see why would trying to ban religious
                  proselytism is direct link to gay rights advocacy or
                  environmentalism.</p>
              <p>Are xtians promoting gay rights? Shocking...</p>

              <p>Frankly, I don't care if you label me a Christian. It is however important to me that atheists do not fall into the trap of groupthink, which I've seen in evidence here.<br><br>I think that a blanket ban on religious evangelism on the grounds that it is a public nuisance is not a strong enough argument. There are plenty of things that annoy me: burning of stuff during the Chinese seventh month, the getais that go late into the night, the neighbor next door who plays his trombone (badly), the people who ask me to fill up surveys at train stations.</p>
              <p>Yes, religious evanglism can be annoying to us. However, the right to free speech is so important that I'm willing to accept that public nuisance. If one day the religious movement becomes dominant in Singapore, I also want to be able to go door-to-door and promote the ideas of curiosity, critical thinking and science.</p>
