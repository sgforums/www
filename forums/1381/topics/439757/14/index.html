              <p>laurence,</p>
              <p>1. So because the word "propagate" was not defined by the courts or deliberated by the courts we must void that word and say we don't know what it means? Oxford Dictionary can be of no use at all? Even common sense ordinary meaning of that word also cannot be used? Can you tell me what the layman understanding of "propagate" means? Don't have to use the Oxford since apparently you don't like it.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, I fail to understand how you can ban evangelism without violating the Constitution as it now reads. You think changing Constitution is like using correction fluid to blanko off Article 15 so simple? Let me just pour cold water on your suggested affirmative action, it won't see the light of day at all so long as we remain a secular state. Mind you, a secular state does not mean being free from religion, but freedom of religion, and that no religion gets to enforce or unduly influence the government. </p>

              <p>I have no quarrel with that. There are other laws of Singapore that govern religious harmony and protect public order. I think these laws suffice. But what some atheists want is that religion (or maybe their target is just Christianity?) be completely banished from the public arena and be consigned to the private sphere. In short, the only religion they want to see enforced in public is atheism. Of course, the term they prefer to use is secularism as it sounds more politically correct.</p>

              <p>Actually if you read the works of the new atheists, they did attack all other religions, but they aimed their cross-hairs at the Christian faith in particular. Here's my reasoning why I think atheists like to gun for Christianity as their preferred target. It is because Christianity offers the greatest intellectual, philosophical and evidential challenge to atheism. You can choose to disagree, but since you ask for my view, there you go.</p>
              <p>Of course you will then say it is because Christianity go round evangelism and that's why it should be gunned down and attack. You will be saying that Christians are asking for it. To you, the nicest Christians are probably the dumb ones who keep their mouths shut and don't preach it just because Jesus commanded them to do it. In fact you would probably be happy if no Christian here challenge anything you say! But that's like saying that insurance agents should also be targeted because they keep calling you asking you to buy their products. But why do we not do so? Because that's what it means to exercise tolerance. We know that's their livelihood and so we exercise tolerance and forbearance over the things we dislike and are against. We just bear with them and politely refuse them, that's being gracious too. Tolerance means to say "I don't like you and what you stand for, but I will not deny you the right to do it so long as it is not against the law".</p>

The freedom of religion and to propagate it is enshrined in our Constitution, the supreme law of the land. You wanna ban evangelism it is unconstitutional and will FAIL and it is illegal, unless you first amend the constitution by removing Article 15. I wish you all the best in trying to do so.

              <p>It's called statutory intepretation. The wiki link provides very easy to understand reasonings. The constitution is one of the most important piece of document in Singapore and such limitations is allowed albeit under limitations. Hence an outright ban right now is still unconstitutional even if statute is silent on it. Again Parliament have to expressly make it's intention clear in statute to NOT allow evangelising.</p>

              <p>You are making an irrelevant accusation, a smear attempt no doubt. I am not suggesting that everyone here is mediocre, so please do not project such mediocrity to others here. However the courts eventually choose to interpret the word "propagate" it will not be contrary to what Oxford, or how any other dictionary defines it. By my lights, I don't think a legal interpretation of a common English word will be such that it negates the ordinary meaning of it in its proper use and context. And what does propagate means?

              <p>It's called statutory intepretation. The wiki link provides very easy to understand reasonings. The constitution is one of the most important piece of document in Singapore and such limitations is allowed albeit under limitations. Hence an outright ban right now is still unconstitutional even if statute is silent on it. Again Parliament have to expressly make it's intention clear in statute to NOT allow evangelising.</p>

              <p><br>You are contradicting yourself. If the law is silent, it doesnt mean its unlawful.</p>
              <p>And i wholly agree with you, Parliament is the place with the rightful process, not Oxford University Press</p>

              <p>You are making an irrelevant accusation, a smear attempt no doubt. I am not suggesting that everyone here is mediocre, so please do not project such mediocrity to others here. However the courts eventually choose to interpret the word "propagate" it will not be contrary to what Oxford, or how any other dictionary defines it. By my lights, I don't think a legal interpretation of a common English word will be such that it negates the ordinary meaning of it in its proper use and context. And what does propagate means? NOT quoting from Oxford (since you apparently think it is mediocre) the definition is</p>

I am thumping on the Constitution and telling you that any attempt to ban evangelism is unlawful UNLESS you get the Constitution changed. It's the same like companies. Anything you do that is not provided by the MOA is ultra vires. You wanna do something against the MOA you get it changed first. If you disallow something that is provided by the MOA without getting it changed, you are the one getting into trouble.</p>

We are clueless? So this Article 15(1) as good as not there is it?</p>
              <p>3. I didn't say you CANNOT say to ban evangelism. You can say anything you like on anything! I am saying that it is UNLAWFUL to call for a ban on evangelism because of Article 15(1). And if you are consistent with yourself, then you have NO basis to say that you can ban evangelism because the courts are silent on the word "propagate". If I cannot say cannot ban, how come you can say ban, while insisting that the word is not interpreted in court? That's just you engaging in special pleading. Are you even reading me?</p>
