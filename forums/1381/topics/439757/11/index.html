              <p>Does the fact that something is deemed a public nuisance means that it should be criminalised and banned, rather than being moderated or regulated? Please think carefully.

              <p>Problem is, once you want to argue about which is "more this, more that" you are treading on subjective waters, and arguing about degrees of differences. Something can be "more this" now and banned. So after when it is "less this" you now lift the ban? Who decides when the line is crossed? It becomes really arbitrary.</p>

              <p>laurence,</p>
              <p>Who told you that banning evangelism is not unlawful? You are using double standards here. If you say that the word "propagate" has not been deliberated by the courts, then you should refrain from commenting on whether it is lawful or not. But it seems that you can freely comment on it while I cannot. If this is not double standards or special pleading I don't know what is!</p>

              <p>Doesn't compute. So if I have a Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, etc. all preaching to me, won't I be a very busy person?</p>

              <p>It's fine to have doubts about certain parts of the Bible. But I think the problem is that many are not rigorous in trying to find out the answer. They spot some things that puzzle them and start blasting away as if all Christians have blind spot and are dim-witted to not see the truth that the Bible is a lie or hoax. The Bible has been hammered away for thousands of years, and throughout that time many Christians have taken the time to respond to the critics. I believe the Bible has withstood such hammering and that it will.</p>

              <p>By my lights, Tcmc gave an LOL because he/she enjoyed the dig you gave. He simply chose to scoff and revel in it. You think it is funny, but it surely had other undertones.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Till now you have offered no evidence that you are well-versed in the Bible. To say that I only want to hear the things I want to hear, such an allegation can also be applied to you, so it is a moot point. Good for bashing people, but proves nothing. And like I said, I did not ignore the interpretations of others. In fact, I have examined them and found them wanting, just like how I treated your proof-texts.</p>

              <p>Who told you that banning evangelism is not unlawful? You are using double standards here. If you say that the word "propagate" has not been deliberated by the courts, then you should refrain from commenting on whether it is lawful or not. But it seems that you can freely comment on it while I cannot. If this is not double standards or special pleading I don't know what is!</p>
