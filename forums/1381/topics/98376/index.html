As an unbeliever or even a christian living comfortably in a country having religious freedom, one will tend to focus on the judgements mentioned in revelation. I have serious doubts that that is what the author of Revelations try to communicate. But for a suffering christian under physical or spiritual oppression, he will tend to focus on the final truimph of Christ. That, I believe is the central message.<br><br>btw, when i mentioned imageries, i meant images, not imaginations. Sorry for any confusion.</div>

Many people in the world had perished and those that recieve the mark of the beast were also cast into hell. Only believers will enter the Millennium Kingdom.<br><br>The Millennium Kingdom will thus be a so-called perfect world where there will be no killing, no temptation of sin because Satan is gone, maybe people will live as long as people did in Noah's time - 900 years. It is like the final litmus test that God have set to see how man will be in the perfect environment before accepting them into heaven.<br><br>Alas, because of man sinful nature, the children that will be concieve by the first citizens (believers) of the Millennium Kindom, even though there is no temptation of sin, even though the Lord himself is ruling the world, they will still not believe.<br><br>In the end God will set Satan free after 1000 years and have a final purging of everyone, including Satan, that have an unbelieving heart.<br><br></div>

I mentor them to do the right things (whether I succeed or not is another matter). Some of these right things include challenging my (me as a person) beliefs. They listen to songs that I don't like, play games I don't understand, yet they respect me and my wife.<br><br>If I want my kids to do what I say, I have a remote control car that does exactly the same thing.<br><br>So reality check, are my kids perfect or defective?<br><br>Back to the topic, Revelation is written in a form of imagery, by a guy called John. Apparently he had seen a vision and had written down what he'd experience. It stands out from the rest of the Bible in that it is a picture of the future. What the imagery means is a highly debatable issue. Theologians had for decades tried to explain the meaning and many books had attempted to give meaning to the images there. So please don't take it literally.</div>

There will be a war between God and Satan (Armageddon). For those who are unbelievers or don't side for God, that time will be full of fear, panic among the people, Satan will convince and deceive them in order to side them.<br><br>One thing we have to know is, the victory belongs to God and Satan will be casted down to the lake of fire in hell forever.<br><br>p/s - correct me if I am wrong..

            <div class='col-md body'>I am no buddhist, but I try to answer it if I can. These answers r just my personal interpretation of buddhism<br><br><blockquote>Can i ask u a few question, ( i mean no harm, just curious), did Buddha ever mention that anyone who believes in a Creator cannot achieve nirvana? </blockquote>No, u can believe in a creator and still achieve nirvana.. but then believing in a lie is clearly a case of ignorance, therefore giving him a lesser probability of completely realising the truth.<br><br><blockquote>Is it really nature that decides who could achieve nirvana and who can't ? ( if not nature then who ?) </blockquote>No, it is not decided by nature. It is by your own self. U reap wat u sow. No being is deciding your fate or future.<br><br><blockquote>Is it if one can't achieve nirvana one will be send down to earth again, and be animals..if good then become prince?. If good i thought should achieve nirvana? </blockquote>If he is good, he can reincarnate to become human or become higher beings as well. To achieve nirvana, u appear to need to realise the complete truth. Good and realise truth seems to be on a different category<br><br><blockquote>Then will mother theresa achieve nirvana in the view of Buddhism? </blockquote>Not likely since she appears to be lost. Hopefully she can reincarnate to a very good life or to a higher level of being after her death...<br><br><blockquote>i don't think i have the heart to just disown him just like that, a snap of a finger.. let alone God who is more perfect than me!</blockquote>Ehh.. he do disown the people who is dead in Noah's ark story, the people of the other tribes who is killed by him and the countless egytians who died because they r loyal to their king.<br><br><blockquote>So reality check, are my kids perfect or defective</blockquote>They r normal. The question is how do u respond to your kids if one day they convert themselves to be muslim or buddhist ? Do u go and throw them into boiling water or melting lava just because they do not listen to u ? It is normal for people to have their own free will and do things tat is not wat u expected. Respect tat right, and let them live a life they desire ! Not go around saying u have free will but if u choose to disobey me, u get to be punished ! It is like a person who fail to program a remote control car properly and destroy them if they fail to be controlled !<br><br>Frankly.. I don't understand why does people believe in revelation... to me it appears to be a story plot for a video game or something...<br></div>
