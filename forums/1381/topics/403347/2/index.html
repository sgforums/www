              <p><br>Of late , we are seeing many christians coming to sgf denying themselves as christians for bashing, flaming and bringing bad name to other religions.  This is very bad.   By doing these they are not bringing glory to the God their Lord.     I know God is not pleased.      In due time, God will punish these if they still refuse to repent.</p>

              <p>to be a buddhist, one must take the 3 refuges which i'm sure hasene has not (from what i have read her posts from other forum). thus she is not a buddhist yet.</p>
