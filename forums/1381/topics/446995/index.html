I dated a chinese Christian guy and recently we broke up because of my religion status. Actually we planned to get marry legally, I want to convert to Christian, it's the thing that I really want to do since i was young, that's why i dated non malay/muslim. However, his parents dont want us to be together. he told his father that I was gonna convert to Christian but he said it's impossible since im a malay and islam.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">His uncle said, the story abou Lina Joy isn't true after all. You know Lina Joy right?</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">actually she did not success to convert herself instead, she got trapped by them. And now nobody knows what's happen to her. I'm not sure if this true but if you have any latest news regarding Lina Joy. Please let me know.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Most of muslim who converted to other religion in malaysia get caught by them (JAIS etc) because they didnt convert official and they married illegally.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Im still studying and even when I start to work I still cant go overseas because I have to settle down my PTPTN loan. </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">my boyfriend couldnt do anything right now. So right now I want to solve this without involving him and his family. All I want is to OFFICIALLY convert to Christian in Malaysia without being trapped by them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Any of you who have information (real) about Malay baptized, please let me know.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">My boyfriend is soon gonna graduate and will move to sabah for teaching (about 5 years/ 10 years) actually he told me he gave up. he tried so hard to be with me but somehow there's no way that I could convert officially and peacefully. He cant move to another country because he has to settle down his PTPTN loan and since he's an English teacher, he can only move when he's 50 years old. Now he's 23 years old.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I try to convince him that I'd find a way, but he refuse to try again.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I love him so much and I want to be with him. </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I really really need your help Singaporeans. I am so dissapointed with Malaysia thats all I can say.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure what you're asking from fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>If it's about love and the one you loved then I believed you have to get rid of the main obstacle which is the PTPTN loan (whatever heck it is) first and foremost. Settle it once and for all then you could be on your way fulfilling your dreams.<br><br>As for the religion matters, it's your call and we are talking about freedom of religion here. Although Singapore practice freedom of religion, that doesn't mean we could save you from your Islamic declared country Malaysia. A true faith is not based on exterior complexion nor country's rules and regulations, it is purely "skin-deep".<br><br>In fact, if you knew that your PTPTN loan is the main obstacle then you ought to be smarter than the authority by meticulously eliminating your main obstacle prior to achieve your next goal - to migrate and convert in overseas etc.<br><br>If your guy really loves you then he shall wait for you regardless time and circumstances. If it's truly love then everything should standstill apart from your guy's combined efforts to be together for eternity - if it's genuinely exist.</p>
              <p>Or else you want to look for someone new among the Singaporeans here. <a class="tinymce_control" href="446995?page=1#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="446995?page=1#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="446995?page=1#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="446995?page=1#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>

              <p>Since I broke up with I need someone who can help to get through this. Yes, I found out that PTPTN loan is the main obstacle but right now I'm looking for any Malaysian who could help me to settle this. And just now I received a mail from Spore guy.</p>
              <p>I know he did that because he's afraid of his family. I just hope that after I did this he'd accept me back. I mean we tried this quite few years. But if he didn't like what you say, I'll just find another one.</p>
              <p>I am sorry to confuse all of you but I hope you'll pray for me to get through this.</p>

              <p>that's all you can think about.  Why don't you just stay at home and get laid?  Ohya.  you have been staying at home but cannot get laid.  Everyday can only think of circumcised dick, something that you probably go pray for and about every day if you have a religion.</p>

              I see that you are in denial mode to protect your mighty atheistic ego.
