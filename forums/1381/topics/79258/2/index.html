Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! 16Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves,[3] you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? 17But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, 18and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. 19I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.<br>20When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. 21But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. 22But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. 23For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br><br></div>

But I find Pastor Prince's radical teaching on grace too deep and it might not be appropriate to preach it from the pulpit bcos people might not be mature enough to understand. They might get the wrong meaning that grace condones their sins. Besides there is not enuf balance to the grace message bcos God also exhorts us to lead holy lives and follow godly principles like giving to the poor and needy and helping the oppressed etc. We are told to lead righteous lives bcos then our enemies won't be able to blame us when they accuse us.<br><br>We are always justified in God's sight but bcos of men we need to keep holy. It's a great reponsibility when we receive grace bcos we need to forgive others or God won't forgive us. We need to walk in love or we are not under grace. We need to share the gospel to save others bcos we have received grace. It is a higher std than merely observing the ten commandments. That's why I say not many people can keep it and I wonder if Pastor Prince himself has attained that std. Or else grace will just bcome a convenient way to excuse ourselves when we do wrong. It is no more self effort but grace by God.<br><br>I was delivered from law at NCC and I encourage all who are depressed and dscouraged to attend and be under the anointing. Just my two cents worth.</div>
