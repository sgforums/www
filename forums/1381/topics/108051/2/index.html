            <div class='col-md body'>urm ,bear, wasnt Oldham an American?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>In anyway, its common knowledge that students in SAJC, CJC ACJC have to attend chapel service. I dont know whats the situation now. And those who do not, run in foul of the school rules. And this prolly happened to many primary and secondary schools, like Fairfield Methodist Primary and Secondary.<br><br>And while we, as adults can talk abt discouraging such behaviour, bear in mind most of the students in JC are 17 and 18. They hadnt a clue what is the law and what are their rights.<br><br>And talking to one of the forumnite, I believe Religious Studies has been taken off the syllabus, so there isnt much 'religious' in the secular education except for madrasah. And Kuali is right. Its ironic these schools did such things while commemorating religious harmony day, which i believe to fall in Feb (?).<br><br></div>
