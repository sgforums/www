            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the point is: when your parents decided that they wanted to send you to a mission school, you are suppose to follow the rules imposed by the school. Meaning to say, if for some strange reason, if your parents decided to send you to a Madrasah school, you have to abide by their practice. So if you are a Methodist/Anglican/Catholic school you have to attend worship service/mass/school assembly with prayer etc.<br><br>No, I am not defending Christian schools with dumb rules pertaining to Harry Potter and Pokemon. As a matter of fact, I wrote to my sons' school that a session conducted by the Religious Emphasis teacher on Satanism on Pokemon is at best based on a myth and heresay, which of course when translated means preaching of "lies".<br><br>One need to understand that from the school's standpoint, defending a theology goes beyond what the creed of the denomination. They also have to deal with a larger general public (in the form of Christian parents) who may have rather conservative views towards such genre. Some of these parents may have a large say (due to financial or political influences) on the running of the school. There is also the public face they have to consider.<br><br>Unfortunate, rules are not there to make people happy. Rules are there to ensure that the school (or any other authorities) have an easier time working. A rule that I have found dumb is not even religious in nature. I don't understand why some schools ban mobile phones when this equipment is no longer seen as a luxury but a necessity. Still school authorities will threaten students with punishment and confiscating the equipment if a child is found to hold on to one.</div>

Among the many religions in Singapore, the Muslim community bond the strongest, and hold on to their faith stronger than any other religion. Therefore, the schools which sought to spread the gospels would exclude them out. Its even more so after the 911 incident.<br><br>Well, as whether Christians and Muslims worship the same God, i believe not all Christians and not all Muslims would agree. I dont see Christians readily reading the Koran, and Muslims do shun away from things that look like a cross. Islam to Christianity, to some, is like Christianity to Judaism. Its more of personal disagreement, than technical disparity.<br><br>I believe the the reason why others are forced to join is because they deemed as less faithful, or does not hold on to their own faith stronger than Muslims, or u can even say that being an evangelistic missionary school, other faiths are deemed worthless, no matter how much the school is subservient to the gahmen and the religious harmony act. Come on, the first thing a Christian must do is to deny other faiths, and it depends on what level u are willing to do it. Some deny other faiths, do not practise teachigs of other faith, but accept other faiths do exist. That is pretty allright. I am only irked that many Christians, not all, speak and act as though the whole world only contain them. This is a dangerous thought and action, which pretty explained for the debacles in this forum as well as the school behaviour towards non Christians.<br><br>But interestingly, ask any teacher or senior department head or even the principal this question, he or she will probably be dumbstruck, if he does not use the excuse of following school rule or quoting from the Bible.<br><br>Regarding the school rules on hair fringe and all that ,all school practise it. The school was most probably based it on proper upkeep and presentation of oneself, but students were probably thinking more along the line of fashion and style.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Well, rules are meant and will be broken anyway.<br><br></div>

In Rome, do as the Roman does. But as i grew older, i find this reasoning not logical.<br><br>With the phasing out of Religious Studies, schools are getting more and more secular in nature. The primary purpose of a school is to provide that education secular in nature - maths science english language history. Its necessary to differentiate between madrasashs and Christians missionary schools nowadays. Madrasahs are wholly centred on the Islamic teachings. They do have secular subjects, but they have Islamic studies too. On the other hand, Christian missionary schools strictly follow MOE guidelines and syllabus, and wholly provide education secular in nature. Students are going to school for that education first, and spirituality second in priority. While its not wrong for schools to provide a spiritual avenue for the students, by no mean should it be the main thing for students, and that they shld be forced to attend services.<br><br>Second, 'doing as the Roman does' is a poor excuse. Consider this, do the students have much choices as to which schools they can attend, especially JCs? If three missionary JCs say, if u come to this school, u will have to follow the culture and attend services, can the students who dont like it simply opt out to other schools? No way! Other JCs will be running out of vacancies and squeezed out. It will be nightmare. Remember, they are admitted to the JC based on their O level results, never on their faith. Considering all the requirements to attend schools, even the distance between home and school, results, preference of the school ECAs etc etc, most simply dont have a choice.<br><br>Lastly, school rules being school rules, shld never run to the contravention of the rights enshrined in the Constitution and laws - freedom to religious belief. It will be greatly ironic that schools preach and force people to attend mass, while trying to teach students to be good, obey the law, commemorate Religious Harmony Day, yada yada....<br><br>the singapore school system is in such a way, students conform to rules and regulations wherever they go. U dont get much complaints from these aspects because the students havent a clue what they are in for.<br><br></div>

I expect to go to a "mission" school just because I expect it to be a normal school. I mean, the position of the school is determined by the population density or people and school isn't it ? How many JCs r there in singapore ? I believe it is to be less than 20, and most of them may be too far, can't qualify or over qualified to even consider about. So if we do not want to attend any religious practise, then we have to limit the number of choices we had ? Aren't we discriminated then ?

If u want to receive fiancial help from them, then make sure u follow their <strong>requirements</strong>, tat is no forcing of student from other religion to practise wat your reiligion teaches. Don't just take the fiancial aid then break the conditions tat comes with it. Aren't u taking the cake (fiancial assistance) and eating it ?<br><br><blockquote>One need to understand that from the school's standpoint, defending a theology goes beyond what the creed of the denomination. They also have to deal with a larger general public (in the form of Christian parents) who may have rather conservative views towards such genre. Some of these parents may have a large say (due to financial or political influences) on the running of the school. There is also the public face they have to consider. </blockquote>U want to go for mass, it is your business. Don't force others to go. If u want to ban hairy putter books, don't let it affect the other people who don't believe wat u r doing is right. So wat if some of the "parents" r rich and powerful ? The schhols have to follow their whim and fancy ? I think tat is something like corruption isn't it ? U want to donate money, u want to help out, then do it volunteerily. U don't donate money in the hope of controlling the organisation isn't it ? [/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not a discrimination. You're limited by your own choice or preference. It's not like the schools don't allow you to enrol just because you're not of a certain belief. I don't think MOE has any requirements on religious issues for schools. Their requirements are basically academic and administrative.<br><br>Personally, as long as the school doesn't make you do degrading or unethical acts, some rules are harmless.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>comparing the amt of damage done by colonial power and misisonaries to those done by colonialised nations?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So its really true, when someone made a remarks, many a times, that a lot of Christians are not following Christ because he believes, but becos its the trend and its hip. I can see this verily in the statement people made, when they readily condemn actions by their ancestors, whether its the beliefs their ancestors practised, or the fight against colonial power and such.<br><br>There is no reason for Buddhism to shift west and Christianity to shift east, but yet it does. It shows how readily the intellectual West adopt and adapt beliefs to aid their well being, and how Asians, up to today, readily receive crap and practise crap. We aped the west b4, and now we are aping it more than ever.<br><br>One of the most glaring example of such behaviour is how easily Christians and missionary schools brush off 'attending services as lan lan thing'. I thin kits time for them to wake up and smell the roses, thats the world doesnt belong to them alone.<br><br>As for Buddhist schools, i dont know why people in this forum like to bring in other religion, but never mind. Unlike Christian missionary schools, Buddhist school are not very secular. They do in the past include Buddhist studies and sutra chanting as part of the activities and syllabus. I checked with few who came from such schools, they DO exclude non Buddhists, to their choices, from such activities. Is there really bowing to Buddha statues? So far only honeybunz made such remarks. Together with Muslim madrasah, its only recently they are geared towards very secular syllabus and activities.<br><br>Christian missionary schools, as i had experienced once, are very much a mainstream schools, but i do believe there are few non mainstream non secular ones. Outside of services, the school is totally unChristian like in many aspects.<br><br></div>
