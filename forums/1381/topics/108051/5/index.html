I can even say I find it offensive myself and there is a perfectly good reason for it. U never do a complete study on your name before hand isn't it ? Change your name lor..<br><br><blockquote>One of the other reason why pokemon got banned was because evolution was involved in Pokemon (this came out in the papers).<br><br>Of course, there's no harm watching the show even if you strictly deny evolution.<br><br>But in the Muslim countries, they are strict and I doubt that they would even bother to know about these kind of things, especially them being religous.

One thing for sure, all those documents about dinosaurs and their bones have to be banned as well. So they decide to practise censorship and snipe off all information tat may very well be the truth ? I bet they never get to study evolution in their bio class as well.</div>

You want to evangelise also not like that what. Furthermore, you'll have idiots going to the service to make trouble or sleep.<br><br>My school has Holy Mass once a month.
