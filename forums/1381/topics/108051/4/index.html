About Pokemon for the muslims, I remember that "Charmander" and the other evolved form names have a hidden meaning that offends Islam.

It's not like the schools don't allow you to enrol just because you're not of a certain belief. I don't think MOE has any requirements on religious issues for schools. Their requirements are basically academic and administrative.<br></blockquote>As said again, everyone should be free to make christrian or mission schools as their choice of schools for watever reasons they have and <strong>NOT</strong> have to live through their unreasonable and unlawful acts of being coerce to paticipate in a religious ritual. If u say if u "don't like the rituals, don't join the school" philosophy, then u r already discriminating the other people of their religions by limiting their choices of schools available to them. Again I had to say, schools r LEGALLY bound to prevent such incidents from happening. Don't like it ? DON'T START ANY SCHOOLS IN SINGAPORE LAH. Same like your argument mah, don't like it go to other schools lor.<br><br><blockquote>Personally, as long as the school doesn't make you do degrading or unethical acts, some rules are harmless</blockquote>It may appears to be harmless to u but it may be very offensive to others. I don't see why pokemon or harry potter have to be banned no matter wat u guys say. If u go to a buddhist schools just because it is near your home, and u r FORCED to bow to the statue and read their prayers and only provide vegetarian meals in the canteen, how will u feel ?

Lan Lan..<br><br>if the school bans harry potter books its the school's right and choice, shut up and get on with your life. simple? </blockquote>If i ever get any news of these schools tring to be funny and force people to go to their rituals, then I am gonna make sure it was well-complained, the school to be properly punished and such behaviors stopped. U don't like it ? Lan lan...<br><br><blockquote>anyway stupidissmart, now you know the "mission" school is slightly different, you can always opt out and change school. if you're not smart enough to go to a good school without the religious constrants, then suck thumb la. complain so much for what? </blockquote>Singapore focus on religious harmony. If u don't like being complained and to be stopped, then go to another country and start your religious school there. There r so many other countries n the world.<br><br>And frankly, all tis argument illustrate the fact tat when such mission schools start schools, their motives is not to educate people or help the people, but it is actually intended to be a "religion conversion" process.<br><br><blockquote>if you don't like the rules, change school lor, if you joined the school because of her reputation, and if reputation is your piority, see if you can go into RI lor, if cannot, suck thumb la. what you want? </blockquote>If we want to follow our religion strictly, then we cannot choose christian schools ? So u agree tat there should be religious discrimination ?<br><br><blockquote>you want to talk about religious harmony? harry potter books promotes witchcraft, which is against our believes. its only natural for the school of a christian background to ban it. are you "religiously sensitive" enough to see that? are you sure you aren't bias at all? the school didn't crucify the students for reading it, just merely disallow the students from reading it in school, you're free to do whatever you like outside it. it's pretty fair rule. and in doing so, they didn't compromise their believes, but didn't impose and try to change their lives outside the school boundaries </blockquote>u feel tat bowing to a statue is equal to bowing to a rock, then how good r u at being religiously sensitive ? If u talk about witch craft, frankly they r everywhere. Even lord of the rings, most RPGs and many comics have wizards as well, why don't u ban it as well ? It is a fact tat u r religious insensitive, u only care about your own religion, and impose rules so tat all the people from other religion have to bend to it. I purposely like to read harry potter books in schools, why stop me ? Just because of your religion, u restraint my freedom of action ? Tis again is religion discrimination.<br><br><blockquote>Oh well, better to be safe than sorry. Children may get obsessed with Pokemon and anyone can get obsessed with Harry P.

            <div class='col-md body'>If u ask me, things like pokemon or harry potter is more healthy than doom 3 or any other violence games where u get to kill people and see blood spilling all over the place. I guess subconsciously promoting murder is more acceptable than seeing a star of david or some lousy names for some of the monster<br><br></div>

A little respect (to the stricter Christians) should have been observed, since Christmas Day is a special day for them.  Deciding to air Harry Potter must have been a big gamble.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe they r depriving other people who do not subscribe to their religion. u say they r happy it is banned, but I do not think so. It is an act against free will. Too bad they r children and therefore they have the least right to protest about it. Why not just warn the people about the show and let their parents do the monitoring, like some violent games etc.</div>

A good example is u, u r still a muslim isn't it ? Has it affect u in any way ? The names of the monster doesn't mean anything and neither does the producer of the show have such intent. It is u who think it too seriously to come out with the conclusion tat it is bad for your religion. If u talk about sacreligous, your name can become sacreligous as well since it has a figure "69" in it. Maybe it is time for u to think if u r really blindly following your faith to an extent tat watching pokemon becomes a sin. Who says tat pokemon is wrong ? Do the scrioture says pokemon is wrong ?

            <div class='col-md body'>I have some comments on names in Pokemon... sorry if anyone thinks it is out of context...<br>1. Religious people who studies the names of this genre fail to take into account that this title is translated to many languages and they all have different names. In Singapore alone, there is the Chinese and English version plus the Japanese versions. I have seen notes written by pastors that claimed that the English names of the Pokemon characters are names of evil spirits in South America and even Nepal.... however I cannot substantiate these claims.<br>2. Yes there are meanings to names of the characters in Pokemon, but only because people who did the translation had to keep it faithful to the characters. eg Charmaleon -&gt; Charmander -&gt; Charizard comes from Chameleon, Salamander, Lizard. The Char probably has got something to do with Charcoal.<br>Squirtle -&gt; Wartotle -&gt; Blastoise comes from Turtle, and Tortoise with Squirt, War and Blast coming from their primary weapon of a water cannon. Almost anyone who plays the game knows that Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan is a tribute to Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Arbok and Ekans is a reverse spelling of Kobra (Cobra) and Snake. Articuno, Zapdos and Motres is really uno, dos and treos (tres?) or one, two, three, with Artic meaning Arctic, Zap for electricity and Mot for Molten.<br>I can go on and on...... well.... Pikachu has absolutely no meaning in English, but in Japanese, the sound effect pika, pika is a kind of a representation to electricity, no different from our buzz, buzz....<br>3. <strong>If one goes looking for the devil, one will find it even in his pocket. </strong>When the series was released in Israel, Jewish psychic Uri Geller tried to sue the series because Alakazam's name apparently sounded like Uri Geller in Hebrew and that the creature uses Uri's trademark spoon.<br>4. On the assumption that Pokemon is Satanic, what effect do you see in the people playing it? This is really the crux of the matter. If the effect is no different than, say Gunbound, or being glued to ESPN for the latest Man U game, then the issue is really not about Pokemon, or that matter Harry Potter.<br>It has got to do the control of the child as well as the control the child has over things around them.<br><br>My own sons and even myself enjoyed Pokemon (as well as Harry Potter) immensely, we still collect the comics, now with under the manifestation of Crystal, Ruby and Sapphire. There is absolutely NO EFFECT at all at them.</div>

They don't know any hidden meaning to the names, I mean r u expecting them to do a research on ALL LANGUAGES, SYMBOLS, MEANINGs of ALL CULTURES and RELIGION and ALL THEIR TRANSLATED PHONETICS IN ALL LANGUAGES before naming of ALL the few THOUSANDS monsters in the show ? U yourself make a mistake in your naming as it is sexually wrong. But u do it because u do not know and I won't condemn u because of it.
