              I've come to the conclusion that God may not be for everybody. Yes everybody could put their faith in God but from my own experience even though there are a lot of Christian population where I live, most of them would not stand up for what is right instead would collaborate with whoever in charge, to do almost just about anything to be on the safe side or even as I suspect to hope to gain personal favor.<br><br>
                                                                                                                          
               I sincerely view these people not to be Christian in the real sense. An apostate Christian perhaps is more appropriate since through their mindset and actions they deny the very God that they claim to worship. They are well aware what they are doing is wrong yet they show no remorse and ask for no forgiveness, they do not want to admit that what they are doing is a sin even though they are well aware it is wrong<br><br>
                                                                                      
              They would gladly thus worship any man and let any man rule them to ANY direction replacing their God, their mere belief since they do not really believe in God to begin with and they place their faith so much more in men.<br><br>
              
              These people had they lived in Europe would probably turn into atheist. These people are Christians BY CONDITION not the Christians made BY DECISION.

              <p>That's right. WE Brits reformed the church and we made it different and respectable, and in the end we thought it was all a load of doctrinal garbage, hence in europe today, you won't find people proclaiming to be Christian. Being christian is not a positive thing these days, ofcourse in asia (backward) its a different story.</p>
              <p>Unlikely Britain will become Muslim in our lifetime, maybe in future since the government needs to appease the Islamic vote (again Religion influencing politics negatively). Australia will definitely NEVER go muslim.</p>
