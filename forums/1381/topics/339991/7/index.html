              have put in place, and we still squabble and wage wars overy
              territory and ideology. We have expanded our collective body of
              knowledge and ability to manipulate resources, but not the ability
              to share them equally. We create, build and tweak systems of

              <p>I did not say that atheists don't have lasting satisfaction. I said that some people become disillusioned with human institutions and choose to find their fulfilment in religion. Those people who advocate faith in humankind should not knock them, because the former are living out a contradiction.</p>
              <p>And I spoke of material wealth and gain, which is beyond what is necessary to get by and survive. Putting words in another person's mouth isn't going to help you score points. I'll state what my definition of emotional and spiritual satisfaction is - the knowledge, contribution towards and fulfilment of one's purpose in life beyond the realm of self and self-sustenance.</p>
              <p>Try looking up some videos of Severn Suzuki and Carl Sagan, and see how much we have collectively acted on their messages.</p>

              <p>believe it or not, once there was this extremely staunch christian gave me a piece of her mind for seeing doctor.  She told me I no need to see doctor, all I hve to do is pray to jesus for healing.  </p>
              <p>Ha ha ha, greatest joke of all, like that clinics and hospitals will have no business!.   Ha ha ha.   Ironically, a neighbour christian dreamt about angel conveying God's message to him that God will cure him but as days go by his conditions become worse, and from worse to worst.  </p>

              <p>God is defined as all powerful being. So He can cure all
              diseases and stop all sufferings, since he is all powerful. He is
              also suppose to be good and just, accepting good people to heaven
              and condemning bad people to hell. He is also all knowing, knowing
              every shit in the world, such as who is the good people and who is
              the bad people.</p>
              <p>Fact, there is suffering in the world. either God is not all
              powerful, not all knowing, or not good and just.</p>
              <p>This fact prove there is no God. Circular argument!!</p>

              <p>believe it or not, once there was this extremely staunch
                      christian gave me a piece of her mind for seeing doctor.  She
                      told me I no need to see doctor, all I hve to do is pray to jesus
                      for healing.</p>

                      Ironically, a neighbour christian dreamt about angel conveying
                      God's message to him that God will cure him but as days go by his
                      conditions become worse, and from worse to worst.</p>
