              <p>Well, think about the story of half a glass of water. You can either curse that it is only half full or rejoice that it is only half empty and drink it with joy.</p>
              <p>The choice is yours and hope you make a decision that will make you happy - in the spirit of an atheist.</p>
              <p>The littel girl has shown so much faith in God and she knew she could be in for worst if not for God  so she thanked God and what's wrong with that?</p>

              <p>Hi MyNameisNas,</p>
              <p>As a Muslim, i agree with you as to the fact that God creates something or test us not without a reason. Be it for us to repent, for us to learn from it or to become better.</p>
              <p>Without new illness, we will not keep striving for excellence in the medicine. that said, it is also not as a revenge, to make us guinea pigs or as a mere show of his Power.</p>
              <p>But we do have to ponder though, why is it that only when we are struck with illness and mishaps do we then remember, call out his name and pray for his mercy.</p>

              <p>lol.. revenge sounds so.. antagonistic. </p>
              <p>i really do see it as a consequence. when God created all things to be good. after adam fell, and sin came into the world. did God create things that are not good, for revenge?</p>
              <p>not really, but things are screwed in this world, because of the consequences of adam's sin.</p>

              <p>Yes scriptures had been and still is being misintrepreted, both purposely and not,</p>
              <p>to fit certain men's belief. The [Catholic] church has had its share of faults.</p>
              <p>To this day I found no evidence that the bible tells us that the earth is the center of the universe. People gave me verses but really they are not telling or even implying that earth was the center of the universe. Men made up excuses and came out with the verses as part of their made-up excuse just to claim that what they believe is the truth as proven by the bible. DO NOT ASSUME THINGS when reading the bible. I suggest reading the bible like lawyers reading a bill or state law to prepare for a case. Careful, wise and not assuming anything but what is written. When you assume you made <strong>the mistake of being arrogant</strong> that <strong>you think you know</strong> what was meant by a holy prophet or by a great man or by God. Don't! those men had had personal relationship with God at a level that we could never understand. Don't assume because we are not at their level.</p>
              <p>When you see contradictions in the bible. Don't quickly assume that one of them is wrong! Both of them may probably be right!. If the contradiction seems to be so obvious and a direct opposite use other verses to judge which one you could trust more. The other verses may even not come from the same book or even testament.</p>
              <p>It's very important for believer to actually read their bible and to understand them as far as it is possible and to read them as wisely as it can be done and not to take conclusion that is too far off that it can no longer be supported by the scriptures it self. For the part that you haven't understand leave them be for the moment. Ask experts if you like. Real experts! But take it as a perspective only even the experts may come to a wrong conclusion. Build a relationship with God by being faithful and true(yes you are aspired to be holy but God still works even if you have faults as long as you are faithful and true) and He may(or may not) give you some clue to some of the secrets in the bible.</p>
              <p> I know slim chance but they do happen sometimes.</p>
              <p>Remember this.</p>
              <p>Though I wrote not to assume anything, the bible makes many usage of cryptic words. Again use other verses to decrypt these verses. Knowing the jewish faith helps too because Jesus was an obervant jews and Jesus came not to break the law but to perfect it because we were hopelessly in the dark. Remember Jesus came not to break the law and plans of God. And to some extent logic but one that is lighten with faith could help a lot too. You must realize that the then human Jesus was actually a very smart person.</p>

              <p>You got it wrong January. This may seem absurd to nonbeliever but to Christians we don't see that our successes or our luck as our own. We think of all what happened to us, happened with the permission of God. It's called living with faith. When we are successful we do not view it because of our own effort alone. We believe that God took a share in making us successful and we are thankful for His part.</p>
              <p>The girl believed that God took a role in saving her life. And she was thankful that God let her live in the end.</p>
              <p>I can understand that it may look silly to non believers. My opinion is being thankful of God in some situation is best kept private or kept as personal opinion. In others it may be best if you testify them to the public. But this is just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p>Hi Mricales&amp;Prophecies,</p>
              <p>We may be of different religions (im a Muslim) but we do share a lot of common beliefs; one of which is that God have a 'hand' in everything that happens, be it good or bad.Without his Will, the girl may not live even how good the doctors or equipments may be. That is why no doctors will claim any surgery etc to be 100% safe.</p>
              <p>To add, He gave us the freedom to choose between right from wrong. If we choose to do wrong, He can stop us but He did not. He let us be 'cause he gave us the ability to think and we will answer for our consequences. Just like a parent, He will not stop us from doing something if we insists on doing so, but we have to answer for it ourselves. If we want to commit heinous crimes like murder or rape, we will answer for it. It will defeat our purpose of being here if He stops all bad things from happening.</p>
              <p>God is fair. He will reward those who do good and punish those who do bad. His punishements or rewards can come in this life or in the afterlife.</p>

              <p>Hi M&amp;P,</p>
              <p>I am just curious to know <strong>(1)</strong> when and where are there contradictions in the bible?</p>
              <p>And I agree with you that we need to <strong>(2)</strong> ask the experts and these are priests and pastors (really properly trained ones) and not those that claimed "God spoke to me.....crapy Korean or American styled" self proclaimed pastor or senior pastor or whatever they like to call themselves.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, we cannot interpret the bible as we like and we must accept the explanations as given to us by the trained experts. To me personally, it does not matter which denomination one comes from but if we choose that denomination, one believed everything completely - if the explanations does not sounds correct or convincing to ne, then it may be an indication to start searching and look into other denominations with an open mind. It will be strange to says that one is a xyz Christians but does not beleive in everything that Church teaches.</p>
              <p>Good example are those who worship greedy gospel, they really believed that being geeedy is what god wants although it is clearly what their self pro-claimed pastor wants. But they belived 100% anyway although their preacher may be untrained or trained ftom unkown sources etc..., they believed every words their pastor said.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, God has spoken to us thru the prophets, Christ has come to fulfilled the prophecies, the bible and the Holy Spirit is here to guide us. We need to have faith and pray for God's grace of wisdoms and use them.</p>
              <p>There is no contradictions in the bible and everything from Genesis to Revelation is the truth. Not everything that is said in the bible may have happened in the way it is described because they are passed down orally (and people tends to add in their own elements when they tell stories) and some might not even have happened. But the important thing is not the vehicle but the passenger - I.E. the message that God wants to bring to us thru the bible  which St Paul sums up best as faith, hope and love and nothing is greater than love.</p>
              <p>The healing of the little girl is a grace from God and she rightly thanked God for it beacuse she has put her faith in God. To non-believers, this is stupidity and crap and some even blamed God for getting sick! It's one choice where they want to be.</p>
