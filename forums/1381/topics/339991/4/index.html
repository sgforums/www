              <p>This is often claimed because the Bible says said 
                                        that every eye will see Jesus at His Second Coming. 
                                        However, it would seem that His coming will envelop 
                                        the entire earth</p>
              <p>The prophet Isaiah also 
                                        tells us that the earth is round: "It is he that 
                                        sits upon the circle of the earth" (Isaiah 40:22). 
                                        This is not a reference to a flat disk, as some skeptic 
                                        maintain, but to a sphere. Secular man discovered this 
                                        2,400 years later. At a time when science believed that 
                                        the earth was flat, is was the Scriptures that inspired 
                                        Christopher Columbus to sail around the world (see Proverbs 
                                        3:6 footnote).</p>

              <p>it's faulty and limited human logic which made people to believe that the earth is flat during a period of time - until someone sailed around the world. forgot who though.</p>

              <p>As for number two, the church(I'm Catholic) has its faults too
              for example holding on the principle that the earth was the center
              of the universe.</p>
              <p>'Experts' from the Catholic church agreed that everything
              revolved around our planet and incarcerate everyone who thought
              otherwise.</p>
              <p>...until proven wrong. And the church corrected itself no longer
              insisting on this false belief which I've found to be groundless
              from the perspective of the scriptures(bible).</p>
              <p>The point is you put your faith in Jesus not unto one
              organization. You worship God not organization. The church itself
              means congregation of believers which now has shifted its meaning
              into building for Christian worshippers to gather or into a
              hierarchy that governs and manage Christian activities. The church
              is you, the church is me the church is the congregation of
              believers and not pointing to any hierarchy. I do not mean that we
              have to disrespect the church hierarchy but too many people have
              fallen into religion fanatics. I used religion fanatics and not
              religious fanatics because anyone who is truly religious or a man
              of God would never become a fanatic. Worship God not your
              religion.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents anyway.</p>

              <p>I am not sure about Catholic Church view that the earth is flat - is it a view of the theologist or an official Church teaching ? Can you point to me cause I am curious...</p>
              <p>Anyway, what is important is that we know the truth and the Church's official teaching now.</p>
              <p>I agree with you that we all should worship God but the Church (organisation in your wordings) is equally important. The Church's teaching must be the truth based on the Gospel and teachings of Jesus. Even though there are many variations and interpretation, we do have the grace from God to discern which is more resonable and correct in our opinion and embrace on that Church.</p>
              <p>I disagree with people trying to read the Bible on their own and try to find a meaning to it because it is quite difficult and dangerous....</p>
              <p>Difficult because one need to know the history, langauge, translations, the context in which the passage was written, the purpose and audience etc....</p>
              <p>Dangerous because there are many "wrong" interpretations leading to many "stay home christians", and the worst are those self proclaimed pastors who is leading quite a few innocent people astray with their non-denomination charimatic gatherings.</p>
              <p>So staying with a Church that has proper trained priest and pastor is important. Otherwise, we will start seeing more cultish activities coming our way....all done in the name of God but with twisted "bible truth".</p>

That particular conflict (from many centuries ago) was a mistake between two schools of scientific thought. Mistake the Church made was to subscribe to any school at all.

              Proof? How about a witness? A witness testimony is considered a proof in the court.
              And here is my testimony I wrote in other forum.
              
              Hello HolyRoute yes I did see Jesus Christ when I was in my 7th grade. I will never forget that day.
              
              I was then in my bed at night about 8 pm. I felt terrible about my life. i felt that many people seemed to hate me for no obvious reasons. Then I started to cry. But Because I was a boy I covered my face with my pillow not to let anyone knew I was crying. As I began to cry I started to imagine that I was hugging Jesus where in fact I was hugging my pillow. As I was doing this I thought to myself that no one was worth defending except Jesus and a powerful thought came to me that Jesus was the one without sin. After that thought I felt love for Jesus. Small at first but in a mere few seconds that small love for Jesus was growing exponentially such that in the end I was really really in love with Jesus. I would give to Jesus anything that He asked of me anything at all because I loved Him so much. Then a thought came to me that I could ask something from God.
              So I did.
              
              I asked to be allowed to see Jesus face. Mind you I didn't really realize that Jesus was not mere man as I was still a child. I never read the bible then too. After I uttered my wish with my thought a powerful vision came to me while I was still fully awake laying on my bed. I saw what I believed to be Jesus. His whole body was covered with such immense white light that was coming out from His face. I didn't see any figure but I knew the direction of His face. And because I wanted to see His face I tried to look into the direction of His face but the intensity of the light was such that I couldn't penetrate the light. The light was (getting) much more intense in the direction of His face. The light wasn't giving me any pain though at first. But I was persistent(or foolish) that I kept on trying over and over again. Until I thought to myself: Never mind not being able to see Jesus face. I've seen God and now I could tell this to others. After I thought that to myself I tried for the last time to stare into the direction of His face but this time both of my physical eyeballs hurt. It felt like burning(I didn't realize it was a burning sensation then though) it felt like any small needles hit both of my eyeballs. After this I didn't dare to stare in the direction of His face and only dared to stare down. The vision then began to grow weaker and weaker until it disappear completely.
              
              Be blessed
              -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              
              And the bible never said that the earth was created 5,000 years ago. Where did you get that false information?

                                - is it a view of the theologist or an official Church teaching ?
                                Can you point to me cause I am curious...</p>
                                <p>Anyway, what is important is that we know the truth and the
                                Church's official teaching now.</p>
                                <p>I agree with you that we all should worship God but the Church
                                (organisation in your wordings) is equally important. The Church's
                                teaching must be the truth based on the Gospel and teachings of
                                Jesus. Even though there are many variations and interpretation, we
                                do have the grace from God to discern which is more resonable and
                                correct in our opinion and embrace on that Church.</p>
                                <p>I disagree with people trying to read the Bible on their own and
                                try to find a meaning to it because it is quite difficult and
                                dangerous....</p>
                                <p>Difficult because one need to know the history, langauge,
                                translations, the context in which the passage was written, the
                                purpose and audience etc....</p>
                                <p>Dangerous because there are many "wrong" interpretations leading
                                to many "stay home christians", and the worst are those self
                                proclaimed pastors who is leading quite a few innocent people
                                astray with their non-denomination charimatic gatherings.</p>
                                <p>So staying with a Church that has proper trained priest and
                                pastor is important. Otherwise, we will start seeing more cultish
                                activities coming our way....all done in the name of God but with
                                twisted "bible truth".</p>

                                Well I don't know about the earth being flat but rather about the earth being the center of the universe. As far as I know it was the official church stand which it rigorously defended.
              
              I think everyone should read the bible with open conscience. And about the danger of cultism. Again the answer is to read your bible. And if you're still fooled by false teachers and false prophets which are abundant in numbers so help you God.
              
              Besides, having a unified perspective on the bible doesn't guarantee that it is the most accurate interpretation of the bible as proved by the then unified stand that the earth was  the center of the universe.

              <p><a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/galileo_controversy.asp">http://www.catholic.com/library/galileo_controversy.asp</a></p>
              <p>Interesting points from the article (for those too lazy to read the article <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">) :</p>
              <ul>
              <li>During Galileo's time, the geocentric view was widely held to be true by the scientific community at large and not just the Church.  </li>
              <li>Contrary to popular belief, Galileo did not manage to prove heliocentricity beyond reasonable doubt because he could not answer the strongest argument against heliocentricity which was made nearly two thousand years earlier by Aristotle. The measuring equipment of Galileo's day did not allow him to do so.</li>
              <li>It was a good thing the Church did not rush to embrace Galileo’s views, because it turned out that his ideas were not entirely correct either. Galileo believed that the sun was not just the fixed center of the solar system but the fixed center of the universe. We now know that the sun is not the center of the universe and that it does move — it simply orbits the center of the galaxy rather than the earth. </li>
              <li>In Galileo's time, the Church had just gone through the Reformation experience and was wary of controversy. Theologians were not prepared to entertain a layman re-interpreting scripture based on the heliocentric theory when he had not proved the new theory beyond reasonable doubt. The Catholic Church has since acknowledged that Galileo's condemnation was wrong (and has even issued two stamps of Galileo <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> ).</li>
              <li>We have to remember that the Church's mission is to guide people to heaven; and not to make mathematicians, scientists or astronomers out of people. The Church can be wrong when it comes to these matters but not in matters of faith and morals.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Separately, you don't have to worry about choosing between believing in the teachings of Christ and in the <em>official</em> teachings of the Church* . They are one and the same. Jesus established the Church on earth and granted it authority to teach faith and morals in his name as is made clear in the bible, eg: Luke 10:16 - "whoever hears you, hears me. Whoever rejects you, rejects me."; 1 Tim. 3:15 - the Church being "the pillar and foundation of truth"; Mathew 18-17 - the Church being the final arbiter on disputes in faith and morals and being given the authority to bind and to loose.  </p>
              <p><em>* not those of a single priest, another Catholic or a non-Catholic making claims on what the Catholic Church teaches; which might or might not be accurate.</em></p>

              <p><br>Proof? How about a witness? A witness testimony is considered a proof in the court. And here is my testimony I wrote in other forum. Hello HolyRoute yes I did see Jesus Christ when I was in my 7th grade. I will never forget that day. I was then in my bed at night about 8 pm. I felt terrible about my life. i felt that many people seemed to hate me for no obvious reasons. Then I started to cry. But Because I was a boy I covered my face with my pillow not to let anyone knew I was crying. As I began to cry I started to imagine that I was hugging Jesus where in fact I was hugging my pillow. As I was doing this I thought to myself that no one was worth defending except Jesus and a powerful thought came to me that Jesus was the one without sin. After that thought I felt love for Jesus. Small at first but in a mere few seconds that small love for Jesus was growing exponentially such that in the end I was really really in love with Jesus. I would give to Jesus anything that He asked of me anything at all because I loved Him so much. Then a thought came to me that I could ask something from God. So I did. I asked to be allowed to see Jesus face. Mind you I didn't really realize that Jesus was not mere man as I was still a child. I never read the bible then too. After I uttered my wish with my thought a powerful vision came to me while I was still fully awake laying on my bed. I saw what I believed to be Jesus. His whole body was covered with such immense white light that was coming out from His face. I didn't see any figure but I knew the direction of His face. And because I wanted to see His face I tried to look into the direction of His face but the intensity of the light was such that I couldn't penetrate the light. The light was (getting) much more intense in the direction of His face. The light wasn't giving me any pain though at first. But I was persistent(or foolish) that I kept on trying over and over again. Until I thought to myself: Never mind not being able to see Jesus face. I've seen God and now I could tell this to others. After I thought that to myself I tried for the last time to stare into the direction of His face but this time both of my physical eyeballs hurt. It felt like burning(I didn't realize it was a burning sensation then though) it felt like any small needles hit both of my eyeballs. After this I didn't dare to stare in the direction of His face and only dared to stare down. The vision then began to grow weaker and weaker until it disappear completely. Be blessed ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And the bible never said that the earth was created 5,000 years ago. Where did you get that false information?</p>

              <p><br>The testimony you just gave was less than believable. And Smarty Boy, you say that there is evidence, so why don't you provide some? I know why you people believe so much of superstition. Since you were born, your parents raised you saying things like "Pray to god and get good results in everything" Since you were very young and open minded, you accepted it as the truth. Even as you got older, you did not think about it, whether it seems logical. And this keeps going on for more and more stupid generations to come. You all might not understand why we do not belive in 'god', but just ask yourself, why do you think all the other religeons' claims are false. Anyone can say they saw jesus. But this sounds like you were dreaming while falling asleep. Either that or you are delusional.</p>
              <p>Thank you for correcting me on the 5000 years thing. Someone once told me that dinosaurs are a scam and everything started 5000 years ago. That person called herself a christian, guess she did not read the bible.</p>

              <p>if you're catholic, the bible should be the final authority of truth for you (i'm pretty sure the catholic church believes in creation, i'll be appalled if otherwise)</p>
              <p>it's why sin came into the world etc, the flood, all of it, is truth for us.</p>
              <p>or is Jesus' death on the cross a fairy tale for you too? then question is, if you don't believe that the bible holds the truth which sets you free, are you really saved on the basis of your confession of your faith (or lack of)?</p>
              <p>it's good to find out more though, be convinced by your own findings. =) go attend some courses, ask your priests, ask your mentors etc.</p>
              <p>i'm sorry, but i always get frustrated that how come the catholics i know personally don't seem to know why they're believers, or what they really believe.</p>
              <p>it's a fine time to start figuring out your faith, because your salvation depends on what you believe is truth..</p>
