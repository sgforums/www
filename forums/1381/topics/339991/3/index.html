              <p>Hi Mricales&amp;Prophecies,</p>
              <p>We may be of different religions (im a Muslim) but we do share a
              lot of common beliefs; one of which is that God have a 'hand' in
              everything that happens, be it good or bad.Without his Will, the
              girl may not live even how good the doctors or equipments may be.
              That is why no doctors will claim any surgery etc to be 100%
              safe.</p>
              <p>To add, He gave us the freedom to choose between right from
              wrong. If we choose to do wrong, He can stop us but He did not. He
              let us be 'cause he gave us the ability to think and we will answer
              for our consequences. Just like a parent, He will not stop us from
              doing something if we insists on doing so, but we have to answer
              for it ourselves. If we want to commit heinous crimes like murder
              or rape, we will answer for it. It will defeat our purpose of being
              here if He stops all bad things from happening.</p>
              <p>God is fair. He will reward those who do good and punish those
              who do bad. His punishements or rewards can come in this life or in
              the afterlife.</p>

              <p>Hi M&amp;P,</p>
              <p>I am just curious to know <strong>(1)</strong> when and where
                                  are there contradictions in the bible?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I'll try to answer your first question first(not in the mood of reading long passage right now)</p>
              <p>One of the most contradictory story told in the bible can be found in the story of the 2 men which were crucified along with Jesus.</p>
              <p>Luke told us that one of these man repented and believed in Jesus. and Luke told us that Jesus told him that on that very day the man would be with him in paradise.</p>
              <p>John made no mention of the two men who were crucified with Jesus.</p>
              <p>Mark and Matthew told us that the two man who were crucified with Jesus, both of them mocked(insulted) Jesus and didn't repent.</p>
              <p>Another point worth noting is that Jesus has always said or implied that He would be raised only after 3 days. So Jesus couldn't possibly be saying that in that very day He and the men who repented would be in paradise. Because Jesus was only going to be raised on the third day. Jesus was in sheol or the world of the dead for three days before being raised. This is one of the controversy which some try to explain that there had been a misintrepretation from its original greek language in which a comma wasn't translated to the english scripture altering the meaning altogether. With a comma what Jesus actually said would be: This very day I told you that you would be with me in paradise. So Jesus didn't promise that  he would be with Jesus in paradise that very day. Jesus was merely saying today I tell you that you will be with me in paradise.</p>
              <p>Those two are some of the examples.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for number two, the church(I'm Catholic) has its faults too for example holding on the principle that the earth was the center of the universe.</p>
              <p>'Experts' from the Catholic church agreed that everything revolved around our planet and incarcerate everyone who thought otherwise.</p>
              <p>...until proven wrong. And the church corrected itself no longer insisting on this false belief which I've found to be groundless from the perspective of the scriptures(bible).</p>
              <p>The point is you put your faith in Jesus not unto one organization. You worship God not organization. The church itself means congregation of believers which now has shifted its meaning into building for Christian worshippers to gather or into a hierarchy that governs and manage Christian activities. The church is you, the church is me the church is the congregation of believers and not pointing to any hierarchy. I do not mean that we have to disrespect the church hierarchy but too many people have fallen into religion fanatics. I used religion fanatics and not religious fanatics because anyone who is truly religious or a man of God would never become a fanatic. Worship God not your religion.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents anyway.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>I'm a Christian and I've seen Jesus in glory while I was in my 7th grade quite a long time ago. So while atheists are still debating with other believers that there is no proof of God I've seen the proof personaly and I know that Jesus is indeed God otherwise He would not be in such glory that He is now.</p>

              <p>That is the reasons why atheists cannot shut up.... they have to speak against people who talk about things that are not reasonable.</p>
              <p>If the child keep insisting on paying 10 dollars for a 5 dollar thing, would you just let him continue to do that or would you do some drastic action, like stop giving him pocket money or send him to theraipist.</p>

              <p>SIngapore geography textbook and see if they got say its caused by god to teach human beings a lesson..</p>

              <p>let me repeat this answer again on behalf of science for ten thousandth times..... Science is the most humble thing which seeks to find truth bit by bit is reasonable method in the world with infinite knowledge, and apply these real knowledge to aid humans. Science knows that it don't know many things . Of course, Science never claims that it know everything in the universe. There is just oo much knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike science, religions just claims that god create universe and then continue with their own narrow minded stories and rules to follow. Their evidences are their respective books, miracles, ancestors legacy, and individual feelings.</p>

              <p>i wont respond to your so called rebuttal since it's a shameless attempt to distract from the original topic.</p>
              <p>but in your other reply, u seem to be one of those doofus who imagine: because evolution is true, therefore God doesn't exist. Mind enlightening me how does evolution theory <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prove</span> God's nonexistence? Because there've been people (e.g. Simon Conway Morris and Ronald Fisher) who have no problem believing both.</p>
              <p>now in your reply to me, first up, science and religion don't make these claims, people do. Science, pursued humbly and rationally, doesnt cause its practitioners to declare that God doesnt exist, BUT atheist fundamentalists who have no other way to pursue their agenda do so. They carry their atheistic assumptions to science, instead of basing them upon it.</p>
              <p>about your delirious reference to "religions", i've no idea which ones you're writing about since you've neglected to make specific references. But as i said earlier, there's no conflict between religion (at least for Christianity) and science. I've mentioned some people who faithfully pursue the discipline of science and are still theists.</p>
              <p>To the person who used Galileo as an example, just demonstrated that the simplistic belief that religion clashes with science is an idea that languishes in academic backwater, and probably suspension in time. It was a conflict between Copernican science and Aristotelian science which had become Church tradition, not science versus religion. </p>
              <p>Like Herzog, if you believe science to be an attempt to discover the workings of the physical world, and that the truth remains out there (probably forever), at best, from your worldview, science should always remain a question mark and not qualify you to make unncessary conclusions. To make this jump from the question mark to a  claim of refutation, you're taking a leap of faith - the very thing i suspect you're accusing theists of.</p>
              <p>In fact, the belief that science will eventually discover the "truth" and find all answers, is a claim of faith in itself. Consider the biblical definition of faith - "<em>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</em>" (Hebrews 11:1, ESV)</p>

              <p>after scanning some of your replies, i realize that you all are
              unreaonable in your logic. Without science, do you think you can
              enjoy the benefits that modern life affords. Please dun credit god
              again by saying that god create science.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to repeat, its christian or the bible who says that
              earth is flat and center of universe. Lucky science has discover
              such nonsense.</p>
