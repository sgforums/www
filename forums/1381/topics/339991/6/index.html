                              <p>Dear brothers and sisters,</p>
              <p>Ya, it's pretty sad that people choose to put their 'blind
              faith' totally in machines and science. Who created us? Evolution?
              Kinda nonsense isnt it if we think of the complexities of our
              body. </p>
              <p>It defies any logic or scientific theories that its just a mere
              coincidence that we are who we are. What if we have our feet where
              our hands should be? What if we have our nose where our mouths
              should be? What if our internal organs are not organised as they
              way they are now? Coincidence?</p>
              <p>Look at the things around us; animals, plants, mountains, trees
              etc. All have their own purpose. Coincidence?</p>
              <p>All of us will die one day. Isnt it sad that we forget that? So
              what are our purpose in this life?</p>
              <p>So the science take all the credit for saving the girl's life?
              Who gave us the brains to be who we are? To invent the things we
              see today? Without faith, what is there for us to cling on to when
              times are bad, or when we are on the down?</p>
              <p>Btw, im a Muslim.</p>

              1)You clearly have not understood what "natural selection" meant. It answers your 1st three paragraphs. (google for your answer).
              
              2)Our purpose in this life, is defined by ourselves. For me, I would like to aid the advancement of humanity through science, so my future descendants can lead a better life.
              
              3)Natural selection gave us brains. Whether there is a god which influenced nature or not, I cannot answer you, but I am certain if there is, he is nether Yahweh nor Allah.
              
              4) Only weak people cling on to faiths when times are bad or when they are down. People with a strong mentality, will with their strong resilience, bounce right back on track with their lives, using their superior intelligence to guide them, solving their problems.

              Plato and Aristotle understood the word, in the sense which<br>
              implies finality; in science, we never have sufficient reason for

                            </div>
                          </blockquote><br>
              
              <p>Science is dynamic, always changing to inch nearer to the truth. </p>
              
              <p>But what is truth? According to hume's fork: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume%27s_fork there cant be a truth, due to the fact that we might be deluded by our senses.</p>
              
              <p>To fully accept hume's law, it would mean everything is pointless. Yet i do not wish for that nor do I fully agree with hume's law. Only partially.</p>
              
              <p>Thus my opinion of "truth" is what people's senses tell them, together with what you have discovered, using your rational and logical thinking.</p>
              
              <p>The origins of the universe, may or may not be discovered by science</p>

              <p>I don't understand what is the truth of things. Learning science
              can only discover how things work, that's all. Will a human build a

              believers(in God) are wrong. Until the time comes, let's stick to

              <p>Well, being an agnostic means you are uncertain of the existence of a god or gods.</p>
                      
              <p>With our current ability and knowledge, there is no way of answering the question about a god's existence. Thus I applaud people who honestly and courageously use their brains to seek the answer to this.</p>
                      
              <p>Whereas I despise people who cling on to faith when times are bad, people who submit to emotional or peer pressure and convert to christianity/islam, people who blindly delude themselves into thinking there is a god, and dismiss all other theories, believing these theories originate from the devil. I think such people will be the bane of humanity. Religion, even in moderation, provides a breeding ground for such idealogy.</p>

              <p>Nope. Biologically, we have not adapted to the institutions we have put in place, and we still squabble and wage wars overy territory and ideology. We have expanded our collective body of knowledge and ability to manipulate resources, but not the ability to share them equally. We create, build and tweak systems of governance and economy but they continue to fail.</p>
              <p>Do not ridicule another person's search for perfect truth in the divine when mankind has never proved its worth in the first place.</p>

              <p>Ya, it's pretty sad that people choose to put their 'blind
              faith' totally in machines and science. Who created us? Evolution?
              Kinda nonsense isnt it if we think of the complexities of our
              body. </p>
              <p>It defies any logic or scientific theories that its just a mere
              coincidence that we are who we are. What if we have our feet where
              our hands should be? What if we have our nose where our mouths
              should be? What if our internal organs are not organised as they
              way they are now? Coincidence?</p>
              <p>Look at the things around us; animals, plants, mountains, trees
              etc. All have their own purpose. Coincidence?</p>
              <p>All of us will die one day. Isnt it sad that we forget that? So
              what are our purpose in this life?</p>
              <p>So the science take all the credit for saving the girl's life?
              Who gave us the brains to be who we are? To invent the things we
              see today? Without faith, what is there for us to cling on to when
              times are bad, or when we are on the down?</p>
