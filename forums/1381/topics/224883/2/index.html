Most of us have our beliefs and you might not agree with them due to doctrinal differences.<br><br>Why attend church if you don't think it is right? It is like being forced to shop with someone who only wants to look at something you are not interested in . I think that is wrong.

The whole species of mankind, more than 10 billion people from the past till now, are blamed for the wrong choice 2 individual made. Is tat wat u r saying ?<br><br><blockquote>So are you saying just because we have free will , all of us are going to be great sinners like murdering people, stealing from people, committing adultery ? God might as well create robots instead but he created a variety in the world. He chosen to give us free will in the hope that we will come to him willingly, love and worship him out of our own free will . </blockquote>No, we do not have to kill people or steal from peopel to be sinners. There r tons of people, if not most people who do not do tat but according to christainity they still sin. The idea of sinning is so trivial tat even placing your exam as more important as god is a deadly sin. Free will will definitely lead to sinning, and tat is why everyone according to christainity r sinners. To summarise the issue, using davidche words<br><br>God knows free will will lead us to sinning which is bad.<br>Creating us to become robots is also bad.<br><br>So how?<br></div>
