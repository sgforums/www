            <div class='col-md body'><p>Morality was apply within only a particular tribe’s agreements, and the rightness of action on its collective mood towards addressing other groups, it’s individuated and localized to only particular groupings, and really should have reality within the attendant cultural paradigms who agree with it. But the Israelites had a specific worldview, and they imposed that worldview; that radical new world view was monotheism. The eating off this tree of knowledge of good and bad has caused a moral conflict and tension between Yahweh’s good design for creation. The drama of humanity’s life should revolve not around the search for eternal life, nor preoccupation with immortality; it was not in Yahweh’s design for this kind of drama. It’s the power of moral choice alone that is godlike. <br><br>Morality’s about balance and survival, and the methods aren’t as important as the mannerisms in preserving humanity for eons instead of centuries, as humanity is walking in the footsteps of so called ancient civilizations in odious and strange ways. A pop culture where the modus litany puts valuables before values, character, ethic, writes a recipe for ruin.  The error is as deep as the nature of man, humanity cannot expect any deliverance from it so long as the nature of man continues the same, and humanity’s natural love of truth almost as depraved as humanity’s natural love of holiness. Humanity has before it the opportunity to become a conscious cooperator, no longer must we be merely unconscious players at the mercy of forces and energies beyond our control. Today we are intelligent enough and conscious enough to see the patterns and cycles that converge to form human destiny. Today humanity can take an active part in molding that destiny and not be simply the unwitting subject of the forces of change. But awaiting humanity is the Day of Yahweh, a popular idea among the Israelites, that on some future occasion, Yahweh would dramatically intervene in world affairs and he would do so on Israel’s behalf. He would lead Israel in victory over her enemies. They would be punished. Israel would be restored to her full and former glory.  <br><br>Remember those covenants,<br><br>http://thatlifeyahwehhas.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2011-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;updated-max=2012-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;max-results=12<br><br><br> <br></p></div>

              <p>You don't need to overcome the old nature. In fact nobody can overcome it. That is why Jesus Christ had to die for our sins.</p>

              <p>correct.  just asking for forgivenness alone is not enough.  you have to repent.  but then look around you.  how many people are truly repentent?  many have the misconception they will go to heaven just because they accepted christ.  there are those who professed their love for god but yet cant even love the people around them.</p>

              <p>OK, now I know those who honour Jesus and continue to sin will go paradise.  Thank you.</p>
              <p>But, hold on, it is contradicting isn't it.  Jesus mentioned not all who called him Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven.   Ummmmm . .. . .. .   </p>

              <p><br>Such logic.   So it is ok for children who have parents to go round sinning , killing, robbing and so on la because good works does not matter.</p>

              <p>correct...the context for tat scripture is referring to those who knew abt jesus way b4 they were near death...like if i 1st accepted christ when i was 20, i am expected to work towards living a godly life until i die...i will still sin cos i am still not perfect...however its the effort tat counts most to God...its like tis, if ur child studied very hard for his exam yet he came back wif a fail grade, will u still scold/cane him or worse throw him out of the house cos he failed? when i was growing up, my parents always told me tat if i studied hard and failed, they wun get angry...but if i failed cos i was lazy and dint study, they will be angry...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so for a 20yr old who accepted christ and lead a life sinning wilfully, then the qn will be whether he was truly saved in the 1st place...these are the ones jeus was referring to who will say Lord, Lord but will have no place in heaven cos they were not truly saved in the 1st place...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for eg, if i received christ cos i want to be bless or if i receive christ cos its good to do so, these ppl may not be truly saved cos the significance of salvation is not so tat we can be blessed or tat its good to be saved, rather its cos we acknowledge the love of God, Jesus death on  the cross for our sins and tat Jeus is our Lord and saviour...if today we come from a stable family, do we live wif our parents cos they are rich, happy or do we live wif them simply cos they gave birth to us, provided for us and loved us??? same for God, we acknowledge tat he created us, loves us and tat heaven is home to those who are willing to turn back and reconcile the parent-child r/s which was broken when adam fell...</p>
