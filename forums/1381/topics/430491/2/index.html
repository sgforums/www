              <p>consequences yes...on judgment day, there will be 2 type of judgments...one for the non-believers and one for believers...believers will be judged for their good/bad works and seriously, if a christian commits murder while on earth, does he get away wif it? no he doesnt...he will be punished by the country's law and if he doesnt repent b4 God, he may even not make it to heaven...however, if he repents to god, he will pay the price on earth but be given his place in paradise...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>correct...the context for tat scripture is referring to those who knew abt jesus way b4 they were near death...like if i 1st accepted christ when i was 20, i am expected to work towards living a godly life until i die...i will still sin cos i am still not perfect...however its the effort tat counts most to God...its like tis, if ur child studied very hard for his exam yet he came back wif a fail grade, will u still scold/cane him or worse throw him out of the house cos he failed? when i was growing up, my parents always told me tat if i studied hard and failed, they wun get angry...but if i failed cos i was lazy and dint study, they will be angry...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so for a 20yr old who accepted christ and lead a life sinning wilfully, then the qn will be whether he was truly saved in the 1st place...these are the ones jeus was referring to who will say Lord, Lord but will have no place in heaven cos they were not truly saved in the 1st place...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for eg, if i received christ cos i want to be bless or if i receive christ cos its good to do so, these ppl may not be truly saved cos the significance of salvation is not so tat we can be blessed or tat its good to be saved, rather its cos we acknowledge the love of God, Jesus death on  the cross for our sins and tat Jeus is our Lord and saviour...if today we come from a stable family, do we live wif our parents cos they are rich, happy or do we live wif them simply cos they gave birth to us, provided for us and loved us??? same for God, we acknowledge tat he created us, loves us and tat heaven is home to those who are willing to turn back and reconcile the parent-child r/s which was broken when adam fell...</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Please do your beloved God and Jesus a favour if you love your god not to misinterpret what Jesus said.  No wonder so many christians not doing what God, Jesus want them to, shake my head.   Your explanation in red is absolutely not accepted.      Christians can be truly saved yet choose to continue to sin and refuse to repent.     </span></p>
