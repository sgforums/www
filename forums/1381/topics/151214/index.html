As most of you would know.. Catholics believe that Jesus is truly present in the communion (Eucharist)... as in we are consuming the real body of Christ.<br><br>anyway .. i was with 3 friends ... 2 mentioned that it was just a symbol ... another one mentioned that it was the true body of Christ.<br><br>my question now ... is it a case of different denominations having different intepretations? or is there a prevailing view?<br><br>just being curious<br><br>disclaimer: i am not trying to insinuate anything</div></blockquote>1. according to macross, it is truly flesh n blood.<br>2. protestant churches who does practice it, treated it as symbols. usually.<br><br>according to the catholic encyclopedia, protestant churches needed some form of rituals, ranks and rules to prevent screwing up their orders, so they import some rituals over. or something like that.</div>

Read from somewhere that they believe that one was really Jesus body, but under the presence of the bread. (ie. Look like bread.  Taste like bread.  But it is the true flesh of Christ).  But then, that's very close to Catholic's teaching leh.  Think got a lot of grey lines in between...hahah<br><br>Not sure whether it was Presbyterian or which main stream denomination that says Jesus is spiritually present in the bread.<br><br>The only ones who say it's just a bread to symbolise body of Christ is the Methodists.  Today, many fundamentalists also agree on that.<br><br>Calvin spent some years in Germany, which I suppose he was then working with Luther.  I just came across some notes and was surprised to see this fact : Calvin was 25 years younger than Luther.  I always thought they were around the same age.  That's why they shared the same ambition.<br><br>I forgot where I read recently again on both of them working together before they disagreed with each other.  Have to look up again.</div>
