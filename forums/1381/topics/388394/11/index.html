              <p>i have never said christianity teachings is ridiculous, it is the people who interpret them are ridiculous. i have friends from other denomination did not say whether the prayers are answered or not depends on the relationship with god. instead they said it depends on whether the person follow jesus' teachings (the ten commandments). this makes sense to me.</p>

              Shih Chih-hao, who ran a Buddhist academy in Taipei County, was found
              guilty of molesting and sexually assaulting the boys, all under 14
              years old, said Wen Yao-yuan, spokesman for the Taiwan High Court.</div>
              <br> The scandal erupted in 2000 when police began investigating allegations
              by some 25 pupils at the academy -- a shelter for abused, runaway and
              impoverished boys -- that they were sexually abused by Shih.<br> <br> The boys reportedly said they were molested by Shih during meditation
              sessions or forced to have sex with him while they were taking baths.<br> <br> In 2002 the Taipei District Court sentenced Shih to 12 years in jail.
              He appealed the ruling to the High Court, which upheld the previous
              verdict in 2004.<br> <br> Shih, who claimed innocence, later appealed to the Supreme Court which
              ordered a new trial. The High Court on Thursday handed down a guilty
              verdict, but reduced the prison term to 11 years and six months plus
              mandatory therapy.<br> <br> The 43-year-old monk first caught public attention when he took his
              pupils to a graveyard and told them to sit on tombs and meditate to
              overcome their fear of death.<br> <br> The Buddhist academy, which had sheltered some 30 boys since its opening in 1999, was shut down after the scandal came to light.</div>
