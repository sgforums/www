              <p>He's not wrong actually, think of it, cai shen ye? God of prosperity? Praying for 4D numbers?</p>
              <p>And I'm sure these are not the only religions or cultures where those practicing it or claim to be practicing it sell the idea that it is about being rewarded financially or materially.</p>
              <p>Or like witch doctors who promise winning streak for football teams or other professional atheletes.</p>
              <p>The difference though lies in the structure.</p>

              <p>Chinese religions are a mixture of religion and culture so I don't think Buddhism, Taoism or Confucianism in strictly religious terms teach you to be rich, pray to god of prosperity, pray for 4D numbers.</p>
              <p> The book of Malachi:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The last of the twelve <span class="mw-redirect">minor prophets</span> (canonically), the final book of the Hebrew Bible in Christian, but not Jewish tradition.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Information about Tithing:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Due to the fact that the New Testament explicitly directs Christians to
              give voluntarily as each person has determined in their hearts (2
              Corinthians 9:7) and condemns those who make a show of their donations
              to organized religion (Mark 12:41-44, Matt. 6:3), the arguments for
              tithing as a Biblical practice seem to violate the basic principles of
              Biblical interpretation used by most conservative Protestants.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Tithing is also practised in Islam and Sikhism:</p>

              <p>Prosperity gospel... Hmmm how did we get here in the first place?</p>
              <p>From this forum it seems that these are the thoughts about it:</p>
              <p>1. Church that believes and preaches that its good for members to prosper</p>
              <p>2. Inference from 1 is that the leaders of such churches are money-minded and materialistic cos they want members to be rich</p>
              <p>3. Inference from 2 is that the leaders want members to be rich so they will give more and so they can become rich</p>
              <p>Firstly, Christians, whether you believe its good to prosper or not... don't you think its rather irrational to assume that the SOLE reason a church wants members to do well is to add money to its budget. Not just irrational but its an awful awful claim to bring against somebody, let alone a church.</p>
              <p>Secondly, even if you don't believe that God Himself wants you to be rich (this is a theological debate... we can bring out the verses but then we'd argue till the cows come home) is it a bad thing to believe that? As long as there's a balance, and not an extreme focus on money. I do not see why its bad to want to prosper. Don't we all want to have enough to live comfortably.... and perhaps enough to give to others as well?</p>
