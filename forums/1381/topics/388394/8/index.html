              <p>Think should further seperate the concept of "reward". Whether or not you believe in "reward" is one thing, but not all churches talk about reward as being material reward. Just to point out the difference, not whether or not you believe there is a reward in the first place.</p>

              <p>Relax. What ever the pastor want to do, let them do it. In the
              end, is God who judge them, not we. Anything they do which is wrong
              to the god but acceptable to the majority of us they will faced the
              punishment when they are dead. (Although they say, repent to god
              and you will be blah blah blah, but they die before they got the
              chance, if according to that, they are going to a sad sad place
              =X). So let them do whatever they want. Regarding to tithe and
              offering, it is more of our personal choice. But we still need to
              understand they need $ to run the church, and a place for their
              member to pray and worship. But I will not comment so much on how
              much $ is acceptable to spent on such stuff. If you are rich, you
              tend to spent more. And giving tithe and offering, for me, is only
              when you can afford to give, without expecting any return, cause we
              are giving to help to spread the gospel and help to pay abit for
              the church, not for the "blessing" in the prosperity theory. If it
              is for the "blessing", then they are contradicting with theirself
              cause they mention "Don't treat God like a vending machine, put in
              $$$ and expect blessing to come out". and I belive the prosperity
              theory treat god as one. Anyway, pastor something might talk
              bullshit (since human make mistake, and are not perfect), is up to
              us to listen and decide. If they constant bullshiting, don't go to
              that church and find a new one, or backslide, or change a religion.
              In the end, we usually have no control over this situation beside
              complaining and commenting on the net.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree.</p>
              <p>All in all though, in the short term, the church leaders are answerable to their congregation. If the congregation and church members decide this is what they want, then it shows where they stand as a church.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I do not wish to say my own practice of Christianity is absolute, I will have my own answering to do come judgement day.</p>
              <p>If that is what the church members want, even if it were a friend, I cannot tell them no. But if what they wanted was something else then maybe I might suggest differently.</p>
