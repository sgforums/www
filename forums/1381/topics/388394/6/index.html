              <p>It was either in article of TV that Kong Hee indulges to buy  branded goods for wife.  </p>
              <p>Debatable topic lah!    If he personally earns so much (not from church) buys branded goods for wife.   If he uses the money from church to buy branded goods for wife.</p>
              <p>Christianity does not support love for materialism.</p>

              <p>When a church helps those in need, doing it in secrecy as the bible has
              taught, it would be criticised for not been seen or heard of doing any good deed.</p>
              <p>However, when the church helps those in need and make it known to the public, it is not immune from criticism either, and from the same critics too, for flaunting its wealth.</p>

              <p>Hmmm I didn't read the article about branded goods.</p>
              <p>But, Kong Hee is not paid by the church already right? Remember there was this ST article saying his last drawn salary was in 1994 or sth.</p>
              <p>LV bag is expensive but she's a celeb right so I don't think is especially extravagant.</p>

              <p>Hmmm...dunno how LV came about. I'm not sure if they own any LV...I think not...I never seen that before all these years...</p>
              <p>But I know the couple takes not from the church, but they gave alot of their own into the church and for charity, building orphanages in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and several schools in China....</p>
              <p>I think its very unfair if you do not know them, have no evidence or basis....but out of your own imagination accuse them of all kinds of things.</p>
              <p>WHat they buy and use with their own money is their own business and its nobody's. Since they're not using any public funds, but they helped so many people out of their own, we should give them credit for it.</p>

              <p>Ministry of internet, now thats quite a funny one! Come now, lets not accuse anyone of misusing funds without evidence shall we? :)</p>
              <p>Just cos someone has money doesnt mean its 'dirty money' or 'filthy rich'.</p>
              <p>Just cos someone buys an LV bag doesnt mean he/she 'stole it' does it?</p>

              <p>Hazel, some people here you don't have to take seriously. Some here post just for the sake of it or to disturb others. Rather than for the discussion itself. Some like to give an opposing view and stick with it.</p>
              <p>It's the culture here in sgforums, take it with a pinch of salt and bear in mind the possibility of a genuine discussion on the internet, especially in sgforums can be very low.</p>
              <p>About Kong Hee and his wife, I find it sad that when people talk about CHC they cannot seem to talk about these two either. It's almost as if these two individuals are as big if not bigger than the church itself.</p>
              <p>It has come to the point that theese two are like public figures already, so what they do even in their personal space will be commented or criticised sometimes. I won't say whether it's right that happens or whethey what they do is right or wrong, but that is how it is. People's perception is that they are fair game to the rest of the world. Maybe they are, maybe they aren't, just understand that is how people in general seem to see it.</p>
              <p>Ultimately despite my two paragraphs about them so far, the discussion in this topic should really be about the church itself rather than about just the two of them instead. About where CHC stands as a Church and organisation. The purpose of their activities, so on and so forth.</p>
