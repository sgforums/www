              <p>CITY Harvest Church has announced a $310 million expansion plan to buy land, and to erect a building that will house shops, restaurants and a 12,000-seat auditorium.</p>
              <p>Founder Kong Hee, 45, said during church services yesterday and last Saturday that the land sale would be completed later this month. He did not specify the location, but said the site would be in the 'central south' district.</p>
              <p>He described the site as 'super large'. It is believed the site covers an area as large as three football fields - six times the size of the Protestant church's current home in Jurong West Street 91, which it owns.</p>
              <p>'This is truly amazing,' Dr Kong said yesterday at the Singapore Expo, where it has been renting a hall for services. 'Finally, we will have a church in the marketplace, for the marketplace, to penetrate the marketplace.'</p>
              <p>The church's plans to incorporate retail elements into its building project follow similar plans announced in 2007 by New Creation Church, another large Christian group in Singapore.</p>
              <p>New Creation has teamed up with mall developer CapitaLand Retail to build an 'integrated hub' at Buona Vista. The $1 billion project, when ready in 2012, will house shops, a concert hall and a theatre.</p>

              <p>Well, hope all of them are really kind-hearted to give without motive and not to create more rice-Christians (convert and we give you food and other necessities/or make the locals listen to their preaching before giving) which is common with some religious charities.</p>
              <p>Btw is there any verse in the bible that say God wants you to make churches into megachurches or spent millions to make the churches into eye-poping complex like a shopping mall?</p>

                  are when he owns everything? All is need is a simple building for his

              <p>Well, hope all of them are really kind-hearted to give without motive and not to create more rice-Christians (convert and we give you food and other necessities/or make the locals listen to their preaching before giving) which is common with some religious charities.</p>
              <p>Btw is there any verse in the bible that say God wants you to make churches into megachurches or spent millions to make the churches into eye-poping complex like a shopping mall?</p>

              <p>The answer is no to your above question.   In fact, God teaches humility.</p>

              <p>It depends on whether u want to give</p>
              <p>however "their teaching always remind us of 100 fold returns"</p>
