              <p>Honestly, penetration of market ? sounds like a marketing strategy concept. Maybe he phrased it wrong as its supposed to be mean like bigger place for worship.. fair enough.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I thought all disciples of jesus are poorer and simple people. He said tat rich people should donate all their wealth before joining him before. He also warned people not to make money using religion as an excuse by hitting the stores around temples and calling them thieves.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>what you said is true.   Wealth sometimes is a blessing from God.  It is the motives that count.</p>

              <p>So the ritual of prayer has become more important than living according to the teachings of Jesus eh?</p>
              <p>I may question the divinity of Jesus but i could agree that he was a very moral person. Somehow i don't think he would have approved of such behaviour.</p>

              to give money to be pretty damn underhanded.</p>

              <p>Underhand. Haha. Playing with people mind. But human are not perfect. And pastor are human, thus not perfect. So this is their imperfect side. Just don't fall prey to it and we will just do fine  </p><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
