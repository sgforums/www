              <p>It's in the Old Testament but not in the New Testament.</p>
              <p>Does ti mean Christians do not need to tithe?</p>
              <p>God loves a cheerful giver. I <strong></strong>f one does not feel that the earth and everything in it belongs to Him, <strong>don't give</strong>.</p>
              <p>Christians honour Him by giving back some of what they've earned.</p>
              <p>CHC and NCC started out small and grew very large today. CHC and NCC are just two testimonies about giving back to God, made well known by the ranting and raving of their critics.</p>

              <p><br>i share the same sentiment. i tell you how naive they are. for eg. they found a good swimming coach for their children and told me it was because god blessed them. come on, i wonder is god really that free to look into this kind of trivial matter.</p>
              <p>they told me whether their prayers were answered or not depends on their relationship with god. ridiculous right ?</p>
              <p>there was once one of my family member and i were hoping for something important. she prayed to god very hard but i did not (free thinker). in the end, i got it and she didn't. that was the time when they stopped saying in front of me : god blessed them.</p>

              <p>i have never said christianity teachings is ridiculous, it is the people who interpret them are ridiculous. i have friends from other denomination did not say whether the prayers are answered or not depends on the relationship with god. instead they said it depends on whether the person follow jesus' teachings (the ten commandments). this makes sense to me.</p>

              <p><br>true, christianity isn't good works but grace, that is why so many christians cannot be bothered to be kind to people.    Thus many evil christians in workplace and other places.      Christians are taught that once they accept christ they can go heaven. While evangelising, no message on what jesus said is presented to non believers.  the message is jesus said that no everyone who call him lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven,. but those who repent and do the will of god.    Unfortunately, the presentation of gospel to non believers are more of salesman selling the product, aim only to convert and not to prepare the non believers that they have to change and do god's will after they convert to so call activate their going to heaven.   </p>

              <p>Most established orthodox religions usually focus on their god(s), prayer, religious practices like fasting, charity works etc.  Most if not all, warn of too much attachment to worldly material wealth and advise followers to put their religious beliefs ahead of material beliefs. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in modern times, I guess materialism and money wealth as become more important than any other religious belief.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are right. Nothing wrong with making a living to have a comfortable life.  But extravagence and over indulgence are the key words here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
