            <div class='col-md body'><p>Relax. What ever the pastor want to do, let them do it. In the end, is God who judge them, not we. Anything they do which is wrong to the god but acceptable to the majority of us they will faced the punishment when they are dead. (Although they say, repent to god and you will be blah blah blah, but they die before they got the chance, if according to that, they are going to a sad sad place =X). So let them do whatever they want. Regarding to tithe and offering, it is more of our personal choice. But we still need to understand they need $ to run the church, and a place for their member to pray and worship. But I will not comment so much on how much $ is acceptable to spent on such stuff. If you are rich, you tend to spent more. And giving tithe and offering, for me, is only when you can afford to give, without expecting any return, cause we are giving to help to spread the gospel and help to pay abit for the church, not for the "blessing" in the prosperity theory. If it is for the "blessing", then they are contradicting with theirself cause they mention "Don't treat God like a vending machine, put in $$$ and expect blessing to come out". and I belive the prosperity theory treat god as one. Anyway, pastor something might talk bullshit (since human make mistake, and are not perfect), is up to us to listen and decide. If they constant bullshiting, don't go to that church and find a new one, or backslide, or change a religion. In the end, we usually have no control over this situation beside complaining and commenting on the net.</p></div>

              <p>Sound like the prosperiy theory at work. But from what i can
              remember, the bible say that cause the Old Lady give her all to the
              Jesus, while the rich guy is simply showing off. This just show
              that the amount is not really important, but the attitude, heart
