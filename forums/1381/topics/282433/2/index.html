            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Likewise, for <strong>everywhere else in the b</strong>ible, you will never find God advocating for your "healthy sex" theory of having sex outside of marriage for the sake of a "healthy sex life". It is always always within marriage, and wherever sex mentioned out of marriage, it was always referred to as a sin. </blockquote>To be perfectly honest, god advocate incest (adam and eve decendents, noah's family), obliged to marry your sister in law (onan, Deuteronomy 25) and sex with slaves (exodus 21:7).<br><br>Just to point out tat sex is not as harmful as people mentioned in tis thread. Couples having sex but only have pleasure as the objective (usage of contraceptive) instead of reproduction is perfectly normal and healthy. A single guy masturbating has no harmful effect as well. To be honest again, even if u have premarital sex, as long as u r matured responsible adults, it is again harmless to society. It is similar to drinking alcohol. If u r an irresponsible adult, u can drink and drive and hit and run which also has disasterous effect.</div>

Those were exceptions in a certain contextual situation. </blockquote>Hey, did I say I will commit incest ? I only speak the truth tat god let its people commit incest. Someone (which is u) had mentioned tat nowhere is the bible do they mention healthy sex outside marriage. So how about Adam and eve and noah's ark ? People always mention about adam and eve and not adam and steve, or adam and eve is a sign of marriage etc etc etc but it is as plain as day their families commit incest, and do it pretty often to "populate" the world. I am pretty sure abel or cain have sex with their direct relatives as well. Why do god allow incest and even encourage it by asking adam and eve and their decendents to populate the world but suddenly make it become a deadly sin now ?  Is incest healthy sex ? it is the worst and most evil sexual activity, much worst than pre marital sex, sex with contraceptives, masturbation or even homosexual.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Because of the previous excellent reply by specialOps, I read through genesis tonight and find some very interesting sexual activity tat is found in the bible<br><br>Abram tell people his wife is his sister and allow the pharoah to marry her wife. It is a good move because he got a lot of possession from it. Poor pharoah though, he got cursed by god even when he is cheated. Abram then have sex with his maidservant when he is already married and give birth to sons. Sad to say the servant got mistreated and even sent off. Then Abraham again use the old trick and tell his wife is his sister at another time and let her marry another king ? And in the end u know wat is the most amazing thing ? Abraham wife is really his sister !! They commit incest and tat give birth to isaac !?!<br><br>Then u know wat happened to Lot ? He have sex with his 2 daughters and they bore him a son ? Now is he his grandfather or father ? Wat happened after tat ? Jacob married 2 sisters, then have sex with their servants too. Onan get killed because he practise the withdrawal method but Judah is fine when he visit prostitute and have sex with his daughter in law.<br><br>If u read the bible, u will realised sex with servants, incest with daughters and sisters, polygamy, having sex with sister in laws and daughter in laws etc is all fully supported by god.<br><br>Now tell me, after all tis happened in the bible, can u still say tat sex is sacred and only used for reproduction and only when married ? It seemed to me tat it is used as pleasure and trade and they can do it with anyone.</div>

God is unfair, as evident in the genesis who reward villains and liers while punished good people who did nothing wrong. God practise favourtism and look with favour on certain individual such as whose bloodline and if u r not his favoured bloodline, u have to stand unfair treatment. It teaches morality yet abolished them as well, as people who did criminal acts go about rewarded (sarah is a particular vicious person who become the mother of all nation) while those who commit minor sins r cursed with death (onan and job's family r sad tales). It also teaches people about revenge, and it is shown by killing of many tribes for not good reason and some is even encouraged by god itself.<br><br>If u say human character is evil and have weaknesses, god himself do display certain human traits and is not particularly wise, fair, forgiving, good, unjealous, unegoistic as thought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>If you read the creation story in genesis.  G-d did not create hell.  It is church teaching that believers of Jesus go to heaven, when they die and non-believers go to hell.  According to the OT, if we disobey the commanment of G_d  i.e the 7 laws of Noah, we will be punished.  If we obey we will be blessed.  That is why G-d require us to set up righteous and honest courts and apply fair justice in judging offenders.  In Judaism, when a person die, he dies and his spirit returns to G-d.  "Abrahim breathed his last and died in a ripe old age, an old man satisfied with life, and he was gathered to his people." genesis 25:8.   It is important that we be satisfied with our life.  If we live a righteous life, we may make some mistakes along the way, if we repent, G-d will surely forgive us.<br><br>"Yet you say, the way of the Lord is not right. Hear O house of Isreal!  Is my ways not right?  Is it not your ways that are not right?  When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and dies because of it, for his iniquity which he has commited he will die.  Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickness which he has commited and practices justices and righteousness, he will save his life.  Because he considered and turned away from all his transgression which he had commited, he shall surely live, he shall not die"  Ezekiel 18:19-26.<br><br>Regarding Sarah, it is recorded in genesis that she died and Abrahim buried her in a cave.  There is no mention of any heavenly rewards.<br><br>Quote from stupidissmart<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>".....It also teaches people about revenge, and it is shown by killing many tribes for no good reasons and some is even encouraged by G-d itself."<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The people that G-d commanded Moses to exterminate are not saints.  They practised child sacrifice.  In the eyes of G-d this is a terrible iniquity.<br><br>"Then in the forth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete"  genesis 15:16.<br><br>The practices of justices and righteousness belongs to our realms, not G-d.  It is  humans, that can make our world a living heaven or a living hell, not G-d<br>It is people that kill, robbed, raped, murder, suicide bombing etc. not G-d.  If only all humankind practised the 7 laws of humanity given by G-d.  Surely you will agree that the world will be redeemed and peace to the world.<br><br>Shalom.</div>

Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickness which he has commited and practices justices and righteousness, he will save his life. Because he considered and turned away from all his transgression which he had commited, he shall surely live, he shall not die" Ezekiel 18:19-26. </blockquote>Fair enough.

That would be a disgrace to us. 15 We will give our consent to you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males. 16 Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves.

"Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours. 22 But the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are. 23 Won't their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us give our consent to them, and they will settle among us."<br><br>24 All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.<br><br>25 Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. 26 They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. 27 The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where [d] their sister had been defiled. 28 They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields. 29 They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses. </span><br><br>Now tell me, wat does the others townmen did tat deserves their death as well as their children and women be slaves ?<br><br><blockquote>It is people that kill, robbed, raped, murder, suicide bombing etc. not G-d.
