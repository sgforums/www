In Judaism or Christianity, angels like Satan are messengers (malach) of God. ALL angels work for God. Just like not all employees are friends of their boss, the creator-created relationship doesn't mean angels or Satan is God's friend.<br><br>2. The relationship between Satan and God is BEST/MOST CLEARLY spelt out in the Book of Job.  Ask yourself, does Satan look like an enemy of God in the account?<br><br>3. The ultimate temptation and devil is .. yourself. Have you realized that?<br><br>4. Continuing from the previous point, look at the Garden of Eden account. The serpent did NOT ensnare Adam or Eve. They need not escape from the snare of the serpent. By the way, it is not explicit that the serpent is Satan.</div>

If everything is written, then it is interpretation of the bible and there is no such thing as an of oral system.
