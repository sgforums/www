            <div class='col-md body'>Wanted to post this reply in the previous thread, but sadly it closed down. I am starting a continuation from the old one so as to state my point to clear as much doubt in this shady region.<br><br>We have to face it, alot of things in this world has indeed changed and nothing is what it used to be in the past. Sexual immorality is on the rise in the secular world of today - and many have become caught up in this worrying trend.<br><br>Let me be "in your face" and first talk about sex lives of the people in the church and those outside the church... what's the difference?<br><strong>It is true that as a Christian, we should abstain ourselves from sexual immorality, yet there has always been an opposing force made by the Evil One to tempt us into it.</strong> The world out there will forever be so "attractive" and full of temptations, that is why no one said walking the walk of being a Christian is going to be that easy...<br><br><strong>I totally agree to what some pastors have said </strong>- sex lives of non-Christians happen to be better and hotter than such of Christians themselves. Okay, let me zoom into the topic a little further, what does sex actually mean? Does sex = bad, immoral, to be avoided?<br><br><strong>Sex is not bad and sex is not evil.</strong> God himself is the one who created sex, so that we as humans can multiply and grow on Earth. Since sex is actually good, then why (you may ask) is there sexual immorality? Sexual immorality happens when a person does not fully understand the idea of sex, the right intention that God has for it, and he/she does it the wrong way (they do it their way) and wind up doing immoral stuff. (that pleases the Evil One! Warning: the Evil One is here to destroy you! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )<br><br>Now the real question comes around... <strong>Why do they need to have better sex lives? What do they need it for?!</strong> For better love lives? Not true... love and sex is two different things. By the way, sexual immorality arises because of lust! So flee from it!<br><br><strong>You don't love someone because you want to have sex with him/her!</strong> Oh come on! Love in a relationship of a couple does not get better through sex! Love can only abound still more and more when God is the centre of your life and your relationship. In fact, if you really love the person, you wouldn't want to hurt him/her. I believe in loving, caring and giving unconditionally - agape love of God... that is the only tool that will keep a relationship stable. Sex is only a temporary tool used in the world to obtain pleasure and enlightenment for just a while - the fire of passion rages and gets snuffed out almost instanteneously, losing all the effects that it had earlier, getting the two parties coming back again for more next time round. The world does not know that only the holy fire of God that burns in a relationship keeps it pure, righteous and stable.<br><br>My whole point is, sex should never be used as a tool to gain love. That is why premarital sex is not endorsed in the Bible - love does not simply spring out from sex... it should not even be called "making love". <strong>God's purpose of creating us to be able to have sex is somewhat to allow us to add to our population on the Earth and fulfill God's command in Genesis: "to multiply and fill the Earth" so let's just keep it that way and not alter it for our own selfish desires and purposes.</strong> If you want to know more about what love is and how to love, look to God's love and see for yourself.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"But flee youthful lusts, and follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart." (2 Timothy 2:22)</strong></span><br><br><strong>As Christians, stay pure with God and try your best to abstain from all sins and your sinful nature. Make God the centre of your life and a part of your everyday! Flee from lust!</strong> Hope you understand my view of the matter of sex and if there is any further questions, you can just IM me... God bless you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another point that i forgot to touch on...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dumbdumb!:</div><div class="quote_body">hmm, i can't disagree to the pastor who said that its not true that non christian sex lives are better than christian sex lives.<br><br>i do have that mentality that non-christians have better sex lives than christians, who seem less adventurous and passionate. because they're more prim and proper.<br><br>its nice to be proven wrong in this area. its assuring that someone tells me that its not true.<br><br>i mean, sex is a natural thing, a gift of God, is it shameful to speak of it in the right context?<br><br>there are people who are fearful of sex, who think of it as a dirty thing, a shameful thing. i've read newspaper reports of such cases. isn't it good to be liberated from these silly fears?<br><br>but i disagree with the costumes the nuns wore and stuff la.<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Now, replying to dumbdumb's post...</strong></span><br>Look, it is dangerous to venture into unchartered territory, especially when you are lurking into the danger zones of the Evil One. We do not need to be so adventurous or burn with so much passion for our partner just to have a successful relationship and to fit one another's desires of the flesh!<br><br><strong>All we need is the love of God to exist in our relationship with our friends, families and partners - and this will assuredly provide the stability to the various relationships and add more meaning into them... making them more precious.</strong><br><br>Other than the purpose that God has made for sex, the rest of the purposes that are not of God... I think they are rather useless! They do not help contribute to better relationships, they do not convey the right message to others, a lot of problems start because of them, and insults God for utilizing sex in such a demeaning and low-down manner!<br><br>Therefore, feel your mind with good thoughts and things of good report. <strong>Let not sex be something so casual and be taken so lightly of and let not sex be something bad and totally detestable in your eyes. </strong>Renew your mind today and not be polluted with the thoughts and ideals the world has about sex...<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, in order to prove by you what is that good and pleasing and perfect will of God" (Romans 12:2)</strong></span><br><br>Do only what is pleasing in God's eyes, and not anything else.

Never mind that... that's not important...<br><br>No wonder the Bible says God's love is so much higher than human love. All the world thinks about love is sex... which is also shamelessly shallow. My idea of starting this thread is to help enlighten my fellow Christians on the true facts, on what love really is and the issue about sex.<br><br>I wanted to bring some light to this issue and also straighten out some mindsets over this issue which is shockingly wrong.<br>I was waiting for a question to pop out before I talk and discuss further into the topic, but I don't seem to be getting the response.<br><br>Infatuation and Lust are often disguised as Love, not the other way around.<br>Perversion is from the Evil One. Love is Good, and is of God, cause God is love.<br>God is pure and he loves us with an unconditional and everlasting love. No matter what circumstances or obstacles that you encounter in life, God is always there to help you and deliver you.<br><br>Well, my idea of love in a relationship should also be such: That no matter what the couple encounter in life, the good and the bad, they will pull through the situations because they have love for one another. Loving one another with the love that God has for us, unconditional and everlasting, placing God in the centre of their lives and relationship, putting God first in everything they do.<br><br>Without God, virtually almost all things Man do shall fail in the end. This explains so many divorces being made the past few years. Sex doesn't save their relationships at all! There is no love at all in some relationships I see, all I see is lust and that disgusts me. Once one of them stop being so passionate in their sex lives, the other will conclude that his/her partner no longer love him/her and will want to divorce - so silly! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>That is why, as Christians, it is important to see God in your relationship and to acknowledge God to be a part of your relationship with your partner so that you see a relationship that is everlasting, good and pure. Initially, I thought sex was needed in a relationship, but I came to a realization when I read the Bible and saw that God placed love more importantly, and sex was just a tool to reproduce more mankind on the Earth (and not for your selfish desires or to have fun!)<br><br>May God bless you and may the Holy Spirit correct the thinking of yours (if it is wrong) regarding love and sex. Let God be the Centre of your Life today!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
