                          He did address the question of God - there isn't one. One fundamental teaching of Buddhism: everything arises due to interdependent origination. Literally everything. i.e. flower depends on nutrients, water, sun, etc etc etc. Those conditions themselves dependent on everything else... there is nothing independently or inherently existing on its own - everything depends on everything else, without an ultimate origin, cause, creator.
                  
                      
                      One of the titles of Buddha is 'the self-awakened one'. It means he did not have teacher. (though he did practiced under guidance of enlightened beings even in previous lifetimes)

              i'm not trying to promote buddhism here but seeing there is so many misunderstandings of what buddhism is about or what 'enlightenment is', i have to post this and hope people will read and get a basic grasp:
              
              http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/8foldpath.htm
              
              
              
              The Eight-Fold Path is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths - the first of the Buddha's teachings. All the teachings flow from this foundation.
              
              The Four Noble Truths are
              
              1. The Noble Truth of the reality of Dukkha as part of conditioned existence. Dukkha is a multi-faceted word. Its literal meaning is "that which is difficult to bear". It can mean suffering, stress, pain, anguish, affliction or unsatisfactoriness. Each of the English words is either too strong or too weak in their meaning to be a universally successful translation. Dukkha can be gross or very subtle. From extreme physical and mental pain and torment to subtle inner conflicts and existential malaise.
              
              2. The Noble Truth that Dukkha has a causal arising. This cause is defined as grasping and clinging or aversion. On one hand it is trying to control anything and everything by grabbing onto or trying to pin them down, On the other hand it is control by pushing away or pushing down and running away or flinching away from things. It is the process of identification through which we try to make internal and external things and experiences into "me and mine" or wholly '"other" than Me. This flies in the face of the three signs of existence - Anicca, Dukkha. Anatta - Impermanence. Stress or Suffering and No-Self. Because all conditioned existence is impermanent it gives rise to Dukkha, and this means that in conditioned existence there is no unchanging and permanent Self. There is nothing to grasp onto and also in reality, nothing or no 'one' to do the grasping! We grab onto or try to push away ever changing dynamic processes. These attempts to control, limit us to little definitions of who we are.
              
              3. The Noble Truth of the end of Dukkha, which is Nirvana or Nibbana. Beyond grasping and control and conditional existence is Nirvana. "The mind like fire unbound." The realisation of Nirvana is supreme Bodhi or Awakening. It is waking up to the true nature of reality. It is waking up to our true nature. Buddha Nature. The Pali Canon of Theravada, the foundational Buddhist teachings, says little about Nirvana, using terms like the Unconditioned the Deathless, and the Unborn. Mahayana teachings speak more about the qualities of Nirvana and use terms like, True Nature, Original Mind, Infinite light and Infinite life. Beyond space and time. Nirvana defies definition.
              
              Nirvana literally means "unbound' as in "Mind like fire unbound". This beautiful image is of a flame burning by itself. Just the flame, not something burning and giving off a flame. Picture a flame burning on a wick or stick, it seems to hover around or just above the thing burning. The flame seems to be independent of the thing burning but it clings to the stick and is bound to it. This sense of the flame being unbound has often been misunderstood to mean the flame is extinguished or blown out. This is completely opposite to the meaning of the symbol. The flame "burns" and gives light but is no longer bound to any combustible material. The flame is not blown out - the clinging and the clung to is extinguished. The flame of our true nature, which is awakening, burns independently. Ultimately Nirvana is beyond conception and intellectual understanding. Full understanding only comes through direct experience of this "state' which is beyond the limitations and definitions of space and time.
              
              4. The Noble Truth of the Path that leads to Awakening. The path is a paradox. It is a conditioned thing that is said to help you to the unconditioned. Awakening is not "made" by anything: it is not a product of anything including the Buddha's teachings. Awakening, your true nature is already always present. We are just not awake to this reality. Clinging to limitation, and attempts to control the ceaseless flow of phenomena and process obscures our true nature.
              
              The path is a process to help you remove or move beyond the conditioned responses that obscure your true nature. In this sense the Path is ultimately about unlearning rather than learning - another paradox. We learn so we can unlearn and uncover. The Buddha called his teaching a Raft. To cross a turbulent river we may need to build a raft. When built, we single-mindedly and with great energy make our way across. Once across we don't need to cart the raft around with us. In other words don't cling to anything including the teachings. However, make sure you use them before you let them go. It's no use knowing everything about the raft and not getting on. The teachings are tools not dogma. The teachings are Upaya, which means skillful means or expedient method. It is fingers pointing at the moon - don't confuse the finger for the moon.
              
              The Path
              
              1. * Samma-Ditthi â€” Complete or Perfect Vision, also translated as right view or understanding. Vision of the nature of reality and the path of transformation.
              
              2. Samma-Sankappa â€” Perfected Emotion or Aspiration, also translated as right thought or attitude. Liberating emotional intelligence in your life and acting from love and compassion. An informed heart and feeling mind that are free to practice letting go. 
              
              3. Samma-Vaca â€” Perfected or whole Speech. Also called right speech. Clear, truthful, uplifting and non-harmful communication.
              
              4. Samma-Kammanta â€” Integral Action. Also called right action. An ethical foundation for life based on the principle of non-exploitation of oneself and others. The five precepts.
              
              5. Samma-Ajiva â€” Proper Livelihood. Also called right livelihood. This is a livelihood based on correct action the ethical principal of non-exploitation. The basis of an Ideal society.
              
              6. Samma-Vayama â€” Complete or Full Effort, Energy or Vitality. Also called right effort or diligence. Consciously directing our life energy to the transformative path of creative and healing action that fosters wholeness. Conscious evolution.
              
              7. Samma-Sati â€” Complete or Thorough Awareness. Also called "right mindfulness". Developing awareness, "if you hold yourself dear watch yourself well". Levels of Awareness and mindfulness - of things, oneself, feelings, thought, people and Reality. 
              
              8. Samma-Samadhi â€” Full, Integral or Holistic Samadhi. This is often translated as concentration, meditation, absorption or one-pointedness of mind. None of these translations is adequate. Samadhi literally means to be fixed, absorbed in or established at one point, thus the first level of meaning is concentration when the mind is fixed on a single object. The second level of meaning goes further and represents the establishment, not just of the mind, but also of the whole being in various levels or modes of consciousness and awareness. This is Samadhi in the sense of enlightenment or Buddhahood.
              
              * The word Samma means 'proper', 'whole', 'thorough', 'integral', 'complete', and 'perfect' - related to English 'summit' - It does not necessarily mean 'right', as opposed to 'wrong'. However it is often translated as "right" which can send a less than accurate message. For instance the opposite of 'Right Awareness' is not necessarily 'Wrong Awareness'. It may simply be incomplete. Use of the word 'right' may make for a neat or consistent list of qualities in translations. The down side is that it can give the impression that the Path is a narrow and moralistic approach to the spiritual life. I use variant interpretations so you consider the depth of meanings. What do these things mean in your life right now?

              <p><br>Every religion required some kinds of faith to believe in, including the buddhist faith.</p>
              <p>In buddhism, you believe in karma. Yet, you don't believe in the Creator God. So, with regard to karma, what 'evil' did the first animals did in their past lives to be born as the first animals instead of being born human? What good did the first 'human being' done to be born as a human being and not an animal? Who started karma, who was the law behind karma. Since there is no creator God in buddhism, who was responsible for the first karma?</p>
              <p>Secondly buddhism preached about not killing anything. And this is a good teaching. But what about in the case of an insect that can cause plague to come onto the entire human race? Should the insects be killed because of the plague, or should the 'no killing' belief of buddhism applied even in the case of a plague causing insect?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, buddhism preached about leaving the family to seek enlightenment. In this case, a person became a monk or a nun. Don't you think this defy the logic? If every man or woman choose to become a monk or a nun as a result of the buddhist faith, where will the family be? Who will help to ensure the human race continue to survive by procreation?</p>
              <p>Finally, the population of the earth's animals had reduced creatly in years due to humans' hunting of the animal population. Yet, I observed that mankind is not doing less evil, but more evil day after day. What happened to karma? Why are these evil men not being born to be animals? And if they are born as animals, why are the number of animal population reducing?</p>
              <p>I pose these questions not to attack the buddhist religion, but to show that every religion had their own loophole.</p>
              <p>I remeber that buddhists respect all religions, yet from the behaviours of many buddhists here, I do not see how buddhists respect all other religions. Why will a buddhist attack the christian faith if the buddhist really respect all religions.</p>
              <p>Do you see me going to the buddhist forums and asking all kinds of difficult questions, to make you lose faith in your buddhism? I only remember asking in the buddhist forum about what buddhist think of Jesus, and that is out of a great curiousity.</p>
              <p>To end it off, I will like to thank some of the buddhists here who do not attack the christian faith, but merely post here to clarify the concept of buddhism. It is people like you that makes religious harmony a posible experience.</p>
              <p>Finally, I will end with a quotation of the bible verse.</p>
              <p>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.</p>
              <p>Let's not boast about our own religion like as if it is the greatest, and let's not attack each other because of religious differences.</p>

              <p><br>If you refer to experiences that people encounter like people remembering all about their past lives, etc, these are instances that do shed a good light on buddhism.</p>
              <p>But Christianty also have its own range of miracles. There are many people who pray to the christian God and they get healed of their terminal illness. For one case I knowm personally of, this woman had a tube inserted by the doctor inside her body. She prayed to Jesus for healing and the tube totally disappeared. The doctor was puzzled about the tube as well.</p>
              <p>Miracles occur in every religion, not just buddhism.</p>
              <p>And about animals, isn't the population of animals declining, due to loss of natural habitats etc? Yet, we see mankind still doing many evil. If people get reincarnated for doing evil, then more animals ought to exist, because these evil people will be born in their next lives as animals.</p>
