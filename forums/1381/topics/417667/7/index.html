              It's really a simple thing that I need to carve into the hearts of

              <p>Guide and educate these buddhists well, instill in them the
              humility that you don't have and also discourage them to go to
              christian forum like this to post nonsense about christianity.</p>
              <p>It's obvious these enlightened buddhists don't know how to keep
              a leash on their unenlighten buddhists and allow them to roam
              around and create trouble in the forum of other religions like this
              christianity forum.</p>
              <p>They can ignore their underlings talking crap about the GOD of
              other religion, but they can beam themselves to come and respond to
              my topic when I talk about their indian ex-prince buddha.</p>
              <p>What logic is this? Did buddhism teach them to do all that? And
              this is not Bill Crosby show. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
