              <p>I never assumed an atheistic stance nor did i proclaim to be an atheist. As it ever occurred to you that is your projection emanating from within you?</p>
              <p>However, that is your predicament. You are free to spout all that comes to you - it is you and u are being u whatever u type here. To reject outrightly, what one knows not or lacks insight is the highest form of ignorance.</p>
              <p>By judging - u are not defining what another is (in this instance, me) or . .. but defining what you are. The same goes for and each and everyone posting here. It is only whether one accepts, pretends or simply ignores. However, it does not go away.</p>
              <p>As for being misunderstood or not at, it is fine by me. I post to evoke ''questions'' and have one arrive at one's ''conclusion'' or ''views/opinions''.</p>

              <p>You didn't understand my previous post.</p>
              <p>There is no God in Buddhism, so it is irrelevant to compare Buddha with a God in the context of Buddhism. Therefore I never compared Buddha with a Christian definition of God because we don't believe there is a creator.</p>
              <p>Buddha is higher than gods (note: i never put caps lock, the capital G) - this is true. By gods I mean beings who live in heaven, and we don't worship them.</p>
              <p>Also you misunderstood what Buddhism and enlightenment is about. It is not about mundane compassion (though we do practice it), it is about realizing the nature of reality and ending affliction and sufferings. It's not about pretending to be somebody, it is about truly seeing the truth of reality and ending suffering.</p>

              <p>Jesus was a man, Krishna was a man, Buddha was a man, Mohd was a man - after their passing away - Christianity,Hinduism, Islam came into the pix; the same can be said so for the others. For the purpose of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collective identity</span> down the years each was made into a religion. Buddha, Jesus, Krisha, Mohd - all shared experiences and it was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">existential</span> expereinces in human form.</p>
              <p>Of course, there are some who go to temples/church or ... to pray and sadly it is prayer of supplication which is tantamount to ''begging''. Prayer when it is a prayer of gratitude is healthy. The same goes for all others. The neurosis is that man created a fiction and that fiction is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">God in man''s image</span>. Hence, the exclusivity, the prejudices, the judgements, the bigotry.</p>
              <p>A fiction needs maintenance and what is true is missed cos the preoccupation with maintenance of fiction is enegry-sapping. Eg Personality needs maintenance cos it is a mask(s). Individuality (indivisible) does not need cos there are no personas. Real religion is always an individual experience and cannot be contained or shut in a box cos what is true always changes! Not to be confused with truth.</p>
              <p>The sutras, the scriptures, the texts .... add on are mere devices to bring one ''home'' inwards to one's being. How to know? Am i being nasty now? Am I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being kind</span> now? These are footprints of one's being It is a process, a continuum, that is the essence of being religious, if one call himself or herself as religious. My standing in a church or a temple does not make me religious. My being nice to strangers, animals, all people without <span style="text-decoration: underline;">selection</span> is the essence of being religious. Sadly, when one were to look around it does not feel so. Wearing ''badges'' or merely quoting texts, sutras or .. is not religion it is a ritual.Knowledge cannot pretend wisdom. Wisdom emanates from one''s being, knowledge is acquired from outside of oneself. The former frees, the latter binds. When one comes across someone who can relate to ... it reflects the quality of his Being. Being means being eg, kind, being loving, being rude, being considerate or .... .</p>

              want to give the impression that I have reached final
              enlightenment. But some fundamental truths are realized. And even
              the first stage of enlightenment is already seen as much higher
              than living the lives of gods:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <dl> <dd><strong><a title="Dhammapada" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammapada">Dhammapada</a></strong> 178:</dd> <dd><br></dd> <dd>Sole dominion over the earth,</dd> <dd>going to heaven,</dd> <dd>lordship over all worlds:</dd> <dd>the fruit of stream-entry</dd> <dd>excels them.</dd> </dl>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. as for God with a capital G, nope, Buddhists don't believe
              there is one and therefore it does not relevant to compare Buddha
              with God in the context of Buddhism. More than that, we realize
              there couldn't be a God (when we realize and become enlightened to
              the truth of interdependent origination).</p>
              <p>However, Buddha did tell us of a god (a being in a very high
              plane) who was deluded to think he created the world.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Oh man.<br><br>To everyone here, I really suggest we drop this topic entirely... It's not going to do much good for all of us. It'll just add more stress and more... well, frustration. Frustration is the foundation to losing ourselves. <br><br>As a fellow Buddhist, I agree with what An Eternal Now shared. But then again, in this modern world we have to try and put ourselves in the other party's shoes. From parn's perspective, there IS an almighty entity, who grants wishes to those whom are faithful to Him and He being the creator; He being the Father of all. From the Buddhists' point of view, we view life as a vicious cycle, with us ever reincarnating within six paths - Human, Heaven (<strong>NOT</strong> referring to the one Christians' believe in), gods (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not God</span></strong>, but gods as in like those that An Eternal Now have shared), Hungry Ghost, Animal, and Hell. In every path lies suffering, and Buddhists, we aim to break out of this vicious cycle to end our suffering and of course, along the way, vowing to help others break out of this cycle as well, <strong>even</strong> if they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believe in different things</span>.<br><br>Both sides are adamant. We choose to believe in what we believe. We <strong>cannot control </strong>or <strong>even force</strong> others to believe in what we believe in. We could, however share and engage in healthy and friendly debate, unlike anything that is seen within this topic.<br><br>One thing we <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAN</span></strong> control, is what we think of and what we choose to write here. And I suggest we all just respect what the others believe in, and go our seperate paths in life. By respecting and compromising, we can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ensure less conflicts</span> within this world. So yeah. Peace out everybody. Further debate is really unnecessary. <br></p></div>

              <p><br>I wasn't talking about buddhism but about Buddha, and this is a Christian forum.</p>
              <p>So keep an open mind and not a closed mind like everything in the world belongs to buddhism, because it's not. Buddhism is just a very selfish and arrogant religion if you all only knows how to compare your enlightenment stages and awaken your buddha-self as and when you need it.</p>
              <p>GOD can do wonders in your life, but I don't expect you to understand because you don't have any faith.</p>

              <p>Oh man.<br><br>To everyone here, I really suggest we drop this topic entirely... It's not going to do much good for all of us. It'll just add more stress and more... well, frustration. Frustration is the foundation to losing ourselves.<br><br>As a fellow Buddhist, I agree with what An Eternal Now shared. But then again, in this modern world we have to try and put ourselves in the other party's shoes. From parn's perspective, there IS an almighty entity, who grants wishes to those whom are faithful to Him and He being the creator; He being the Father of all. From the Buddhists' point of view, we view life as a vicious cycle, with us ever reincarnating within six paths - Human, Heaven (<strong>NOT</strong> referring to the one Christians' believe in), gods (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not God</span></strong>, but gods as in like those that An Eternal Now have shared), Hungry Ghost, Animal, and Hell. In every path lies suffering, and Buddhists, we aim to break out of this vicious cycle to end our suffering and of course, along the way, vowing to help others break out of this cycle as well, <strong>even</strong> if they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believe in different things</span>.<br><br>Both sides are adamant. We choose to believe in what we believe. We <strong>cannot control</strong> or <strong>even force</strong> others to believe in what we believe in. We could, however share and engage in healthy and friendly debate, unlike anything that is seen within this topic.<br><br>One thing we <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAN</span></strong> control, is what we think of and what we choose to write here. And I suggest we all just respect what the others believe in, and go our seperate paths in life. By respecting and compromising, we can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ensure less conflicts</span> within this world. So yeah. Peace out everybody. Further debate is really unnecessary.</p>

              <p><br>It's really a simple thing that I need to carve into the hearts of these christian slandering buddhists.</p>
              <p>Guide and educate these buddhists well, instill in them the humility that you don't have and also discourage them to go to christian forum like this to post nonsense about christianity.</p>
              <p>It's obvious these enlightened buddhists don't know how to keep a leash on their unenlighten buddhists and allow them to roam around and create trouble in the forum of other religions like this christianity forum.</p>
              <p>They can ignore their underlings talking crap about the GOD of other religion, but they can beam themselves to come and respond to my topic when I talk about their indian ex-prince buddha.</p>
              <p>What logic is this? Did buddhism teach them to do all that? And this is not Bill Crosby show. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
