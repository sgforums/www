              <p>Since the fact is that you're the only person who have been desperately trying to fight for your some form of intelligent recognition which you never had, I have to agree with most of the sgforumers that you have no intelligence at all, cos none of them supported your claims.</p>
              <p>Even if you log on your army of clones also not more than 50% of the forumers in sgforums. So you're not intelligent and never more intelligent than me.</p>
              <p>It's ok, I don't expect you to get what I meant because you have no intelligence at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
