              <p>Please get the facts right.</p>
              <p>We bow to Buddha out of respect.</p>
              <p><strong>We do not worship Buddha, but see him as a teacher. We ourselves have Buddha-nature and can awaken any time. Buddhist aim to become a Buddha, not just worship one.</strong></p>
              <p>Also: we don't treat Buddha like gods. We treat Buddhas as <strong>more respectable than gods,</strong> who are still unawakened beings in samasara, still trapped in the cycle of samsara without ending. Buddha was known as the<strong> 'teacher of gods and men'.</strong></p>
              <p>By the way, Buddha was not the only enlightened being - thousands of his students attained enlightenment.</p>
              <p>There continue to be lots of enlightened people today.</p>
              <p>I, for one, am awake, and would not hide this fact (some others may be more humble or shy or think that announcing enlightenment is a taboo). But there are far more others... in my forum and in other places.</p>
              <p>p.s. there are different degrees of enlightenment, and I do not want to give the impression that I have reached final enlightenment. But some fundamental truths are realized. And even the first stage of enlightenment is already seen as much higher than living the lives of gods:</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. as for God with a capital G, nope, Buddhists don't believe there is one and therefore it does not relevant to compare Buddha with God in the context of Buddhism. More than that, we realize there couldn't be a God (when we realize and become enlightened to the truth of interdependent origination).</p>
              <p>However, Buddha did tell us of a god (a being in a very high plane) who was deluded to think he created the world.</p>
              <p>From an old post of mine:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br> In Buddha's days there were many many different teachings, one
                                              popular one was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped
                                              nowadays. Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty,
                                              the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator,
                                              the Chief of All".<br> <br> In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the
                                              first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms
                                              above where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all,
                                              beyond the 8 Jhanic planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana.
                                              Nevertheless all the devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered
                                              him as the Creator God. Buddha did not subscribe to the belief of
                                              such a notion that the Universe and its Inhabitants were the
                                              Creation of the Mahabrahma. He met with the Brahma, asked him
                                              questions which he could not answer. Eventually he has taken refuge
                                              in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.<br> <br> The Buddha was also known to have said this,<em><br> <br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why does he order such misfortune<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br> And he such inequity and injustice create?<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br> Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</em><br> <br> When the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was
                                              formed, the Mahabrahma was first to be reborn. Other subsequent
                                              brahmas/devas were to be reborn.<br> <em><br> 'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to
                                              himself: " I am Brahmà, the Great Brahmà, the Supreme One, the
                                              Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the
                                              Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the
                                              Ancient of days the Father of all that are and are to be. 'These
                                              other beings are of my creation. And why is that so? A while ago I
                                              thought, 'Would that they might come!' And on my mental aspiration,
                                              behold the beings came." DN 1 2:5</em><br> <br> In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no
                                              control over the system of karma.<br> <br> The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk
                                              of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the
                                              powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He
                                              states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of
                                              transformations, he cannot actually create independent creatures,
                                              change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from
                                              growing old or dying. Brahma can use his special powers to
                                              transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he
                                              cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.<br> <br> from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm:">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm:</a><br> <em><br> When he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world who
                                              speaks of the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the
                                              human world with the intention to debate with the Buddha. The
                                              Buddha, with his ability to know another's mind, knew his intention
                                              and asked, "You claim to be the creator of the human race and all
                                              things in the universe, is this a fact?"<br> <br> The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br> <br> Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did
                                              you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br> <br> The king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life
                                              and nobody welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create
                                              death."<br> <br> Buddha asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did
                                              you create sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be
                                              ill, and he replied, "I did not create illness."<br> <br> Buddha asked many questions in succession, but the king denied that
                                              he created them. Eventually, he admitted that he did not create the
                                              universe and all things in it, and certainly not the human race.
                                              The king of heavens was full of regrets and he felt ashamed.
                                              Finally, he accepted Buddha as his teacher and invited Him to
                                              spread the Dharma in the heavens.</em><br> <br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html">http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html</a><br> <br> <em>"To those who talked about the first cause of this world, the
                                              Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first
                                              cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned
                                              by other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present
                                              may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may

              <p>As for being misunderstood or not at, it is fine by me. I post to evoke ''questions'' and have one arrive at one's ''conclusion'' or ''views/opinions''.</p>

              <p><br>Oh? So buddhist only respect buddha and don't worship buddha?</p>
              <p>Obviously you have been visiting some deserted temples......LOL! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>And how can your wishes be granted if you do not pray to buddha?</p>
              <p>You mean your silent wishes will automatically be granted without you asking for it?</p>
              <p>You're more mentally disturbed than I've imagined of you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you found a magic lamp, you still need to pray to the genie in the lamp before your wishes can be granted.</p>

              <p>Please get the facts right.</p>
              <p>We bow to Buddha out of respect.</p>
              <p><strong>We do not worship Buddha, but see him as a teacher. We ourselves have Buddha-nature and can awaken any time. Buddhist aim to become a Buddha, not just worship one.</strong></p>
              <p>Also: we don't treat Buddha like gods. We treat Buddhas as <strong>more respectable than gods,</strong> who are still unawakened beings in samasara, still trapped in the cycle of samsara without ending. Buddha was known as the <strong>'teacher of gods and men'.</strong></p>
              <p>By the way, Buddha was not the only enlightened being - thousands of his students attained enlightenment.</p>
              <p>There continue to be lots of enlightened people today.</p>
              <p>I, for one, am awake, and would not hide this fact (some others may be more humble or shy or think that announcing enlightenment is a taboo). But there are far more others... in my forum and in other places.</p>
              <p>p.s. there are different degrees of enlightenment, and I do not want to give the impression that I have reached final enlightenment. But some fundamental truths are realized. And even the first stage of enlightenment is already seen as much higher than living the lives of gods:</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. as for God with a capital G, nope, Buddhists don't believe there is one and therefore it does not relevant to compare Buddha with God in the context of Buddhism. More than that, we realize there couldn't be a God (when we realize and become enlightened to the truth of interdependent origination).</p>
              <p>However, Buddha did tell us of a god (a being in a very high plane) who was deluded to think he created the world.</p>
              <p>From an old post of mine:</p>

              <p><br>I see, so you respect buddha who isn't a god, but yet you can respect buddha in a more respectable manner than god. That's quite a story. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>So you have buddha nature and can awakened it anytime? I mean I also can awakened my buddha nature and be KIND to all of you by wearing my buddha mask. And I'm sure everyone have their own buddha mask which they can also awaken it as and when they need it.</p>
              <p>So tell me what's the point of telling me this? You sure you are proud about being able to flash out your buddha mask as and when the occasion calls for it?</p>
              <p>I don't mind if you believed that buddha is the teacher of god when you don't even realise that the god mentioned in your buddhist context is not the same GOD as the Christian GOD. I'll leave it to your enlightened mind to figure it out.</p>
              <p>Yes, you need to get your facts right. Make sure you are referring to the same GOD before you even try to quote it out of your buddhist context. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>If you do not know why Buddhists bow to Buddha, please ask and not make assumptions. Buddhists bow to Buddha out of respect and is also a reminder of His teachings. It is unlike Christianity, pray and pray and hope that all your wishes will be granted.</p>
              <p>Buddhists believe only by following Buddha's teachings, will one be relieve from sufferings and wishes will be granted. In another words, all depends on your deeds and not soley on Buddha's blessings.</p>
