              <p><br>Actually the clear fact is that you're not more intelligent than me, or anyone else in this forum.</p>
              <p>At least nobody has acknowledge if you even have any intelligence so far.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But you seems to be terribly afraid for others to see you as unintelligent, why is that so?</p>
              <p>People who are truly intelligent, don't go around telling other people that they're intelligent or more intelligent than other people.</p>
              <p>They just show it in their posts and advices in the forum...of course they should also be intelligent enough to be rational and not allow their emotional agitation to affect their thoughts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I don't think you're intelligent than anyone or even intelligent at all in real life.</p>
              <p>I would say....you're probably a loser in real life and quite snobbish that none of your friends actually like you or genuinely care for you. They probably don't want to offend you because they don't know what crazy thing you might react and they are just accomodating you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't tell me you really believed that you're intelligent than me or anyone in here?</p>
              <p>I think it's sad that you're the only person here who is desperately trying to promote yourself as an intelligent forumer....which is usually not what real intelligent forumer would have done.</p>

              <p>No wonder the indian prince want to become buddha and lie to the world that he awaken himself.</p>

              <p>S.gal83, you're so right with what you have said in this post.</p>
              <p>There is really quite a number of posts attacking christian religion in this christian forum. And most of these attackers are probably buddhist who were supposed to be promotiing peace.</p>
              <p>At least we christians are smart and sensible because we don't go into other forums to attack their religion, cos we know our topic will be closed by those closed minded buddhist moderators. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
