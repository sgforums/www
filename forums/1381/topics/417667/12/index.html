              <p>I am a christian, &amp; I do know there is only one god.</p>
              <p>Yes, some may come and tramp on your toes, but there is no need to engage in these pointless communications that to me, is not glorifying God, but instead the reverse.</p>

              <p><br> Every religion required some kinds of faith to believe in,
                              including the buddhist faith.</p>
              <p>In buddhism, you believe in karma. Yet, you don't believe in the
                              Creator God. So, with regard to karma, what 'evil' did the first
                              animals did in their past lives to be born as the first animals
                              instead of being born human? What good did the first 'human being'
                              done to be born as a human being and not an animal? Who started
                              karma, who was the law behind karma. Since there is no creator God
                              in buddhism, who was responsible for the first karma?</p>
              <p>Secondly buddhism preached about not killing anything. And this
                              is a good teaching. But what about in the case of an insect that
                              can cause plague to come onto the entire human race? Should the
                              insects be killed because of the plague, or should the 'no killing'
                              belief of buddhism applied even in the case of a plague causing
                              insect?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, buddhism preached about leaving the family to seek
                              enlightenment. In this case, a person became a monk or a nun. Don't
                              you think this defy the logic? If every man or woman choose to
                              become a monk or a nun as a result of the buddhist faith,
                              where will the family be? Who will help to ensure the human race
                              continue to survive by procreation?</p>
              <p>Finally, the population of the earth's animals had reduced
                              creatly in years due to humans' hunting of the animal population.
                              Yet, I observed that mankind is not doing less evil, but more evil
                              day after day. What happened to karma? Why are these evil men not
                              being born to be animals? And if they are born as animals, why are
                              the number of animal population reducing?</p>
              <p>I pose these questions not to attack the buddhist religion, but
                              to show that every religion had their own loophole.</p>
              <p>I remeber that buddhists respect all religions, yet from the
                              behaviours of many buddhists here, I do not see how buddhists
                              respect all other religions. Why will a buddhist attack the
                              christian faith if the buddhist really respect all religions.</p>
              <p>Do you see me going to the buddhist forums and asking all kinds
                              of difficult questions, to make you lose faith in your buddhism? I
                              only remember asking in the buddhist forum about what buddhist
                              think of Jesus, and that is out of a great curiousity.</p>
              <p>To end it off, I will like to thank some of the buddhists here
                              who do not attack the christian faith, but merely post here to
                              clarify the concept of buddhism. It is people like you that makes
                              religious harmony a posible experience.</p>
              <p>Finally, I will end with a quotation of the bible verse.</p>
              <p>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not
                              boast, it is not proud.</p>
              <p>Let's not boast about our own religion like as if it is the
                              greatest, and let's not attack each other because of religious
                              differences.</p>
              <p>God bless,</p>

              <p>On karma: there is no 'first animals' nor 'first humans'. Mindstreams have no beginning. This current universe did had a beginning, but there were previous universes. The cycle goes ad infinitum and is propelled by causes and conditions... there is no source or beginning to this process of becoming.</p>
              <p>Also, karma is simply natural cause and effect. It is not a law created by someone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On insects killing: there are many alternatives to killing insects. Posted this 5 years ago: <em>Hello, my master Ven. Shen Kai offered a solution to Ants and
                                                      Co-ckroaches (avoiding filter). He also mentioned about mosquitoes

                                                      else. To give the ants a sense of direction where to go you may put
                                                      some food nearby, and they will go and live there. But don't put
                                                      the food too far as it may be difficult for them to travel that far
                                                      distance.</em> <em><br><br> Co-ckroach - get some empty Wu3 Jia1 Pi2 Jiu3 (a type of Chinese

              <p> </p>
              <p>On renunciation - renunciation has many kinds, you can be renounced mentally but not physically, you can be renounced physically but not mentally, or you can be both.</p>
              <p>True enlightenment does require some level of 'inner renunciation' (non-attachment), but not necessarily outer renunciation.</p>
              <p>In other words, becoming a monk is <strong>not a requirement for enlightenment.</strong> There are many enlightened <strong>lay persons</strong>. But those who want to focus their lives on spiritual practice may choose to become a monk. I didn't.</p>
              <p>Also, 'if everyone becomes monk and nuns' is an impossibility, this is a scenario that can never happen. But to answer you anyway: in Buddhism, we do not advocate that everyone <strong><em>must</em></strong> become a monk or a nun to be a good Buddhist. The Buddha never expected everyone to become a monk. Buddhism has four supports or 'wheels' - Bhikkhus (monk), Bhikkshunis (nuns), layman, and laywoman.</p>
              <p>Many people think that Buddhism is only about monks and nuns... not knowing that Buddhism is highly dependent on layman and laywoman - they are the ones supporting the monks financially. Monks cannot survive without layman, and layman (buddhists) do not get their spiritual nourishment without a dedicated sangha (monastic community) spreading the teachings. They are interdependent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last question about population - this is answered by understanding that in Buddhism, there are 6 realms and not just two or three. 6 realms are made of the 3 lower realms of hell, hungry ghost and animal, and the 3 higher realms of human, asuras, and devas/celestial beings. Furthermore: according to the Buddhist worldview there are countless planets, galaxies, universes inhabited by sentient lives. Therefore do not limit your view to a very limited perspective of this planet... or even a small group of species.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand that some Buddhist(s) (rooney? not sure if there is anybody else) have been quite hard on Christianity on this forum. To this, there is nothing much I can do - but my advise for these people would be that it is more beneficial posting (in the Buddhist forum of course) and learning about Buddhism than to argue non stop against the existence of a creator. What is the point anyway? It's not like a few logical arguments can easily convince someone who follows a path by faith.</p>

              <p>But Christianty also have its own range of miracles. There are
              many people who pray to the christian God and they get healed of
              their terminal illness. For one case I knowm personally of, this
              woman had a tube inserted by the doctor inside her body. She prayed
              to Jesus for healing and the tube totally disappeared. The doctor
              was puzzled about the tube as well.</p>
              <p>Miracles occur in every religion, not just buddhism.</p>
              <p>And about animals, isn't the population of animals declining,
              due to loss of natural habitats etc? Yet, we see mankind still
              doing many evil. If people get reincarnated for doing evil, then
              more animals ought to exist, because these evil people will be born

              <p>There is really quite a number of posts attacking christian
                      religion in this christian forum. And most of these attackers are
                      probably buddhist who were supposed to be promotiing peace.</p>
              <p>At least we christians are smart and sensible because we don't
                      go into other forums to attack their religion, cos we know our
                      topic will be closed by those closed minded buddhist moderators.

              <p>The point of declaring enlightenment is not so that you can gain respect. In fact, to choose between obscurity and respect, I and Buddha would have chosen for obscurity.</p>
              <p>For example, as I stated earlier the Buddha actually wanted to stay quiet about his enlightenment until he was asked to teach what he knew. He thought it was too troublesome, and too profound for others to understand. But finally he was convinced there were those with 'little dust on their eyes' who are ready for the truth.</p>
              <p>To start teaching, he had to declare that (yes, he did many times including the first few times he actually started to teach) he had in fact attained full and un-excelled awakening. After instructing them, they too (his students) attained awakening and liberation.</p>
              <p>Had he not made such a declaration, nobody would have bothered to follow the path, because why would you walk a path if it hadn't led someone to fruition? In other words, what is the point of Buddhism at all if you can't attain enlightenment (when the whole point of Buddhism is to be enlightened and liberated)?</p>
              <p>The same goes today... yes, there had been countless enlightened people in the past. But if we do not make enlightenment a known possibility, then people may have the notion that 'oh, enlightenment is something in the past' or 'enlightenment is not possible for me' or 'enlightenment is only for the Buddha' or 'enlightenment is for some special elite spiritual beings up on the pedestal', which are pure crap.</p>
              <p>Enlightenment is<strong> very common even today</strong>. And it should be made known that this is a very real possibility, and that by following the Buddhist path, it does lead to the intended fruitions.</p>
              <p>It is definitely bullshit to think that by attaining enlightenment, you will be worshipped... firstly Buddhists don't worship anyone. Secondly, respect is pretty ordinary - I mean you give respect even to friends, etc. There's nothing that special about respect... and this is not the point at all. If I were to discuss awakening to Buddhists, the most common response that I got would be 'ah I see, another one who got it', or 'congrats', or they might ask me a few things about it if they are curious.</p>
              <p>But it's really not like if I talk about it they would start kneeling on their knees or something.</p>
              <p>Why? Because awakening is not an out-of-human kind of achievement. In fact I am still living a very ordinary life and most of my friends have no ideas of my spiritual practices and experiences, and simply treat me like a normal friend. (and I have no compulsion to discuss these things with them either)</p>
              <p>Think of it like getting a university degree.... so what if you do get a university degree and proclaim it? Nobody would be that 'surprised' would they. They may congrats you, and so on, but nothing really that 'surprising'. Why? Because when you go to a university, <strong>you are meant to graduate with a degree</strong> so it is no surprise. And likewise, <strong>when you enter Buddhism, you are meant to become enlightened (</strong>if you do practice it and most don't) so it is no surprise.</p>
              <p>Another thing is this... although awakening is not rare, there is indeed a taboo to discuss enlightenment at least in open public (this wasn't the case in Buddha's time though) probably because of the many weird misconcepts about enlightenment that it has become not so helpful to talk about these in public which could lead to further misunderstandings, division, projection, comparison, etc. (as evidently shown in this thread)</p>
              <p>Yet, I still believe this should be discussed openly in hopes that more people know that enlightenment is real in this day and age.</p>

              <h4 class="first">Episode Description:</h4>
              <p>In this episode, with Theravada teacher Daniel Ingram, he breaches 
                                  the taboo of enlightenment by discussing the enlightenment of other 
                                  teachers. Not only that but he argues for a more transparent approach to
                                   enlightenment within certain teaching circles, in hopes that 
                                  enlightenment can become more attainable. Listen and see why he thinks 
                                  this will help.</p>
