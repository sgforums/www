              <p><br>Every religion required some kinds of faith to believe in, including the buddhist faith.</p>
              <p>In buddhism, you believe in karma. Yet, you don't believe in the Creator God. So, with regard to karma, what 'evil' did the first animals did in their past lives to be born as the first animals instead of being born human? What good did the first 'human being' done to be born as a human being and not an animal? Who started karma, who was the law behind karma. Since there is no creator God in buddhism, who was responsible for the first karma?</p>
              <p>Secondly buddhism preached about not killing anything. And this is a good teaching. But what about in the case of an insect that can cause plague to come onto the entire human race? Should the insects be killed because of the plague, or should the 'no killing' belief of buddhism applied even in the case of a plague causing insect?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, buddhism preached about leaving the family to seek enlightenment. In this case, a person became a monk or a nun. Don't you think this defy the logic? If every man or woman choose to become a monk or a nun as a result of the buddhist faith, where will the family be? Who will help to ensure the human race continue to survive by procreation?</p>
              <p>Finally, the population of the earth's animals had reduced creatly in years due to humans' hunting of the animal population. Yet, I observed that mankind is not doing less evil, but more evil day after day. What happened to karma? Why are these evil men not being born to be animals? And if they are born as animals, why are the number of animal population reducing?</p>
              <p>I pose these questions not to attack the buddhist religion, but to show that every religion had their own loophole.</p>
              <p>I remeber that buddhists respect all religions, yet from the behaviours of many buddhists here, I do not see how buddhists respect all other religions. Why will a buddhist attack the christian faith if the buddhist really respect all religions.</p>
              <p>Do you see me going to the buddhist forums and asking all kinds of difficult questions, to make you lose faith in your buddhism? I only remember asking in the buddhist forum about what buddhist think of Jesus, and that is out of a great curiousity.</p>
              <p>To end it off, I will like to thank some of the buddhists here who do not attack the christian faith, but merely post here to clarify the concept of buddhism. It is people like you that makes religious harmony a posible experience.</p>
              <p>Finally, I will end with a quotation of the bible verse.</p>
              <p>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.</p>
              <p>Let's not boast about our own religion like as if it is the greatest, and let's not attack each other because of religious differences.</p>

              <p>I think you did not get the whole picture. Your Christian sister's topic is not about Buddha, the content is attacking Buddhism. Jesus said reap what you sow. Others are attacking Christianity because TS is attacking Buddhism. Remember reap what you sow. You have to correct TS first before you correct others.</p>

              <p>Just for your information, there are 6 realms. They are heavens, demi-gods,humans, animals and hell. It seems that you only know animals and humans. Buddhists aim not to be born in these 6 realms. I know the basic though I'm no expert.</p>

              <p>The fact that many buddhists and godless-trolls alike have been coming to this christian forum to persecute Christianity and Jesus, these low-life behaviour should have been dealt with zero tolerance policy in the first place.</p>
              <p>Maybe the moderators are afraid, or maybe they are really the very people who condone and encourage such behaviours based on their hatred and grievances in Christianity. Or maybe Mother Moderatress is not a Christian herself and doesn't know the importance of employing zero tolerance policy on all religious forums.</p>
              <p>Either way, such behaviour have been left unchecked for too long and people like you are already adopting an escapist mentality in here and probably in your real life.</p>

              <p>On karma: there is no 'first animals' nor 'first humans'. Mindstreams have no beginning. This current universe did had a beginning, but there were previous universes. The cycle goes ad infinitum and is propelled by causes and conditions... there is no source or beginning to this process of becoming.</p>
              <p>Also, karma is simply natural cause and effect. It is not a law created by someone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On insects killing: there are many alternatives to killing insects. Posted this 5 years ago: <em>Hello, my master Ven. Shen Kai offered a solution to Ants and Co-ckroaches (avoiding filter). He also mentioned about mosquitoes (but I can't remember well for that one). I will summarise a few points below.<br><br>Ants - put some Mei2 You2 near their home, they dislike the Mei2 You2 and will definitely move away from their home to somewhere else. To give the ants a sense of direction where to go you may put some food nearby, and they will go and live there. But don't put the food too far as it may be difficult for them to travel that far distance.</em> <em><br><br>Co-ckroach - get some empty Wu3 Jia1 Pi2 Jiu3 (a type of Chinese traditional beer?). Co-ckroaches love to have a beer and will all go inside. Then you can throw the cans into a dirty place i.e trash can and let them live in their paradise. I don't know about other beers, you all could experiment yourself.</em> <em><br><br>Mosquitoes - I can remember only he mentionwd two ways - burning that mosquito 'incense', or using some kind of electronic device that could make them sterilised and not be able to reproduce babies.</em> <em><br><br>So we do not necessarily need to kill them to get rid of the pests. Wisdom will be of good use.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On renunciation - renunciation has many kinds, you can be renounced mentally but not physically, you can be renounced physically but not mentally, or you can be both.</p>
              <p>True enlightenment does require some level of 'inner renunciation' (non-attachment), but not necessarily outer renunciation.</p>
              <p>In other words, becoming a monk is <strong>not a requirement for enlightenment.</strong> There are many enlightened <strong>lay persons</strong>. But those who want to focus their lives on spiritual practice may choose to become a monk. I didn't.</p>
              <p>Also, 'if everyone becomes monk and nuns' is an impossibility, this is a scenario that can never happen. But to answer you anyway: in Buddhism, we do not advocate that everyone <strong><em>must</em></strong> become a monk or a nun to be a good Buddhist. The Buddha never expected everyone to become a monk. Buddhism has four supports or 'wheels' - Bhikkhus (monk), Bhikkshunis (nuns), layman, and laywoman.</p>
              <p>Many people think that Buddhism is only about monks and nuns... not knowing that Buddhism is highly dependent on layman and laywoman - they are the ones supporting the monks financially. Monks cannot survive without layman, and layman (buddhists) do not get their spiritual nourishment without a dedicated sangha (monastic community) spreading the teachings. They are interdependent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last question about population - this is answered by understanding that in Buddhism, there are 6 realms and not just two or three. 6 realms are made of the 3 lower realms of hell, hungry ghost and animal, and the 3 higher realms of human, asuras, and devas/celestial beings. Furthermore: according to the Buddhist worldview there are countless planets, galaxies, universes inhabited by sentient lives. Therefore do not limit your view to a very limited perspective of this planet... or even a small group of species.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand that some Buddhist(s) (rooney? not sure if there is anybody else) have been quite hard on Christianity on this forum. To this, there is nothing much I can do - but my advise for these people would be that it is more beneficial posting (in the Buddhist forum of course) and learning about Buddhism than to argue non stop against the existence of a creator. What is the point anyway? It's not like a few logical arguments can easily convince someone who follows a path by faith.</p>
