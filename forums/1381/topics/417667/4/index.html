              <p>I think you are talking about Moses and not Noah, and are you talking about the part when Moses fail to circumcise his child? Because there is no instance in the bible when God wanted to kill Noah.</p>
              <p>God can create Jesus like the way he created Adam if he wanted to. But then Jesus will not be of the blood of mortal, or at least the blood of the sinful mortal. For Jesus to be sacrificed as the lamb of God to redeem the world, He needed to be born of the flesh of fallen mortal. Therefore, He is born of the womb of a human mortal named Mary, but He is also born of the Holy Spirit of God. In this way, Jesus can claim to be God and man at the same time. If Jesus is born in the way like Adam, he will be a toally new creation, not in the lineage of mankind, and therefore, He will not be qualified to redeem mankind as the sacrificial lamb.</p>
              <p>God favored the jews, because he made a promise to watch over the descendents of Abraham, and therefore He had to keep His promise to the jews.</p>
              <p>I had to log off now because my parents are going home. I will try to reply to your other questions as soon as I can, and that may be one week later since I do not have access to the internet.</p>

              <p>All Buddhist should love FTs, especially indian FTs.</p>
              <p>After all, they are the decendants of Buddha.</p>
              <p>Last time, if not for <strong>Tripitaka</strong> and his journey
              to India to bring back the scriptures and translate them into
              chinese, China would've become a state with no religion.</p>
              <p>People would be praying to Guan Yu and Lu Bu, but do you think
              Guan Yu and Lu Bu would pray to an Indian ah bu neh neh Buddha?</p>
              <p>Anyway people are confuse easily, when they want to join gangs
              and fight for their women, they will pray to Guan Yu and Lu Bu.
              Then after they got their women and they want to retire, they will
              pray to Buddha for peace and wisdom.</p>
              <p>But I know before they all die, they will be trying their best
              to convert into Christianity. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Why? Because they all know that Christianity is the one TRUE

              <p> </p>
              <p>No need to shave your heads, can still enjoy KFC and Bacon, no
              need to cry on TV or walk on tight rope between buildings.</p>
              <p>And most importantly, can eat REAL FOOD....not those man-made
              vegetarian meat like a hypocrite.</p>
              <p>This entire Buddhism is a farce! Can eat fake MEAT made of

              <p> </p>
              <p>Some retards don't even realised the average size of a Buddha is
              so much bigger than the average size of Jesus. And still want to
              post some internet photo dunno grab from where one.........LOL.

              <p>Truth spoken is no longer truth but hearsay and belief. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is true</span> - is an existential expereince, a herenow expereince. It is an individual expereince not a collective or nor can it be expereinced by belonging to a faith. I am not demonizing any religion but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I lament the distortion, the bigotry</span> and the assumption that knowledge is being wise, being true.</p>
              <p>I said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what is true not what is truth</span>. Truth anybody can tell u, books, teachers, friends, bible, texts, .... add on .</p>
              <p>What is true or false all depends on the individual's perception and most all the willingess despite the fears, the labels the conditionings to see what is true.</p>
              <p>It is not a monoply reserved for a few but for anyone to partake of what is .. assuming one is willing to.</p>
              <p>My expereince can never be yours and vice versa.</p>
              <p>The longing of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all human being is to be free</span>. Sadly many have confused free to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> with free <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> ...</p>

              <p>Truth spoken is no longer truth but hearsay and belief. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is true</span> - is an existential expereince, a herenow expereince. It is an individual expereince not a collective or nor can it be expereinced by belonging to a faith. I am not demonizing any religion but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I lament the distortion, the bigotry</span> and the assumption that knowledge is being wise, being true.</p>
              <p>I said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what is true not what is truth</span>. Truth anybody can tell u, books, teachers, friends, bible, texts, .... add on .</p>
              <p>What is true or false all depends on the individual's perception and most all the willingess despite the fears, the labels the conditionings to see what is true.</p>
              <p>It is not a monoply reserved for a few but for anyone to partake of what is .. assuming one is willing to.</p>
              <p>My expereince can never be yours and vice versa.</p>
              <p>The longing of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all human being is to be free</span>. Sadly many have confused free to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> with free <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> ...</p>

              <p>Books, teachers, friends, texts can only share so much to guide you to build up the faith to discover the truth for yourself.</p>

              <p>Haha actually I wouldn't know what would've have happened if I was a free-thinker. I mean Christians, I have to admit, they can be VERY persuasive if they want to. But I was born a Buddhist so yeah. I have to say it's one of the few things that I'm glad about in my life.<br><br>And that's not cool man. The last part. Haha. But I have to say though, there are more and more young people who're getting Westernized. TOO Westernized, in fact. We must all love our country. Hurr hurr hurr.</p>
