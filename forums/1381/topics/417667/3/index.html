              <p>The irony is this lah - when one chooses to be a Hindu, when one chooses to be a Christian or ...(add on) one is already <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excluding</span> others, in other words one is innately a ''racist'' When I am conscious of my race - i m bound to be a racist.  Another eg, if i compare myself to .... by habit i would compare the next person or another.</p>
              <p>Beware the bigotry and the prejudices and blind faith. This is neurosis but latent.</p>
              <p>If God as perceived/projection by man - he/she/it must be a judgemental, utterly divided and utterly bigoted.</p>
              <p>So I would surmise this - it is a conspiracy of the preists (aka mediums,pastors, imams or .. ) that they want to hold on to power, organized religion is politicized but so very subtle that it takes a discerning and wise and most of all intelligence to see thru the bluff.</p>
              <p>Does the rain choose whom to rain on or where to rain?  Does it discriminate? Does it judge who is deserving t o partake of its presence? Does one go to a blood bank and ask for Chinese blood or Indian blood or Malay ...? One is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never born</span> a chinese, an indian, a malay or  ---- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one is conditioned to be ... one is brought up to be</span> .... hope some can see thru the folly.</p>
              <p>Sad indeed that the neurosis of some is so pervasive and percolates one's daily living. It takes lots of courage to go beyond beliefs n scriptures to know what the real essence of religion is all about. And many dont question, cos by questioning one is doubting oneself - one's weakensses, one's doubts, one's fears may manifest. So the easy way out is to cling or latch on to any ... that reinforces one sense of what one assumes or thinks one is. It is beggary and an insult to one's uniqueness (not to be confused with special) and being.</p>

              <p><br>Enlightened doesn't makes buddha a god, he's still a human and still an indian prince by birth.</p>
              <p>So why do people worship buddha like a god when he's only a human?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's a concern because if many people worship buddha because he's only an enlightened human, that means buddha is just a false idol created by humans.....and overly-exaggerated.</p>

              <p>I see, Christians are racists. I will pray to whoever who can save my soul regardless of race. I will also let anybody to save my life regardless of race. Next time, when you are in the hospital, ask the hospital not to let indian doctors save your life. Buddha was from North India. Many of the Miss Universe are also from North India. Indians are beautiful people.</p>

              <p>I am a christian, and I think buddha is a man who wanted to do some good to the world, but he is misguided in the sense that he chose to do good by his own merits instead of trusting in the creator God of the universe.</p>
