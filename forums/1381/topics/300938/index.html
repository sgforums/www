            <div class='col-md body'>The thing about biblical prophecy is that most of them have no time limit so they are really quite meaningless. Without a time limit, you can always say that "well it just hasn't happened yet."<br><br>So we have to look for prophecies which state specific times or are related to specific events.<br><br>For example, Isaiah prophesied that the child would be called Emmanuel. However, he was called Jesus. Matthew 1:23 was almost definitely inserted just to try to explain this.<br><br>Zechariah 9:8 claims that Israel will never be oppressed again. Or maybe this should be filed under "god changes his mind" again.<br><br>What about Isaiah 52:1 are you sure there are no uncircumcised and "unclean" people in Jerusalem?<br><br>In Genesis, God tells Adam that "in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." I guess I have a different definition of "in the day" than god.<br><br>There are many more examples but I guess no point flogging a dead horse.</div>
