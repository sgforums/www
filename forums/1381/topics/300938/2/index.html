I guess I have a different definition of "in the day" than god.<br><br>There are many more examples but I guess no point flogging a dead horse.</div></blockquote>All prophecy from real God's prophet would come to pass no matter what.

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay. Maybe saying it was flogging a dead horse was a bit harsh. :p  I apologize for that.<br><br>Well I guess the point I was trying to make is that it really depends on what you consider to be prophetic fulfillment.<br><br>If you are willing to stretch it far enough, I guess you can claim that pretty much anything fulfills prophecy.<br><br>About Jesus being called Emmanuel, I believe that most people understood Emmanuel in the prophecy to be a proper name, not the title "God with us". And I think we have to recognize a difference here. Jesus' name is Jesus. We call him Emmanuel because we have decided he's the Messiah and the prophecy foretold his name would be Emmanuel. He was almost certainly not called Emmanuel in those days.<br><br>I don't really have a response to the one about Jesus being resurrected in three days except that we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. That's a fundamental tenant of Christianity and I'll have to give you that one. Obviously, I don't believe that really happened and the New Testament writers were trying to convince their readers that the resurrection really happened. Note how the story becomes more elaborate over time. (Mark -&gt; Matthew -&gt; Luke -&gt; John).<br><br>What about Jesus' promise that he would return during the lifetime of the people around him?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I may be able to convince Andrew that I'm a prophet (or the devil if he'd stay with me long enough <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) even though actually i'm NOT. I don't carry the message of God(nor am I the bastardly antichrist of course nor a false prophet).<br><br>But I might be able to say convincing things(more overt than Jesus) that proves I  could tell the future. Even do more sometimes...<br><br>I'm not even the Messiah nor I am convinced I would go to heaven. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The point is....even proof that Mr Andrew insisted doesn't mean a thing,<br><br>Again faith is a privilege given by God to whoever He chose to give.</div>
