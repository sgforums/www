              A Catholic friend some time ago told me that another Christian(a Protestant) argued with Him about having the image of Christ on the cross in the Catholic churches. This Christian friend argued that Christ to the Catholics is always seen as dead since they put the image of Christ on their cross in the their churches.
                                
              To this story I asked my Catholic friend that would there be church in heaven.
              His answer came swift. Yes he told me there would definitely be church in heaven.
              Then I asked him: Do you think there would be a cross or any cross inside that church in heaven?
                                
              To this he hesitated for some moment. Obviously I got him to think and think he did. His answer came a while later. He said NO. There would not be a cross inside the church in heaven.
                                
              Bingo. My friend is wise enough to tell that there would not be a need for any cross to be present in the church in heaven. Simply due to the fact that God is present in that church in heaven.
                                
              So I asked him if there would not be any cross in the church in heaven why bother arguing about the image of Christ on the cross in this world.
                                
              He replied back I never thought about that. That was good.
              
              To this I gave him a smile.                  
                                
              Cheers.

              <p>The Church Triumphant in heaven has won the race of life while we the Church Militant are still struggling here on earth. To aid us in our struggle we need the image of Christ to push us on. So what if the crucifix reminds us that Christ has died for us? Why has that become a bad thing?</p>

              <p>Yes of course, I think you mistook my posting I have nothing against having cross in the church be it with the image of Christ or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I don't get is having people arguing about this cross is better than that cross or this cross is wrong and that cross is right. I don't see the value of that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's like arguing whether French is better than Portugese when both are migrating to China. Something like that.</p>
