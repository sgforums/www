So dont put words into my mouth. Neither did I argued for meditation as a fact.<br><br>Your post is the third example in this topic of Christians pointing out the faulty practices of other Christians.<br><br>And I didnt say everyone here wanna ban meditation and other heretic practices. But extremism has its beginning too, so my points are - continual pointing out of heretic practices, differences between denominations, condemnation of other religions are just catalysts for extremism. This effect will not be immediate, neither would people realise till its too late. At its early stage, most people do not believe they are extremists. If you believe the Catholic Inquisitions are wrong, step out of the shell and see yourself and your doings.<br><br>Besides, this is Singapore. While I never deny evangelism exist in every religion, force the issue, you will get clashes and rebuttals. This, sadly, is the reality here.<br><br>Seriously, infighting among churches really dont affect us much. For non believers, we can only shake our heads.<br><br>In fact, pointing out some thing which is wrong is the same as condemning it.<br></div></blockquote>I still do not get your point. You already have a perceived idea that the guys from that website are Christians...and that we are pointing out their faulty practices. If they are 'Christians' as what you said, do they need to chant that word or sentence to get closer to GOD? Obviously they do not as it is not biblical. Even your frens in CHC and The Rock do not chant "BANANARAMA" to get closer to GOD. You yourself used the word 'faulty' practices.<br><br>What Neon did here was to show Christians the dangers of a distorted Christianity, not what u said as attacking fellow Christians.<br><br>Read for yourself what you typed about meditation before u said i put words into your mouth.<br><br>If the in-fighting dun affect you much, then no point of you saying anything abt it. I still maintain that not all Christians will condemn you even if you are not a believer. It is really ur pasar. But if you are unsure of the reasons for the differences between the churches, it is not fair for u to comment on it.</div>

One way is through meditation practices.<br><br>I, however, am a Buddhist, and do not share the same idea as the Hindus or the Indians.<br><br>I do, however, agree on many of Jesus's teachings and especially gospels like the Gospel of Thomas and a few others.<br><br><a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas.html</a><br><br>I know lots of you may express doubts on this gospel, but I think it is authentic, just that the christians don't seem to be able to accept it. There's no purpose of someone else to create a gospel of such wisdom, since not many religions share the same concept during early christian times in judaist countries.<br><br>anyway, just expressing my own opinion.</div>
