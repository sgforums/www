              <p>you should check becoz if really 2.5% then you Christians have been overpaying for millenia liao............should ask for refund................then get 75% discount from now on.............</p>
              <p>don't forget to calculate compound interest lost too as that 7.5% extra in the bank over the years when compounded can really add up............also must calculate inflation rate over the years too.....</p>
              <p>cannot let these conniving, money-grubbing pedophiles-in-robes get away with it...............maybe not all are pedophiles but they're certainly parasites.............</p>
              <p>maybe when City Harvest Church wants to buy more properties, the Pastor Dong Kee might increase the monthly fee............10% + 7% GST + Church Admin fee...............so must ask for refund ah...............discount too........</p>
