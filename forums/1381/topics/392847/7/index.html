              <p>members of church have to donate his/her monthy income of 10% to the tithes. that is a hell of a lot if you have members exceeding 10,000 or more.</p>
              <p>the question to ask is this. is it worthwhile to donate your 10% income to building land and expanding the church etc etc. in some cases, the church go buy Reits to invest its pile of cash sitting in banks as a result of accumulation of tithes from devotees. how about you channeling just 0.5% of your monthly income to charitable causes instead?</p>

              <p>It is a no no for CHC to get a stake for Suntec.  Think about it.  It will create dis-harmony in Singapore and riots if worse come.  Hope the Govt will not be silly to approve this.</p>
              <p>But saying no to CHC does not solve the issue.  Churches and temples have a lot of money.  If you dont allow CHC to pour in their funds to Suntec, they might well channel out their funds to oversea to build missionary centres / etc..  This is a great loss of fund to Singapore Govt, if you look at this.</p>
              <p>Instead allow Bank on behalf of church and temple to do investment for greater returns, provided the church and the temple suscribe to some scheme, that they will pay a "Charity Tax" of their investments to non-religious charity organisation like kidney foundation, etc.  So Bank will be the party to do the investment and be responsible to monitor un-usual cash flow.</p>
              <p>The result is religious organisation got more money, good money back to society to help the less fortunate, no dis-harmony becos certain relgion dominate, and woot .. more jobs created in bank industry.., and govt no need to worry becos bank at stake to monitor the accounts are clean.</p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>City Harvest Church continues to come under fire from skeptical Singaporeans three weeks after it announced that it has bought a $310 million stake in Suntec to be used for its worship services.</p>
              <p>Since then, more than a dozen of letters have been published in the Straits Times Forum questioning if City Harvest Church should still be considered as a charity and if the returns from its property investments should be exempted from tax.</p>
              <p>Two letters are published today in the Forum on the matter alone.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan Saw Bin who is an auditor of several charitable groups wonder if “significant involvement in commercial activities by mega churches, through investments in properties, still qualify the churches as charities under the Charities Act and their Constitutions.”</p>
              <p>She urged the authorities including the Registrar of Societies and Commissioner of Charities to “look into statutory compliance and evaluate if such religious groups still qualify as charities.”</p>
              <p><em>“New Creation Church and City Harvest Church are registered as charities but not Institutions of a Public Character. This means that donations to these churches are not tax exempt, so donors do not enjoy tax deductions of 2.5 times. Nevertheless, I am impressed by the ability of these churches to obtain significant donation income, which is a feat few organisations can match,”</em> she added.</p>
              <p>Another Singaporean Harvey Neo pointed out the blurring of lines between a religious group and its associated business entity in reality:</p>
              <p><em>“For example, the initial start-up funds for the business entity could come entirely from the church. Tax-exempt funds from the church might also be diverted to the business entity in indirect ways.”</em></p>
              <p>He stressed that the problems arises when “the associated businesses of a religious group balloon to such an extent that one starts to forget the raison d’etre of religion and begins to wonder where the profits of such businesses go to.”</p>
              <p>City Harvest Church was founded by its Senior Pastor Kong Hee in 1989 as a small Bible study group of 20 and has since ballooned to a mega Church with more than 33,000 members.</p>
