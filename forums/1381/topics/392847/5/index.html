              Personally, i have no qualms about anyone or any organisation opening a 'mega' church. the most important in a church is that it preaches the right teaching following the Word, and obeying God's commands and instructions, and not for their own purposes. 
                  although 310 million dollars is a little over the top, if it's all spent well so that more members can come and be saved, i'm absolutely fine with that. but if u put an investment here, put an investment there, then its not like a church anymore, more of a business where the main purpose is to earn money. Obviously, that is wrong! 
                  
                  Matthew:6 - 24
                  
                  24"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.
                  
              Matthew 19:24: "And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."* 
              
              *the rich man in this verse does not refer to generally rich people, but to the people who love money more than God*
              
                  I honestly feel very sad that there are so many churches diverting away from the true meaning and purpose of christianity, to lead a Christ centered life, and serve him as Master and Lord. I pray and hope that free thinkers and sceptics in Sgforums won't think that all churches in Singapore are like CHC, as this may divert you all from true Christianity. But i guess that God has a purpose for everyone, and we just have to follow his lead. [:
