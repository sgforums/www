               the arguement
                                      itself.</em></p>

               you know who you are.
                                      You try to make it seem as if you are being 
              wronged or bullied,
                                      when your words and questions are more aimed to 
              provoke more than
                                      anything. It's even worse when you know you can 
              phrase things
                                      differently, yet you phrase it deliberately to 
              provoke, to anger,
                                      to incite ill-feeling. Yet you go about 
              accussing others of being
                                      trolls. The irony and hypocrysy of it all.</em></p>
              <p><em>Theological debate here is moot in any

              state of belief or
                                      non-belief. In any case, so often the debate 
              goes haywire because
                                      of people who are all about the arguement and

              <p>I think it's very obvious I do not have a problem with non-Christians in itself.</p>
              <p>Also, I don't think what you are going through now can hardly be called persecution. I think it's not fair to those other people who are really getting persecuted. And I am not referring to just members of a particular faith or non-faith.</p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>City Harvest Church, which has come under intense public scrutiny lately over its purchase of a stake in Suntec, has come under pressure again, this time from its fellow investors.</p>
              <p>Speaking during its weekend Easter services, CHC’s founder and Senior Pastor Kong Hee revealed that the church has received a lawyer’s letter from “investors in the consortium holding a majority stake in Suntec Singapore, reminding it to keep to a non-disclosure agreement in the deal,” the Straits Times reported.</p>
              <p>He added that some investors did not appear pleased that information has been divulged to church members about the deal and it was in “breach” of its obligation of confidentiality.</p>
              <p>CHC announced last month that it has purchased a $310 million stake in Suntec Singapore and that it would use two floors in Suntec to house a 12,000-seat auditorium for worship services and that it would be used exclusively for its services, except for about five times a year to allow for international conferences or events to be held there.</p>
              <p>The announcement prompted queries from some Singaporeans with a flurry of letters to the Straits Times Forum questioning if CHC still deserves its tax-exempt status and if religious organizations should be involved in mega business deals like such.</p>
              <p>It has also been questioned by the Commissioner of Charities though the findings have not been made public yet.</p>
              <p>There were rumors in cyberspace that CHC was concealing some “embarrassing” facts from its members with some of them expressing displeasure at the lack of transparency in which the donors’ funds are being utilized.</p>
              <p>When asked about the allegations, Pastor Kong said they were “furthest from the truth” and that CHC “had disclosed ‘all material details’ to the Commissioner of Charities and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.”</p>
              <p>Despite using the law as a reason to impose a gag order on CHC’s purchase in Suntec, tongues are likely to continue wagging for some time to come.</p>

              <p>City Harvest Church responds to questions over non—disclosure of Suntec deal</p>
              <p>Channel NewsAsia - <abbr class="timedate" title="Monday, April  5">Monday, April 5</abbr></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : City Harvest Church has sought to clear the air surrounding the confidentiality of its deal to co—own Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre.</p>
              <p>In a two—page notice to its members on Sunday, it explained that it had signed a non—disclosure agreement.</p>
              <p>This makes the megachurch a party to the Shareholders Agreement.</p>
              <p>It has to keep confidential all matters and details relating to the Suntec transaction, including the share price and the percentage of shares acquired.</p>
              <p>However, the church was entitled to, and did, disclose details of the transaction to the relevant authorities, namely the Commissioner of Charities and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.</p>
              <p>The notice added that when the church tried to give its members some information about the transaction, other shareholders felt that doing so would be a breach of the church’s obligation of confidentiality.</p>
              <p>On April 1, the Board of City Harvest Church received a letter from solicitors acting for various other shareholders, reminding the church of its obligations of confidentiality and the need to adhere to them.</p>
              <p>The church has since engaged law firm Drew and Napier to review the situation and was advised that further disclosures may be regarded as an "Event of Default".</p>
              <p>And there is a possibility that the church will be obliged to sell its shares to the non—defaulting shareholders at a substantial discount.</p>
              <p>The church also said there is a "strong and unfounded allegation" floating online that the Management Board and Reverend Kong Hee are "deliberately concealing a number of embarrassing facts from its members".</p>
              <p>It said the allegation is "furthest from the truth".</p>
              <p>Turning to the sum of S$310 million which has been at the centre of much debate, the church explained that the money was spent on eight expenditure items, including the shares bought, renovation costs, and committed rentals.</p>
              <p>The church noted that its only continuing financial liability will be the committed rental costs for the use of Suntec Convention Centre.</p>
              <p>In the event of non—payment, creditors have a cause of action against the assets of the church, but members are not personally liable. — CNA/ms</p>

              <p>so, if your children's ambition is  to become religious leader, you should be happy because they are thinking big.</p>
              <p>by the way, some monks are able to eat meat, it depends on which school they are following. thus, find out before you criticise.</p>

              <p>you should check becoz if really 2.5% then you Christians have been overpaying for millenia liao............should ask for refund................then get 75% discount from now on.............</p>
