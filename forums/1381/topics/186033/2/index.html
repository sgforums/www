            <div class='col-md body'>ICHO,<br><br>First and foremost lets get one thing straight. GOD is GOD. He does not or ever will need your permission to do anything. If there is suffering out there, it only serves to amplify the Godless society that we live in today. The suffering out there is caused by man not GOD. We all have free choice and we are all accountable for our actions, also the bible says that the Lord will visit the sin of the fathers to the fourth generation... while we are not responsible for what our ancestors have done, the effects of what they have done will be felt. God does say many times in the bible that the penalty for sin is death and suffering. What part of that did you not understand? We live in a sinful society, so therefore, we will see the punishment for sin. God is not just a God of love, but of justice and righteousness. He cannot stand sin, that is why Yahshua had to die for us, so that when God saw us, He saw the righteousness of Yahshua Hamashia!<br><br>What makes you more special than so many people who have gone before you? You most certainly do not have the market on suffering. Whilst GOD does love you, may be He is allowing you to go through trial and tribulation to teach and train you. GOD is not so much concerned with our tranquility than our STABILITY in Him. Sometimes GOD will permit in His wisdom what He could have prevented in His power.<br><br>Look at Job, can you honestly say that you have gone through more than Him? God allowed Job to go through all that just because hasatan asked. Have you lost all your family in one go? All your material wealth? All your friends? Even his body was covered in boils and sores.. of the worst kind! Yet even though his wife said to him, curse God and die, Job did not. All he said was "the LORD giveth and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the LORD." And Job also went on to say in chapter 13, "though He slay me, yet I will still praise HIM." Now here is a man of faith in God.<br><br>There was recently a story of a man who was rendered a quadraplegic because of an incurable disease to his limbs, they had to amputate all of his limbs to save his life, yet he fought on, he now has learnt to walk with artificial legs and he uses artificial limbs to help him do things. I would say this guy had it pretty hard don't you?<br><br>The bible also tells us, God works for the good of those who love Him, but it is HIS way and not our way. I think you just have to BE STILL AND KNOW THAT YAHWEH IS YAHWEH!<br><br></div>

Were you there when He determined its measurements? Of when God made the seas, the clouds and the skies? Have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place? Have you comprehended the breath of the earth or searched its depts? have the gates of death been revealed to you? Were you there when God set the stars in their courses, when He directs the path of a lightning bolt or sends the rains upon the earth? Can you control all of this? Does the Hawk fly by your wisdom? or the Eagle by your command?<br><br>In chapter 40 of the book of Job,<br>God said this to Job:<br><br>"Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him? He who rebukes God, let him answer it"<br><br>God also said to Job:<br><br>"Would you annul my judgment? Would you condemn Me that you may be justified? Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His? Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, And array yourself with glory and beauty. Disperse the rage of your warth; Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him. Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low; Tread down the wicked in their place. Hide them in the dust together, Bind their faces in hidden drakness. Then I will also confess to you That your own right hand can save you."<br><br>In the end, all Job had to say was that "I know You can do everything, and no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You... Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know....I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, But now my eye sees You. Therefore I abhor myself, And repent in dust and ashes."<br><br>This is what God had to say of Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar:<br><br>"My wrath is aroused against your and your two friends for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.... My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according to you folly; because you have not speken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has."<br><br>Becareful what you say about God lest his wrath is aroused against you. Humble yourself before the ALMIGHTY God and be meek in His presence!<br></div>
