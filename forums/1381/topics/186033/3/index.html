            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">ICHO,<br><br>First and foremost lets get one thing straight. GOD is GOD. He does not or ever will need your permission to do anything. If there is suffering out there, it only serves to amplify the Godless society that we live in today. The suffering out there is caused by man not GOD. We all have free choice and we are all accountable for our actions, also the bible says that the Lord will visit the sin of the fathers to the fourth generation... while we are not responsible for what our ancestors have done, the effects of what they have done will be felt. God does say many times in the bible that the penalty for sin is death and suffering. What part of that did you not understand? We live in a sinful society, so therefore, we will see the punishment for sin. God is not just a God of love, but of justice and righteousness. He cannot stand sin, that is why Yahshua had to die for us, so that when God saw us, He saw the righteousness of Yahshua Hamashia!<br><br>What makes you more special than so many people who have gone before you? You most certainly do not have the market on suffering. Whilst GOD does love you, may be He is allowing you to go through trial and tribulation to teach and train you. GOD is not so much concerned with our tranquility than our STABILITY in Him. Sometimes GOD will permit in His wisdom what He could have prevented in His power.<br><br>Look at Job, can you honestly say that you have gone through more than Him? God allowed Job to go through all that just because hasatan asked. Have you lost all your family in one go? All your material wealth? All your friends? Even his body was covered in boils and sores.. of the worst kind! Yet even though his wife said to him, curse God and die, Job did not. All he said was "the LORD giveth and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the LORD." And Job also went on to say in chapter 13, "though He slay me, yet I will still praise HIM." Now here is a man of faith in God.<br><br>There was recently a story of a man who was rendered a quadraplegic because of an incurable disease to his limbs, they had to amputate all of his limbs to save his life, yet he fought on, he now has learnt to walk with artificial legs and he uses artificial limbs to help him do things. I would say this guy had it pretty hard don't you?<br><br>The bible also tells us, God works for the good of those who love Him, but it is HIS way and not our way. I think you just have to BE STILL AND KNOW THAT YAHWEH IS YAHWEH!<br><br></div></blockquote>SO WHAT IF GOD IS GOD? IT ONLY GOES TO SHOW HOW TYRANNICAL HE IS! YES, HE CAN DO ANYTHING INCLUDING KILLING THE GODLESS BUT WHY ISNT HE DOING IT? WHY SOME PEOPLE GET A BETTER DEAL &amp; SOME DONT? WHY SO UNFAIR &amp; UNJUST? YOU SAY HE PUNISHES SIN BUT I SEE GREATER SINNERS THAN ME LIVING TO 80 Y.O HAPPILIY &amp; RICH. WHY GOD SO BIASED CHOOSING TO PUNISH ONLY SOME UNLUCKY ONES &amp; NOT ALL SINNERS?! IN FACT GODLESS PEOPLE ARE LIVING BETTER THAN GOD LOVING PEOPLE!<br><br>YOU YOURSELF MENTIONED JOB. DO U KNOW JOB'S FRIENDS USED SIN TO HIT HIM &amp; HOW GOD REBUKED THOSE FRIENDS INSTEAD OF JOB? SOME SUFFERINGS ARE NOT CAUSED BY SIN. MAY GOD NOT REBUKE YOU!<br><br>OF COURSE I DONT HAVE THE MARKET ON SUFFERING BUT DO YOU HAVE THE MARKET ON GOD? YOU DONT ALSO! DO YOU REPRESENT GOD? YOU DONT.<br><br>I FIND IT POINTLESS FOR THE MAN TO BECOME QUADRIPLEGIC. HE COULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER MAN WITH GOOD LIMBS. THIS GUY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT. HOW DO YOU KNOW I AM NOT FIGHTING? HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I DONT HAVE A GREAT SUFFERING ALSO? HOW CAN YOU COMPARE SUFFERING? DOES LOSING 4 LIMBS = GREATER SUFFERING?</div>

He who rebukes God, let him answer it"<br><br>God also said to Job:<br><br>"Would you annul my judgment? Would you condemn Me that you may be justified? Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His? Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, And array yourself with glory and beauty. Disperse the rage of your warth; Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him. Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low; Tread down the wicked in their place. Hide them in the dust together, Bind their faces in hidden drakness. Then I will also confess to you That your own right hand can save you."<br><br>In the end, all Job had to say was that "I know You can do everything, and no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You... Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know....I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, But now my eye sees You. Therefore I abhor myself, And repent in dust and ashes."<br><br>This is what God had to say of Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar:<br><br>"My wrath is aroused against your and your two friends for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.... My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according to you folly; because you have not speken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has."<br><br>Becareful what you say about God lest his wrath is aroused against you.

You just have no clue about God.<br><br>2. How and who and why God chooses to deal with you is between you and Him. There may be greater sinners than you out there, but then when we look, we can always find someone worse off than we are in terms of sin. The important point here is God is dealing with you NOW. He may or may not deal with the other "sinners", but He is dealing with you. Whether you let Him or not, is up to you.<br><br>3. It may seem that the Godless people have it better, but we as believers have a far better hope. Not that I say that I have a bad life, I have a blessed life which includes all the trials that I have had to go through. I think you have to learn to be content where you are in life, like the apostle Paul who said that he has learned to be content whether he abounds or is abaised. Sure the godless prosper, but you know what? In Proverbs 13, it says, "but the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous."<br><br>4. Yes some suffering is not caused by sin, but by our own stupid mistakes and arrogance!<br><br>5. You miss the point about the quadraplegic, the moral of the story is not about him losing his limbs, it is about HIS ATTITUDE TO LIFE! Currently, yours sucks. You are one of those chicken littles that run around all day and say the sky is falling... the point is many of us go through trials and suffering, none of us are exempt. How you treat each trial and suffering determines whether you move on in life and grow stronger or you get stuck going round the same mountain again and again because you refuse to learn the lesson that God wants to teach you. Stop being so me focused and go help someone else, this may give you a differnt focus.</div>

EVERYTHING has a unique meaning to each person. love, freedom, god, table, tv, car, be it the tangible or the intangible, everyone ascribes different meanings to everything. even with something as simple as a pen, a person who receives it on his/her birthday would perceive it differently from a person who buys it. what is inconsistent here is OUR perception of god. it is not god who is inconsistent.<br><br>i said different people believe in different gods; i didn't say there are different gods. more inclined towards the teachings of christianity myself (though still an atheist), i believe that there is only ONE god, and that all other so-called gods are made up by humans. however, to a buddhist or a hindu, they believe that there are more than one god. which is right? there is no definite right or wrong. to a christian, their one and only god is real. to a buddist/other religions, their gods are the real ones. to an atheist, both are right or wrong.<br><br>of course, you can be skeptical and say there is no god. who can't be skeptical? but skepticism can bring u no where in an academical inquiry. u can deny this, that, everything. u are not wrong. but where does skepticism lead us to?<br><br>nowhere.</div>
