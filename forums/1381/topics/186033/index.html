EVERYTHING CANNOT EXPLAIN EITHER TRUST GOD OR BLAME GOD. WHAT ELSE CAN ONE DO?<br><br>WHEN SOME THINGS ARE BEYOND MY CONTROL, SOME PAIN WHICH ALWAYS BUG ME, HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT I CANNOT SOLVE ETC ETC, WHERE TO TURN BUT GOD? WHO TO BLAME BUT GOD? PEOPLE LIVE IN DELUSION BCOS THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO TURN ANYWAY SO THEY BELIEVE IN CHRIST OR GOD.<br><br>I DONT SEE THE MANY GOOD COMING OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE DYING IN AFRICA &amp; ELSEWHERE. I DONT SEE THE MANY GOOD COMING FROM THE NEEDLESS SUFFERING OF THE POOR OTHER THAN TO SATISFY THE EGO OF THE RICH BY ALLOWING THEM TO DONATE &amp; HEREBYE "CLEANSE" THEIR CONSCIENCE. I DONT SEE THE MANY GOOD THINGS COMING OUT OF UNFAIRNESS &amp; INJUSTICE. I DONT SEE THE MANY GOOD COMING OUT OF OPPRESSIVE GOVTS &amp; REGIMES. PEOPLE JUST TRY TO EASE THEIR SUFFERING BY BELIEVING IN A GOD OR CHRIST WHICH ALLOW THEM TO LIVE EASIER UNDER THESE TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES, THINKING THAT THERE IS AN ETERNAL LIFE SOMEWHERE IN HEAVEN WHERE THEY WILL ENJOY LATER SINCE THEY CAN'T ENJOY THEIR LIVES NOW. THIS GIVES THEM HOPE BUT THIS DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE WHAT IS BOTHERING THEM OR TORTURING THEM. THEY JUST LOOK FWD TO THE TIME WHEN THEY DIE TO BE FREE IN HEAVEN. HOW PITIFUL &amp; USELESS &amp; SAD!</div>
