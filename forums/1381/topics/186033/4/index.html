You just have no clue about God.<br><br>2. How and who and why God chooses to deal with you is between you and Him. There may be greater sinners than you out there, but then when we look, we can always find someone worse off than we are in terms of sin. The important point here is God is dealing with you NOW. He may or may not deal with the other "sinners", but He is dealing with you. Whether you let Him or not, is up to you.<br><br>3. It may seem that the Godless people have it better, but we as believers have a far better hope. Not that I say that I have a bad life, I have a blessed life which includes all the trials that I have had to go through. I think you have to learn to be content where you are in life, like the apostle Paul who said that he has learned to be content whether he abounds or is abaised. Sure the godless prosper, but you know what? In Proverbs 13, it says, "but the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous."<br><br>4. Yes some suffering is not caused by sin, but by our own stupid mistakes and arrogance!<br><br>5. You miss the point about the quadraplegic, the moral of the story is not about him losing his limbs, it is about HIS ATTITUDE TO LIFE! Currently, yours sucks. You are one of those chicken littles that run around all day and say the sky is falling... the point is many of us go through trials and suffering, none of us are exempt. How you treat each trial and suffering determines whether you move on in life and grow stronger or you get stuck going round the same mountain again and again because you refuse to learn the lesson that God wants to teach you. Stop being so me focused and go help someone else, this may give you a differnt focus. </div></blockquote>1. IF GOD IS NOT A TYRANT HOW COME HE CAN DO <strong>ANYTHING</strong> HE WANTS WITHOUT CONSULTING ANYONE?<br><br>2. WHY GOD DEAL SUCH A HARD BLOW TO ME &amp; NOT TO THOSE GREATER SINNERS? GOD IS BEING VERY BIASED. GOD IS NOT BEING VERY FAIR OR JUST. IF HE CAN DEAL LIKE THIS WITH ME, WHY CAN'T HE DEAL WORSE WITH THEM SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO REPENT?<br><br>3. AS YOU SAID ONLY HOPE. I CAN ONLY HOPE WHAT! SO SUFFER IN THIS LIFE THEN GO TO HEAVEN TO GET REWARD? LYING TO OURSELVES OR WHAT? OR JUST TRYING TO EASE OUR SUFFERING? CAN'T EAT THE GRAPES SO SAY THE GRAPES ARE SOUR?<br><br>4. I DON'T THINK SO. SOME SUFFERING ARE CAUSED BY ACCIDENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS, EVIL GOVTS &amp; PEOPLE, CORRUPT JUDICIARY &amp; POLICE, POVERTY, SICKNESS, GENETIC DISORDERS ETC ETC. SO THE PERSON SUFFERING MIGHT NOT BE HIS FAULT. THERE WAS A BLIND MAN FROM BIRTH IN THE BIBLE WHOM THE DISCIPLES OF JESUS ASKED WHOSE SIN CAUSED HIM TO BE BLIND, HIS PARENTS OR HIMSELF &amp; JESUS ANSWERED NEITHER. SO WHOSE FAULT HE WAS BORN BLIND? GOD'S FAULT WHAT BCOS HE WAS BORN BLIND FOR GOD'S GLORY!<br><br>5. LET HIM ENDURE FIVE YRS DOWN THE ROAD &amp; SEE WHETHER HE STILL NOT COMPLAIN OR MURMUR. YES THE SKY IS FALLING WHAT TO YOU CHRISTIANS, THE END OF THE WORLD IS COMING!</div>

WHY GOD DEAL SUCH A HARD BLOW TO ME &amp; NOT TO THOSE GREATER SINNERS? GOD IS BEING VERY BIASED. GOD IS NOT BEING VERY FAIR OR JUST.

SOME SUFFERING ARE CAUSED BY ACCIDENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS, EVIL GOVTS &amp; PEOPLE, CORRUPT JUDICIARY &amp; POLICE, POVERTY, SICKNESS, GENETIC DISORDERS ETC ETC. SO THE PERSON SUFFERING MIGHT NOT BE HIS FAULT. THERE WAS A BLIND MAN FROM BIRTH IN THE BIBLE WHOM THE DISCIPLES OF JESUS ASKED WHOSE SIN CAUSED HIM TO BE BLIND, HIS PARENTS OR HIMSELF &amp; JESUS ANSWERED NEITHER. SO WHOSE FAULT HE WAS BORN BLIND? GOD'S FAULT WHAT BCOS HE WAS BORN BLIND FOR GOD'S GLORY!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>AND WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THESE EVIL PEOPLE, GOVERNMENTS ETC CAUSE ALL THE SUFFERING? BECAUSE OF PRIDE AND HUMAN ARROGANCE TO NOT ADMIT MISTAKES WHEN THEY ARE DONE.
