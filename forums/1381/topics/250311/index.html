Moses knew all along he was a hebrew.<br><br>2. Moses was brought up in a Hebrew family.<br><br><blockquote>Exodus 2 (NRSV)<br><br>7Then his sister said to PharaohÂ’s daughter, Â‘Shall I go and get you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?Â’ 8PharaohÂ’s daughter said to her, Â‘Yes.Â’ So the girl went and called the childÂ’s mother. 9PharaohÂ’s daughter said to her, Â‘Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages.Â’ So the woman took the child and nursed it. 10When the child grew up, she brought him to PharaohÂ’s daughter, and she took him as her son. She named him Moses,* Â‘becauseÂ’, she said, Â‘I drew him out* of the water.Â’<br><br>11 One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and saw their forced labour. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his kinsfolk. 12He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. </blockquote></div>
