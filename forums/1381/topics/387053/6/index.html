              <p>Conclusions may or may not be simillar, but from a rational
              point of view, can you expect someone to believe creation
              especially since there is hardly any evidence to support it? Its
              not so much that people don't want to believe in God, but that
              there is insufficient reason to do so. How would you expect one to

              <p>I watched a Richard Dawkins video and he talked about it, and interviewed a man there. Every year 80k people visit, and the place has been visited for a century as holy ground. So it is estimated 70-80 million visitors. Out of all these, there are only 66 recognised miracles. This shows that the percentage of miracles happening in Lourdes is no more than say, at the Eiffel Tower, or any other place in the world. It is also mentioned that whatever healing was something that could have gotten better anyway, and not anything spectacular like the regrowth of amputated limbs</p>

              <p>35 out of 80,000? Granted there may be tourists, but the large majority seek for cures. Starfishes can regenerate, so can the tails of lizards, perhaps if humans evolve in the future, it is less likely to be seen as a true miracle. However for now, if you regrow a limb before my eyes, I would definately believe in your god. Overall statistically speaking, healings in Lourdes remain no more than sheer chance, taking into account the large numbers. You are more likely to catch someone else's disease rather than getting healed there</p>

              <p>I don't think just because a lot of people believe in christianity automatically put it as right. If you want to compare, 4.7 billion of the people (population of the world is at 6.7 billion) do not believe in christainity. Doesn't that make it seems there is insufficient evidence to believe in it ?</p>
              <p>And to me, religion is believing in supernatural powers and beings. As long as they teach supernatural elements and expect a certain behavior, they are all religions. Wat exactly do they teach isn't important</p>

              <p>Based on chrisitianity, all other religions worship false gods (maybe except judaism), for the fact that the other majority of the world, excluding atheists and agnostics, believe in some other deity, it seems to prove that most people would have a tendency to believe in the supernatural due to mitigating factors, most notably fear, feelings of solidarity and hope in another life. Many Christians have been raised from birth with the idea being fed to them, in such situations it is unsurprising if they choose to merely believe what their religious leader/bible says without question. Levels of sufficient evidence may vary, but for the fact that suicide bombers have no evidence that they are going to heaven after they die, it shows that many hold a lower standard in examining evidence in relation to religious beliefs, either because they were taught, or because they just want to accept it because of different factors.</p>
              <p>For your 2nd qn, on how we should view Christianity, it seems that one might be saved due to grace, but that certainly would not happen to an evil person according to the church. Simply put, one has to live a "christian" life to go to heaven, to get into God's good graces. This seems very simillar with other religions asking followers to do good deeds.</p>
              <p>To evalute science with religion seems a tad ridiculous at best, due to the fact that much of theology in christianity is based on the bible which with no basis at all, except faith, people believe to be holy. Science however has proven itself with evidence, most notably in the modern era lives we live today. An example of a failing when using doctrine to evalute science was when Galileo was arrested by the inquistion for his "herectical" scientific thoughts of heliocentricity. Yet there fails to be any example where christianity's doctrines trump scientific discoveries/theories.</p>
              <p>Yes, while in an argument you may find loopholes and such, but to question all the time would no doubt lead to the Pyrrhonian regress. Thus we have to content ourselves with a highly probable, but not completely foolproof explanation.</p>
              <p>As for your marriage argument, there are still happy marriage around, just that there is less focus on it. Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to read my long paragraphs</p>

              <p>no, u havent gotten it rite abt the salvation part...christianity does teach salvation by grace alone and not by good works...hence, it becomes very diff from other religions...godd works does play a part but onli after receiving salvation by grace...for other religions, u do good to receive salvation...this diff, subtle it may be to u, is crucial when it comes to how we shld view christianity compared to other religions...</p>
