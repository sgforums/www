              <p>Though I am no longer a creationist, neither an evolutionist, I would have to imply that with what DKCX says, he is implying that even those creationists who have higher qualifications than him are stupid and believe in fairytales. After all, he is a uni student. To him university is higher than going to even higher education, which is out of logic. Wow. Nice moral education. May I know where DKCX is educated at? Which UNI? Is it some crap UNI again? I suggest he bash every single religon and put into the UNI magazine so that he will get bashed up. But no one will waste their time on him anyways. =)  Besides, it is not a proven fact that evolution happened, neither is it a proven fact that God really created humans. It may not be the God of the bible either. </p>
              <p>After all, DKCX told me not to have sex when I was a creationist when somehow I mentioned God wants living things to procreate,HOWEVER it seems illogical since DKCX is the one who should refrain from it if he thinks nothing can create something. So humans need not worry about extinction of the race, because humans can just pop up from some soup. But the soup's story was partially ruined when our dear Louis Pasteur did an experiment. The story of creation in the bible has also been ruined by the 30000 year old tribes and 10 000 year old religons.</p>

              <p>It would "expose" religion only if the religion in question states a given argument directly in contradiction to the evolution theory.

              <p>Conclusions may or may not be simillar, but from a rational point of view, can you expect someone to believe creation especially since there is hardly any evidence to support it? Its not so much that people don't want to believe in God, but that there is insufficient reason to do so. How would you expect one to view Christianity then?</p>
