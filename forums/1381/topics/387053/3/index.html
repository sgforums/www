              <p>good question asked, but there wil never be a reply form god. what you will get instead are a lot of different replies to this question from the believers. thsi is what I called paradoxes, such as, if god is so almighty, can ask god to create something he cant lift? if he cant, he cant be almighty, if he can, he also isnt almighty. see the paradox here?</p>

              <p>the question to ask god is, why are there diseases and illnesses in his created world? since believers claimed god created us and everything and anything, why are there even all these things that exists in the world, like poverty, diseases, sicknesses, deformity, natural diasters?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as usual, there will be a host of replies from believers replying this question. you will never obtain a coherent and satisfactory reply from them, cos they are not god, so they are not in a position to reply meant for god you see. also their replies will generate a lot of paradoxes.</p>

              <p>It is not possible to technically or scientifically classify spiritual notions, nor calculate spiritual impact since there is no meter to gauge with more use of 'spiritual healing' or more 'interactions' with God can help.</p>
              <p>Since there is no 'spiritometer' or 'godometer', it is just perceived individually and even 'holy individuals' cannot say which summoning/calling/healing was better/effective since some ppl get healed and get infected again, some healed permanently, some never got healed, it is kind of a moot point to call it truth.</p>

              <p>If someone was to take statistics about the number of healings in a given number of people, the numbers of those healed would be too low to attribute it to any given factor, nothing different from chance. An experiment was done before to see if prayer actually helped, which was proved otherwise. Theists claim the experiment was unreliable as you "cannot test god". Christians can pull up stories of certain individuals being healed and such, but when you look at the bigger picture, such stories amount to nothing but sheer chance.</p>
              <p>I saw a video on youtube, the root of all evil and there was a portion of it talking about the miracles at lourdes (i think) where the faithful would immerse themselves in water hoping to be cured. 66 miracles, and 80 million visitors over the century. The work of God?</p>

              <p>Let me use your example of the child. The caning is to teach a lesson, send a message. However what can the genocides and deaths from natural disasters tell us? Furthermore the disasters mostly hit the impoverished.</p>

              <p>Yes, perhaps. However why do you take this stance on theism? It is also equally or more likely that there is not supernatural being at all.</p>

              <p>Well in marriage it gives you something to hope for, it gives the prospects of a joyous outcome. You won't know whether or not your marriage would be a happy one, but it would be a gamble you would be willing to take as the returns might be greater than if you didn't. However in theism, this reflects to Pascal's Wager, where if there's a god you benefit from theism but do not lose if there isn't a god. However i put it to you that christianity has no more evidence supporting it than any other religion, thus it makes no sense to follow the wager in the direction of Chrisitanity</p>

              <p>All religions would claim their god(s) to be supreme, thus i don't see where the argument is going. The divorce rates might be increasing, but the difference is that every marriage is different, thus it cannot be used as a generalisation. On the other hand marriage is also seen as more traditional, and the numbers of people co habiting without marriage have also gone up.</p>
