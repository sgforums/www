              <p>but the pt i am trying to raise is christianity doesnt teach
              salvation like other religions...its not a matter of whether u find
              ridiculous or not...tats besides the point...plus i dun tink u shld
              gauge christianity using ur own understanding cos by doing so are u
              saying tat the fundamental teachings of christianity is wrong and
              ur interpretation is rite? its no wonder u keep evaluating
              christianity like other religions cos u juz cannot agree that it
              has always been diff...i mean i can read up on buddhism and
              say...no, i dun agree tat buddha was a human being...i insist(by my
              own interpretation) tat he is God for eg...u see wad i mean? can i
              as 1 individual alter and correct the fundamental teachings of
              another religion juz cos i see it tat way? no, i accept tat since
              buddhism say buddha is not god, then tat is their teaching...i am
              in no position to alter it...</p>

              <p>My disagreement was not with the teachings, but with the assumption that good works was evidence of salvation. For this to be true, no one but christians would be doing good deeds. I don't think that anywhere in my previous post did I make any claim about interpretations.</p>

              <p>Thats not my interpretation that good works is not evidence for salvation, as whether you are christian or not, you can do good, religion has no monopoly on this. It is not my interpretation of christian doctrine, more of a non-religious assertion.</p>

              <p>Only those Islamic countries. Have you heard the story of a
              female in KL who converted to christianity from Islam? She got the
              death sentence for that. Religion is enslavery and a brainwashing

              <p>And
              it is also not true, healing exploits the sick or poor. Because genuine

              <p>I can assure you, I know genuine and real people, personal friends, who're undoubtedly healed from cancer and terminal diseases.</p>
              <p>Healing
              is real - if it is from God. It is not the preacher who heals, it is
              Jesus who heals! Although God does choose to sometimes anoint or give a
              certain person the faith to pray and move in healing.</p>
              <p>Its in the
              bible...read the OT and NT, you will discover there were specific
              people who were anointed to carry God's power to heal.</p>
              <p>Not all preachers are after your money or faking healings. God does heal !</p>

              <p>Many think it explains something, but it remains simillar to the hundreds of different religious fallacies which preach their version of who you are. One thing religions with deities have in common, is their message of complete and total obedience. It makes one feel self-important, as if everything around was made for you. This might sound like a nice world, drawing many to believe in this idealistic universe, but while it sounds nice, it may not be true. You could very well be an accident, but it would make you feel better to think that you were not, wouldn't it? For an aborted fetus, if one considers it to be human, its conception was very much an accident</p>
