              <p>Science usually requires substancial evidence to prove anything.</p>
              <p>As i've said, the healing powers of the body due to a strong willpower and hope have occurred before in the past where even fully paralysed patients could recover some of their movement which was something unbelievable to doctors but it was an act of sheet willpower which caused the miracle and not some religous healer etc. These people mentioned WERE healed but by themselves.</p>
              <p>Such cases have been documented so its more believable since its know that the mind is actually a very powerful force in the human body which could overcome certain seemly impossible tasks when the will etc is strong enough.</p>

              <p>Can you tell me why the healing session is not performed in the hospital? Instead it is usually performed on stage. Patients who really need healing are all in the hospital.</p>

              <p>You need not seek doctor's consent. Just ask the pastor sneak in as visitor and say some prayers or drink some holy water. Unless you tell me that the healing session has to be done elaborately.</p>
