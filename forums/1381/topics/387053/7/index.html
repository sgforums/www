              good works...hence, it becomes very diff from other
              religions...godd works does play a part but onli after receiving
              salvation by grace...for other religions, u do good to receive
              salvation...this diff, subtle it may be to u, is crucial when it
              comes to how we shld view christianity compared to other

              <p>For christians this means jesus' death? Since it happened already (according to the church), this puts christianity into the same criteria as other religions by doing good to enter heaven, true?</p>

              <p>i tink, like dadeadman u dun get wad i meant at 1st...it could be a problem wif wad we mean by irrefutable evidence...u see, u cannot use a case of blissful marriage(in this case MM Lee and wife) and say tat its irreuftable evidence cos wad works for MM Lee may not necessarily work for all...u cannot expect a person looking for irrefutable evidence to trust his marriage will not end in divorce juz cos there are blissful ones ard...cos u see, there are also divorces...so the pt here is, there is no irrefutable(universal) evidence tat marriages will be blissful cos how do u explain the divorces?</p>
              <p>note tat u cannot say 1st get married then work the marriage out cos that is like saying tat enter the religion then find out if God exist...the premises of this argument is while i am not yet married, prove to me tat when i get married, my marriage wun end in divorce...onli if it can be proven(irrefutably) then i get married. its the same idea as prove to me God exist then i believe...</p>
              <p>i dun blame u cos dadeadman initially didnt realli get wad i meant until we discussed further...tats y he has concluded there is no irrefutable evidence for blissful marriages...</p>

              <p>I was mistaken, not 80k yearly but the number of visitors number the millions. Taking into perspective, 35 "miracles" out of millions, the healings statistically amount to nothing but chance. Hypothetically, even if evolution was wrong, would creation automatically be right? We don't live in a multiple choice world, where every answer is already laid on the table. You say that there is no evidence to support evolution, may I see your evidence for creation? If one has faith, as you say, would it not be possible for them to see an occurrence that has a valid explanation but think that it is a miracle?</p>
              <p>To your last sentence, the answer is yes, a few.</p>

              <p>Would both grace and works be inseparable then? Without grace you have no need for good works, but without good works, grace wouldn't save you either. In the end, would good works not be a deciding factor?</p>

              <p>I did not say MM lee method will work for u or ask u to follow them. I just stated the irrefutable fact tat there r people with happy and blissful marriages. There r people who live as a couple together till one die. Your first question is really "so does tat mean
                                                  blissful marriages dun exist?" If one exist, then blissful marriages exist isn't it ? SO your first question is answered.</p>

              <p>note tat u cannot say 1st get married then work the marriage out

                                          exist...the premises of this argument is while i am not yet
                                          married, prove to me tat when i get married, my marriage wun end in

              <p>I see the argument differently from u based on the same marriage. I want my marriage to be successful too, and wat I do is to do some study, communicate with my girlfriend, see if we can be together and gauge how we can resolve problem etc. When I am convinced tat we could be together forever, then I commit and marry.</p>
              <p>For u, u r asking people to anyhow believe first then see if it is true or not. It is like saying u r asking people to anyhow marry first then see if u end up in divorce. If u start to anyhow "believe" and then find out it is not true, then u "divorce" god and jump into another religion immediately ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and finally on your good grace thing, wat it teaches doesn't help in making it seems true. It can talk all he cock and bull in the world like other religion or cults but it doesn't make it more believable. Just because it saves by grace then it is true ?</p>

              <p>oh yes, i tink u havent fully understood wad we mean by a perfect sacrifice. a perfect sacrifice means a sacrifice tat is eternal and done by a sinless being. so when u ask isnt good works a deciding factor at the end...the answer is yes if u are toking abt rewards but no if u are toking abt salvation. cos when we acknowledge and accept wad christ has done for us, the sacrifice being perfect would imply tat we are redeemed forever. u see, ur focus is on the end result(deciding factor) but in christianity, we look at salvation in entirety(beginning to end). so if u see a christian who lead life carelessly then u may qn if he was truly saved since good works is the effects/evidence for salvation. but before one is a christian, does his good works get him saved? the answer is no. in other words, the good works are "not counted'''...however for most other religions, are the good works counted, the answer is yes.</p>
              <p>one reason why i feel u look at the end result is cos ur concept of salvation is abt the end result only. however, in christianity, salvation is the beginning result which is suppose to last for eternity with good works being the evidence of tat salvation. i have to remind u again tat tat good works is the evidence not the element of salvation... </p>

              <p>hey referring to ur earlier post...u said '' for christians, this means jesus' death?'' well, u need to be clear tat jesus' death is so tat he can pay for our sins. however, salvation in christianity is not juz the death of jesus but also the resurrection of jesus. its the resurrection tat symbolises jesus victory over death and sin. if jesus died and didnt resurrect, then we would still be condemned. so u cannot juz look at his death. its the death and resurrection tat make up the complete sacrifice and salvation.</p>

              <p>I don't think that other religions actually teach that if you perform good deeds you are guaranteed a place in heaven, it would depend on what their god's decision ultimately, whether or not they have been good or bad. So I think that every religion,with a god, whether religious leaders emphasized or not, actually has simillarities with "grace" in christianity.</p>
              <p>As for good works being evidence of your salvation, i find that to be untrue. You previously said "redeemed all who acknowledge him". There remain many non-christians who are good people. It would also be ridiculous to assume that everyone born before jesus(if he was real), did not perform good deeds. Also, I heard from a christian that everyone before jesus went either to purgatory or hell, not sure how true this is.</p>
