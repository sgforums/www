              <p>Yes, every religion is different but the marriage example takes theism vs atheism as marriage is between yes and no. However the point you are making is between yes and yes, if you see what i mean. About the point of eliminations, i find your argument unsound, almost every major religion has a creation story. Hindus have their story, taoists have their story. Islam, Judaism and Christianity merely share monotheism. (if the story of the trinity is accepted)</p>

              <p>When you say "one" in the first paragraph do you mean creation or number of gods? This site speaks of the creation stories: http://www.innovationslearning.co.uk/subjects/re/information/creation/creation_home.htm</p>
              <p>And that just lists a few of the creation stories. Back to marriage, unless the divorce rate is way above the number of people married, i conclude there is sufficient evidence for it</p>

              <p>Let me use your example of the child. The caning is to teach a lesson, send a message. However what can the genocides and deaths from natural disasters tell us? Furthermore the disasters mostly hit the impoverished.</p>

              <p>I tell you, you will never get a sane and coherent reply on this or other questions posed, cos they are not god. can they speak for god? even so, you will get different answers from believers cos thats their own opinions. they are entitled to their opinion as the saying goes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so you see, if you want to obtain an answer to the world problems or ills, do not seek the answers/solutions from them cos thay have no answers. all they will tell you is how has it all planned out or punishments, or this is a test for them set up by god. so in the end, you will get a myriad of answers to the questions asked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its better to rely on modern science, chemistry, physics, economics, mathematics and medicine to seek for answers to the world's ills like genocide, poverty, hunger, corruption etc etc. its better to be self reliant than rely on an imagined divine being its existence is yet to be proved.</p>

              <p>I tend to be skeptical of healings even though I am a Christian... but more so because I came from a background of pentecostal abuse where people were quick to declare miracles without really checking if it really happened? A few years of this tends to make one cynical... at least to people going around trying to claim things without verification.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I still do believe healings happen because I have witnessed them first hand. A person who was deaf could suddenly hear, and unless he was a plant put into the crowd to decieve us, then very likely this was a miracle.</p>
              <p>I believe that real miracles should hold up to medical and scientific checking... if they are real they made a real physical change.</p>
              <p>It is naive to think that modern science, chemistry, physics and economics and what have you not will provide the answer to the world's ills. Practically because I believe human nature to be far more telling. These things are just tools and they can, and have been abused. Science has provided us many benefits, but also plenty of evils and pains. The worship of science as the salvation to our issues in my opinion, is a misguided path. Science is a tool, and a powerful one at that. But is is limited by our morality, which is derived from some other source.</p>

              <p>You are just restating my point. It is erronous to refer to Science or Religion as a "thing" that automatically determines the behaviour of those who hail by them. At the end of the day people still have the choice to make what they have of it.</p>
              <p>Simply put, the worship of science, is ironically, the almost religious faith some put in Science to be the solution of all of mankind's problems... as if the invention of nuclear weapons, super-diseases due to antibiotic abuse, and what have you not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However I do not see how religion can be "good" or "bad" going from a naturalistic perspective. Good and bad, in the naturalistic perspective, are just irrational human illusions created by society to control its members. It has no real relation to the universe. What is good for one man may be bad for another. The only thing that matters is power and the will to apply it.</p>
              <p>By trying to say religion brings "bad" things, one is actually betraying the fact that he has no been able to shed religious thought, this irrational belief in the "goodness" or "badness" of things. One does not need to have a religion in order to behave religiously... the tons of athiests who reject religion, but yet still think mankind is bound by some arbitary moral law that certain behaviours are "bad" are a prime example.</p>
              <p>There is no good or bad behaviour, just behaviour that people put labels on.</p>

              <p>The progress of science may have brought troubles and ills, but it is an undeniable fact that you are enjoying the great benefits it brought. You get to see doctors that don't just prescribe "magic" potions, neither do you have to live in caves.</p>
              <p>I would not describe any sort of behaviour as being religious, due to the fact that with or without religion, one can still choose his own behaviour, thus no need to bring religion into the picture at all. This arbitrary moral law you stated, everyone lives by it. This "law" changes with the times, like how in the past it was common to keep slaves, be racist etc. We even judge the Bible by the moral standards we hold now, or we would be taking the old testament literally. An example in the new testament is when jesus tells his disciples to hate their families, but many christians don't view this as literal. Why ever not? In the end I agree with your last sentence.</p>
