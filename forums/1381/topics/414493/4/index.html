              <p> I have said this before and for the sake of retards like u who accuse me of slander with basically no proof whatsoever, some christians r retards, but theres a lot out there u dun know abt. I blast u if u go visit a church? Or rather, u heaed someone say that and decided to pitch with ur nonsense? First u say all christians r arseholes, next u slander me with lies.                          </p>
              <p>My fault u rso dumb even simple facts cant ne understood? Does one bad apple turn the whole basket bad? Or is it just jur retarded brain having nothing better to do? And now u even associate anyone u hate with christianity? How naove and hypcritical can you get? Post some solid evidence then, if u claim me hypocritical? Half of u guys prob dun know what a real church is. My hypocritical friend, did i once say that there r no bad christians? Or rather was it u who spouted nonsense on the world being full of asshole christians? Shall i say most hindus r bad as well? I have encpuntered nastiness in hindus, shall i base that to say all hindus are assholes? Was i being arrogant or just disgusted at ur naiveity?

              <p>well, I am not sure the intent of the TS, and did not read all posts.</p>
              <p>however, just my two cents.</p>
              <p>when I first go to church, I was treated special, like a newborn to the family. I was loaded with materials, went to lunch with leaders, and get to know tons of christians in my church. As I settled, I began to find my own way around, i know who/where to go. yes, I don't get the sensation of being new anymore, but wherever I go, I am treated like an equal.</p>
              <p>Some doesn't like the feeling of being "new" cause it makes them standout, while others enjoyed it, cause it comes with "perks". For me, it is just a phrase.</p>
              <p>like going to a new class or joining a new group, you get to be showed around, but U need to stand on your own. yes, if U have special needs, u do get special help.</p>
              <p>everyone is different and with their own experiences react differently.  some may feel comfortable getting rid of the "newness" and be just normal in a group but some needs longer hand-holding. it is all normal. for some, they do feel in a way, "neglected" but trust me, for all christians, we are all united in blood of christ, and whenever you feel out of place, talk about it. i believe there are mature christians (bro/sis) who will aid you. just don't be shy.</p>
              <p>Thanks, and God bless to all.</p>

              <p>I've been to a few churches and I do realised and have also witnessed this occurrence enough to say that it is common for christians to be only nice to new people.</p>
              <p>Yes, you do get to be welcomed warmly into the big family called church when you're new. The continuation of the warm-ness is something you will need to go and look for it yourself in other people when you're not so new to the church. So the church itself isn't really a constant place for warm salvation and welcome if you're not a new church-goer or christian.</p>
              <p>Perhaps many people are already numbed and jaded by the society because they feel it is common for people in society to behave in an indifference and pretentious manner.</p>
              <p>People come to church seeking salvation and fellowship, but found out that such kindness comes with a 10% price tax on their income.</p>
              <p>Churches may preach many things about GOD in the bible, but the sermons are often tailored to meet the financial requirements of the churches and often not towards the growth/benefit of the believers. Take note of the sermons which begins with GOD and you and ended with you and the Church (GOD Disappear?). Repeating sermons are the worst lot of them all, it just shows how little juice the churches are actually blessed in their spiritual fruit.</p>
              <p>Many people who have willingly and unwillingly joined churches, failed to realised that they were unconsciously enslaved by the very people whom they had seeked salvation and fellowship from. Discipleship, Mentoring, and the many positions in the hierarchy in the Church organisation were screaming out signals of enslavement, but people were too afraid to question why they needed to obey the orders, regulations, "culture and tradition" of the churches at the sacrificial expense of their own freedom and privacy.</p>
              <p>Aren't we all equal in front of GOD? I guess we will only be equal before GOD when we're dead and not allowed to be equal with one another when we're alive.</p>
              <p>It's also true and sad to learn that there are always power struggles between church members and the leaders, and leaders with other leaders.</p>
              <p>The funniest common thing that I have encountered is that church people always has this imaginations that new church-goers always had a sad past/reasons/problems to attend church and they are very keen to find out these reasons.</p>
              <p>Sadly I don't attend church as much as I would like to, but as people would tell me to come to church for GOD and yet still allow me to see the many changes in their attitudes and behaviour towards new to old christians in the churches.</p>
              <p>My simple wish is for all christian to treat one another equally as how they would like to be treated themselves. Do not only warmly welcome and be zealous towards the new people you meet in the church, but also maintain the same amount or great zealous towards the people whom you are associated with in the church.</p>

              <p>There is no need to go to church to see how Christians behave. Look around us, we will know. Most of the Christians don't believe in good works to go to heaven. They believe whatever wrongs they do, God will forgive them. So, why bother to be good? Father is always there to forgive, that is why there are many spoilt kids.</p>

              <p>And u do? Besides being ignored at times or maybe a few times criticised by a member and u blame the church on the whole? I do know what its like to be a brother in christ, unlike uy fren, whos just a little disgruntled with barely any common sense to spare. Have u defined ur little ‘persecution’? Or is it just merely being treated as second to a newcomer that pisses u off? U think jesus went for the christian jews? No! He ignores them most of the time, focussing on the sinners. How much more so here? Does ignorance pisses u off? Or one crazy christian managed to humiliate u so u feel all christians r the same?</p>

              <p><br>I find that it is normal for people to be criticised by others outside church, but shouldn't christians encourage one another to do better instead of employing criticism to motivate them to do better?</p>
              <p>Especially church leaders! They should be more learned and should know better that they should ENCOURAGE instead of CRITICISE. (I don't want to hear reasons such as they are only humans and they will err from time to time, because if they aren't good enough to be leaders, then please do not appoint them as leaders)</p>
              <p>Don't you think there's always a better way of getting the message across to another person without inflicting any damage?</p>
