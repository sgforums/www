              <p><br>It's not whacked, but I feel that once you got to know these friendly christians, you will see that they aren't really sincere people deep down inside them.</p>
              <p>Alot of christians are nice only on the outside and on sundays, but rotten on the inside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh...I forgot to mention that christians are also one of the kind types of people who loves to put themselves high and mighty and noble and then go around pitying everyone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess your behaviour is acceptable to you and your kind. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
