              <p>Distributing flyers , so what???    It is just superficial distribute flyers, once get in the church is a different treatment.   Worse one church distributed flyers to tell residents they will go to their homes to distribute cakes and for a few years this never happen.  </p>
              <p>No matter how and what you say there is nothing to justify the bad behaviour of most christians.   </p>
