              treated.  </p>
              <p>Distributing flyers , so what???    It is just
              superficial distribute flyers, once get in the church is a
              different treatment.   Worse one church distributed
              flyers to tell residents they will go to their homes to distribute
              cakes and for a few years this never happen.  </p>
              <p>No matter how and what you say there is nothing to justify the
              bad behaviour of most christians.   </p>
              <p>As non christians attend church the church people welcome. 
              once after becoming christians is a different

And now u even associate anyone u hate with christianity? How naove and hypcritical can you get? Post some solid evidence then, if u claim me hypocritical? Half of u guys prob dun know what a real church is. My hypocritical friend, did i once say that there r no bad christians? Or rather was it u who spouted nonsense on the world being full of asshole christians? Shall i say most hindus r bad as well? I have encpuntered nastiness in hindus, shall i base that to say all hindus are assholes? Was i being arrogant or just disgusted at ur naiveity? My fren who slanders christianity jus as he 'claims' i slander islam?

              <p>There is no need to go to church to see how Christians behave. Look around us, we will know. Most of the Christians don't believe in good works to go to heaven. They believe whatever wrongs they do, God will forgive them. So, why bother to be good? Father is always there to forgive, that is why there are many spoilt kids.</p>
