              <p>then on what grounds then did u base ur fact that ur church is 'heartlesss'? have u heard of real investigative reporting? do journalists post crap or make sure they get into the real situation to understand fully what they want to publish? FYI: its not called brainwash, itss called being bothered. coming to church barely once a week and then deducing its full of crappy christians is something I dont understand </p>

              <p><br>Actually you're wrong.</p>
              <p>It's common for people to reduce their regular attendence at church because it is full of crappy christians.</p>
              <p>I won't call for support from the people here to verify my claims, but as a christian yourself, you should not deny the truth just to maintain and protect the nobility of crappy christians.</p>
              <p>It just shows the poor acceptance of criticism of christians and the zero graciousness of christians when faced with truthful criticism/feedback from fellow christians.</p>
              <p>Do you really want me to only say good things about crappy christians so that they may increase in numbers?</p>
              <p>What will GOD say of your actions if you do not uphold the truth? I will agree with you if all christians were as good as you have imagined.</p>

              <p><br>You don't need to treat anyone as a king, but certainly there is no need for power struggles to exist in church or even politics to exist in christianity!</p>
              <p>The reason they exist is because Humans tries to rule over each other by categorising and separating between each other with ranks such as leaders, disciples, and other hierarachy in the churches.</p>
              <p>GOD WILL NEVER MAKE CHRISTIANS FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO REACH HIM.</p>
              <p>IT IS HUMANS WHO TRIES TO DO EVIL THINGS TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM REACHING OUT TO GOD BY IMPOSING RANKS AND HIERARCHY IN CHURCHES WHERE PEOPLE COME TO SEEK SALVATION FROM GOD.</p>
              <p>WE ARE ALL EQUAL BEFORE GOD.....DEAD AND ALIVE.</p>

              <p>Who can tell me why christians need to serve and seek the approval of other christians in the church before they can reach GOD?</p>
              <p>Christians can reach out to GOD even without serving and seeking approval of other christians in church.</p>
              <p>If enslavement isn't the right word to use, please enlighten me with a more suitable term and justify that at the same time.</p>
              <p>Your believe, faith, love, respect, joy for GOD is purely shared between YOU and GOD.</p>
              <p>What makes you think you will gain more or less from GOD if you have lacked the serving and the approval of your fellow christians in the church?</p>
              <p>My King is GOD and GOD alone is my LORD and SAVIOUR.</p>
              <p>I do not worship Humans, so I do NOT need their acceptance and approval to LOVE, WORSHIP, BRING JOY to my GOD, my LORD and my SAVIOUR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a church is being run in such an uncorrective manner in order to attract new believers to join their church and become new christians, and are only warm, attentive, concern, loving, focused towards them when they are new christians, but also show uncaring, having ulterior motive, personal agenda towards their existing fellow christians....then I can say either the church management are wrong or the flock are lost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can't be the only christian who are witnessing these things in churches. Something is wrong if christians are afraid to uphold the truth and question the evil which is trying to contain them in their christian walk of faith.</p>
