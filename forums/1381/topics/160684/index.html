            <div class='col-md body'>statistically, its very vague to say "christians are rich"<br><br>not every christians are rich, in fact, there are many christians who gave up everything to do mission works and help out in 3rd world countries.<br><br>many christians died defending their faith, or just being in the faith alone. (eg, the 3 christian girls in indonesia)<br><br>how about the thousands of christian believers in african tribes? are they rich? i hardly think so..<br><br>but i'll twist your words a little. not all christians are rich in monetary goods. But they're rich in the heart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>but there are christians who are rich, filthy or otherwise. And i really don't see anything wrong with being rich.. as long as it isn't used for evil purposes. After all, its our God's blessing.<br><br>It's really an old argument. You can say the money can be used to help less fortunate people. But how do you know the rich christians didn't help? Maybe they help alot, but for every dollar they give to the poor, God blesses him 100 fold?<br><br>tell you something.. there are only 3 types of people who say money isn't important - the rich, the insane, and the "spiritual"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This phenomena is obvious in singapore and I see the following reasons, but only for the chinese community.<br><br>1)Christians here are mostly english speaking. Generally the english speaking families here are in the high or middle income group. Civil servants (esp. the senior ones, since colonial time), and all professionals speak english. That is why christianity is regarded as western religion, angmoh ga.<br><br>2) on the other hand, chinese speaking only or those who quit schools before 0 level and turn to speaking dialects and english chinese form the majority of the population, in the middle or lower income group or the grass root level. Most of the 1 million buddhists, 200,000 taoists are among them and the others simply practise chinese traditional rituals. There are not many christian churches that cater to this group of ppl.<br><br>3) There are some very rich chinese speaking only singaporean, mostly in their own business but they are usually very strong buddhists or simply cannot accept christianity which to them is western culture and influence.<br><br>4) Christianity holds very strong position against gambling and unhealthy lifestyle, whereas followers of other religions believe that it is the good deeds they do that count. IMHO, those who gamble will never be rich.<br><br>Christians are still the minority among singaporen. Many churches are sending missionaries to thailand, india and other distant places, but how many churches, especially the english speaking ones, conduct ministry to reach the poor,  chinese speaking populations in singapore?? well, these ppl usually have very strong traditional religious background and are difficult ppl, plus home ministry is definitely less noble sounding than overseas mission, leave it to the chinese churches, i suppose. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

So, wealth is not confined to a certain belief group only... in fact that reminds me, I went to the REN CI CHarity Dinner last Sunday and The REVEREND MING YI put up his own personal item for auction... I think it was a Buddhist bead.... and from $1000 base price, it shot up to $100,000. Winner was the boss of Teh Yi Jia, Popiah King, Sam Gwee....

For the rest of my relatives, they're not christians and well they don't have that kind of wealth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Maybe its just me, or I have few relatives. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>i think for ur case... it's becoz singaporeans are generally rich, just so those who are rich happened to be christians.. i know alot of non christians are very rich too</div>
