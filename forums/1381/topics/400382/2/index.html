              <p><br>For most of the big and rich churches, it is compulsory to GIRO 10% of your gross earnings every month to church if  you want to be a member. Before u can become a member, u got to fill an employment slip detailing your job and gross monthly salary before CPF contribution. So really cannot siam one. Where else u think they got the money to build such big and nice buildings?</p>
              <p>Thats not all, u frequently have to cough out extras for whatever additional fund raising events such as money for new buildings or overseas missions.</p>
              <p>So really, modern churches is very much about fishing for rich enterprising individuals to become their members. Of course the poor are welcome, but the handsome pretty rich individuals are even more welcome.</p>

              <p>You don't have to pay tithes to be a Christian. Being a Christian means you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, while repenting from sins. </p>
              <p>Even if 10% of your tithe is 10cents, God will be pleased too! :)</p>

              <p>Where have i not answered your questions? I'm still waiting for your response to my post on the evil thread page 12, dated 28 May 11:16pm. And also the one at 11:22pm. Have you found out what "epistemology" means? on the other hand, you blatantly avoided answering my questions by "passing"... </p>
              <p>Be waiting for you back on the other thread. For once, bring something substantial to the table... </p>

              <p>I will not reply to any of your incoherent or illogical argument, that is why. not personal attacks? go re-read your own threads and comments posted. anyway I am not surprised at the way you are having a go at me, just like a few of your like minded mates here. I will be surprised if you did not have a go at me because your reputation have preceded you. I have maintained my stand earlier,  your incoherent replies or non replies have answered my questions already.</p>

              <p>dont think too highly of yourself. you don't quite seem to be able to think and reason. most of your posts are mere RANTS. White noise. drivel.

              <p>illogical?? asking if you have warrant for your beliefs is illogical? first of all, i haven't made any argument to be branded illogical. Second of all, asking for warrant is not illogical because if you don't have a basis for asking those questions, how can you pose them in the first place? </p>
              <p>incoherence does not answer any questions, unless you justify them in your head with your own irrationality. which is why i'm still waiting for your response in the other thread. </p>
              <p>i don't care about my reputation, i prefer to call a spade a spade. i see that most of your rants are filled with hatred, spite and bitterness which understandably leads one to commit all sorts of logical fallacies, just like you have. So what do you say? prove to me you've substance for once, or at least humour me by showing that you can answer some of my questions.</p>
