              <p><br> For most of the big and rich churches, it is compulsory to GIRO 10%
              of your gross earnings every month to church if  you want
              to be a member. Before u can become a member, u got to fill an
              employment slip detailing your job and gross monthly
              salary before CPF contribution. So really cannot siam one. Where
              else u think they got the money to build such big and nice
              buildings?</p>
              <p>Thats not all, u frequently have to cough out extras for
              whatever additional fund raising events such as money for new
              buildings or overseas missions.</p>
              <p>So really, modern churches is very much about fishing
              for rich enterprising individuals to become their members. Of
              course the poor are welcome, but the handsome pretty rich
              individuals are even more welcome.</p>

              <p>Not all churches have the same practices regarding declaration of income and how much you should be giving to church. Many churches in Singapore alone do not have any strict pratice regarding either.</p>
              <p>Afterall, it is stated in the bible how much you give should be between you and God. That in fact, what you give from the right hand not even the left hand should know.</p>
              <p>There are many ways to give to God and help the church, not necessarily by giving money. If you really feel bad yourself (not due to external coercing), you can opt to help the church in deeds or in kind. I won't give you specifics or details on how to help your church in other ways, it does depend on the individual.</p>
              <p>My suggestion at this time is to pray about it and hope for God's prompting in a direction of some sort.</p>

              <p>Read Deuteronomy 26. The 10% "tithe" was a practise in the old testament for the tribes of Israel to support the Levites. The Levites served as priests in those days, so they do not have any "income" of their own. Christians translate that practice to modern day churches, to support the Church because the full time staff (Pastors, clerks, cleaners, etc) do not have any income either. However, if we read Acts in the new testament, people gave according to what they had and wanted to give, with the same purpose of supporting the Churches. There are 2 camps of thoughts in this area, some insist on giving 10% "tithe" to the Church, following the old testament practice; some choose to give "offerings" to God with no fixed benchmark whatsoever.</p>
              <p>Personally, I have been attending church for a couple of years. I do not declare my income to the church, neither do I give 10% of my salary to my church, I have not been thrown out or ostracised in church by anybody. However, I take 10% as a guideline and donate it to worthy causes (charitable organisations/ directly to people whom I know are in financial difficulties), as well as to my church by putting the money directly in the offering bag. I personally believe in giving back to God with a cheerful heart, part of what He has greatly blessed me with, and I strongly believe that as Christians, we are channels for God's blessings, we are blessed so that we can be a blessing to others around us (christians/non christians). Ultimately, we are accountable to God on what we do with our money, whether or not we have been good stewards of what God has entrusted us with. So pray, and God will give you the wisdom and conviction to do what is right in His eyes, God bless you.</p>

              <p>Just to highlight to everybody again, for those who don't know and also those who blatantly ignore. Not every church has the same practice when it comes to tithing and declaration of income.</p>
              <p>I think there has been enough sharing here of different Christians regarding their own practices regarding giving to the church. If you insist on sticking with narrow stereotypes then it says a lot about you.</p>
