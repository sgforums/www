              <p>Its just a simple Yes or No. Open communcations and elaborations can come after. I said i am willing to answer all your YES or NO in your first reply.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">First of all, let me make it clear.
                                      That a lot of your explainations and these supposedly elaborations
                                      just <strong>further reinforces my point</strong>. Lets just do a
                                      simple cross-examination. <strong>And hopefully through this, we
                                      can cut the bullshit, and get down to the gist of it to clear any
                                      confusion and supposedly misunderstandings with</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>all those
                                      long-winded supposely explainations and elabtorations that you
                                      claim is being directed at me</strong></span><strong>, but
                                      unfortunately,</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I know that, and it seems to
                                      me, that you are actually explaining it to
                                      yourself</strong></span><strong>. Bravo.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Let me just cross-exam our
                                      statements with a series of simple YES or NO questions.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1)U said: So do u agree tat u had
                                      said gravity is not the truth before ?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">NO. I will quote you what u used on
                                      me.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“How long did it take them just to
                                      explain the theory of gravity”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>As u can clearly see, the

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">2)U Ans: Truth has to work within a
                                      certain scope. For 1+1=2, both must be the same context. (1 apple +
                                      1 apple =2 apples, 1 apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2
                                      apples or 2 oranges). If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the
                                      equation right and talking cock. Before u do the summation, why not
                                      u state the question to ask first before doing the sums ?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">All this time, I already clearly
                                      meant in different circumstances.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Is 1 + 1 = 2 True and the Truth IN ALL

                                      said I claimed: I did not say Gravity is not truth</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">NO. I will quote you what u used on

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As u can clearly see, the word
                                      Theory is in reference to the subject Gravity. As u notice the word

              <p>U have to tell me wat is the physical difference between the

                                      wrong with saying it "could be anything" ?”</p>
              <p>Let me ask you:</p>
              <p>If we come across something that we dont even know what it is,
                                      and I asked you, “What is it ?” normally, if a person dont know,
                                      they will reply, “ I dont know” they dont say , “It could be
                                      anything!” because, by asking that question answering “It could be
                                      anyhing?” Is like telling me... it could be anything, which I KNOW.
                                      “If could be anything!”. thats why I asked you, “What is it ?</p>

              <p><em>All other aspects and characteristics of science can be

              <p>The idea is the scientific hypothesis. It is judged if it is the
                                      truth or not</p>
              <p><strong>We've learned from experience that the truth will come

                                      and find out whether you were wrong or right. Nature's phenomena

              <p><em>If we come across something that we dont even know what it
              is, and I asked you, “What is it ?” normally, if a person dont
              know, they will reply, “ I dont know” they dont say , “It could be
              anything!” because, by asking that question answering “It could be
              anyhing?” Is like telling me... it could be anything, which I KNOW.
              “If could be anything!”. thats why I asked you, “What is it
              ?</em></p>
              <p>U r again saying rubbish. If someone shows a thing which we have
              no clue at all, a person saying "it could be anything" is
              justified. U know wat is the meaning of "anything" ? It means it
              could be something u do not know too. U could search at google and
              u can find the following usage in grammer</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Are you Richard Feynman ?
              YES or NO</span></strong></p>

              <p style="font-weight: normal;"> <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">NO</span></strong>. U say 0/0 is logically zero

              anything, the first set of 0/0 could be 1 while the second set
              could be 0, then it still come to the conclusion tat 0= 0 which is
              again right.”</strong> <strong>YES OR NO</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yes</span></strong>. I

              <p>So ? I have said many times tat it goes from -ve infinity to +
              infinity and it could be anything in between. Let me ask u back</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Does y tend to positive

              <p>The answer u give is the answer of division by zero</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DID I EVER SAY “SCIENCE IS

                                      define it. U have a rough idea it could be anything, and that
                                      anything could be in the realm of comprehension. To me, undefined,
                                      just means I cannot define it. Unable to comprehend.</p>

                                      Normally the bad apples could be 80 or 90 per 500. Let me ask u back</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats not the point. Its a simple question.
                                      Just a YES or NO.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No,  obviously he supplied some good
                                      apples. But my point is, do u call it a crate of good apples if they

                                          Gravity is Truth). But if you think I did not , then I guess even

              <p>As said before many times, u had stated the below before on the 15th Jan</p>
              <p>“How long did it take them just to
                                          explain the theory of gravity"</p>
              <p>This
                  is plain as day tat u said gravity is a theory and thus false. The word
                  "of" just reinforce the idea u claim gravity is a theory. My objective
                  is to show u had said gravity is not truth once. So I had done it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No. Gravity is the Truth.

              <p>Let me tell u one thing first. Gravity is really a scientific
                                          theory similar to evolution.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">No, To me, gravity is
                                          Truth.</span></p>
              <p>Didn't u say "if it is a theory, it cannot be the truth " ? So how come tis is true now ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(I guess we both agree. No

                                          beginning. 1 + 1 = 2 is true... but not really the TRUTH! (17 Jan
                                          9.58pm)Because it depends on circumstances. Thats my whole point.
                                          Hope u have finally understand in my context by

              <p>The whole point is truth always has a scope. No truth is true no matter wat the circumstances is. Since u claimed</p>

                                          insisted I meant Gravity is a theory, then AGAIN, u choose not

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
                                      truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
                                      And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
                                      both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
                                      Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                      of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                                      "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                                      truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                                      proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                                      <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                                      call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  truth
                                      has no scope and can works for all circumstances<br></span></p>
              <p>My ans: When I ask u whether gravity can pull aspiration and etc, u admit tat truth has a scope. All truth has a limit on where it works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
                                      NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
                                      finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
                                      about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
                                      truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
                                      Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                                      the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ?</p>
              <p> </p>

                                      u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
                                      wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
                                      u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                                      is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
                                      if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
                                      again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
                                      truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                                      be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                                      equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                                      article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                      touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
                                      when I said it could be any value from 0 to
                                      infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                                      meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                                      values. U
                                      paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots will
                                      conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat the 0
                                      in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U provide an example of mathematics fallacy which really just means a misrepresentation of maths</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                                      definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                                      wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                      The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                      accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                      it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                      on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                                      ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                                      be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                                      definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
                                      knowledge of facts. And u just misquote Richard Feynman</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                                      is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                      it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                      body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
                                      same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
                                      be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
                                      still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                                      student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
                                      small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
                                      and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
                                      is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
                                      theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
                                      wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>
              <p>If a scientific hypothesis is proven wrong, does it means all the established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>

              <p>“How long did it take them just to explain the theory of
              gravity"</p>
              <p>This is plain as day tat u said gravity is a theory and thus
              false. The word "of" just reinforce the idea u claim gravity is a
              theory. My objective is to show u had said gravity is not truth
              once. So I had done it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No. Gravity is the Truth.
              And Yes, there is a theory of gravity.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Let me tell u one thing first. Gravity is really a scientific
              theory similar to evolution.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">No, To me, gravity is
              Truth.</span></p>
              <p>Didn't u say "if it is a theory, it cannot be the truth " ? So
              how come tis is true now ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(I guess we both agree. No
              problem there) That was the whole point I was telling in the
              beginning. 1 + 1 = 2 is true... but not really the TRUTH! (17 Jan
              9.58pm)Because it depends on circumstances. Thats my whole point.
              Hope u have finally understand in my context by
              now.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The whole point is truth always has a scope. No truth is true no
              matter wat the circumstances is. Since u claimed</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Is the truth gravity which
              u claimed is TRUTH, TRUTH in ALL
              CIRCUMSTANCES </span></strong></p>
              <p>Then can gravity pull aspiration, or education, or economy down
              to the earth ?</p>
              <p>U r not really answering my question here. I said show me the
              equation example again, not ask me tis question.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">My Answer:</span> <span style="color: #888888;">No. (In case u wish to argue the point ? Please
              check back to Wiki – Truth. Even the intellectuals are vastly
              different from the dictionary, hence I do not consider my
              definition deviate greatly from the rest of the english speaking
              world) (RED)</span></p>
              <p>The intellectuals basis is still tat truth is true. Furthermore,
              u should include the word "science"</p>
              <p>I have already said the answer as yes. It works. So it is
              yes</p>
              <p>So u refuser to answer tis question ? U can avoid answering
              questions but I am just gonna write my points after all the end
              anyway</p>
              <p>Tat is your wrong defintion. Anything means "anything" right ?
              The things I do not know is also "anything" right ? The things u do
              not know is also "anything" right ?</p>
              <p>Tis is because u refuse to answer wat is divide by zero. Tat is
              no logical meaning to it</p>
              <p>Tis only shows u, alone, believe tis is true</p>
              <p>Ok, then why did u bringing out the example of 0/0 in the first
              place ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wrong. As said before, u r dealing with undefined value, not
              variable.The left hand side and right hand side can be different. U
              putting X is trying to put another fallacy</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Did u ever say Science is
              NEVER about the truth ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No. I already made it
              clear that its about the How and Why , if they stumbled upon the

              <p>Yup I understand. So ? There r lazy people and hardworking

              check back to Wiki – Truth. Even the intellectuals are vastly

              world) (RED)</span></p>
              <p>The intellectuals basis is still tat truth is true. Furthermore,

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>I have already said the answer as yes. It works. So it is

              <p>So u refuser to answer tis question ? U can avoid answering

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Tat is your wrong defintion. Anything means "anything" right ?
              The things I do not know is also "anything" right ? The things u do
              not know is also "anything" right ?</p>
              <p>Tis is because u refuse to answer wat is divide by zero. Tat is
              no logical meaning to it</p>
              <p>Tis only shows u, alone, believe tis is true</p>

              place ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ISNT IT OBVIOUS THAT MATHS CREATED BY HUMANS HAVE ERRORS. THATS ALL. </span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE EXAMPLE.  DO U AGREE THAT HUMAN MAKES ERRORS ? YES OR NO ?</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">SIMPLE</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wrong. As said before, u r dealing with undefined value, not
              variable.The left hand side and right hand side can be different. U
              putting X is trying to put another fallacy</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Does the graph ever reaches 0 ? YES or

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">No</span></strong></p>
              <p>So ? I have said many times tat it goes from -ve infinity to +
                                      infinity and it could be anything in between. Let me ask u back</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Does y tend to positive
                                      infinity and negative infinty as x goes to zero ? Wat is the value
                                      of X=0 then ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The answer u give is the answer of
                                      division by zero</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ans: And so what is it ?
                                      UNDEFINED. Please, look at the graph again..</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">THEN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY U PUT ZERO TO INFINITY ?</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">UNLESS U ADMIT U MADE A MISTAKE. U ARE HUMAN.

              <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
              call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  truth has no
              scope and can works for all circumstances<br></span></p>
              <p>My ans: When I ask u whether gravity can pull aspiration and
              etc, u admit tat truth has a scope. All truth has a limit on where
              it works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its

              finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
              about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
              truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
              Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
              the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
              u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be

              u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
              is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
              if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
              again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
              truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
              be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
              equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
              article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
              touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
              when I said it could be any value from 0 to
              infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
              meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
              values. U paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots
              will conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat
              the 0 in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U
              provide an example of mathematics fallacy which really just means a
              misrepresentation of maths</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
              definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
              wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
              The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
              accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
              it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
              on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
              ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
              be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
              definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
              knowledge of facts. And u just misquote Richard Feynman</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
              is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
              it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
              body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
              same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
              be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
              still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
              student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
              small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
              and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
              is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
              theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
              wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>
              <p>If a scientific hypothesis is proven wrong, does it means all
              the established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ISNT IT OBVIOUS THAT MATHS CREATED BY HUMANS HAVE ERRORS. THATS ALL. </span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE EXAMPLE.  DO U AGREE THAT HUMAN MAKES ERRORS ? YES OR NO ?</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">SIMPLE</span></p>
              <p>Wrong. As said before, u r dealing with undefined value, not
              variable.The left hand side and right hand side can be different. U
              putting X is trying to put another fallacy</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Does the graph ever reaches 0 ? YES or
                                      NO</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">No</span></strong></p>
              <p>So ? I have said many times tat it goes from -ve infinity to +
                                      infinity and it could be anything in between. Let me ask u back</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Does y tend to positive
                                      infinity and negative infinty as x goes to zero ? Wat is the value
                                      of X=0 then ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The answer u give is the answer of
                                      division by zero</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ans: And so what is it ?
                                      UNDEFINED. Please, look at the graph again..</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">THEN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY U PUT ZERO TO INFINITY ?</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">UNLESS U ADMIT U MADE A MISTAKE. U ARE HUMAN. ITS O.K TO MAKE MISTAKES. THATS MY WHOLE POINT. I MAKE MISTAKE, U MAKE MISTAKE, SCIENCE MAKE MISTAKE,  MATHS MAKE MISTAKE, ABSOLUTE REALITY DOESNT, BECAUSE IT IS WHAT IT IS.</span></p>

                                      Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                      of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                                      "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it
                                      is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                                      truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                                      proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                                      <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                                      call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have said tis many times as well but your only defence is "theory of gravity" is "theory of gravity"</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
                                          truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
                                          And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
                                          both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1
                                          apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2 apples or 2 oranges).
                                          If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the equation right and
                                          talking cock. When I asked u wat to state the question which u wana
                                          ask for the above equation, u refuse to provide it.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
                                          Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                          of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                                          "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it
                                          is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                                          truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                                          proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                                          <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                                          call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>
              <p>Didn't u say "if it is
                                          a theory, it cannot be the truth " ? So how come tis is true now
                                          ?</p>

              <p>(Hence its TRUE that gravity exist. Like i said again n again...
                                          it is Science's explaination of WHY Gravity works. The Truth is

              <p>(Even before man has walked the earth, gravity has
                                          existed(Truth). Man has taken advantage of the phenomenon of
                                          gravity, but that time it wasnt called gravity yes ? Science called
                                          it gravity. 17 Jan 5.52pm)</p>
              <p>(Oh.. and i never said Gravity is not the truth. I explicitly

                                          whether science can even quantify it or not YES ? NO ? 18 Jan

              <p>(I did not question the existence of gravity. Again, you put
                                          things in my mouth. 24 Jan 2.51pm)</p>
              <p>(Now, simply, refer to my examples regarding Gravity and Rain

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                                          be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                                          equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                                          article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                          touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0

                                          ? If the following is true, Dividing by 0 gives 0/0 x 1 = 0/0 x 2 .
                                          So simplify, you have 1 = 2 . The fallacy is the implicit
                                          assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation.

                                          ultimate judge to whether our statements are the truth to his
                                          definition or not.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                                          is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                          it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                          body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
                                          same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
                                          be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
                                          still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                                          student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
                                          small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
                                          and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
                                          is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
                                          theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
                                          wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>
              <p>If a scientific hypothesis is proven wrong, does it means all
                                          the established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>

              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
              of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
              "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it
              is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
              truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
              proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
              <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
              call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have said tis many times as well but your only defence is
              "theory of gravity" is "theory of gravity"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sorry I miss tat.</p>
              <p>Why not ? There r overwhelming good apples in the crate. I could
              call it a crate of good apples.</p>
              <p>So do u wanna reply to the questions instead of avoiding
              it  ?</p>
              <p>I am unsure because I do not know. If u can prove a theory tat
              is wrong before, then I will agree with u. Otherwise Theories may
              not be wrong before</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The intellectuals basis is still tat truth is true. And they can
              define it in words. Wat happened to your word "science".</p>
              <p>There is no errors in the maths u had shown. U just shown a
              fallacy which is a misinterpretation</p>
              <p>And human made errors doesn't means they never do the right
              thing. If they do the right things they could be truth</p>
              <p>WHy not ? The graph shows it can be anything.</p>
              <p>Maths make mistake. Not proven</p>
              <p>Established scientific theory/laws make mistake ? Not proven</p>
              <p>Then why do u lie ?</p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Did u ever say Science
              is NEVER about the truth ?</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #888888;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No.</span></strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I already made
              it clear that its about the How and Why , if they stumbled upon the
              truth. Bravo.</strong></span></strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SO your definition of science is different from the english
              speaking world isn't it ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Possibility of human make mistakes doesn't means he made
              mistakes.</p>
              <p>Standing on a high rise building if u believe it is not truth is
              impossibly dangerous. People do take things like lift or high rise
              building for granted as truth and stable. However u use them and
              said they r not truth. Strange isn't it ?</p>

              <p>Like i said, Theory starts with a postulation. Thats why Gravity as Truth, is explained <strong>BY</strong> the Theory <strong>OF </strong>Gravity.  I gues u REALLY are too stupid to understand.</p>

              different dish. U are the one telling me i said its irreplaceable. U
              were just asking me a question, and i was just answering your question.
              What does that have to do with my engine ?</span></p>

              truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
              Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
              the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ?</span></span></p>
              <p>So is the WHY and HOW truth ?</p>
              <p>No I am not u. But your words r all for people to see. Unless
              your english is so bad tat u cannot represent wat u wanna say</p>
              <p>Explained it before, U can refer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did u remember I saying tat if it is proven to be untrue, it is
              not longer science. So science is always a body of truth.</p>
              <p>Reconciled. Now why do u refuse to comment on the point of logic
              for so long ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then your examples, and all other corresponding definition of
              science is just your thinking. And the only thing left to compare
              is the dictionary version which u reject</p>
              <p>U have said science is never truth. How do u know ? So wat is
              wrong with science being created by human ?</p>

                                      <strong>OF</strong> Gravity.  I gues u REALLY are too stupid

              <p>Stupid
              ? Gravity is still a THEORY. U said u do not believe in evolution is
              because it is a theory. Now gravity is a theory and u simply believed
              it to be the truth. Double standard again ?  U said THEORY OF GRAVITY,
              RIGHT ? U said then science cannot tell between truth and false right ?
              Theory of gravity is science domain right ? Then u said science is
              never about truth. SO how come gravity is truth now ? Aren;t u
              contradicting yourself ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
                                      truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
                                      And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
                                      both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
                                      Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                      of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                                      "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it
                                      is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                                      truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                                      proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                                      <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                                      call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u.</p>
              <p> There r other ways to say tis. Gravity is a theory, U said theory r not truth. Gravity in in the domain of science. Since science to u is never about truth, then gravity is not truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  truth has no
                                      scope and can works for all circumstances<br></span></p>
              <p>My ans: When I ask u whether gravity can pull aspiration and
                                      etc, u admit tat truth has a scope. All truth has a limit on where
                                      it works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
                                      NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
                                      finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
                                      about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
                                      truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
                                      Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                                      the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ? I asked u the following, why refuse to answer ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
                                      u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
                                      wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
                                      u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                                      is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
                                      if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
                                      again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
                                      truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                                      be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                                      equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                                      article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                      touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
                                      when I said it could be any value from 0 to
                                      infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                                      meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                                      values. U paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots
                                      will conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat
                                      the 0 in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U
                                      provide an example of mathematics fallacy which really just means a
                                      misrepresentation of maths</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                                      definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                                      wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                      The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                      accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                      it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                      on true and false. So u can never write the right things again

              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ? Why refuse to comment on the above ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                                      definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
                                      knowledge of facts.And no matter who u quote, it is meaningless because u r not the person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                                      is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                      it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                      body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
                                      same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
                                      be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
                                      still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                                      student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
                                      small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
                                      and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
                                      is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
                                      theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
                                      wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>
              <p>If a scientific hypothesis is proven wrong, does it means all
                                      the established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">11) U claimed: It is my version of truth, not yours</span></p>
              <p>My ans: When asked u to define truth, the only thing u came out is "actual existence". However u add in "must work under all situation", "perfect", "all truth cannot be viewed collectively for better understanding" etc. U just keep adding things u like into it. Wat does it show ? No integrity, lier, fickle minded and absurbness.</p>
              <p>Even the philosophers etc can narrow their definition but u can't because u r grammaticaly incapable.</p>

              <p>U wanna continue continue la</p>
              <p>Stupid ? Gravity is still a THEORY. U said u do not believe in
                      evolution is because it is a theory. Now gravity is a theory and u
                      simply believed it to be the truth. Double standard again ?  U
                      said THEORY OF GRAVITY, RIGHT ? U said then science cannot tell
                      between truth and false right ? Theory of gravity is science domain
                      right ? Then u said science is never about truth. SO how come
                      gravity is truth now ? Aren;t u contradicting yourself ?</p>
              <p>Then good. I wonder why u ever bring out tis stupid topic in the
                      first place</p>
              <p>U see u make rubbish statements again. Let me show u</p>
              <p>1) U claim an organisation/people/field makes mistake</p>
              <p>2) Then u ask, if they make mistakes, how could they be
                      truth</p>
              <p>3) U r assuming they make mistakes for EVERYTHING. If they can
                      do right things, why couldn't they be truth ?</p>
              <p>4) Fact is they don't always make mistakes. They can do right
                      things. Thus u cannot conclude they r never about truth</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am human, and so ? U r human too</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The error is u mis-interpreting it. Sorry but tis is the
                      technical term for your mistake. It's called fallacy. It is always
                      true and interprete truth and facts well.Tat is why u r incapable
                      to explaining the meaning of division by zero</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It may taste different, but u yourself said yes it is
                      acceptable. Your analogy about engine say different brand could not
                      be substituted. Howver there r many things tat could be substituted
                      such as brands of evaporated milk etc. So wat does it show ? Your
                      example of engine is really pointless</p>
              <p>Well, I am just pointing to u basic english. U said truth as
                      "actual existence" and it doesn't make u escape from the earlier
                      question. Unless u wanna say u don't mean wat u say and thus a lier
                      ?</p>
              <p>Sure no problem. Two can play tis game</p>
              <p>Then it comes to tis question which u refuse to comment</p>
              <p>If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ? I am afraid not
                      because u claimed 0/0 is logically zero</p>
              <p>U don't care lor. So I said u r delusional, thinking answers to
                      simple questions like why apples fall to the ground is not truth,
                      or how rain comes about is not truth to u. I can't stop u from
                      trying to be stupid right ?</p>
              <p>Sorry to say but they generally have the same definition of
                      truth, which is something true. And they can express their truth in
                      words, u can't because u r grammatically challenged</p>
              <p>Then u can refer to the above</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
              truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
              And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
              both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1
              apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2 apples or 2 oranges).
              If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the equation right and
              talking cock.</p>
              <p>When I asked u wat to state the question which u wana ask for
              the above equation, u refuse to provide it. Why u refuse to provide
              a simple question for your ridiculous example ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
              Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
              of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
              "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it
              is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
              truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
              proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
              <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
              call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u.</p>
              <p> There r other ways to say tis. Gravity is a theory, U said
              theory r not truth. Gravity in in the domain of science. Since
              science to u is never about truth, then gravity is not truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  truth has no
              scope and can works for all circumstances<br></span></p>
              <p>My ans: When I ask u whether gravity can pull aspiration and
              etc, u admit tat truth has a scope. All truth has a limit on where
              it works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
              NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
              finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
              about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
              truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
              Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
              the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ? I asked u the following,
              why refuse to answer ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
              u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
              wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
              u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
              is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
              if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
              again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
              truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
              be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
              equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
              article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
              touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
              when I said it could be any value from 0 to
              infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
              meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
              values. U paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots
              will conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat
              the 0 in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U
              provide an example of mathematics fallacy which really just means a
              misrepresentation of maths</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
              definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
              wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
              The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
              accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
              it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
              on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
              ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
              be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ? Why refuse to
              comment on the above ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
              definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
              knowledge of facts.And no matter who u quote, it is meaningless
              because u r not the person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
              is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
              it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
              body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
              same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
              be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
              still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
              student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
              small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
              and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
              is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
              theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
              wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>
              <p>If a scientific hypothesis is proven wrong, does it means all
              the established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">11) U claimed: It is my version of
              truth, not yours</span></p>
              <p>My ans: When asked u to define truth, the only thing u came out
              is "actual existence". However u add in "must work under all
              situation", "perfect", "all truth cannot be viewed collectively for
              better understanding" etc. U just keep adding things u like into
              it. Wat does it show ? No integrity, lier, fickle minded and
              absurbness.</p>
              <p>Even the philosophers etc can narrow their definition but u
              can't because u r grammaticaly incapable.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats why I believe my statement to be true,

              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
              it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
              body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body
              is the same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease
              to be students one day. However the definition of "student body"
              is still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the

              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
