                  is the one who keep refusing to narrow his definition. But even though u have
                  narrowed down the definition, it is still basically still the same thing. Natural
                  phenomena is a <strong>fact</strong>, occurrence, or
                  circumstance observed or observable. And <strong>fact</strong> is still <strong>truth</strong>. SO after all the
                  hogwash about defining science, u still go back to the same definition. Your
                  description of science is still the dealing with truth.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Oh.. now i need to spoon feed u
                  again ? How about u read it yourself boy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Tat is funny. U claim it support your argument yet refuse to
                  show why. If u refuse to state why they r relevant to your argument, I just
                  have to dismiss it</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: red;">U sure its all true = truth ?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: red;">I think u missed out on the articles that doesnt
                  mention any word true .</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Which one ?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">I mean , if u think they are all
                  bullshit, they all mean UR definition of True = Truth. Go ahead. I got no
                  problem. I dont believe in half of them anyways. They are all different  I
                  got no beef.  U want to believe ur truth , its up to you. I got nothing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Tat is strange. I did not say they r bullshit. I said they
                  treat truth tat is derived from the word true. Did u even read my reply ?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">This proves that u are narrow
                  minded. There is ALL these people trying to define. Tring so damn hard.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It probably show u r narrow minded because the fact is
                  everybody treated true as truth which is something tat is not false</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: red;'>No. Because u r talking about MATH equation in the first part and
                  CHEMISTRY/BIO equation in the second. Why should they be the same ?</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: red;">BRAVO.. U GOT IT... U FINALLY GOT IT! AGAIN !
                  PLEASE.. DONT REVERT BACK TO STUPID AGAIN!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another stupid comment from u. They r different things
                  altogether, of course they should give different outcomes. Hence 1+1 =2 is a
                  truth which u cannot prove wrong</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Did i say all his theory are wrong ? DID I ? YES OR
                  NO ? ALL I SAID WAS, EINSTEIN is Human , he makes mistakes. Thats all. Simple.
                  U just THINK u know what i am talking about but u jump to conclusion. IF u are
                  unsure. Ask.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Are u trying to say he doesnt make mistakes? A
                  mistake is a mistake. It doesnt matter. Even if it is corrected, or no
                  established or accepted theories, he still makes mistakes. Simple as that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Ok. Then I said, even though he made mistakes or human made
                  mistakes, tat doesn’t means science could not come out with truth.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">U are the stupid one that says ZERO to INFINITY.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">I asked u.. DOES IT TOUCH ZERO. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">U SAY NO.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">So .. i look at graph.. i scratch my head. I asked u..
                  YO!  WHERE THE ZERO ?U can say all the bullshit +ve -ve infinity, SURE.. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BUT
                  WHERE IS ZERO. I am confused. U TELL ME!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Is UNDEFINED = VARIABLE ? No ? IF NO THEN WHY DO U TREAT
                  THEM AS THE SAME ? U said it does not cut the graph BUT U ALSO SAID 0/0 is
                  logically ZERO. WHERE DO U GET THE IDEA tat 0/0 is ZERO ? If u think it is
                  stupid, u r laughing at YOURSELF because u suggest tis hilarious answer first.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: red;">Has Theories been wrong before ? YES or NO</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: fuchsia;">Unsure</span></strong>. U still has not
                  given an example of a wrong scientific theory</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: red;">And for someone who based so much of his

              <p><strong><span style="color: red;">U end with an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">UNSURE.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">This has to be the ultimate big BOO BOO in a cross
                  examination so far.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">U are in MY world now stupid. And u talk about me
                  telling lies, and bad grammar , lousy english, substandard understanding of
                  truth and science. U better know ur subject matter well.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">If u are UNSURE, I suggest u SHUT THE
                  FUCK UP, AND SIT THE FUCK DOWN.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">Unless u believe u can understand

                  any answer. Did I said anything wrong ? NOPE. The only charge u can say about

              simple knowledge like water freezes at 0 degrees r real answers and
              thus truth. But then u just deny and deny and try to avoid question etc</span></p>

              if u think u can accept existence of falsehood in your body of truths,

              already in there. It needs to be replaced by a true theory, but even
              that, cant gurantee its correct. It might later be found to be false
              again. So because of that, because of the possibility of falsehood in
              that body of truths, I just cant accept it. Because I KNOW, there are

              they cannot even make a simple statement. I have asked before. Simple
              things like things r pulled to the ground by gravity is a fact and
              truth. Simple things like 1+1=2 is also simple truth, or how water
              freezes at 0 degrees Celsius etc. However u refuse to believe such
              simple things to be truth. It don’t even have to be a complicated
              theory and a simple basic knowledge and fact. But of course u just deny

              it. But for the definition case, u cannot. If u think your statement is

              misunderstandings. But like i said, U DONT WANT MY UNDERSTANDING, U
              WANT MY COMPLIANCE.</span></p>

              is the mistake u said u made ? The only one I see is tat u say u type
              "truth" as "true" a long time ago. After that where else ? Now u said I
              want your compliance, which is really wrong. I want your understanding.
              But wat do u say ? U cannot define the word "science", u cannot define
              "truth" properly then u made a vague encompassing point tat science is
              never about truth and called other people stupid ! U say the dictinary
              is wrong, people who follow dictionary r stupid and cannot think out of
              the box and said 1=1 is not truth. People ask all these to understand
              wat the hell u r saying. But U just don't want people to understand u !</span></span></p>

                                                  though u have narrowed down the definition, it is still basically
                                                  still the same thing. Natural phenomena is a <strong>fact</strong>,
                                                  occurrence, or circumstance observed or observable. And
                                                  <strong>fact</strong> is still <strong>truth</strong>. SO after all
                                                  the hogwash about defining science, u still go back to the same
                                                  definition. Your description of science is still the dealing with
                                                  truth.</p>

              <p>Tat is funny. U claim it support your argument yet
                                                  refuse to show why. If u refuse to state why they r relevant to

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: red;">I think
                                                  u missed out on the articles that doesnt mention any word true

                                                  all bullshit, they all mean UR definition of True = Truth. Go
                                                  ahead. I got no problem. I dont believe in half of them anyways.
                                                  They are all different  I got no beef.  U want to believe
                                                  ur truth , its up to you. I got nothing.</span></p>
              <p>Tat is strange. I did not say they r bullshit. I said
                                                  they treat truth tat is derived from the word true. Did u even read
                                                  my reply ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">This proves that u are narrow
                                                  minded. There is ALL these people trying to define. Tring so damn

              <p>It probably show u r narrow minded because the fact is
                                                  everybody treated true as truth which is something tat is not
                                                  false</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><em><span>No. Because u r

                                                  U GOT IT... U FINALLY GOT IT! AGAIN ! PLEASE.. DONT REVERT BACK TO

              <p> </p>
              <p>Another stupid comment from u. They r different things
                                                  altogether, of course they should give different outcomes. Hence
                                                  1+1 =2 is a truth which u cannot prove wrong</p>

              <p><span style="color: red;">Are u trying to say he doesnt make
                                                  mistakes? A mistake is a mistake. It doesnt matter. Even if it is
                                                  corrected, or no established or accepted theories, he still makes
                                                  mistakes. Simple as that.</span></p>
              <p>Ok. Then I said, even though he made mistakes or human
                                                  made mistakes, tat doesn’t means science could not come out with

                                                  not wish to commit on any answer. Did I said anything wrong ? NOPE.
                                                  The only charge u can say about me is being conservative. So wat

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jeez</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U didnt even give me options to choose my
                                      definition of Science. And u only put one.What u expect me to choose! Obviously my definition of Truth is different from yours, wont it be most probable that I cant accept your Body of Truths ? If u had spoon fed me with a choice of definitions, we wouldnt even be arguing over something supposedly easy to accept and understand like... threads ago ?<br></span></p>
              <p> Is UNDEFINED = VARIABLE ? No ? IF NO THEN WHY DO U TREAT
                                      THEM AS THE SAME ? U said it does not cut the graph BUT U ALSO SAID
                                      0/0 is logically ZERO. WHERE DO U GET THE IDEA tat 0/0 is ZERO ? If u
                                      think it is stupid, u r laughing at YOURSELF because u suggest tis
                                      hilarious answer first.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What u talking about ? I am speaking in a
                                      sense of LOGIC. Nothing which is 0 divides by Nothing which is 0 
                                      = Nothing Logically!</span></p>
              <p>Tat is funny. Why can’t I say unsure ? U did not provide an
                                      example of scientific theory to be wronged then and I do not wish to
                                      commit on any answer. Did I said anything wrong ? NOPE. The only
                                      charge u can say about me is being conservative. So wat ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">SO WHAT ?? Thats not the point, it just means u
                                      dont know about ur subject matter. If u want ur answer to be
                                      conservative and unsure, SAY SO.  But the whole point, is YES or
                                      NO, its something u can discover yourself. U should know. I thought U
                                      really know. Because u talk of science as if u are very well versed.
                                      Hence if u are not sure, please dont say anything. And i dont have to
                                      do this to you.</span></p>
              <p> See it is not tat difficult isn’t it ? Sheesh… I wonder
                                      who is the one who keep refusing to narrow his definition. But even
                                      though u have narrowed down the definition, it is still basically
                                      still the same thing. Natural phenomena is a <strong>fact</strong>,
                                      occurrence, or circumstance observed or observable. And <strong>fact</strong> is still <strong>truth</strong>. SO after all the hogwash about
                                      defining science, u still go back to the same definition. Your
                                      description of science is still the dealing with truth.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now FACT is TRUTH ? DO u want to add
                                      anything else ? I am  sure u can replace my Truth with Absolute
                                      Existence, why dont u do that ? Natural Phenomen = Absolute
                                      Existence. So whats the problem ?</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tat
                                      is again silly. U KNOW WHO IS THE ONE TAT WANT TO BE DEFINITIVE ABOUT
                                      TIS ? U. U ask me to give a YES or NO answer to your question on the
                                      crate. Now u state tat we shouldn’t answer so definitively when u
                                      force people to give a definitive answer ? Isn't it your answer tat u
                                      will NOT call a crate with good apples as good apples. </span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">U could have just
                                      said NO. And tell me WHY. Thats it. U can say YES . Its not a trick
                                      question. The cross examination is just to see where u stand. How ur
                                      mind thinks. And we work out the differences and misunderstandings.
                                      Your intentions. Thats it. Its NOT A TRICK QUESTION. ITs a simple YES or NO question. No spin, no tricks , no part questions within a question.. NADA. All my questions
                                      are not even trick questions. They are just to discern what u believe
                                      and ur character thats all! And regards to the Crate of Good apples, isnt it OBVIOUS to me that my answer is NO.. i wont call it a crate of good apples ? U can accept rotten apples inside and still dub it as crate of good apples, i got no beef with it. It just shows me what u percieve as e.g Body of Truths. Simple. Not a trick question.<br></span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wat
                                      is the mistake u said u made ? The only one I see is tat u say u type
                                      "truth" as "true" a long time ago. After that
                                      where else ? Now u said I want your compliance, which is really
                                      wrong. I want your understanding. But wat do u say ? U cannot define
                                      the word "science", u cannot define "truth"
                                      properly then u made a vague encompassing point tat science is
                                      never about truth and called other people stupid ! U say
                                      the dictinary is wrong, people who follow dictionary r stupid and
                                      cannot think out of the box and said 1=1 is not truth. People ask all
                                      these to understand wat the hell u r saying. But U just
                                      don't want people to understand u !</span> </span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What u talking
                                      about ? We agreed and disagreed in a few things. Whats wrong with
                                      that ? Didnt u explain and I explain ? I am fully aware of ur
                                      understanding, just that like “zero to infinity” it makes no
                                      sense ! So is it ZERO or is it NOT ? Because you have contradictory
                                      statements ! I am really scratching my head, wondering which is the
                                      one u mean! </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The main point, is u say u are UNSURE about
                                      ur own subject matter. End of the day , u just cant tell me jack
                                      shit. All this rubbish u been spouting, now doesnt mean anything. The
                                      basic fundamental is “U just dont know ur subject” I asked u a
                                      simple question. YES or NO.. u even gave me UNSURE, I didnt even
                                      expect that. I admit. Being conservative pretty much means u are
                                      being chicken to answer. Means u dont even know. The sheer simple
                                      matter is, u dont know.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Its like u coming telling me u are
                                      mechanic,then I ask u, can cars run on petrol ? U say unsure. If u
                                      dont know, n u tell me all about cars, I will think u are all about
                                      cock n bull. U gottta stand my shoes and try to understand why <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I
                                      just felt... insulted this whole time, thinking I was talking to

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence there is
                                      even a possibility that you are spewing rubbish out of ur ass! </span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am speechless.
                                      Really.. I feel insulted. I think in the end of the day, whatever u say is useless ,unless u really know what u are talking about , u better keep your

              <p>Anyways,</p>
              <p>Have a good read about <a href="http://www.firstscience.com/home/articles/big-theories/can-science-reveal-the-truth-page-1-1_60242.html">Truths</a>. &lt;---- this excerpt. Doesnt say ANYTHING about science =Truth.</p>
              <p><a href="http://plusroot.com/dbook/23TruthDef.html">This one too.</a> &lt;------ In the plus definition system, the term truth refers to: that quality which
              true propositions hold in common. Because the <em>word</em> truth also has
              numerous other meanings in philosophy, plus analysis uses the term impartial
              truth to refer to truth as defined in the plus system. In the present context,
              truth and impartial truth are equivalent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yours is what encompasses true propositions hold in common.</span></p>
              <p>Even Impartial Truth , the <strong>Objectivity</strong> is both a central and elusive concept in philosophy.
              While there is no universally accepted articulation of objectivity, a
              proposition is generally considered to be objectively true when its
              truth conditions are "mind-independent"—that is, not the result of any
              judgments made by a conscious entity. Contrary to this, most recent
              philosophers, since the Critique of Pure Reason (1781) by Immanuel
              Kant, have concluded that scientific knowledge is systematic knowledge
              of the nature of things as we perceive them rather than they are in
              themselves.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.staceylawson.com/2007/12/truth-that-cannot-be-told.html">Read here too.</a> &lt;--- that is TRUTH in Silence. I admit, its not even mine or ur definition of truth, but it sure as hell is some form of Truth!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There are many truths about truths, and thats the TRUTH!</strong></span><br> <br> -Truth is found, not invented. It is there, independent from whether
              people believe in it or not (Gravity existed before Newton).<br> - The truth is true for all. (Regardless of the person, 2 +2 = 4)<br> - All the truth is absolute. Even the truths that affect to be relative
              are really absolute. "I was warm 10th of June in 2008" may affect the
              relative, but it is true for everyone, everywhere that I got the
              feeling of warmth in 10th of June, 2008.<br> - The truth does not change with it what we believe. If the whole world believes that cows can fly, it is still not the truth.<br> - Beliefs can not alter facts, regardless of how sincerely one believes in something.<br> <br> A few phrases that you hear too often (and a brief counter question, which explains why they are just rhetorical nonsense).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">That is just but a few meanings of Truths. All iam saying is, there are possibilities. Thats all. IS it so hard  to accept POSSIBILITIES ?</span></p>

Even the truths that affect to be relative are really absolute. "I was warm 10th of June in 2008" may affect the relative, but it is true for everyone, everywhere that I got the feeling of warmth in 10th of June, 2008.<br>- The truth does not change with it what we believe.

Its not a trick question. The cross examination is just to see where u stand. How ur mind thinks. And we work out the differences and misunderstandings. Your intentions. Thats it. Its NOT A TRICK QUESTION. ITs a simple YES or NO question. No spin, no tricks , no part questions within a question.. NADA. All my questions are not even trick questions. They are just to discern what u believe and ur character thats all! And regards to the Crate of Good apples, isnt it OBVIOUS to me that my answer is NO.. i wont call it a crate of good apples ? U can accept rotten apples inside and still dub it as crate of good apples, i got no beef with it. It just shows me what u percieve as e.g Body of Truths. Simple. Not a trick question.</span><span lang="EN-US"></span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And I could have said “don’t know” and said my reasons as well. It is a trick question. U think things as only black and white, yes or no but in actual fact things could be in shades of grey.

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And again u made a fallacy here.

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">The main point, is u say u are UNSURE about ur own subject matter. End of the day , u just cant tell me jack shit. All this rubbish u been spouting, now doesnt mean anything. The basic fundamental is “U just dont know ur subject” I asked u a simple question. YES or NO.. u even gave me UNSURE, I didnt even expect that. I admit. Being conservative pretty much means u are being chicken to answer. Means u dont even know.

              <p><span>How about tis reply ? U seems to conveniently forget about it<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span>Ya ? But I got a problem with yours and thus ask u to clarify. Up till now u refuse to do it. And as said before, your maserati example is just bad</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Its a perfect example. But u are just too stupid to understand it. The engine. The core. The heart of the car.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Perfect example ? Wat is the link between “truth” and engine then ? I don’t see the connection here. And there r things tat could be replaceable and things tat could not be replaceable. Most people will not mind eating kway teow instead of noodles or drinking different brand of milk. But of course, u r too stupid to realize tat your example is silly</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Clarify ? I clarified with examples of 1+1 , Gravity, science able to be wrong... etc. But i guess as usual, u interprete it the way u do. So whats the point ? So be it.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The example of 1+1 is wrong and u keep insisting gravity is truth. Of course to a person who just keep denying, even basic knowledge is false to u</span></p>
              <p><em><span>Tis is rubbish again. I said before the graph show x could be –ve infinity to + infinity. And 0 is between these values. U r thinking like a primary school kid tat is why u expect the graph to cut. I did not make a mistake here, it is just u refuse to accept the answer</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">IS ZERO =  ZERO +ve , -ve. YES OR NO?  U know, pulling answers ouf o ur ass is one thing, not admitting to a mistake is another.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Is zero between +ve infinity and –ve infinity ? Of course again u try to deny and refuse to answer questions in its entirely. And do u know who is the first person who says tat 0/0 is logically zero ? It is u. So u must be pulling answers from your ass</span></p>
              <p><em><span>Tat again is another loop made by u. Science had stated facts which u cannot reject. They stated 1+1=2. They stated gravity. They stated water freezes at 0 degree. R u gonna say these r not truth</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">What loop ?Science explaines the  How and Why . Truth is there. So whats the problem ? Please.. enlighten me.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As said before, any real answer to a question is truth. If u asked whether I slept last night and I answered an honest yes, tat answer is already the truth. So the answer to how and why like why is there rain and simple knowledge like water freezes at 0 degrees r real answers and thus truth. But then u just deny and deny and try to avoid question etc</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="color: red;">But if u think u can accept existence of falsehood in your body of truths, then I got nothing to say. It doesnt negate the effect of falsehood already in there. It needs to be replaced by a true theory, but even that, cant gurantee its correct. It might later be found to be false again. So because of that, because of the possibility of falsehood in that body of truths, I just cant accept it. Because I KNOW, there are definitely falsehood. But if u dont, good on you.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The loop is really u saying tat there r no truth in science at all, and tat they cannot even make a simple statement. I have asked before. Simple things like things r pulled to the ground by gravity is a fact and truth. Simple things like 1+1=2 is also simple truth, or how water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius etc. However u refuse to believe such simple things to be truth. It don’t even have to be a complicated theory and a simple basic knowledge and fact. But of course u just deny tat these simple facts r even true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Well.. let me guess, even when i defined it, u TOO create the loop by saying i never defined it. So why bother ? Right ? Since u are ALWAYS SO RIGHT.. n PERFECT.</span><span>*clap clap*</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u defined it, then I will stop the loop. Simple right ? When I say u start a loop. It is because I have answerd your points but u just avoid it. But for the definition case, u cannot. If u think your statement is so full of sense, then u should just give a proper definition to it. But u refused. So it is obvious u really is just talking cock</span></p>
              <p><em><span>U said before tat Richard Feynman had a different definition of science. U and I r not Richard Feynman. Then we cannot conclude wat is his view on science r. So u cannot show any other definition of science available other than the dictionary. Thus science is a body of truth</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">U think its body of truths.. please.. by all means. U and I are not Richard Feynman, he is the ultimate judge to that truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ya lor. Then it still go back to the fact tat the accepted definition of science is still body of truth. U never manage to show anybody with opposing views to tis</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">O REALLY... is 1+1 = 2 and 1 Sperm + 1 Ovum = 1 Fertilised egg  are same ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 72pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Please.. enlighten me again.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Wat do u wanna find in the first place before u start the calculation ? Surely u must have logical problem or question at hand before u apply the solution right ? Otherwise u r really just talking cock</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">OH SO NOW THEY ARE FALLACIES... and i made WRONG interpretation of it. BRAVO !! BRAVO !!!</span> <span><span style="color: red;">Please... enlighten me on my supposedly WRONG interpretation to it. SHOW ME.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U mean on the definition of fallacy ? U can check the dictionary which states tat fallacy: <span> </span></span><span>a misleading or unsound argument</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Oh.. so now they are 2 different things... hahaha...  i thought u said 0/0 can be ANYTHING. Please, check urself, or this one will really bite u in the ass REAL BAD.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">A fallacy IS fallacy. U can pull ur ass out n say 0/0 on inside is ANYTHING, 0/0 on one side can be another ANYTHING, in the end of the day, THAT fallacy if i simplify it simply, i can prove 1 = 2.  But i guess again, U R RIGHT.. I AM TOTALLY WRONG in my algebra.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Another logic flaw of yours</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It could be anything</span></span></p>

              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However it don’t have to be a variable. It can be anything</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So your argument is still wrong because it could be anything other than a variable and thus my equation is not wrong</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So again u made another fallacy and mis-interprete by providing unsound arguments.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">lol... u sure ? U better be sure with ur above statement corresponds with X on one sides can equal one thing, and X on the other side can be another in the same equation.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yes I am sure. And U r still treating 0/0 as a defined variable and u r just too stupid to realize tat.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">For someone who supposedly doesnt understand my "english" and "bad grammar" , i hope u can understand things written by others. But as usual, u will dismiss it, like theories, truths and science.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Well so u admit u plagarise right ? And u cannot come out with your arguments isn’t it ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">My view is stated  pages n pages before. Its very obvios its cut n paste with different fonts.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then why not have the courtesy to quote where u take it from ? I guess u did state your view long long ago. Science is never about the truth right ? Even your article do not support tat fact</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">WOW.. so your logic is superior ? So IF MAN makes mistakes, Einstein is a man, and Einstein makes mistakes is NOT logic ? U want me to show u that Einstein makes mistakes ? Do u ? Are u going to cut off ur left nut ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Did u not understand your fallacy ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>o<span>   </span></span></span> <span>1)</span> <span>Men made mistake</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span>2)</span> <span>Einstien is man</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span>3)</span> <span>So u conclude Einstein made mistake</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 72pt;"><span>The problem is,</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span>1)</span> <span>Men don’t always make mistake. They can do the right things</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span>2)</span> <span>Einstein don’t always make mistakes and can do the right things</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span>3)</span> <span>We cannot conclude Einstein is wrong with his theories. He may have come out with truth</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 72pt;"><span>He is human. But u r just using fallacy to hide your flawed logic</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So u made a stereotype. U said Einstein make mistake, which I agree. But I do not agree tat his theories which r well established and accepted r mistakes. But to u, it is because he made mistakes before. Again shows your stereotype</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span>And it do include communicating the idea to other peers. Unlike u, I will agree I make a mistake. But u think u r always right and tat u refuse to acknowledge tat your definition of the words is so wrong</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">WOW.. FINALLY.. U ADMIT U WILL MAKE A MISTAKE. Took u QUITE a while didnt it ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U still have not shown me where u get the definition from. The question will be better if u did not plagarise and stick the right source u get it from.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">So.. I NEED to follow a school of thought ? I cant have my OWN brain to decide on which are the ones i should adopt and which are the ones i dont ?  U know, dictionary.com , u can treat it as ur bible . I , choose to absorb all information and disseminate it myself and come up with my own conclusion.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Truth is Truth = Actual Existence. But again u just too stupid</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">True = True</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Whats so hard ? I already stated, clearly, with examples, fitting my description of what is true may not be the truth. U understood, but u just want to apply UR definition of TRUTH into my belief. So u ARE stupid. U know it cant work, but u keep insiting it.</span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The very basic thing to do is simply define it properly, which is something u refuse. If u say u come from your own school of thought, then surely u must tell wat it is about right ? And I did not treat the dictionary as a bible. I treat it as dictionary. The standard way of using English vocabulary and words.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u say it is actual existence, then u have to answer many questions which u avoided before.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Do u agree tat a collective collection of truth studied together can enhance the understanding of the subject ?</span></span></em></p>
              <p><span><span>o<span>   </span></span></span> <em><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2) If it is not the truth, it is not true.</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><em><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><em><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">b) false is not true</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><em><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is a simple logic.</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Can u explain why the above does not apply to u ?</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Why do u claim tat truth like 1+1 must work for all circumstances according to your definition? Why can’t it be true in a certain snapshot make it truth ?</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Exactly, if there is grey.. U SAY ITS GREY. If its BLACK.. u SAY ITS BLACK.. if its WHITE.. u SAY ITS WHITE.  U dont say something that is NOT.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Thats why, if u cant gurantee me a crate of GOOD APPLES, u tell me its Crate of MOSTLY good apples, i accept. Of course. So what if i am specific. What if i am down to the detail.  It gets me get the job done. It gets me to identify affidavits and testimonies that are no exact, to find flaws and intentions. I expect my oil tanker to come with 27300 litres. But because they said 27300 litres  with a variance of +- 0.05%, i accept. But just dont tell me its 100% 27300 litres of AGO product.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tat is again silly. U KNOW WHO IS THE ONE TAT WANT TO BE DEFINITIVE ABOUT TIS ? U. U ask me to give a <span style="color: red;">YES or NO</span> answer to your question on the crate. Now u state tat we shouldn’t answer so definitively when u force people to give a definitive answer ? Isn't it your answer tat u will NOT call a crate with good apples as good apples. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I gave the answer of unsure then. To u, U gave the answer tat is must never be called a crate of good apples. U sure really use a lot of fallacies</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Since when i said i was not human ? I was the one saying i am human. I make mistakes. I admit my mistakes. Explaination was given to clear any misunderstandings. But like i said, U DONT WANT MY UNDERSTANDING, U WANT MY COMPLIANCE.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wat is the mistake u said u made ? The only one I see is tat u say u type "truth" as "true" a long time ago. After that where else ? Now u said I want your compliance, which is really wrong. I want your understanding. But wat do u say ? U cannot define the word "science", u cannot define "truth" properly then u made a vague encompassing point tat science is never about truth and called other people stupid ! U say the dictinary is wrong, people who follow dictionary r stupid and cannot think out of the box and said 1=1 is not truth. People ask all these to understand wat the hell u r saying. But U just don't want people to understand u !</span></span></p>

              &lt;---- this excerpt. Doesnt say ANYTHING about science
              =Truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It also doesn’t say tat science is not

              definition system, the term truth refers to: that quality which
              true propositions hold in common. Because the <em><span>word</span></em> truth also has numerous other meanings in
              philosophy, plus analysis uses the term impartial truth to refer to
              truth as defined in the plus system. In the present context, truth
              and impartial truth are equivalent. Yours is what encompasses true
              propositions hold in common.</span></span></p>

              common, that is, they are all true. Figuring this out is so easy,

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Your article treat true as truth as
              well.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: red;">that is TRUTH in
              Silence. I admit, its not even mine or ur definition of truth, but
              it sure as hell is some form of Truth!</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: red;">Truth is found,
              not invented. It is there, independent from whether people believe
              in it or not (Gravity existed before Newton).<br> - The truth is true for all. (Regardless of the person, 2 +2 =
              4)<br> - All the truth is absolute. Even the truths that affect to be
              relative are really absolute. "I was warm 10th of June in 2008" may
              affect the relative, but it is true for everyone, everywhere that I
              got the feeling of warmth in 10th of June, 2008.<br> - The truth does not change with it what we believe. If the whole
              world believes that cows can fly, it is still not the truth.<br> - Beliefs can not alter facts, regardless of how sincerely one
              believes in something.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">They r not really relevant to the current
              topic anyway. All the above quotes doesn’t means science cannot
              state truth</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span>There are many truths about truths, and thats the
              TRUTH!</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">That is just but a few meanings of Truths. All iam

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However the basic idea is tat it must still
              be linked with “true” and “false”.</span></p>

              possibility, then it isn’t hard to accept tat science do states

                      of Science. And u only put one.What u expect me to choose!
                      Obviously my definition of Truth is different from yours, wont it
                      be most probable that I cant accept your Body of Truths ? If u had
                      spoon fed me with a choice of definitions, we wouldnt even be
                      arguing over something supposedly easy to accept and understand
                      like... threads ago ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Is your definition of
                      science, why should I provide options for u to choose ? U wanna me
                      so spoon feed u with your own definition of words ? Rubbish
                      !</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">What u talking about ? I am speaking in a sense of
                      LOGIC. Nothing which is 0 divides by Nothing which is 0  =
                      Nothing Logically!</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Another rubbish statement.
                      There is no logic in dividing by zero. If u think it is logical,
                      then show me where it cuts the graph !</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">SO WHAT ?? Thats not the point, it just means u dont
                      know about ur subject matter. If u want ur answer to be
                      conservative and unsure, SAY SO.  But the whole point, is YES
                      or NO, its something u can discover yourself. U should know. I
                      thought U really know. Because u talk of science as if u are very
                      well versed. Hence if u are not sure, please dont say anything. And
                      i dont have to do this to you.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As said, I am being
                      conservative. Did I say anything wrong ? Nope. I am just letting u
                      do some research on your own instead of me spoonfeeding u and
                      telling u all the answers and read all your stupid
                      articles</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Now FACT is TRUTH ? DO u want to add anything else ?
                      I am  sure u can replace my Truth with Absolute Existence, why
                      dont u do that ? Natural Phenomen = Absolute Existence. So whats
                      the problem ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Is tat so hard to believe ?
                      Look at the dictionary</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>a truth
                      known by actual experience or observation; something known to be
                      true</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>something
                      that actually exists; reality; truth</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>something
                      said to be true or supposed to have happened</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So wat is the problem ? Your
                      definition still give the same idea tat science is a body of truth.
                      It is just explaining the same term in another
                      way</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">U could
                      have just said NO. And tell me WHY. Thats it. U can say YES . Its
                      not a trick question. The cross examination is just to see where u
                      stand. How ur mind thinks. And we work out the differences and
                      misunderstandings. Your intentions. Thats it. Its NOT A TRICK
                      QUESTION. ITs a simple YES or NO question. No spin, no tricks , no
                      part questions within a question.. NADA. All my questions are not
                      even trick questions. They are just to discern what u believe and
                      ur character thats all! And regards to the Crate of Good apples,
                      isnt it OBVIOUS to me that my answer is NO.. i wont call it a crate
                      of good apples ? U can accept rotten apples inside and still dub it
                      as crate of good apples, i got no beef with it. It just shows me
                      what u percieve as e.g Body of Truths. Simple. Not a trick
                      question.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And I could have said “don’t
                      know” and said my reasons as well. It is a trick question. U think
                      things as only black and white, yes or no but in actual fact things
                      could be in shades of grey. When u start asking these questions, u
                      already show your thinking tat everything is either yes or
                      no.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And again u made a fallacy
                      here. Even if I said “yes” about apples, it doesn’t means science
                      is not “truth”. I have said before. Of a hypothesis is wrong, it is
                      remove from science and it is still truth</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">What u
                      talking about ? We agreed and disagreed in a few things. Whats
                      wrong with that ? Didnt u explain and I explain ? I am fully aware
                      of ur understanding, just that like “zero to infinity” it makes no
                      sense ! So is it ZERO or is it NOT ? Because you have contradictory
                      statements ! I am really scratching my head, wondering which is the
                      one u mean!</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U said we agree but I never
                      say we do. I told u liao, the answer is for undefined value but in
                      your case u r thinking like a variable. If it cuts the graph, then
                      it is already defined. U do not understand at all. And as said
                      before, it can be anything. Isn’t tis already mentioned many times
                      ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">The main point, is u say u are UNSURE about ur own
                      subject matter. End of the day , u just cant tell me jack shit. All
                      this rubbish u been spouting, now doesnt mean anything. The basic
                      fundamental is “U just dont know ur subject” I asked u a simple
                      question. YES or NO.. u even gave me UNSURE, I didnt even expect
                      that. I admit. Being conservative pretty much means u are being
                      chicken to answer. Means u dont even know. The sheer simple matter
                      is, u dont know.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The only thing u managed to
                      show is simply I did not give u an answer u desire. U ask something
                      very vague and expect me to come out with a black and white answer.
                      I simply refuse and u kick up a fuss over it. Childish isn’t it
                      ?</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And u did not answered all
                      the points which I pointed out before. Why do u so selective
                      answering ?</span></span></p>

You already claim science  = Body of Truths, but yet u are UNSURE about the theories, so how the FUCK can u even think its Body of Truths ?That means u accept falsity in your body of Truths , thats why i CANNOT accept body of truths to contain Falsity.

              <p><em><span>Ya ? But I got a problem with yours and thus ask u to

              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Its a perfect example. But u are
                  just too stupid to understand it. The engine. The core. The heart
                  of the car.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Perfect
                  example ? Wat is the link between “truth” and engine then ? I don’t
                  see the connection here. And there r things tat could be
                  replaceable and things tat could not be replaceable. Most people
                  will not mind eating kway teow instead of noodles or drinking
                  different brand of milk. But of course, u r too stupid to realize
                  tat your example is silly</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Clarify ? I clarified with examples of 1+1 , Gravity,
                  science able to be wrong... etc. But i guess as usual, u interprete
                  it the way u do. So whats the point ? So be it.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The example of 1+1 is wrong and u keep
                  insisting gravity is truth. Of course to a person who just keep
                  denying, even basic knowledge is false to u</span></p>
              <p><em><span>Tis is rubbish again. I said before the graph show x
                  could be –ve infinity to + infinity. And 0 is between these values.
                  U r thinking like a primary school kid tat is why u expect the
                  graph to cut. I did not make a mistake here, it is just u refuse to
                  accept the answer</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">IS ZERO =  ZERO +ve , -ve. YES OR NO?  U
                  know, pulling answers ouf o ur ass is one thing, not admitting to a
                  mistake is another.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Is zero between +ve infinity and –ve
                  infinity ? Of course again u try to deny and refuse to answer
                  questions in its entirely. And do u know who is the first person
                  who says tat 0/0 is logically zero ? It is u. So u must be pulling
                  answers from your ass</span></p>
              <p><em><span>Tat again is another loop made by u. Science had
                  stated facts which u cannot reject. They stated 1+1=2. They stated

                  r not truth</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">What loop ?Science explaines the  How and Why .
                  Truth is there. So whats the problem ? Please.. enlighten
                  me.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As said before, any real answer to a
                  question is truth. If u asked whether I slept last night and I
                  answered an honest yes, tat answer is already the truth. So the
                  answer to how and why like why is there rain and simple knowledge
                  like water freezes at 0 degrees r real answers and thus truth. But
                  then u just deny and deny and try to avoid question etc</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="color: red;">But if u think u can accept existence of falsehood in
                  your body of truths, then I got nothing to say. It doesnt negate
                  the effect of falsehood already in there. It needs to be replaced
                  by a true theory, but even that, cant gurantee its correct. It
                  might later be found to be false again. So because of that, because
                  of the possibility of falsehood in that body of truths, I just cant
                  accept it. Because I KNOW, there are definitely falsehood. But if u
                  dont, good on you.</span></strong></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The loop is really u saying tat there r no
                  truth in science at all, and tat they cannot even make a simple
                  statement. I have asked before. Simple things like things r pulled
                  to the ground by gravity is a fact and truth. Simple things like
                  1+1=2 is also simple truth, or how water freezes at 0 degrees
                  Celsius etc. However u refuse to believe such simple things to be
                  truth. It don’t even have to be a complicated theory and a simple
                  basic knowledge and fact. But of course u just deny tat these
                  simple facts r even true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Well.. let me guess, even when i defined it, u TOO
                  create the loop by saying i never defined it. So why bother ? Right
                  ? Since u are ALWAYS SO RIGHT.. n PERFECT.</span><span>*clap
                  clap*</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u defined it, then I will stop the loop.
                  Simple right ? When I say u start a loop. It is because I have
                  answerd your points but u just avoid it. But for the definition
                  case, u cannot. If u think your statement is so full of sense, then
                  u should just give a proper definition to it. But u refused. So it
                  is obvious u really is just talking cock</span></p>
              <p><em><span>U said before tat Richard Feynman had a different
                  definition of science. U and I r not Richard Feynman. Then we
                  cannot conclude wat is his view on science r. So u cannot show any
                  other definition of science available other than the dictionary.
                  Thus science is a body of truth</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">U think its body of truths.. please.. by all means. U
                  and I are not Richard Feynman, he is the ultimate judge to that

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ya lor. Then it still go back to the fact
                  tat the accepted definition of science is still body of truth. U

                  check the dictionary which states tat fallacy:
                  <span> </span></span><span>a misleading or unsound
                  argument</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Oh.. so
                  now they are 2 different things... hahaha...  i thought u said
                  0/0 can be ANYTHING. Please, check urself, or this one will really
                  bite u in the ass REAL BAD.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">A fallacy
                  IS fallacy. U can pull ur ass out n say 0/0 on inside is ANYTHING,
                  0/0 on one side can be another ANYTHING, in the end of the day,
                  THAT fallacy if i simplify it simply, i can prove 1 = 2.  But
                  i guess again, U R RIGHT.. I AM TOTALLY WRONG in my
                  algebra.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Another logic flaw of
                  yours</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It could be
                  anything</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So u claimed it could be
                  variable</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However it don’t have to
                  be a variable. It can be anything</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So your argument is still
                  wrong because it could be anything other than a variable and thus
                  my equation is not wrong</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So again u made another fallacy and
                  mis-interprete by providing unsound arguments.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">lol... u
                  sure ? U better be sure with ur above statement corresponds with X
                  on one sides can equal one thing, and X on the other side can be
                  another in the same equation.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yes I am sure. And U r still treating 0/0
                  as a defined variable and u r just too stupid to realize

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">My view

                  where u take it from ? I guess u did state your view long long ago.
                  Science is never about the truth right ? Even your article do not

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">WOW.. so
                  your logic is superior ? So IF MAN makes mistakes, Einstein is a

                  that Einstein makes mistakes ? Do u ? Are u going to cut off ur

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 72pt;"><span>The problem

              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span>3)</span> <span>We cannot
                  conclude Einstein is wrong with his theories. He may have come out
                  with truth</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 72pt;"><span>He is human. But u r
                  just using fallacy to hide your flawed logic</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So u made a stereotype. U said Einstein
                  make mistake, which I agree. But I do not agree tat his theories
                  which r well established and accepted r mistakes. But to u, it is
                  because he made mistakes before. Again shows your
                  stereotype</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span>And it do include
                  communicating the idea to other peers. Unlike u, I will agree I
                  make a mistake. But u think u r always right and tat u refuse to
                  acknowledge tat your definition of the words is so

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U still have not shown me where u get the

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">So.. I
                  NEED to follow a school of thought ? I cant have my OWN brain to
                  decide on which are the ones i should adopt and which are the ones
                  i dont ?  U know, dictionary.com , u can treat it as ur bible
                  . I , choose to absorb all information and disseminate it myself
                  and come up with my own conclusion.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Truth is

                  stupid</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">True =

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Whats so
                  hard ? I already stated, clearly, with examples, fitting my
                  description of what is true may not be the truth. U understood, but
                  u just want to apply UR definition of TRUTH into my belief. So u
                  ARE stupid. U know it cant work, but u keep insiting

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The very basic thing to do is simply define
                  it properly, which is something u refuse. If u say u come from your

                  right ? And I did not treat the dictionary as a bible. I treat it
                  as dictionary. The standard way of using English vocabulary and

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u say it is actual existence, then u

                  answer tat u will NOT call a crate with good apples as good

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I gave the answer of unsure then. To u, U

                  your compliance, which is really wrong. I want your understanding.
                  But wat do u say ? U cannot define the word "science", u cannot
                  define "truth" properly then u made a vague encompassing point
                  tat science is never about truth and called other people
                  stupid ! U say the dictinary is wrong, people who follow
                  dictionary r stupid and cannot think out of the box and said 1=1 is
                  not truth. People ask all these to understand wat the hell u r

                              facts. A lot of times, the dictionary just explain some ideas similar but in a
                              different way. Or r u really dumb tat u refuse to see the underlying and
                              physical meaning of the message but just look for key words ?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

                              NO. There is more excerpts then just that line, explaining the IDEA of truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Then r u sure then wat is true may not be the truth ? The
                              message above explains tat the word truth is simply derived from “true”</p>

                              Because u talk of science as if u are very well versed. Hence if u are not

                              reason why I said unsure is because I am conservative and wanna safeguard
                              myself by giving a non committal answer. However u draw stupid conclusions from
                              it and use it as though it is something remarkable. Is tat your best attack

                              link to your question about truth. Wat is the link ? No link. U r just talking rubbish
                              all the way</p>

                              are different. That is the core of our beliefs. All the cosmetics sure, u can
                              add the mirror , ur 4 spoke wheels into my 5 spoke wheel. But the ENGINE&gt;.
                              the CORE... is different. Hell its going to look wierd , but the engine wont

                              inside and still dub it as crate of good apples, i got no beef with it. It just
                              shows me what u percieve as e.g Body of Truths. Simple. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'>Not a trick question.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Just limiting the answer is assuming tat everything must be
                              in black and white, and not grey. Is everything in black and white ? Could there
                              be shades of grey ? In <strong>fact u r

                              these already trick questions ?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">And again u made another fallacy here. How I treat a crate
                              of apples doesn’t mean I treat the same to a body of truth. These r completely
                              2 different issues altogether. If I use your examples, a “crate f good apples”
                              is like a Hyundai while “body of truth” is like Maserati. Could I put Hyundai
                              engine into Maserati ?</p>

                  record truth and facts. A lot of times, the dictionary just explain
                  some ideas similar but in a different way. Or r u really dumb tat u
                  refuse to see the underlying and physical meaning of the message

              <p><span style="color: red;">Are u sure it treats true to

                  theories, so how the FUCK can u even think its Body of Truths ?That
                  means u accept falsity in your body of Truths , thats why i CANNOT
                  accept body of truths to contain Falsity. Simple.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;"> </span></p>
              <p>Why should I play your stupid game ? I chose to answer
                  “don’t know” is my freedom. And u r picking on it because I say
                  “don’t know” ? Wow why must u force people to follow your rule ?
                  Did u give me money ?</p>
              <p>Second, your question is really stupid. It is like
                  asking if I see a glass of water filled almost to the brim, will I
                  say it is a full glass of water or not ? Now if I say yes, which is
                  probably wat most people will say, u said I have bad standard and
                  tat it is not full because it is not filled to the brim. If I say
                  No, then u will say I am unreasonable and tat most people will call
                  it full. So wat do u expect me to say ? If u think it is not a
                  trick question, then u reply yes or no to the question</p>
              <p>A glass of water is fill up 90% and almost to the brim.
                  DO u call it a full glass of water ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">So.. they are still two
                  different dish. Its no longer MEE pok.. and no longer KWAY TEOW if
                  its not KWAY TEOW in it.So tell me. Does it NOT taste different ?
                  IS IT NOT a different dish as i answered ? So whats the problem ?
                  Unlike u, i dont READ into your trick question. And some of your
                  questions are not EVEN questions.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U said most people will accept it as the same yourself.
                  U really talk cock, talk about other stupid things like engine and
                  expect it to link to your question about truth. Wat is the link ?
                  No link. U r just talking rubbish all the way</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Your definition of Truth and
                  mine are different. That is the core of our beliefs. All the
                  cosmetics sure, u can add the mirror , ur 4 spoke wheels into my 5
                  spoke wheel. But the ENGINE&gt;. the CORE... is different. Hell its
                  going to look wierd , but the engine wont run, and it will look
                  like a bad piece of junk.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And so wat has it got to do with truth ? engine is an
                  engine, a car is a a car and your truth is different from all
                  tis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">OH.. so NOTHING which is 0
                  divides by NOTHING which is 0 LOGICALLY.. EQUALS WHAT ? U TELL ME..
                  tell me now. What does NOTHING divide by NOTHING logically. TELL ME
                  ?AM I TALKING MATHEMATICS ? OR AM I TALKING LOGIC HERE. WHAT IS THE
                  ANSWER LOGICALLY ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Logically it means undefined. But u give the stupid
                  answer of zero. Can u even tell me wat is division by zero ? U
                  CANNOT EVEN GIVE ME THE LOGICAL MEANING OF IT. And u just keep
                  ignoring tis question. Tis is just stupid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">I got no problem again with your logic.</span></span> <span style="color: red;">Did I say ur logic is wrong
                  ?</span></strong> <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">What else
                  do I need to comment ?</span></span></strong></em> <strong><span style="color: red;">U said ur logic cannot apply to
                  my phrase, then so be it. Its YOUR logic. NOT MINE. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am not trying to get u to fit my
                  Maserati engine part into your Hyundai
                  engine.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tat is very strange, u spell truth as T.R.U.T.H and I
                  spell it as T.R.U.T.H. If tat logic does not apply to your truth,
                  then obviously u have to elaborate.</p>
              <p>1)U said truth is “actual existence”.</p>
              <p>2) If a statement is not based on “actual existence”,
                  it is false.</p>
              <p>3) If it is false, it is not true.</p>
              <p>Then your stupid statement about wat is true may not be
                  the truth is rubbish because if it is not the truth, it cannot be
                  true as well</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">U could have just said NO.
                  And tell me WHY. Thats it. U can say YES . Its not a trick
                  question. The cross examination is just to see where u stand. How
                  ur mind thinks. And we work out the differences and
                  misunderstandings. Your intentions. Thats it. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Its NOT A TRICK
                  QUESTION. ITs a simple YES or NO question. No spin, no tricks , no
                  part questions within a question.. NADA.</span></span></strong> <strong><span>All my questions are not even trick
                  questions. They are just to discern what u believe and ur character
                  thats all!</span></strong> And regards to the Crate of Good apples,
                  isnt it OBVIOUS to me that my answer is NO.. i wont call it a crate
                  of good apples ? U can accept rotten apples inside and still dub it
                  as crate of good apples, i got no beef with it. It just shows me
                  what u percieve as e.g Body of Truths. Simple. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Not a trick
                  question.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just limiting the answer is assuming tat everything
                  must be in black and white, and not grey. Is everything in black
                  and white ? Could there be shades of grey ? In <strong>fact u r
                  persisting and try to force me to just say yes or not WITHOUT
                  elaboration</strong>. Isn’t these already trick questions ?</p>
              <p>And again u made another fallacy here. How I treat a
                  crate of apples doesn’t mean I treat the same to a body of truth.
                  These r completely 2 different issues altogether. If I use your
                  examples, a “crate f good apples” is like a Hyundai while “body of
                  truth” is like Maserati. Could I put Hyundai engine into Maserati
                  ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">What ? is that it ? Did i not
                  clarify Science and Theologians and admit that there may be
                  misunderstanding in the way i worded it ? Besides that, show me my
                  errors.</span></p>

                  Its TRUE, i dont think of it as.. THE TRUTH.</span></strong></p>
              <p>U claimed tat the laws of thermodynamics r wrong U
                  claimed tat 0/0 is logically zero. U stated tat 1+1=2 is not truth.
                  U claimed truth has no scope and could work in ALL circumstances. U
                  claimed tat 1=2 from division of 0/0. U claimed real and true
                  answers to questions r not truth. U said mathematical truth r not
                  truth. U thought 10/0 and 0/0 actually give different answers. U
                  claimed tat people who use the dictionary r just followers and not
                  superior. U claimed tat I said Einstein is always right and wanna
                  me to cut off my left ball.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">What u talking about ? We
                  agreed and disagreed in a few things. Whats wrong with that ? Didnt
                  u explain and I explain ? I am fully aware of ur understanding,
                  just that like “zero to infinity” it makes no sense !
                  <strong><span>So is it ZERO or is it NOT ?</span></strong> Because you have contradictory statements ! I am really scratching
                  my head, wondering which is the one u mean!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I said, it is UNDEFINED. It could be ANYTHING. If u
                  talk about contradictory statements, u said gravity is truth and
                  not truth, u say 1+1 is a mathematical truth which is not truth. U
                  said 0/0 is logically 0 but u show the graph yourself and say it
                  cannot be zero.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">The main point, is u say u
                  are UNSURE about ur own subject matter. End of the day , u just
                  cant tell me jack shit. All this rubbish u been spouting, now
                  doesnt mean anything. The basic fundamental is “U just dont know ur
                  subject” I asked u a simple question. YES or NO.. u even gave me
                  UNSURE, I didnt even expect that. I admit. Being conservative
                  pretty much means u are being chicken to answer. Means u dont even
                  know. The sheer simple matter is, u dont know.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">By the way , let me make it clear.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U derive simple True = Truth</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U think I dont know that ? U think all my
                  accumulated knowledge till this point, i cannot differentiate
                  TRUE/FALSE ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Did I EVER say u are wrong ? <strong>NO. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Its because i can differentiate clearly,
                  that i have been aware that it is much more complicated than that.
                  True = True . truth = truth . Truth = Truth .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dont forget, i said again n again, that i am
                  fully capable of understanding ur conceptualisation of truth. Thats
                  why i can understand your reasoning behind Science as Body of Truths.
                  But after so much, u should be clear by now my True and Truth is not
                  the same as ur True = Truth. Even when i was being specific, u just
                  dont get it. <strong>Is it MY FAULT ?</strong> </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">                 
                  MY crate of Good apples = Good apples <strong>ONLY (Unacceptable to have
                  rotten apples in it. If there is , I will call it MOSTLY good apples)</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">How hard is it to understand ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence its just simple. YOUR BODY OF TRUTHS =
                  True = Truths + Falsitities. If u can accept that , no problem. I got
                  no beef.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If u want me to Accept Body of Truths then
                  it MUST be BODY OF TRUTHS! Is it so hard to understand ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U noticed ? Our definition of Truth is
                  already different. So of course its not going to work perfectly in
                  eac of our belief system. Hence AGAIN, i am fully understanding to
                  your concept. U dont see me challenging u on ur beliefs right ? I
                  only challenge those I see as  blatant mistakes or things that
                  doesnt add up. Especially the Zero to Infinity. IN court, if ur
                  affidavit is different from your testimony, its a contempt of court.
                  We pretty much can throw the whole case out if u are the main
                  witness. If u meant ..<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Could be ANYTHING </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BUT </strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ZERO,</span> I am more then willing to accept the omission. But until now, u still
                  hang on to both. U CANT have TWO TRUTHS(True = Truth in your
                  definition) , either one is TRUE or NOT.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And i explained to u why i do not think so..
                  theories, mistakes, man... true.. but not really the Truth. Like how
                  u use the word "SOME TRUTHS" well, why didnt u read into my
                  "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAY NOT </span>be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE </span>TRUTH" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">While u were reading so into my supposedly u
                  claim "Trick Questions" , why didnt u READ into my sentence
                  of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAY NOT</span> be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE </strong></span>TRUTH ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">All the articles i have shown u ALL
                  SURPASSED THE SIMPLE NOTION of TRUE = TRUTH. Because the realisation
                  that TRUE is TRUE. TRUTH is TRUTH. There IS the subtle differences
                  and they try to explain that difference with thier superior
                  intellectual minds. But as usual, u can only see and read it as True
                  = Truth even after all those articles that TRY to define the subtlety
                  of True and Truth.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I can only come to a conclusion, did u even
                  read them ? Or u just dont understand! Its o.k u know.. even when
                  years ago i was studying it, it took me a damn good while just to
                  seperate the relative terms and its meaning. Even the article cant
                  even describe Truth till the point the auther is uncertain hence can
                  only say the Truh in his article represents Impartial Truth. I admit,
                  i may not be well versed in the english language to write it out the
                  way they do, but hey... thats what examples, articles and analogies
                  are for right ? But what astounds me is your supposedly superior
                  english language and dictionary.com  with so many meaning u cant
                  even GRAAASP the idea that there are differences and differences of
                  opinions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence, before u even try to critique the
                  articles, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">U better solve the "Zero to Infinity" part
                  first</span>. Your knowledge of Science is already proven you dont even
                  know the subject matter, so dont even bother bringing up anything
                  science in general. It will just look bad for you and me to even
                  continue. The Maths part is suspect too. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You have two true
                  statements that apparently, only one can be true. I have given u time
                  and time.. days n days to omitt the mistake, but u have chosen to
                  ignore and causing this loop.</span> <strong>The longer u ignore it, the more
                  suspect your credibility in Maths becomes. </strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>And another thing:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So please, before u even begin, at least
                  take some time to understand the paradoxes. The articles. They are
                  all different explainations to what Truth or the Truth is. </span></p>

                  truth has nothing to do with science. <strong>Are u trying to say Truth is
                  PURELY SCIENCE ?</strong> Is that what u are trying to say ? All i am

                  many words you use, words can never approximate the truth."</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Have u been in 90 years of silence ? Even if
                  u say its not scientific, how do u know he never did observation,
                  hypothesise, experiments <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IN SILENCE</span>  about the Truth ?
                  How do u know there is NO peer scrutiny ? I am sure, in that 90yrs of
                  silence , his mind was busy with something... i dont know. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Anyways, </strong>thats besides the point, u
                  have <strong>NO STANDING</strong> to talk to me anything about science now.
                  Lets just focus on <strong>Maths </strong>and <strong>Truth</strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now, for Truth, your version of the truth is
                  the simple correspondence theory. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As Aristotle claims in his Metaphysics: "To
                  say that [either] that which is is not or that which is not is, is a
                  falsehood; and to say that that which is is and that which is not is
                  not, is true" </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats why its perfectly understandable that
                  u truly believe and equate true = truth in simple logic and terms.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let me just to reitterate again, that U ARE
                  NOT WRONG.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Once again, let me make it clear, that i am
                  perfectly able to understand the way u do, from the cross
                  examinations and ur definitions. It should be from the
                  misunderstandings that one must see past it to allow understanding.
                  And we have both acknowledged the difference in our definition and
                  its application. .Now lets not try to apply our core.. which is the
                  engine part of our respective vehicles into each other's vehicles.</span></p>

              <p>Which point r u answering n here ? If u r talking about
                                          your definition of science, it is as plain as day tat science
                                          record truth and facts. A lot of times, the dictionary just explain
                                          some ideas similar but in a different way. Or r u really dumb tat u
                                          refuse to see the underlying and physical meaning of the message
                                          but just look for key words ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Are u sure it treats true to
                                          truth or does it treat true to truth as in impartial truth? ARE U
                                          VERY SURE ? YES OR NO. There is more excerpts then just that line,
                                          explaining the IDEA of truth.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then r u sure then wat is true may not be the truth ?
                                          The message above explains tat the word truth is simply derived
                                          from “true”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">surely there must be some

              <p> </p>
              <p>Then can u explain why u emphasis tat science is NEVER
                                          about truth before ? So u agree u made a mistake before ? REPEAT
                                          AFTER ME… HUMAN MAKE MISTAKE… HUMAN MAKE MISTAKE</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">SO WHAT ?? Thats not the
                                          point, it just means u dont know about ur subject matter. If u want
                                          ur answer to be conservative and unsure, SAY SO.  But the
                                          whole point, is YES or NO, its something u can discover yourself. U
                                          should know. I thought U really know. Because u talk of science as
                                          if u are very well versed. Hence if u are not sure, please dont say
                                          anything. And i dont have to do this to you.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me see… u expect me to answer yes or no, I answer
                                          unsure and u attack me for such a silly thing ? I don’t have to
                                          play your game. The reason why I said unsure is because I am
                                          conservative and wanna safeguard myself by giving a non committal
                                          answer. However u draw stupid conclusions from it and use it as
                                          though it is something remarkable. Is tat your best attack against
                                          me ? When I didn’t even commit to any particular stand ?</p>

                                          why i can give a definite answer YES or NO in my own questions. Is

                                          convictions u can either answer YES or NO. You already claim
                                          science  = Body of Truths, but yet u are UNSURE about the
                                          theories, so how the FUCK can u even think its Body of Truths ?That
                                          means u accept falsity in your body of Truths , thats why i CANNOT

              <p>Second, your question is really stupid. It is like
                                          asking if I see a glass of water filled almost to the brim, will I
                                          say it is a full glass of water or not ? Now if I say yes, which is
                                          probably wat most people will say, u said I have bad standard and
                                          tat it is not full because it is not filled to the brim. If I say
                                          No, then u will say I am unreasonable and tat most people will call
                                          it full. So wat do u expect me to say ? If u think it is not a
                                          trick question, then u reply yes or no to the question</p>
              <p>A glass of water is fill up 90% and almost to the brim.
                                          DO u call it a full glass of water ?</p>

                                          Unlike u, i dont READ into your trick question. And some of your
                                          questions are not EVEN questions.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

                                          U really talk cock, talk about other stupid things like engine and
                                          expect it to link to your question about truth. Wat is the link ?
                                          No link. U r just talking rubbish all the way</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Your definition of Truth and
                                          mine are different. That is the core of our beliefs. All the

                                          going to look wierd , but the engine wont run, and it will look
                                          like a bad piece of junk.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And so wat has it got to do with truth ? engine is an
                                          engine, a car is a a car and your truth is different from all
                                          tis.</p>

                                          isnt it OBVIOUS to me that my answer is NO.. i wont call it a crate
                                          of good apples ? U can accept rotten apples inside and still dub it
                                          as crate of good apples, i got no beef with it. It just shows me
                                          what u percieve as e.g Body of Truths. Simple. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Not a trick

              <p> </p>
              <p>Just limiting the answer is assuming tat everything

                                          and white ? Could there be shades of grey ? In <strong>fact u r

              <p>And again u made another fallacy here. How I treat a
                                          crate of apples doesn’t mean I treat the same to a body of truth.
                                          These r completely 2 different issues altogether. If I use your

              <p>I said, it is UNDEFINED. It could be ANYTHING. If u

                                          not truth, u say 1+1 is a mathematical truth which is not truth. U
                                          said 0/0 is logically 0 but u show the graph yourself and say it

                                          cant tell me jack shit. All this rubbish u been spouting, now
                                          doesnt mean anything. The basic fundamental is “U just dont know ur

                                          pretty much means u are being chicken to answer. Means u dont even

              <p>Which point r u answering n here ? If u r talking about
                                          your definition of science, it is as plain as day tat science
                                          record truth and facts. A lot of times, the dictionary just explain
                                          some ideas similar but in a different way. Or r u really dumb tat u
                                          refuse to see the underlying and physical meaning of the message
                                          but just look for key words ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Well, i am definately NOT dumb. <strong>For someone who doesnt know the subject matter well and that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">science</span></strong>, i suggest<strong> u shut the fuck up  and sit the fuck down</strong>. Move on to ur Maths and Truth.</span></p>
              <p>Then r u sure then wat is true may not be the truth ?
                                          The message above explains tat the word truth is simply derived
                                          from “true”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes i am sure that what is true</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>MAY NOT</strong></span><strong> </strong>be the truth.</span></p>
              <p>Then can u explain why u emphasis tat science is NEVER
                                          about truth before ? So u agree u made a mistake before ? REPEAT
                                          AFTER ME… HUMAN MAKE MISTAKE… HUMAN MAKE MISTAKE</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">WHEN ? ALL I SAID WAS. SCIENCE IS ABOUT THE HOW AND WHY, ON THE WAY THEY FIND THE TRUTH BRAVO. I SAID , SCIENCE IS NOT THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH.</span></p>

                                          play your game. The reason why I said unsure is because I am

                                          truth” is like Maserati. Could I put Hyundai engine into Maserati
                                          ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I already said, U CANT PUT A HYUNDAI ENGINE PART INTO A MASERATI ENGINE PART. U wanna try ? The reference here on the Hyundai is regarding ur personal beliefs and fundamentals. Thats its. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Crate of good apples, is in regards to science= body of truths</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then... can I put ur kuey tiaw and ur meepok into ur student body ? I can do that too. How fucked up is that. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">U ARE SO DESPERATE NOW, TRYING TO PUT TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT SUBJECTS INTO A STUPID ANALOGY.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What else u want to say ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT !SAY IT . I WILL CRUSH U. THIS SMELLS OF DESPERATION. EVEN I UNDERSTOOD UR ANALOGIES IN THIER OWN SUBJECT N CONTEXT. U DONT SEE ME CHUCKING STUPID IDEAS ANALOGIES LIKE THIS TO U RIGHT ? This takes the cake man... <strong>MAN UP!</strong></span></p>
              <p>I said, it is UNDEFINED. It could be ANYTHING. If u
                                                                  talk about contradictory statements, u said gravity is truth and
                                                                  not truth, u say 1+1 is a mathematical truth which is not truth. U
                                                                  said 0/0 is logically 0 but u show the graph yourself and say it

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">WHEN DID I SAY GRAVITY IS TRUTH N NOT TRUTH. SHOW ME... SHOW MEEEE... OR DO U MEAN I SAYD THEORY <strong>OF </strong>GRAVITY. IS THAT IT ? Thats pathetic n lame man.. </span></p>
              <p>- <strong><span>OF COURSE. LIKED I SAID, IT
                                                              DEPENDS ON CIRCUMSTANCES. Acceleration of Gravity is TRUE, but u
                                                              cant say its LIKE THAT, as Gravity on Earth and Moon are different.
                                                              Its TRUE, i dont think of it as.. THE TRUTH.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>YES</strong>..<strong> ACCELERATION OF GRAVITY IS TRUE</strong>. <strong>GRAVITY IS TRUTH</strong>. <strong>CAN U EVEN SEPRATE TRUE and TRUTH ? OBVIOUSLY NOT !</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is that it ? Is THAT the only thing u assumingly said i claim Gravity to NOT be truth ? What an Idiot!</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">YES . I SAID IT CANNOT BE ZERO . MATHEMATICALLY. LOGICALL NOTHING DIVIDES BY NOTHING = NOTHING 0. NADA. BUT MATHS CANT <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>0 </strong></span>WHY ?</span></p>

                      apparently, only one can be true. I have given u time and time.. days n days to
                      omitt the mistake, but u have chosen to ignore and causing this loop.</span></span><span style="color: red;"> <strong>The longer u ignore it, the more suspect your
                      credibility in Maths becomes.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Wat is the mistake ? I said it could be anything and u cannot see a undefined
                      value as a variable. U treat tham as same. Worse still u r the one who said it
                      is zero in the first place</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The beginning of the topic is really about the earlier few statements u had
                      made before. At first, u claimed tat science cannot discern wat is true and
                      false. U claimed tat science can never state any truth and tat only thelogist
                      could. U also said many examples like 1+1=2 r not truth at all (yet u also
                      claimed it is a mathematical truth, but not truth) and provide an unconvincing
                      application of it. For a long time u even refuse to state your definition of
                      truth and science. And those who do not share the same understanding or views r
                      labelled as stupid and ignorant.</p>
              <p>My belief of truth is simply tat it has to be an objective true. U claimed
                      "wat may be true may not be the truth" doesn't really make sense
                      because in your definition, there r things that exhibit dual properties,. It is
                      being true and yet not the truth. Tat doesn't make sense since if it is not the
                      truth in the first place, it could not be true at all. Tat perhaps is the crux
                      of the problem. U do not treat true statements as truth, or true answers to any
                      question as truth. In fact it is unclear to me wat is truth to u. Maybe u would
                      like to state clearly wat is truth to u and how u reconciled with all your
                      previous statements on truth</p>
              <p>And indeed there r many articles on truth, but all of them do not run away
                      from the idea tat truth is an objective true. The difference is not on the
                      definition of the word, but on the idea on how do we know wat is truth or not.
                      And none of them says tat science is never about truth. And saying tat, doesn't
                      make it equal tat all truth must be science. Science is a subset of truth. The
                      problem is u claimed before tat science is not a subset of truth.</p>
              <p>For your article by Stacey Lawson, he is basically just a blogger. And the
                      way he support his stand is simply from religious scriptures tat states the
                      people being silent about explaining wat is truth. And the truth is perhaps
                      spiritual attainment in tat article.</p>

              <p>Wat is the mistake ? I said it could be anything and u cannot
                                  see a undefined value as a variable. U treat tham as same. Worse
                                  still u r the one who said it is zero in the first place</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The beginning of the topic is really about the earlier few
                                  statements u had made before. At first, u claimed tat science
                                  cannot discern wat is true and false. U claimed tat science can
                                  never state any truth and tat only thelogist could. U also said
                                  many examples like 1+1=2 r not truth at all (yet u also claimed it
                                  is a mathematical truth, but not truth) and provide an unconvincing
                                  application of it. For a long time u even refuse to state your
                                  definition of truth and science. And those who do not share the
                                  same understanding or views r labelled as stupid and ignorant.</p>
              <p>My belief of truth is simply tat it has to be an objective true.
                                  U claimed "wat may be true may not be the truth" doesn't really
                                  make sense because in your definition, there r things that exhibit
                                  dual properties,. It is being true and yet not the truth. Tat
                                  doesn't make sense since if it is not the truth in the first place,
                                  it could not be true at all. Tat perhaps is the crux of the
                                  problem. U do not treat true statements as truth, or true answers
                                  to any question as truth. In fact it is unclear to me wat is truth
                                  to u. Maybe u would like to state clearly wat is truth to u and how
                                  u reconciled with all your previous statements on truth</p>
              <p>And indeed there r many articles on truth, but all of them do
                                  not run away from the idea tat truth is an objective true. The
                                  difference is not on the definition of the word, but on the idea on
                                  how do we know wat is truth or not. And none of them says tat
                                  science is never about truth. And saying tat, doesn't make it equal
                                  tat all truth must be science. Science is a subset of truth. The
                                  problem is u claimed before tat science is not a subset of
                                  truth.</p>

              <p>So there r things tat are true but not the truth ? It is like

                                                      mean anything. The basic fundamental is “U just dont know ur

              <p>Just limiting the answer is assuming tat everything must be in
                                  black and white, and not grey. Is everything in black and white ?
                                  Could there be shades of grey ? In <strong>fact u r persisting and
                                  try to force me to just say yes or not WITHOUT
                                  elaboration</strong>. Isn’t these already trick questions ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">"</span>Exactly, if there is grey.. U SAY ITS GREY. If
                                                      its BLACK.. u SAY ITS BLACK.. if its WHITE.. u SAY ITS WHITE. 
                                                      U dont say something that is NOT. <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4 Feb 3.30pm"</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes there is black, there is white , there is shades of grey. To me, when u say UNSURE, it just means u dont know ur subject matter. Did i tell u that u CANT choose unsure ? DID I ? I accept it! IT just shocked me with your convictions that u could come up with UNSURE.. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">DID I NOT ACCEPT YOUR UNSURE ANSWER?</span></strong></p>
              <p>And again u made another fallacy here. How I treat a crate of
                                  apples doesn’t mean I treat the same to a body of truth. These r
                                  completely 2 different issues altogether. If I use your examples, a
                                  “crate of good apples” is like a Hyundai while “body of truth” is
                                  like Maserati. Could I put Hyundai engine into Maserati ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">OOOH... OOOOH&gt;.  So how u treat a crate of apples doesnt mean u treat the same to a body of truth. So U are being selective now ? Double standard ? Your analogy can work , MINE cant ? Anyways , its MY analogy of your body of truths. If u dun want, its up to you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hey, your Student body consist of MEEPOK and Kueh Tiaaw, can I use it too ? <strong>Or to me cant.. u can again ?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>BRAVO.. BRAVO!!</strong> As i said, these analogies are used in different subject. If i use them in the same subject, fair enough. But they are not. One is talking about body of truths, the other one is about ur beliefs, u trying to impose ur definition into mine. Two seperate subjects</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>See.. like u trying to fit your hyundai engine part.. into my maserati engine AGAIN!</strong></span></p>

              <p>I am talking about the usage of the word “body”. And u r having
                                  problem with the word “:body”. Tat is why I used “student body” as
                                  an example.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> got no problem with that. I dont think its a very good one. I personally think crate of good apples is better. If u think Body of students is best, so be it. I accept it. I personally treat crate of apples more similiar. <strong>U believe urs, i believe mine. In the end of the day, its the same. U can accept some truths, i cant. I need to accept ALL TRUTHS.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Wat is the mistake ? I said it could be anything and u cannot
                                  see a undefined value as a variable. U treat tham as same. Worse
                                  still u r the one who said it is zero in the first place</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U said ANYTHING.. thats why u are giving me contradictions from your other satements. SO right now, i am trying to find out, THIS ONE.. or THAT ONE. BE A MAN! ANSWER IT!<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> IS IT ZERO TO INFINITY ?</strong></span> <strong>OR </strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NO.. THE GRAPH DOES NOT TOUCH ZERO.</strong></span></span><strong>?</strong></p>
              <p>Another stupid sentence which u avoid answering. Wat is the
                                      logical meaning of dividing by zero ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nothing. Logically, 0 which is Nothing divides by 0 which is Nothing = Logically equals zero nothing. Unfortunately, Maths cant solve it. Thats it. How many times have i told u ? U want me to cut n pate with <strong>dates </strong>?</span></p>
              <p>Which is it ? TELL ME. IF u say either one, i will assume either one is wrong. Then move on. All it shows that u make mistakes. THATS IT.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are u scared to be proven that u make mistakes ? Scared to lose some face ? Are u trying to tell me that ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Say it again with me. We are Humans , we make mistakes. Say it again.. and again.. AND AGAIN!</strong></span></p>
              <p>The idiot is u. U said they r not the truth, as plain as day
                                  here. And I thought u said “true= true”, truth = truth” and tat wat
                                  is true may not be the truth ? U really just practice scoundrel

                                                      never state any truth and tat only thelogist could. U also said

              <p> </p>
              <p>My belief of truth is simply tat it has to be an objective true.
                                                      U claimed "wat may be true may not be the truth" doesn't really
                                                      make sense because in your definition, there r things that exhibit
                                                      dual properties,. It is being true and yet not the truth. Tat
                                                      doesn't make sense since if it is not the truth in the first place,
                                                      it could not be true at all. Tat perhaps is the crux of the
                                                      problem. U do not treat true statements as truth, or true answers
                                                      to any question as truth. In fact it is unclear to me wat is truth
                                                      to u. Maybe u would like to state clearly wat is truth to u and how
                                                      u reconciled with all your previous statements on truth</p>

              <p>And indeed there r many articles on truth, but all of them do
                                                      not run away from the idea tat truth is an objective true. The
                                                      difference is not on the definition of the word, but on the idea on
                                                      how do we know wat is truth or not. And none of them says tat
                                                      science is never about truth. And saying tat, doesn't make it equal
                                                      tat all truth must be science. Science is a subset of truth. The
                                                      problem is u claimed before tat science is not a subset of
                                                      truth.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">TO ME SCIENCE IS NOT THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH. SIMPLE. ALL I SAY IS SCIENCE IS THE HOW AND WHY. THATS IT. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If they find truth along the way. GOOD FOR THEM. THATS IT. If u think How and Why are Truths, GO AHEAD. I dont have a problem! Thats it.</span></p>
