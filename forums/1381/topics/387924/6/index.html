              <p>No, "1+1 = 2" is true regardless of the physical universe. Mathematics is an inpendent and separate entity from existance. Aliens will know "1+1 = 2", other universes (if there are parallel universes) can develop mathematics that is exactly the same as what man has done.</p>
              <p>Its a difficult concept to understand, so I will try to make an example, but not a very good one.</p>
              <p>In mathematics, we can theoretically calculate the value of pi without any physical measurements. However, this value of pi is only true if the geometry of the space is 'flat' (ie, parallel lines never meet and etc.) Yet, this universe of ours might be not perfectly flat (parallel lines can diverge or intersect). Consequently, the real value of the ratio of the circumference to diameter is slightly. Thus, you can see that this value of pi is independent of physical existance. It does not need to be created.</p>

              <p><br>I am not trying to argue with you the mathematical entity of its truth. I am not disputing that point. I am not here trying me to dispute. U want example, i am showing it in this context what it means.</p>
              <p>I am trying to aim for a different truth. Mathematically 1 + 1 = 2 is a true and a truth. But, there are other types of 1 + 1 like 1 apple + 1 orange = No 2 Apples. But maybe 2 fruits.</p>
              <p>What i am trying to do now is to show u the meaning of truth in my context, from such a lot of possibilities what the truth can mean. I am showing u the meaning of the truth. U can just concentrate on that meaning of the truth. We are just dealing with this meaning of the truth in this context.</p>
              <p>I am not starting an argument with other truths. Are u all here bored, sitting on ass, finding an argument ? DId i not agree and accept your definition of the truth ?  Why cant u do the same for me ?</p>
              <p>I guess, once again, i was right. Some of you guys are small minded and narrow minded. U guys are just pathetic. Here i am , accepting one of the possible meanings of the truth. All i am asking is you accept my meaning of the word truth, as listed in Dictionary.com  </p>

              <p><br>NO no no no no no... sigh....</p>
              <p>Do you guys comprehend what i am trying to tell u guys ? Gravity is just a word to represent the forces that pull whatever goes up, down. Before science came up with the word gravity or understood the existence of gravity, it has already existed. It is the TRUTH that what goes up must come down. Think 5 , 6 thousand years ago, they do not understand  the phenomenon of what goes up must come down.  They did no say gravity is true because the word gravity did not exist that time.</p>
              <p>What i am saying is, truth is absolute  actual existence of reality. Just because you cannot comprehend certain things does not mean its not the truth.</p>
              <p>U guys have a problem now. U are stuck in the present, in this time and this moment. U have to open up your mind, like those guys, 2 , 3 thousand years ago. They could not understand the mechanics, but they knew, something exist. Something is pulling whatever they throw up, down.</p>
              <p>o.k.. i will put it in simplest term. Is there a possiblity that there are multitudes of truths out there, that we human beings cannot comprehend. What limited information we have now, we can consider certain things to be true, whether these are truth.</p>

              <p>if u look at dictionary.com, for the word true, "<em>being in accordance with the actual state or conditions</em>", isn't tat the same as the meaning of your meaning of truth which is <em>"actual existence"</em> ? So how could true not equal to truth ?</p>
              <p>Lets see the bottom line. Science states the truth. Gravity is stated by science. He states things fall to the ground is because of gravity. The word is defined as such.  So is tat the truth or not ? So does science states the truth ?</p>

              <p>I'm too lazy to read the rest of the posts so I shall post a very general reply to what I've read so far.</p>
              <p>1. Do not attempt to place scientific theory in the same category as religion. As much as both of these satisfy the wikipedia definition, there is quite a big difference. It is akin to saying that we should for all purposes consider dental braces and an egg sandwich food because we put them in our mouth. Science is based on evidence and accepts the possibility that at times it may be wrong. Religion is based on blind faith of the ignorant who are threatened with a burning hell if they DARE to even consider for a moment aloud in their minds that religion may be wrong.</p>
              <p>2. Why you should NOT be afraid to question your religion: your god would want your faith in him to be unshakeable and unwaverable, and therefore to fufil said requirement you should to the best of your ability use your god-given brain to prove to yourself that your god is real. Which involves giving yourself a satisfactory answer to all the questions that create doubt about the existence of your god.</p>
              <p>3. Wake up. There is ZERO concrete proof of the existence of any god. While we do not 100% exclude the possibility of the existence of said god(s), there is ABSOLUTELY no indication of ANY sort that indicates even the slightest likelihood that whatever is written in the bible is a factual account. It is akin to saying that a secret magical eggplant exists in a supersecret place on earth than cannot be found by humans. It is unfalsifiable. It is possibly true, indeed, but very unlikely. Just because I say it is so, does not mean I can't be lying. Just because your priest says it is so, doesn't mean that it is the truth.</p>
              <p>4. Finally, most importantly, just because your are a Christian does not mean that you must flatly deny, purely out of loyalty, anything about science. Understand that being a Christian does not mean you have to literally believe that Jesus walked on water. Christianity, any religion, for that matter, is meant to be taken figuratively. It is teaching you to be a good person. What is actually important about Christianity is the lessons that you learn about life. What is righteous and good. What is respectable. Do you honestly think that God would bother about inconsequential details such as whether we believed the sun revolved around us or not? No, I would be inclined to believe that God is a lot less petty than that and would care more about whether you started up a scam cheating elderly people of large sums of money, or if you helped someone today who really needed it.</p>

              <p><br>No. it is not the same. Actual state and Actual Existence is different. U have to grasp that... GRAAAAASSSSSPPP.</p>
              <p>Science SEEK to UNDERSTAND the mysteries of the universe. Thats why it is called THEORIES. All science did was find the existence of gravity. Thats it, to help explain the truth of what goes up must come down. Because of that, they call the phenomenon gravity, and hence its the truth. Define that phenomenon as gravity.</p>
              <p>Hence in this context, yes, science helped to explain what gravity is. Explain that phenomenon. = Gravity Yes it is the truth. I never dispute that truth.</p>
              <p>The word Theory as defined by Kopper and Hawkings  "Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory.

              <p>Hmm, after skimming through the posts I think point number 3 in my previous post is of relevance.</p>
              <p>Basically science does not deny the possibility of existence of god, nor the possibility of existence of the tower of babel, nor the possibility of ANYTHING at all. It does not even deny that creationism is impossible. It just states that these are <em>unlikely</em>. It's like saying we could all be dreaming now, sitting inside a computer contraption that causes us to imagine all these things on and on and on... We cannot DENY the possibility of it, but it is just something that seems unlikely.</p>

              <p>I'm too lazy to read the rest of the posts so I shall post a very general reply to what I've read so far.</p>
              <p>1. Do not attempt to place scientific theory in the same category as religion. As much as both of these satisfy the wikipedia definition, there is quite a big difference. It is akin to saying that we should for all purposes consider dental braces and an egg sandwich food because we put them in our mouth. Science is based on evidence and accepts the possibility that at times it may be wrong. Religion is based on blind faith of the ignorant who are threatened with a burning hell if they DARE to even consider for a moment aloud in their minds that religion may be wrong.</p>
              <p>2. Why you should NOT be afraid to question your religion: your god would want your faith in him to be unshakeable and unwaverable, and therefore to fufil said requirement you should to the best of your ability use your god-given brain to prove to yourself that your god is real. Which involves giving yourself a satisfactory answer to all the questions that create doubt about the existence of your god.</p>
              <p>3. Wake up. There is ZERO concrete proof of the existence of any god. While we do not 100% exclude the possibility of the existence of said god(s), there is ABSOLUTELY no indication of ANY sort that indicates even the slightest likelihood that whatever is written in the bible is a factual account. It is akin to saying that a secret magical eggplant exists in a supersecret place on earth than cannot be found by humans. It is unfalsifiable. It is possibly true, indeed, but very unlikely. Just because I say it is so, does not mean I can't be lying. Just because your priest says it is so, doesn't mean that it is the truth.</p>
              <p>4. Finally, most importantly, just because your are a Christian does not mean that you must flatly deny, purely out of loyalty, anything about science. Understand that being a Christian does not mean you have to literally believe that Jesus walked on water. Christianity, any religion, for that matter, is meant to be taken figuratively. It is teaching you to be a good person. What is actually important about Christianity is the lessons that you learn about life. What is righteous and good. What is respectable. Do you honestly think that God would bother about inconsequential details such as whether we believed the sun revolved around us or not? No, I would be inclined to believe that God is a lot less petty than that and would care more about whether you started up a scam cheating elderly people of large sums of money, or if you helped someone today who really needed it.</p>

              <p>Erm read the next post LOL.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think basically what Maro is trying to say is (correct me if I'm wrong):</p>
              <p>Science is ever-changing and just because science says something is true now, does not mean that in a few years someone won't discover that it was actually false. Basically science attempts to pinpoint with as much accuracy as possible what is LIKELY, but it cannot say with absolutely certainty that anything at all is 100% true, and it is merely an opinion based on evidence of what is likely to be true, and what is unlikely to be true.</p>
              <p>I hope that this simplification (if I understood your original point correctly) will help others to understand too.</p>
              <p>@Maro: You should know that the post that you quoted from me was not intended to be taken as a reply to your current argument because at the point I posted it I had only read the posts until page 2 or 3. Also I posted because I hoped based on what I read on the first few pages I would be able to accurately gauge to some extent what the following discussion would be about, and therefore post something of relevance to the discussion...

WHY , are u nit picking these small points, i accept and did not refute your statements , why , cant u accept my point ? I am not here to argue the existence of God or not. Simple. Everything is possible.  Its that possibility that is the driving force to seek .. the answers.</p>
              <p>Theory is so powerful yes,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> BUT it has been proven to be wrong</span>. U see now ?  There is a possibility to be wrong! Like the Theory that the Earth is the centre of the universe.</p>
              <p> "There is no single observation tat disagree with the prediction of the theory."</p>
              <p>What theory ? My greatness ? What theory u referring to ?</p>

              <p>Anyway, I think basically what Maro is trying to say is (correct me if I'm wrong):</p>
              <p>Science is ever-changing and just because science says something is true now, does not mean that in a few years someone won't discover that it was actually false. Basically science attempts to pinpoint with as much accuracy as possible what is LIKELY, but it cannot say with absolutely certainty that anything at all is 100% true, and it is merely an opinion based on evidence of what is likely to be true, and what is unlikely to be true.</p>
              <p>I hope that this simplification (if I understood your original point correctly) will help others to understand too.</p>
              <p>@Maro: You should know that the post that you quoted from me was not intended to be taken as a reply to your current argument because at the point I posted it I had only read the posts until page 2 or 3.</p>

              <p>You yourself said science is open-minded, then why cant u be open minded on the possibilities. What are u even trying to say ? Are u stupid ? because.. Stupid IS NOT SMART.

              <p>And as I said, no living organism ever disobey the theory of evolution. All the while I told u tat the possibility of evolution being wrong is damn low, 0+ percent. The only way to prove evolution wrong is probably things like discovering completely new beings such as pheonixes (beings tat are able to stand fire and rejuvenate in it), or dragons (able to spit out fire and fly with impossible size), or fire elementals (not organic living beings), or rock golems (non organic living beings), or treant (photosynthesis being with intelligence and motion of animals), or talking pizza boxes (something totally created, no precedence), or spongebob (no precedence, some new being created not evolved). They r colorful examples but why I use tis examples is to show tat unless u discover some completely new beings tat does not resembles any old living beings, then u cannot prove theory of evolution to be wrong. And the reason why it allow disproving is simply because science allow correction to be made in order to become mroe accurate. Even though the possibility is low, it is being open minded. If u have evidence and a better theory, u can prove newton law wrong as well.</p>

              <p>Are u using a different meaning of the truth here or are we on the same page. As in Truth = Actuality</p>
              <p>And yes,what i stated in <strong>on 15 Jan 1108pm,</strong> I did phrase TRUE and FALSE in that statement wrong. I admit, but i already corrected my statements after in subsequent posts and its obvious what i meant and its the TRUTH , not true and false, i just didnt go EDIT it. U are just nitpicking! But i am sure you know where my actual stance, reasoning and statement lies.Theologians determine true or false after, in thier domain and that is the religion of it.</p>
              <p>And as for the Theory of Evolution, i never and did not say u are wrong or it is wrong., did i ? All i am saying that these are not TRUTHs. Thats all.

Ur idea of truth differs from mine by the looks of it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">U regard  Evolution as the TRUTH, i regard Evolution as TRUE for now but NOT the truth.</span> I am more open-minded thats all.</p>
              <p>Why cant u just accept that. I accepted yours. Why cant u accept mine ? Unless i am wrong, and false, and my interpretation of the meaning of truth even from the dictionary is wrong, and i applied it wrongly. Is that what u are saying ?</p>

              <p>Why is science not the search for truth ?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO</strong></span> Isn't
              discovering mechanics and how it works the truth ?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO</strong></span> Isn't
              discovering gravity and giving values again the search for truth ?
              Isn't discovering how the earth comes about or how life comes
              about a search for truth ? Isn't discovering how land eroded,
              how trees are thicker in the equator or why there r seasons all the
              search for truth ? Science searches for truth and discer wat is
              true or false. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Ans:</strong> Because science is not to search for the
              TRUTH but to explain WHY and HOW.</p>
              <p>Are u using a different meaning of the truth here or are we on
              the same page. As in Truth = Actuality</p>
              <p>And yes,what i stated in <strong>on 15 Jan 1108pm,</strong> I
              did phrase TRUE and FALSE in that statement wrong. I admit, but i
              already corrected my statements after in subsequent posts and its
              obvious what i meant and its the TRUTH , not true and false, i just
              didnt go EDIT it. U are just nitpicking! But i am sure you know
              where my actual stance, reasoning and statement lies.Theologians
              determine true or false after, in thier domain and that is the
              religion of it.</p>
              <p>And as for the Theory of Evolution, i never and did not say u
              are wrong or it is wrong., did i ? All i am saying that these are
              not TRUTHs. Thats all. Opinions and postulation, like the
              explaination in wiki of Theory. Ur idea of truth differs from mine
              by the looks of it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">U
              regard  Evolution as the TRUTH, i regard Evolution as TRUE for
              now but NOT the truth.</span> I am more open-minded thats all.</p>
              <p>Why cant u just accept that. I accepted yours. Why cant u accept
              mine ? Unless i am wrong, and false, and my interpretation of the
              meaning of truth even from the dictionary is wrong, and i applied
              it wrongly. Is that what u are saying ?</p>

              <p>I nearly laughed when recently a forummer said that it is surprising that people still believe in religion even though Quakes are caused by tectonics. Hello? What kind of disproof is that? They do realise that to eat Sushi they must use their hands or either a pair of chopsticks right?</p>
