              <p class="MsoNormal">Frankly speaking, if u go around and ask people, how many
              people can really name a scientific theory tat is superceded ? It is likely tat
              99% of the population couldn’t name one. Is it a surprise ? Most of the
              theories tat were listed often comes with some competitor (origin of universe) who
              give an alternative view and were not generally accepted or established by the
              scientific committee. A lot of your list r also not wrong but refined. And most
              of them have been deemed as wrong more than 100 years ago. And to really
              confirm whether is there such theories, one have to research into it. Your list
              is derived from</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">On the 30<sup>th</sup> Jan u stated</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Some theories are just
              so totally different and totally wrong that doesnt relect the truth. Like the
              Universe rotates around the Earth. Or how the Earth was Flat. </em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">but the above theories u stated r not really scientific
              theories. When asked u to name a scientific theory tat was obsolete, u cannot
              name a proper theory and gave off two wrong answers as well. So at tat time
              when u asked me whether there r scientific theories tat were obsolete, I leave
              it as unsure. If u think tat I saying a simple “unsure” is bad, u giving out
              the two wrong examples is WORSE. TWO WRONG EXAMPLES. And u claim your
              scientific standard is high ? Wat a joke ! I am not gonna say my scientific
              knowledge is the top 5% percentile but to deal with a person with a bad
              background of science like u, my standard is already adequate.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Yes there is black, there is white ,
              there is shades of grey. To me, when u say UNSURE, it just means u dont know ur
              subject matter. Did i tell u that u CANT choose unsure ? DID I ? I accept it!
              IT just shocked me with your convictions that u could come up with UNSURE..</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p>Just limiting the answer is assuming tat everything must be in black and
              white, and not grey. Is everything in black and white ? Could there be shades
              of grey ? In <strong>fact u r persisting and try to force me to just say yes or
              not WITHOUT elaboration</strong>. Isn’t these already trick questions ?</p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories</a></p>
              <p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> Jan u stated</p>
              <p><em>Some theories are just so totally different and
                  totally wrong that doesnt relect the truth. Like the Universe
                  rotates around the Earth. Or how the Earth was Flat. </em></p>
              <p>but the above theories u stated r not really scientific
                  theories. When asked u to name a scientific theory tat was
                  obsolete, u cannot name a proper theory and gave off two wrong
                  answers as well. So at tat time when u asked me whether there r
                  scientific theories tat were obsolete, I leave it as unsure. If u
                  think tat I saying a simple “unsure” is bad, u giving out the two
                  wrong examples is WORSE. TWO WRONG EXAMPLES. And u claim your
                  scientific standard is high ? Wat a joke ! I am not gonna say my
                  scientific knowledge is the top 5% percentile but to deal with a
                  person with a bad background of science like u, my standard is
                  already adequate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Yes there is black, there is
                  white , there is shades of grey. To me, when u say UNSURE, it just
                  means u dont know ur subject matter. Did i tell u that u CANT
                  choose unsure ? DID I ? I accept it! IT just shocked me with your
                  convictions that u could come up with UNSURE..</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again trying to avoid answering question ? I paste the
                  whole topic for u to answer here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just limiting the answer is assuming tat everything must be in
                  black and white, and not grey. Is everything in black and white ?
                  Could there be shades of grey ? In <strong>fact u r persisting and
                  try to force me to just say yes or not WITHOUT
                  elaboration</strong>. Isn’t these already trick questions ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">OOOH... OOOOH&gt;.  So
                  how u treat a crate of apples doesnt mean u treat the same to a
                  body of truth. So U are being selective now ? Double standard ?
                  Your analogy can work , MINE cant ? Anyways , its MY analogy of

              <p>I am just using your lousy analogy against u. I think

                  much sense to u, I just use it back to u so u can think through it

              <p>Seems u really like to discuss tis topic in length. So
                                          no prob.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, if u go around and ask people, how
                                          many people can really name a scientific theory tat is superceded ?
                                          It is likely tat 99% of the population couldn’t name one. Is it a
                                          surprise ? Most of the theories tat were listed often comes with
                                          some competitor (origin of universe) who give an alternative view
                                          and were not generally accepted or established by the scientific
                                          committee. A lot of your list r also not wrong but refined. And
                                          most of them have been deemed as wrong more than 100 years ago. And
                                          to really confirm whether is there such theories, one have to
                                          research into it. Your list is derived from</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I

              u can not believe me, its better u read WIki again. Stop embarassing

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And
              why do u even quote 99% of the population ? Its got NOTHING to do with
              them. Are u just saying that because they are ignorant, we are supposed
              to forgive ur ignorance too ? I mean, after all this supposedly ur

              <p>Just limiting the answer is assuming tat everything must be in

              <p><span style="color: red;">Yes there is black, there is
                                          white , there is shades of grey. To me, when u say UNSURE, it just
                                          means u dont know ur subject matter. Did i tell u that u CANT
                                          choose unsure ? DID I ? I accept it! IT just shocked me with your
                                          convictions that u could come up with UNSURE..</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If i accepted your UNSURE, obviously i already accepted your shades of grey. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Of
              course there are shades of grey. So ? Remember, i got NO problem with
              your answer. When u said unsure, i just came to the conclusion that u
              dont know ur subject matter . Thats it.</span></strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Come on, from the THEORY </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>OF </strong>GRAVITY.. to this ? Come on.. u can do better.  </span></p>
              <p>As usual, u become a chicken and refuse to comment on
                                          the statement which I made countless times. “If an answer is true
                                          and real to any questions, it is the truth”. Why u failed to
                                          comment on tat ? If u think saying “unsure” is bad, avoiding the
                                          topic at hand is much worse</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Well,
              thats YOUR definition. I already said, i got NO problem.  U are making
              a statement. And i agree with your definition. What else u want ? My
              compliance ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wat is wrong ? U contradict yourself in tat statement
                                          again. U claimed it is the truth and then said it is not the truth
                                          simultaneously. Wat is wrong ? U r just plain stupid.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">One is <strong>Mathematical Truth</strong>. The other is.. <strong>THE </strong>TRUTH. Yes, to me there <strong>IS </strong>a difference.  But like i said ,u are to stupid to understand.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;">Tat is strange. To u, isn’t theorem not truth as well ?
                                          So why do u treat godels incomplete theorem as truth ? And wat is
                                          the relevance of tat theorem to our problem ? U just anyhow quote
                                          but did u really read it yourself ? I know u r really bird brained
                                          but I don’t know it is tat serious.</p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Since
              when i said its THE TRUTH ? I am just showing ur stupid ass that Maths,
              is NOT PERFECT. Hence, i said again, Maths not about to do its job
              properly, and that is quantiy, FAILED, TAHTS WHY I CANT SEE 1+1 = 2 as
              THE TRUTH.. only as Mathematical Truth. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Obviously,
              u are just too damn stupid ass.Alot of times u ask so much, I need to
              keep showing u what other people think. Because obviously my layman
              english is not understandable to you.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>See ? Failed to answer my points again. Wat a chicken
                                          and a bird brain. Did u respond to the point</p>
              <p><strong><em>It is being true and yet not the truth. Tat

                                          it could not be true at all.</em></strong></p>
              <p>R u too chicken to respond directly to it ? If your

                                          existence, it is not true. U still have a stupid dilemma in your

                                          then u said it is about truth. Wow man… u claimed I am not versed

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">The starting point for this
                  article was not obvious, at least to me. I began building it around
                  the definitions of model, simulation and related terms but discovered
                  that these depend upon an even deeper set of terms, those related to
                  the notion of truth. Most models and simulations, even those used in
                  entertainment, abstract their representations from some form of truth
                  or reality and, in most cases, try to represent truth to some degree.
                  Measurement of a simulation's fidelity depends significantly upon
                  knowledge of the truth. Despite this reliance, the definitions of the
                  term "truth" have all the properties of a riddle. They are
                  both simple and complex, both obvious and subtle. The definitions
                  used in the current draft glossary have two distinct flavors:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><strong>truth.</strong> 1.
                  Reality; actuality. 2. Conformity to fact or actuality. 3.
                  Faithful to an original or standard. 4. A
                  statement proven to be or accepted as true. [1] 5. A property
                  implicitly ascribed to a proposition by belief in or assertion of it;
                  the denial is "falsity". 6. In the verification theory of
                  truth, a correspondence between the proposition and the events,
                  properties or objects to which it refers linguistically or
                  operationally. 7. In the logical theory of truth, the coherence
                  between that proposition and other propositions. 8. In the
                  constructivist theory of truth, constructability implying the absence
                  of paradox and contradiction. [2]</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><strong>The first flavor, embodied
                  by the first four definitions, comes from<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> standard usage</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> that accessible to and, theoretically, controlled by we common
                  people.</span> </strong>I have taken the liberty to arrange these definitions
                  in order of the<strong> strength of their commitment rather than that of
                  their preferred usage</strong> (as is a common convention in
                  dictionaries). The first definition equates
                  truth to reality with no difference between them. The second
                  suggests that truth need only conform to reality but not necessarily
                  BE reality. The third more loosely ties truth to an original or
                  standard that may or may not be real. The
                  fourth only requires truth to be accepted as true. Clearly,
                  no model's representation can be true by the first definition unless
                  it only represents itself, an interesting circularity that may only
                  appeal to those philosophers in dire need of entertainment.
               The fourth definition, on the other hand,
                  permits the collective opinion of a group, subject matter experts for
                  example, to license a model's representation as truth, a truly scary
                  prospect to <strong>ardent truth seekers.(Me)</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><strong>The second flavor, captured
                  by the remaining four definitions, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">philosophically
                  mathematical</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>and, while probably accessible to few, has
                  far greater precision than those definitions implied by common usage. </strong><strong>These definitions of truth, presented in no particular order,
                  capture the more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">technical meanings that derive from
                  different philosophical schools</span></strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>(Mathematical
                  Truth , Logical Truth etc)</strong>This list
                  is by no means exhaustive as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">formal
                  meaning of truth has undoubtedly been pondered and debated widely by
                  philosophers since its invention. </span>The
                  first essentially defines truth as the denial of its opposite,
                  falsity. That seems clear cut <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but
                  hardly useful.</span> The second connects truth to its
                  verifiability against actuality. The third equates truth to coherence
                  with other propositions and the final, related definition demands
                  that truth lack contradiction and paradox with other propositions. I
                  submit that these definitions characterize essential properties of
                  truth but are not, in themselves, complete definitions of it. They
                  simply provide a set of potentially rigorous tests for the
                  possibility of truth. Even the intersection of truth's formal
                  definitions possesses a disquieting degree of interpretational wiggle
                  room, a property that undoubtedly benefits lawyers handsomely while
                  driving mathematicians absolutely crazy. I know of no provably
                  complete set of tests for truth. Please let me know if you do.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br>Simulationists, possibly from
                  the recognition of truth's impreciseness, have defined at least two
                  special kinds of truth that deserve mention (and please send me any
                  others about which you know):</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><strong>ground truth</strong>. The
                  actual facts of a situation, without errors introduced by sensors or
                  human perception and judgement. See perceived truth, truth. [3,
                  4]<br><strong>perceived truth.</strong> That subset of ground truth acquired
                  and, possibly, distorted by sensors, human perception or judgement;
                  the situation as perceived by an observer. See ground truth,
                  perception, truth. [5]</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br>Since the definition of
                  perceived truth depends upon the notion of perception, I've included
                  its definitions here for completeness:<br>perception. 1. An
                  observer's awareness or appreciation of objects, processes or
                  situations in his environment mediated through their sensory organs.
                  2. An observer's descriptions, hypotheses or constructs of the world
                  of which they become thereby a part. [2] 3. To take notice of;
                  observe. [1]<br>While this definition does not capture this subtlety,
                  the term ground truth can mean either the actual situation being
                  abstracted by the simulation (the real world) or the situation
                  generated by the simulation itself (the simulated world).
                  Fortunately, the difference between ground truth and perceived truth
                  is more distinct. Perceived truth may be clouded by the effects of
                  sensors, judgement or, from the definition of perception, the process
                  of description. Considering the variations between different people's
                  judgement, it seems funny to call this truth at all but that is the
                  accepted definition.<br>The definition of truth, at least the first
                  four given above, stands squarely upon the definition of reality.
                  Ironically, the accepted definition of reality provides precious
                  little substance upon which truth can stand:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>reality</strong>. The quality or
                  state of being actual or true. [1]<br>The concept of real-world, an
                  often used term in modeling and simulation in the place of reality,
                  actually provides somewhat more information and supplements reality
                  nicely:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><strong>real-world</strong>. The set of
                  real or hypothetical causes and effects that simulation technology
                  attempts to replicate. [3] The real world defines one standard
                  against which fidelity is measured that includes both imagined
                  reality and material reality in order to accommodate assessment of
                  simulation fidelity when future concepts and systems are involved.
                  See fidelity, imagined reality, material reality, perceived truth.

              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">This definition introduces two
                  more terms in the cascade of definitions related to truth, material
                  reality and imagined reality. Dale Pace has proposed these terms to
                  distinguish realities that actually exist from those that we could
                  imagine to exist:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>material reality</strong>. The
                  material universe (or those parts of it) pertinent to a particular
                  purpose. [7]</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>imagined reality</strong>. A concept
                  that has no exact counterpart in the material universe although parts
                  of it may have counterparts in the material universe, e.g., a
                  unicorn. Imagined reality may have a nonzero intersection with
                  material reality, but can never be a proper subset of it. [5]</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br>As I understand these terms,
                  material reality comes from the universe that has been or can
                  currently be observed. Imagined reality comes from the set of
                  possible universes that could be observed. This distinction helps to
                  deal with simulations that represent the range of future possible
                  entities and situations that do not now exist in material form, for
                  example, a new weapons system concept. Imagined reality could also
                  apply to past or present situations that did not actually exist or
                  about which we have insufficient knowledge from which to construct a
                  representation of material reality.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">The current glossary draft
                  includes one more popular term describing reality, virtual
                  reality:<br><strong>virtual reality:</strong> 1. Also referred to as artificial
                  reality or synthetic reality. Virtual reality perceives a
                  participant's action in terms of the body's relationship to a graphic
                  world and generates responses that maintain the illusion that his
                  actions are taking place within that world. [8, 9] 2. The application
                  of integrated technologies to enable a participant to sense that he
                  or she is occupying, to some degree, an environment other than that
                  which he or she physically occupies. [8, 10]</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Virtual reality, like imagined
                  reality, exists solely within a simulation and the effects that
                  simulation generates to stimulate the observers' senses. Also like
                  imagined reality, virtual reality need not correspond to any form of
                  real reality or truth. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>That
                  elegantly pristine notion of truth that we were all taught as
                  children has now become a tangled web of dependencies,
                  inconsistencies and imprecise definitions</strong>. How could we
                  start at a better place in building the definitive glossary of
                  modeling and simulation terms? We simulationists have only
                  contributed to this morass of complexity by creating worlds
                  unconstrained by the physical universe with realities that depend
                  upon the properties of the windows we use to perceive them. These
                  capabilities permit us to create a situation when the perceived truth
                  of a virtual reality representing an imagined reality might indeed
                  fail all of the truth tests when compared to the real-world, an
                  example of when a truth is not a truth, a true riddle revealing the
                  vagaries of our language. Upon this foundation we will build a
                  vocabulary through which to communicate unambiguously!</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Your reply on 30 jan 1246</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: red;">What happened
              to your superior logic ? If your previous statement is already wrong , <strong>science is wrong already</strong> , and even if
              u correct it , u cannot negate the fact that it was wrong . Some theories are
              just so totally different and totally wrong that doesnt relect the truth. Like
              the Universe rotates around the Earth. Or how the Earth was Flat.  If this
              happens more then onec, there are probably theories right now that are probably
              wrong, so must accet the possibility of fallacy in thoeries now accepted as
              correct.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: red;">If that is the
              case, <strong>science CANT be body of truths</strong> , u have to accept possibilities that the theories may be wrong.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">U r talking about science before and after and using your “theories”
              as examples of why science could be wrong. U R THE LOSER WHO GIVE THE WRONG
              EXAMPLES OF SCIENTIFIC THREORY AND YOUR SCIENCE SUCKS !. Face it don’t deny la
              ! I thought u love to say Human make mistakes ? Just face it tat u made
              mistakes as well and your science level is pretty much lower</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Then u know wat is the whole problem ? it is with your
              question. For u, theories could be anything. So I answer unsure since I do not
              know wat is your definition of the word. I said u never prove any scientific
              theories to be wrong is just a statement.</p>

              IT just shocked me with your convictions that u could come up with UNSURE..</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">U don’t talk cock here la. Your questions asking people to answer
              things according to “yes” or “no”. U even refuse to let anyone elaborate on
              those points. Wat does tat show ? U see things as only black and white and ask
              silly unreasonable questions.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Hey, i am jsut showing u your
              exmaple of throwing in my crate of apples into the maserati engine. Now u agree
              with me how stupid it is right ? hahaha</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I put these examples as separated. I used your maserati
              engine in the right context without distortion. U distort my example
              completely. U just mixed body of student with mee pok and kway teow and tat is
              unacceptable. The only thing u show is your stupidity and inability to
              comprehend examples</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Is it YOUR definition of Truth or
              mine ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If it is different, u surely have to elaborate more and not
              avoid the topic altogether. And I have asked repeatedly and u refuse to answer
              it. R u a man ? U r not because u refuse to answer simple questions</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Because, like i said ,i believe
              mathematics numbers is a representation of quantities. And i just know that in
              reality, 1 + 1 does not always equal to 2. Thats why, to me, i do not view it
              as a truth. Mathematical Truth yes. But Truth to include representation of
              quantities , No</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Why is mathematic truth not the truth ? U claimed u said
              gravity I truth too however it do have a scope. So wat is the truth to u ?
              Nothing right ?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">One again, you are just stupid. All
              i am telling u is that 1+1 does NOT always EQUAL 2. If u read the words u will
              understand, and smart enough, to read between the lines you will understand.
              But u are too stupid. 1 apple + 1 orrange = 2 Fruits. U see it now ? It all
              depends on circumstances. You are just too stupid , and u cant link  them
              . U cant understand the reality.</span> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Again tat is rubbish. U r using the equation wrongly in the
              wrong context and tat is why u get garbage results. U r simply mixing chemistry/bio
              equation with maths</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Nothing, just an analogy. Whats
              yours with student and truth ? Just analogies right ? Why are u asking such a
              stupid question ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">So it has complete no links with each other right ? So the
              whole question is simply rubbish and a waste of time. Wat is the link with my
              analogy ? I stated many times already. We r talking about usage of the word
              body. And u know where I get the example from ? From the dictionary</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Body: a collective group: <span class="ital-inline">student
              body; corporate body</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Tis is a dictionary example of how to use the word body for
              a collective group. So u wanna say the dictionary is wrong in using student
              body as an example ?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: red;">O... O.. so what the fuck is this ? I said</span></strong><span style="color: red;"> <strong>LOGICALLY u know ? LOGIC ? not MATHS ? is 0 ? as in
              NOTHING ? NADA.. ZILCH ?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Wat is logical interpretation of dividing by zero ? U cannot
              come out with any answer at all except just repeat and repeat ! Elaborate !
              Show why dividing by zero is nothing ! Prove the wiki article on dividing by zero

              confused. U TELL ME!</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I told u liao. U r interpreting it as though it is a
              VARIABLE. Is a variable = undefined ? U r again fitting a maserati engine to a
              hyundal car. Two different items and u used the same concept to understand. Stupid
              right ?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Ifu read the Wikipedia article, it said</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>But there is another
              way to explain the division: if we want to find out how many people, which are
              satisfied with half an apple, can we satisfy with 1 apple, we divide 1 by 0.5.
              The answer is, of course, 2. Similarly, if we want to know how many people,
              which are satisfied with nothing, can we satisfy with 1 apple, we divide 1 by
              0. And <strong>the answer is any number; we can
              satisfy any number of people</strong>, that are satisfied with nothing, with 1
              apple.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It followed my idea of 0/0 and tat is could be anything.</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">U mean this ? Are u stupid ? What did i say that is
              contradictory ? Or are U trying to read it as contradictory ? Its obvious that
              i said acceleration of gravity on Earth and Moon are true, but not the TRUTH.

              <p><strong><em><span style="color: red;">OF
              COURSE. LIKED I SAID, IT DEPENDS ON CIRCUMSTANCES. Acceleration of Gravity is

              Its TRUE, i dont think of it as.. THE TRUTH.</span></em></strong><em><span style="color: red;"></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Tat is rubbish again. Acceleration of gravity is GRAVITY !
              Wat is gravity ? Acceleration on objects ! If tat is not truth, gravity is not
              truth ! Do u even know wat is gravity ?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Well, thats YOUR definition. I
              already said, i got NO problem.  U are making a statement. And i agree
              with your definition. What else u want ? My compliance ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Then you, claiming tat science only states the WHY AND HOW r
              not truth, is wrong ! The how and why r TRUTH since it is a true and real
              answer. If u disagree, then u have to elaborate your answer instead of avoiding
              it</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">One is <strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'>Mathematical Truth</span></strong>. The other
              is.. <strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'>THE</span></strong> TRUTH. Yes, to me there <strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'>IS</span></strong> a difference.  But like
              i said ,u are to stupid to understand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Again another rubbish statement. Mathematical is an
              adjective. The noun is “truth”. A mathematical truth is a truth. U r really too
              stupid to know how to use English</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Since when i said its THE TRUTH ? I
              am just showing ur stupid ass that Maths, is NOT PERFECT. Hence, i said again,
              Maths not about to do its job properly, and that is quantiy, FAILED, TAHTS WHY
              I CANT SEE 1+1 = 2 as THE TRUTH.. only as Mathematical Truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It doesn’t failed. U just anyhow throw in the wrong idea
              into the equation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Quite a while ago , <strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'>ppl believed that the earth was flat was true,
              true is subjective. Where Truth is absolute. U see now ? Thats it. Simple. U

              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><strong><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";'>It is being true and yet not

              <p class="MsoNormal">People believed it is true, but the fact is it is not. So
              your example shows tat the truth is earth is not flat, and the statement “earth
              was flat” was not true. SO it is again if it is not the truth, it could not be
              true.</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">GRAVITY = TRUTH, ACCELERATION OF GRAVITY = TRUE
              only.. not TRUTH. Simple.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">1+1  is mathematical truth. But not MY TRUTH.
              Thats why i seperate, MATHEMATICAL TRUTH and TRUTH ? U noticed ? lke LOGICAL
              TRUTH ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Gravity is in itself the acceleration. So rubbish</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Your truth is “actual existence”. 1+1 is a mathematical
              truth and works. And a mathematical truth is a truth.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: red;'>The
              starting point for this article was not obvious, at least to me. I began
              building it around the definitions of model, simulation and related terms but
              discovered that these depend upon an even deeper set of terms, those related to
              the notion of truth. Most models and simulations, even those used in
              entertainment, abstract their representations from some form of truth or
              reality and, in most cases, try to represent truth to some degree. Measurement
              of a simulation's fidelity depends significantly upon knowledge of the truth.
              Despite this reliance, the definitions of the term "truth" have all
              the properties of a riddle. They are both simple and complex, both obvious and
              subtle. The definitions used in the current draft glossary have two distinct
              flavors:</span><span style="color: red;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Why do u plagarise again ? Why do u always refuse to quote
              out where u get the source ? Do u know tat plagariser is no different from stealing
              and not giving due credit ? Furthermore, wat is the relevance of the quotation
              with respect to the discussion ? Why do u just stick and paste without
              elaborating and said which part of the article is relevant. The article is
              written by simulator, or in other words, for science. He also believe tat
              science is the exploration of truth and thus is still largely in line with my
              thinking.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There r differences in opinion. I agree with u. But u r the
              first tat goes around and scold people stupid when they do not agree with u. If

              <p>Wat talking u here ? R u saying astrologers do not have
                                  peer review ?</p>
              <p>Now u wanna talk about the point of definition of
                                  scientific method. Sure no problem. U just paste a definition there
                                  and plagarise without quoting the source. I do not know where u get
                                  tat idea so I said u could add peer review in. Is tat a problem ?
                                  Peer review has been seen as an important part of scientific

                                  it , u cannot negate the fact that it was wrong . Some theories are
                                  just so totally different and totally wrong that doesnt relect the
                                  truth. Like the Universe rotates around the Earth. Or how the Earth
                                  was Flat.  If this happens more then onec, there are probably
                                  theories right now that are probably wrong, so must accet the

              <p>U r talking about science before and after and using
                                  your “theories” as examples of why science could be wrong. U R THE

                                  means u dont know ur subject matter. Did i tell u that u CANT
                                  choose unsure ? DID I ? I accept it! IT just shocked me with your

              <p> </p>

                                  to answer things according to “yes” or “no”. U even refuse to let
                                  anyone elaborate on those points. Wat does tat show ? U see things
                                  as only black and white and ask silly unreasonable questions.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I put these examples as separated. I used your maserati
                                  engine in the right context without distortion. U distort my
                                  example completely. U just mixed body of student with mee pok and
                                  kway teow and tat is unacceptable. The only thing u show is your
                                  stupidity and inability to comprehend examples</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Is it YOUR definition of
                                  Truth or mine ?</span></p>
              <p>If it is different, u surely have to elaborate more and
                                  not avoid the topic altogether. And I have asked repeatedly and u
                                  refuse to answer it. R u a man ? U r not because u refuse to answer
                                  simple questions</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Because, like i said ,i
                                  believe mathematics numbers is a representation of quantities. And
                                  i just know that in reality, 1 + 1 does not always equal to 2.
                                  Thats why, to me, i do not view it as a truth. Mathematical Truth
                                  yes. But Truth to include representation of quantities ,
                                  No</span></p>
              <p>Why is mathematic truth not the truth ? U claimed u
                                  said gravity I truth too however it do have a scope. So wat is the
                                  truth to u ? Nothing right ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">One again, you are just
                                  stupid. All i am telling u is that 1+1 does NOT always EQUAL 2. If
                                  u read the words u will understand, and smart enough, to read
                                  between the lines you will understand. But u are too stupid. 1
                                  apple + 1 orrange = 2 Fruits. U see it now ? It all depends on
                                  circumstances. You are just too stupid , and u cant link  them
                                  . U cant understand the reality.</span> </p>
              <p>Again tat is rubbish. U r using the equation wrongly in
                                  the wrong context and tat is why u get garbage results. U r simply
                                  mixing chemistry/bio equation with maths</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Nothing, just an analogy.
                                  Whats yours with student and truth ? Just analogies right ? Why are
                                  u asking such a stupid question ?</span></p>
              <p>So it has complete no links with each other right ? So
                                  the whole question is simply rubbish and a waste of time. Wat is
                                  the link with my analogy ? I stated many times already. We r
                                  talking about usage of the word body. And u know where I get the
                                  example from ? From the dictionary</p>
              <p>Body: a collective group: <span>student body;
                                  corporate body</span></p>
              <p>Tis is a dictionary example of how to use the word body
                                  for a collective group. So u wanna say the dictionary is wrong in
                                  using student body as an example ?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: red;">O... O.. so what the fuck is

              <p>I told u liao. U r interpreting it as though it is a

                                  engine to a hyundal car. Two different items and u used the same
                                  concept to understand. Stupid right ?</p>
              <p>Ifu read the Wikipedia article, it said</p>
              <p><em>But there is another way to explain the division:
                                  if we want to find out how many people, which are satisfied with
                                  half an apple, can we satisfy with 1 apple, we divide 1 by 0.5. The
                                  answer is, of course, 2. Similarly, if we want to know how many
                                  people, which are satisfied with nothing, can we satisfy with 1
                                  apple, we divide 1 by 0. And <strong>the answer is any number; we
                                  can satisfy any number of people</strong>, that are satisfied with
                                  nothing, with 1 apple.</em></p>
              <p>It followed my idea of 0/0 and tat is could be
                                  anything.</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">U mean this ? Are u stupid ? What did
                                  i say that is contradictory ? Or are U trying to read it as
                                  contradictory ? Its obvious that i said acceleration of gravity on
                                  Earth and Moon are true, but not the TRUTH. But GRAVTY itself..
                                  is</span> <strong><span style="color: red;">TRUTH</span></strong><span style="color: red;">.</span></p>

                                  cant say its LIKE THAT, as Gravity on Earth and Moon are different.
                                  Its TRUE, i dont think of it as.. THE

              <p>Tat is rubbish again. Acceleration of gravity is
                                  GRAVITY ! Wat is gravity ? Acceleration on objects ! If tat is not
                                  truth, gravity is not truth ! Do u even know wat is gravity ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Well, thats YOUR definition.
                                  I already said, i got NO problem.  U are making a statement.
                                  And i agree with your definition. What else u want ? My compliance
                                  ?</span></p>
              <p>Then you, claiming tat science only states the WHY AND
                                  HOW r not truth, is wrong ! The how and why r TRUTH since it is a
                                  true and real answer. If u disagree, then u have to elaborate your
                                  answer instead of avoiding it</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">One is <strong><span>Mathematical Truth</span></strong>. The other is..
                                  <strong><span>THE</span></strong> TRUTH. Yes, to me there
                                  <strong><span>IS</span></strong> a difference.  But
                                  like i said ,u are to stupid to understand.</span></p>
              <p>Again another rubbish statement. Mathematical is an
                                  adjective. The noun is “truth”. A mathematical truth is a truth. U
                                  r really too stupid to know how to use English</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Since when i said its THE
                                  TRUTH ? I am just showing ur stupid ass that Maths, is NOT PERFECT.
                                  Hence, i said again, Maths not about to do its job properly, and
                                  that is quantiy, FAILED, TAHTS WHY I CANT SEE 1+1 = 2 as THE
                                  TRUTH.. only as Mathematical Truth.</span></p>
              <p>It doesn’t failed. U just anyhow throw in the wrong
                                  idea into the equation.</p>

                                  <strong><span>ppl believed that the earth was flat was
                                  true, true is subjective. Where Truth is absolute. U see now ?
                                  Thats it. Simple. U understand now ? True, subjective, Truth to me
                                  is absolute.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><em><strong><span>It is being true and yet not
                                  the truth. Tat doesn't make sense since if it is not the truth in
                                  the first place, it could not be true at
                                  all.</span></strong></em></p>
              <p>People believed it is true, but the fact is it is not.
                                  So your example shows tat the truth is earth is not flat, and the
                                  statement “earth was flat” was not true. SO it is again if it is
                                  not the truth, it could not be true.</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">GRAVITY = TRUTH, ACCELERATION OF
                                  GRAVITY = TRUE only.. not TRUTH. Simple.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">1+1  is mathematical truth. But
                                  not MY TRUTH. Thats why i seperate, MATHEMATICAL TRUTH and TRUTH ?
                                  U noticed ? lke LOGICAL TRUTH ?</span></p>
              <p>Gravity is in itself the acceleration. So rubbish</p>
              <p>Your truth is “actual existence”. 1+1 is a mathematical
                                  truth and works. And a mathematical truth is a truth.</p>
              <p><span>The starting point for this article was
                                  not obvious, at least to me. I began building it around the
                                  definitions of model, simulation and related terms but discovered
                                  that these depend upon an even deeper set of terms, those related
                                  to the notion of truth. Most models and simulations, even those
                                  used in entertainment, abstract their representations from some
                                  form of truth or reality and, in most cases, try to represent truth
                                  to some degree. Measurement of a simulation's fidelity depends
                                  significantly upon knowledge of the truth. Despite this reliance,
                                  the definitions of the term "truth" have all the properties of a
                                  riddle. They are both simple and complex, both obvious and subtle.
                                  The definitions used in the current draft glossary have two
                                  distinct flavors:</span></p>

              <p>Why do u plagarise again ? Why do u always refuse to
                                  quote out where u get the source ? Do u know tat plagariser is no
                                  different from stealing and not giving due credit ? Furthermore,
                                  wat is the relevance of the quotation with respect to the
                                  discussion ? Why do u just stick and paste without elaborating and
                                  said which part of the article is relevant. The article is written
                                  by simulator, or in other words, for science. He also believe tat
                                  science is the exploration of truth and thus is still largely in
                                  line with my thinking.</p>
              <p>There r differences in opinion. I agree with u. But u r
                                  the first tat goes around and scold people stupid when they do not
                                  agree with u. If u agree with difference in opinion, u wouldn’t
                                  scold people for your vague statement on science unable to discern
                                  truth.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why u avoid answering tis point ? I thought u require
                                  everybody to answer all your questions otherwise they r not a man
                                  ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Facts changes over time, depending on information we get... the TRUTH... which is Absolute.. is FOREVER. You see fact as YOUR truth, but to me , fact is fact. Its like the flat earth theory. People believe it as said it was the truth and a fact, but the point is, the earth will remain round even if ALL the people in the world says its flat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Think of it this way. Its an analogy. Exmaple: If all believe in the theory of evolution, and God was actually the one that created everthing, it doesnt change the Truth that God was the one that created everything. Even if EVERYONE in the word thinks it so. Its not going to change that truth.</span></p>

              <p>Wat talking u here ? R u saying astrologers do not have
                                  peer review ?</p>
              <p>Now u wanna talk about the point of definition of
                                  scientific method. Sure no problem. U just paste a definition there
                                  and plagarise without quoting the source. I do not know where u get
                                  tat idea so I said u could add peer review in. Is tat a problem ?
                                  Peer review has been seen as an important part of scientific
                                  method.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">No,  u were the one that said, those theories are not scientific. I am just pointing out to you, that is. Like even astrologers, they all went through peer review. And if few hundred years ago, the astronomy today is still based on astrologers of the time. Like how Chemistry is still  based upon Alchemy.</span></p>
              <p>U just paste a definition there
                                  and plagarise without quoting the source. I do not know where u get
                                  tat idea so I said u could add peer review in.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What u talking about adding peer review in it ? I got <strong>no problem</strong> with you saying u wanna add peer review in it ,i am just telling u that u seem to be able to add definitions, but not me.Another case of  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOU CAN I CANT</strong></span> again.</span></p>

              <p>U r talking about science before and after and using

                                  SCIENCE SUCKS !. Face it don’t deny la ! I thought u love to say
                                  Human make mistakes ? Just face it tat u made mistakes as well and
                                  your science level is pretty much lower</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Does science make mistakes ? YES or

              <p>So, what did i say wrong ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes i admit , humans man mistakes, but i clearly did NOT make a mistake here. Even after u admited that Science makes mistakes. Thats why my earlier point, is still correct. Just that u only admitted in Science can be wrong, as in make mistakes after.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then u know wat is the whole problem ? it is with your
                                  question. For u, theories could be anything. So I answer unsure
                                  since I do not know wat is your definition of the word. I said u
                                  never prove any scientific theories to be wrong is just a
                                  statement.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So, yeah, didnt i tell u what theories were ? They are... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory">Theories</a> . I even showed u in wiki, </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is it my fault that u are too stupid ? <strong>Theories is an even MORE EASY question then scientific theories</strong>. U even asked for scientific theories. So NOW another <strong>U CAN I CANT</strong>, even when u asked for it, now u say i cant. <strong>* BRAVO !! BRAAAVO !!*</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Has Theories been wrong

              <p>U don’t talk cock here la. Your questions asking people
                                  to answer things according to “yes” or “no”. U even refuse to let
                                  anyone elaborate on those points. Wat does tat show ? U see things
                                  as only black and white and ask silly unreasonable questions.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I accepted your elaborations didnt I ? DID I ? So , u yourself answered an <strong>UNSURE </strong>for the <strong>easiest question regarding science and theories</strong>, and  now u blame me, for asking u a simple question u cant answer. Thats why i came to the conclusion that u just <strong>DONT KNOW UR SUBJECT MATTER AT ALL</strong></span><strong>.</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">What happened to all that <strong>BIG TALK and DAMN SURE COMMITMENT  and that "I AM WRONG U ARE RIGHT" and all that BLUSTERY ? </strong>So should understand, why u cant really blame me for coming to that conclusion after all that tough talk right ?</span></p>
              <p>I put these examples as separated. I used your maserati
                                  engine in the right context without distortion. U distort my
                                  example completely. U just mixed body of student with mee pok and
                                  kway teow and tat is unacceptable. The only thing u show is your
                                  stupidity and inability to comprehend examples</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">*CLAP CLAP CLAP* so now I DISTORT your examples.. wow... WOW... <strong>again </strong>, <strong>YOU CAN.. I CANT... "I AM WRONG U ARE RIGHT"</strong> BRAVO.. *clap clap clap* BRAVO !!! Oh.. so now I am stupid ? lol.. </span></p>
              <p>If it is different, u surely have to elaborate more and
                                  not avoid the topic altogether. And I have asked repeatedly and u
                                  refuse to answer it. R u a man ? U r not because u refuse to answer
                                  simple questions</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why should i even avoid or elaborate ? If u are already so stupid, what else can i say ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Just to entertain you, like i said , your definition ? or Mine ? because i know ur bullshit, so, I have to be sure, which defintion ? tell me. Is it collection of knowledge ? Ur truth ? my truth ? which one ? Its not about being chicken, I was never the one with the trick questions. Dont forget. Its you.</span></p>
              <p>Why is mathematic truth not the truth ? U claimed u
                                  said gravity I truth too however it do have a scope. So wat is the
                                  truth to u ? Nothing right ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mathemematical Truth , in case u dont understand. My truth is absolute. I am talking in terms you can understand, do u understand ? I am hoping, that u do. Its very simple, its not that i dont understand any other definition of the truth. I am trying to talk YOUR language. But u keep thinking i am trying to trick your ass. Because u seem to have a problem grasping my truth ? Truth to me.. is Absolute Existence. I already highligheted to you. Things that are Absolute. Thats it. So simple. U see.. things, that exist regardless of our comprehension, our belief or our perception. LIke.. GRAVITY. The simples example.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Example: Earth is round, regardless if ALL the people think its flat. Doesnt matter. It doesnt have to do with our beliefs, perception etc. Where else Maths, changes over time. The example was Godel's Theorem. Admitted that it was incomplete. Maths changes over time. Like science. These things i do not consider absolute, because, they are <strong>NOT ABSOLUTE</strong>. <strong>Kapish </strong>?</span></p>
              <p>Again tat is rubbish. U r using the equation wrongly in
                                  the wrong context and tat is why u get garbage results. U r simply
                                  mixing chemistry/bio equation with maths</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats my point. Do u get it now ? U KEEP answering the question urself . I dont get it. U seem to answer urself, but u dont get it ? Thats why i came to the conclusion that u are stupid. </span></p>
              <p>So it has complete no links with each other right ? So
                                  the whole question is simply rubbish and a waste of time. Wat is
                                  the link with my analogy ? I stated many times already. We r
                                  talking about usage of the word body. And u know where I get the
                                  example from ? From the dictionary</p>

                                  corporate body</span></p>
              <p>Tis is a dictionary example of how to use the word body
                                  for a collective group. So u wanna say the dictionary is wrong in
                                  using student body as an example ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Crate of apples = ur body of truths. If u dont agree, u dont have to. Different engine part = differences in defintion of truth. The core belief. The core issue, like the heart of the engine. Do u own a car ? If u own a sports car before, u should be well aware of cars and thier engines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am just using analogies too. Are u trying to say , that analogies can only come out from dictionary ? So, ur meepok ? whats that ? ur milk ? Isnt that analogies too ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Again, i told u ,I dont always follow dictionary.com. I have a brain. If u want to, its up to you.</span></p>
              <p>Wat is logical interpretation of dividing by zero ? U
                                  cannot come out with any answer at all except just repeat and
                                  repeat ! Elaborate ! Show why dividing by zero is nothing ! Prove
                                  the wiki article on dividing by zero is wrong when it said it has
                                  no logical meaning!</p>
              <p>logical interpretation of dividing by zero ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">0 = Nothing divides by 0 = nothing equals Nothing logically. Can u understand that ? I have NOTHING ... and i want to divide by NOTHING... so obviously, u get NOTHING.  So do u understand now ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Again, u have two different answers to the same question. I am trying to find out which answer it is.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">All i am trying to figure out is, is <strong>Zero</strong> in the answer. Thats it. Yes or No. IT seems to me u are just trying to avoid the question.

              <p><em>But there is another way to explain the division:
                                  if we want to find out how many people, which are satisfied with
                                  half an apple, can we satisfy with 1 apple, we divide 1 by 0.5. The
                                  answer is, of course, 2. Similarly, if we want to know how many
                                  people, which are satisfied with nothing, can we satisfy with 1
                                  apple, we divide 1 by 0. And <strong>the answer is any number; we
                                  can satisfy any number of people</strong>, that are satisfied with
                                  nothing, with 1 apple.</em></p>
              <p>It followed my idea of 0/0 and tat is could be
                                  anything.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I got no problem with the statements.  Right now, this is NOT the point. My point is, plesae, tell me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1) Zero to Infinity ? </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Or </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) Does the graph touch Zero ? No .<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ZERO or NO ZERO? Thats it.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Tat is rubbish again. Acceleration of gravity is
                                                          GRAVITY ! Wat is gravity ? Acceleration on objects ! If tat is not
                                                          truth, gravity is not truth ! Do u even know wat is gravity ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I told you already. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gravity </span>to me.. is what goes UP must come DOWN</strong>. <strong>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">acceleration </span>is the part of the HOW and WHY</strong>. Thats all. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And yes, i know what is gravity.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Once again, u are basing gravity in YOUR definition of truth, not mine. Thats all.</span></p>
              <p>Again another rubbish statement. Mathematical is an
                                                          adjective. The noun is “truth”. A mathematical truth is a truth. U
                                                          r really too stupid to know how to use English</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hey, if u want to use ur almighty grammar to talk like that, go ahead. Once again, i NEVER have any problem with YOUR beliefs. If u want to drive a hyundai, drive a hyundai. I personally, prefer to drive my Maserati. Thats all. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong></strong> </span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It doesn’t failed. U just anyhow throw in the wrong
                                                          idea into the equation.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Well, i explained again and again, if philosophers and intellectuals understood the subtle differences, I dont really have to persuade you. You dont accept my explaination, its up to you. Thats all. </span></p>
              <p>People believed it is true, but the fact is it is not.
                                                          So your example shows tat the truth is earth is not flat, and the
                                                          statement “earth was flat” was not true. SO it is again if it is
                                                          not the truth, it could not be true.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>TELL IT TO THE PEOPLE BACK IN THE DAY</strong>. RIght now, u are basing all your judgement and knowledge you have, at THIS TIME. 100 years later, things might be different. We dont know. Thats why, i personally dont believe, True = Truth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">To me, True is subjective, Truth is Absolute . Regardless of what people think. </span></p>
              <p>Why do u plagarise again ? Why do u always refuse to
                                                          quote out where u get the source ? Do u know tat plagariser is no

                                                          discussion ? Why do u just stick and paste without elaborating and

                                      was pointed out to u many times tat the meaning u quote is the same
                                      as a collection of truth. Natural phenomena is a
                                      <strong>fact</strong>, occurrence, or circumstance observed or
                                      observable. And <strong>fact</strong> is still
                                      <strong>truth</strong>. All these r from the dictionary, which u
                                      quote “science” and “truth”. SO after all the hogwash about
                                      defining science, u still go back to the same definition. We could
                                      substitute the words in your example with the words and have no
                                      loss in meaning</span></p>

              <p><em>If all believe in the theory of evolution, and God
                                      was actually the one that created everthing, it doesnt change the
                                      FACT that God was the one that created everything. Even if EVERYONE
                                      in the word thinks it so. Its not going to change that

                                      I used it to exaplain some of my points to u. A crate of apples and
                                      science r completely different things, like Hyundai engine and
                                      Maserati engine. Your example is forcing two different things
                                      together which is wrong.</p>
              <p>And if u r also comparing engines with people values of

                                      truth r also different topics as well and forcing them together is

                                      different time phrase. U claim tat theory of gravity is a theory
                                      and thus u cannot accept it as truth. U claimed tat gravity is
                                      truth afterwards. Later u claim again tat acceleration of gravity
                                      is not truth again and said acceleration of gravity is not gravity.
                                      Tat shows how terrible your science standard is again. The
                                      acceleration of gravity is the effect of gravity. Why r they
                                      different ? Again u avoid the topic altogether.</p>
              <p>Then u claimed tat 1+1 is a mathematical truth then
                                      later say it is not truth. Isn’t a mathematical truth, truth ? U
                                      said tat truth to u is absolute. Then “mathematical truth” should
                                      be absolute to u too since u use it after “mathematical”. If u say
                                      they r different, then it means one thing. Your definition of
                                      “truth” changes whenever u pleased. There is no consistency in your
                                      language</p>
              <p>U also claimed tat science can never come out with the
                                      truth. Later u amend and say tat science could come out with truth.
                                      U just keep changing your stand repeatedly throughout the whole

                                      divide by zero is nothing. Tat is again rubbish because there is no
                                      logical meaning in dividing by zero. Even if u use zero, nothing,
                                      NIL, ZILCH, to <strong>divide by zero</strong>, there is still no
                                      logical meaning to it BECAUSE THERE IS NO LOGICAL INTERPRETATION
                                      WITH DIVIDING BY ZERO. U create a big boo boo and disgrace yourself
                                      again.</p>
              <p>After which u start to attack me with the graph. I told
                                      u repeatedly tat it is undefined, and tat it could be anything.
                                      Then u claimed it is wrong because anything means “anything” u know
                                      or I know. Tat is rubbish. U claimed it never cut the graph at
                                      zero. I told u repeatedly tat u r treating it as a variableand
                                      expect it to cut the graph. Fact is it shouldn’t. The graph at 0 is
                                      really at –ve infinity to infinity. And again the idea of
                                      “anything” comes from Wikipedia itself</p>
              <p><em><span>But there is another way to explain
                                      the division: if we want to find out how many people, which are
                                      satisfied with half an apple, can we satisfy with 1 apple, we
                                      divide 1 by 0.5. The answer is, of course, 2. Similarly, if we want
                                      to know how many people, which are satisfied with nothing, can we
                                      satisfy with 1 apple, we divide 1 by 0. And</span></em> <strong><em><span>the answer is any number; we can satisfy

                                      are satisfied with nothing, with 1 apple.</span></em></p>
              <p>However again u void the point and repeat. It really

              <p>U paste and stick many many articles on truth and I
                                      have been asking u repeatedly tis question. Wat is the relevance
                                      with the topic here ? Wat is your definition ? U CANNOT EVEN PUT IT
                                      CONCISELY IN WORDS. And whenever u have something u cannot answer,
                                      u just barrow your head in and say your definition of truth
                                      differs. In your last article, u claim tat my truth is</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>the fourth
                                      definition</span></span></strong><strong><span>(Your

                                      seekers</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Says who ? U don't even know wat is my definition of truth after all tis while ! My definition is tat truth is simply a noun
                                      for “true” or an objective true. And tat it is basically something
                                      tat is not shown to be false. Your idea of truth and mine may be
                                      very similar, it is just tat u refuse to define or state it out and
                                      u keep adding in your own ideas.</p>
              <p> </p>

                                      tat science is wrong before and thus not truth</span></strong></p>
              <p>Tis is an old problem with your logic before. We may
                                      believe the same “truth” but to u, if science is ever wrong, then
                                      science is never about truth. To me, if it is not proven wrong,
                                      then it remains as truth. We could hold the same definition of
                                      “truth” here (it is an objective true) but we reached different
                                      conclusions. U stereotype and condemn all the theories and laws in
                                      it just because it had been proven wrong before. If some theories
                                      had been wrong, u treat everything in the scientific organization
                                      like Einstein and Newton as wrong and thus not the truth.</p>
              <p>I however believe each is based on its own observation
                                      and <strong>evidences</strong> and tat it is logical, make
                                      <strong>things worked</strong>, it is repeatable etc give me enough
                                      grounds to believe it is the TRUTH, the ABSOLUTE TRUTH. If it turns
                                      out to be wrong in the end, it is okay. As wat u said, human errs.
                                      I just simply erred in trusting it to be truth. But nevertheless, I
                                      still treat it as truth unless it is proven wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yeah u can keep sticking and pasting the same
                                      arguments. Because it is obvious tat u r avoiding the topic and
                                      refuse to answer my point despite repeat attempts. Watever I said,
                                      u just cover your ears and refuse to answer anything. I think there
                                      is no point in talking with such a person now. U wanna say I am
                                      stupid, or whatever, is up to u. Maybe u had obtained final victory
                                      now as I find debating with a person who does not answer people’s
                                      point as fruitful as talking to a brick wall and thus give up.</p>

              <p style="line-height: normal;"><span>However it was pointed out to
                                          u many times tat the meaning u quote is the same as a collection of
                                          truth. Natural phenomena is a <strong>fact</strong>, occurrence, or
                                          circumstance observed or observable. And <strong>fact</strong> is
                                          still <strong>truth</strong>. All these r from the dictionary,
                                          which u quote “science” and “truth”. SO after all the hogwash about
                                          defining science, u still go back to the same definition. We could
                                          substitute the words in your example with the words and have no
                                          loss in meaning</span></p>

              <p><em>If all believe in the theory of evolution, and God was
                                          actually the one that created everthing, it doesnt change the FACT
                                          that God was the one that created everything. Even if EVERYONE in

              <p>Now tell me why is the difference between your definition and
                                          the dictionary definition of the science ? U said the dictionary

                                          totally wrong that doesnt relect the truth. Like the Universe

              <p>U know wat ? YOUR EXAMPLES R WRONG. THEY r not scientific
                                          theories at all. And u cannot pretend and say u r not talking about
                                          scientific theories. U states science is wrong, and give examples
                                          of “theories” tat went wrong and conclude tat because of your
                                          examples, science can’t be body of truth. Tis shows how bad your
                                          standard of science is because u cannot tell pseudoscience from
                                          science.</p>
              <p>Thus when u write an unexplained word theory in the question, I
                                          simply answer “Unsure”. And I ask u to quote a scientific theory
                                          tat went wrong. Is tat wrong ? Who know wat is your definition of
                                          theory ? U change the definition of the words “truth”, “science”
                                          “fact” and give off wrong examples of scientific theories. What is
                                          wrong with saying “unsure” in tis case ? However again u exaggerate
                                          and make a big hoo haa over nothing</p>

                                          there is a whole field of people doing on thermodynamics. U also
                                          claimed tat the acceleration of gravity is different from gravity.

                                          and How but they r not truth. However if the answers are, according

              <p>U claim things could be true, but not the truth. Tat means u r

                                          the same time. Tat is a contradictory idea since things tat were

              <p>I stated the following examples.</p>
              <p>A body of student compared with a body of truth. The usage of
                                          the words are the same and it is the dictionary example of how to
                                          use the word body</p>
              <p>Some things could be tolerated while other cannot. Most people
                                          would accept changes like HL mlik over daisy low fat milk without
                                          problem at all. Tis is in contrast with your example of motors</p>
              <p>U state the following examples:</p>
              <p>Maserati engine could not be fitted to a Hyundai engine. U r
                                          trying to highlight different things/people could not be fitted to
                                          one another</p>
              <p>A crate of apples with some bad one in it. U wanna refer it to
                                          science and their body of truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since u r so familiar with your example of the engines, I used
                                          it to exaplain some of my points to u. A crate of apples and
                                          science r completely different things, like Hyundai engine and
                                          Maserati engine. Your example is forcing two different things
                                          together which is wrong.</p>
              <p>And if u r also comparing engines with people values of truth.
                                          Using your example, it also highlight tat the engine and truth r
                                          also different topics as well and forcing them together is out of
                                          point</p>
              <p>Then u said tat TWIST my example of <span style="color: red;">Student body consist of MEEPOK and Kueh Tiaaw</span> and completely said I practice unfair standard. U can use my
                                          examples, no problem. Of course u have to use it wisely. If u
                                          cannot use it wisely, u shouldn’t resort to twisting people example
                                          by combining them together. Tat is just shameless</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span><span>7)<span>  </span></span></span> Contradictory statements</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U claimed tat gravity is truth, and not truth during different
                                          time phrase. U claim tat theory of gravity is a theory and thus u
                                          cannot accept it as truth. U claimed tat gravity is truth
                                          afterwards. Later u claim again tat acceleration of gravity is not
                                          truth again and said acceleration of gravity is not gravity. Tat
                                          shows how terrible your science standard is again. The acceleration
                                          of gravity is the effect of gravity. Why r they different ? Again u
                                          avoid the topic altogether.</p>
              <p>Then u claimed tat 1+1 is a mathematical truth then later say it
                                          is not truth. Isn’t a mathematical truth, truth ? U said tat truth
                                          to u is absolute. Then “mathematical truth” should be absolute to u
                                          too since u use it after “mathematical”. If u say they r different,
                                          then it means one thing. Your definition of “truth” changes
                                          whenever u pleased. There is no consistency in your language</p>
              <p>U also claimed tat science can never come out with the truth.
                                          Later u amend and say tat science could come out with truth. U just
                                          keep changing your stand repeatedly throughout the whole thread</p>

              <p>Tis is again another joke u created. U claimed tat 0/0 shows tat
                                          maths is not truth. However it is labeled as a fallacy and it is
                                          nonetheless truth to the physical world. U claimed tat 0 divide by
                                          zero is nothing. Tat is again rubbish because there is no logical
                                          meaning in dividing by zero. Even if u use zero, nothing, NIL,
                                          ZILCH, to <strong>divide by zero</strong>, there is still no
                                          logical meaning to it BECAUSE THERE IS NO LOGICAL INTERPRETATION
                                          WITH DIVIDING BY ZERO. U create a big boo boo and disgrace yourself
                                          again.</p>
              <p>After which u start to attack me with the graph. I told u
                                          repeatedly tat it is undefined, and tat it could be anything. Then
                                          u claimed it is wrong because anything means “anything” u know or I
                                          know. Tat is rubbish. U claimed it never cut the graph at zero. I
                                          told u repeatedly tat u r treating it as a variableand expect it to
                                          cut the graph. Fact is it shouldn’t. The graph at 0 is really at
                                          –ve infinity to infinity. And again the idea of “anything” comes
                                          from Wikipedia itself</p>
              <p><em><span>But there is another way to explain the division: if

                                          “true” or an objective true. And tat it is basically something tat
                                          is not shown to be false. Your idea of truth and mine may be very
                                          similar, it is just tat u refuse to define or state it out and u
                                          keep adding in your own ideas.</p>

              <p>Tis is an old problem with your logic before. We may believe the
                                          same “truth” but to u, if science is ever wrong, then science is
                                          never about truth. To me, if it is not proven wrong, then it
                                          remains as truth. We could hold the same definition of “truth” here
                                          (it is an objective true) but we reached different conclusions. U
                                          stereotype and condemn all the theories and laws in it just because
                                          it had been proven wrong before. If some theories had been wrong, u
                                          treat everything in the scientific organization like Einstein and
                                          Newton as wrong and thus not the truth.</p>
              <p>I however believe each is based on its own observation and
                                          <strong>evidences</strong> and tat it is logical, make
                                          <strong>things worked</strong>, it is repeatable etc give me enough
                                          grounds to believe it is the TRUTH, the ABSOLUTE TRUTH. If it turns
                                          out to be wrong in the end, it is okay. As wat u said, human errs.
                                          I just simply erred in trusting it to be truth. But nevertheless, I
                                          still treat it as truth unless it is proven wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yeah u can keep sticking and pasting the same arguments.
                                          Because it is obvious tat u r avoiding the topic and refuse to
                                          answer my point despite repeat attempts. Watever I said, u just
                                          cover your ears and refuse to answer anything. I think there is no
                                          point in talking with such a person now. U wanna say I am stupid,
                                          or whatever, is up to u. Maybe u had obtained final victory now as
                                          I find debating with a person who does not answer people’s point as
                                          fruitful as talking to a brick wall and thus give up.</p>

              <p>However it was pointed out to u many times tat the meaning u
                                          	quote is the same as a collection of truth. Natural phenomena is a
                                          	<strong>fact</strong>, occurrence, or circumstance observed or
                                          	observable. And <strong>fact</strong> is still <strong>truth</strong>.
                                          	All these r from the dictionary, which u quote “science” and
                                          	“truth”. SO after all the hogwash about defining science, u
                                          	still go back to the same definition. We could substitute the words
                                          	in your example with the words and have no loss in meaning</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Very simple. Again, Fact to me is Fact.
                                          	True is True. True and Facts are subjectives and subject to change
                                          	over time. Subject to our knowledge and perception. However, Truth
                                          	on the other hand, is absolute. Regardless of our preception,
                                          	regardless of our knowledge, regardless of anything, Truth is out
                                          	there, it is absolute. Dont forget, I am not aiming for your truth
                                          	and that is true = truth. I am aiming for a higher truth.</span></p>
              <p> <em>If all believe in the theory of evolution, and God was
                                          	actually the one that created everthing, it doesnt change the FACT
                                          	that God was the one that created everything. Even if EVERYONE in
                                          	the word thinks it so. Its not going to change that FACT</em></p>
              <p> Now tell me why is the difference between your definition and the
                                          	dictionary definition of the science ? U said the dictionary
                                          	definition of “truth” is wrong yet u use their definition. U
                                          	claimed tat people r shallow in following dictionary strictly yet u
                                          	use the dictionary definition of “science”. U r just having
                                          	double standards isn’t it ?</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Its very simple really. I question
                                          	everything, I learn and read, I reasearch and study.My degrees in
                                          	different fields showed me the inconsistencies of Truth, hence my
                                          	belief in the meaning of science. So, to me, I have come to a
                                          	realisation that sometimes, the dictionary doesnt explain
                                          	everything. Hence, I categorise my things as u will see as I explain
                                          	further.  So , some I will accept  in the dictionary, but some I
                                          	dont, then comes the issue of Truth. Now truth has been a very
                                          	interesting topic since my philosophy years. If u accuse me of
                                          	double standard, I dont blame you, because you are having double
                                          	standards too. As I reply, u will notice ur double standard and pot
                                          	calling kettle black.</span></p>

              <p> <em>What happened to your superior logic ? If your previous

                                          	wrong that doesnt relect the truth. Like the Universe rotates around

              <p><em>If that is the case,</em> <em>science CANT be body of truths</em> <em>, u have to accept possibilities that the theories may be wrong.</em></p>

                                          	theory ? U change the definition of the words “truth”, “science”
                                          	“fact” and give off wrong examples of scientific theories. What
                                          	is wrong with saying “unsure” in tis case ? However again u
                                          	exaggerate and make a big hoo haa over nothing</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Even if they are not scientific theories to
                                          	you, even though I regard it as theories nevertheless, The
                                          	pre-Socratic philosophers rejected traditional mythological
                                          	explanations of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon">phenomena</a> they saw around them in favor of more rational explanations. These
                                          	philosophers asked questions about "the essence of things , so
                                          	they agreed between scholars and intellectuals at the time of the
                                          	flat earth theory. Back in the day, did it not go through peer
                                          	review and scrutiny ? </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I make a big HOO HAA.. because, u talk so
                                          	much about how right u are in science, accepting it as a body of
                                          	truths, but u are not even sure whether theories have been wrong
                                          	before, so I came to the conclusion that you really dont know ur
                                          	subject matter well at all.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">4)   Scientific Level</span></strong></p>
              <p>Unlike someone, I admit tat I do not know everything about
                                          	science. However compared to u, it is adequate. First u give wrong
                                          	scientific theories. Next u claim tat the laws of thermodynamics r
                                          	wrong in the reply on 4<sup>th</sup> Feb 531pm</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">U know anything about Thermodynamics ? When
                                          	we were in primary and secondary schools, what did the teachers
                                          	teach us. Compare it to what UNI taught us. First thing the lecturer
                                          	said was "WHAT U KNOW ABOUT THERMODYNAMICS.. IS WRONG.. THIS IS
                                          	THE REAL STUFF"</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_state_theory">Transition
                                          	State Theory</a>.</p>
              <p> Tis is wrong. Thermodynamics is still relevant today. In fact
                                          	there is a whole field of people doing on thermodynamics. U also
                                          	claimed tat the acceleration of gravity is different from gravity.
                                          	They r actually the same</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">When did I say wrong theories are not
                                          	useful anymore ? Being wrong doesnt mean they will cease all utility
                                          	function right ? Wrong just means its not the Truth. It may still
                                          	work in a controlled environment or within its scope. But it can
                                          	still be applied within the boundries of its given rules. Like
                                          	Newtons law, wrong, but it still serves a useful utility function in
                                          	the given context. It doesnt mean it was discarded and totally not
                                          	used. U get it now ?</span></p>
              <p> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">5)   Avoiding of issues</span></strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">A lot of questions U have left unanswered
                                          	as well. But u have not answered them for a long time, so I just
                                          	overlook them, and focus on the core questions.</span></p>
              <p><em>Do u agree tat a collective collection of truth studied
                                          	together can enhance the understanding of the subject ?</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> ANS</span></p>
              <p><em>Why do u claim tat truth like 1+1 must work for all
                                          	circumstances according to your definition? Why can’t it be true
                                          	in a certain snapshot make it truth ?</em></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">ANS</span></p>
              <p>Isn’t true and real answer to a question the truth ? I ask u if
                                          	u have an sgforum nick Badzmaro and u said yes, tat answer is the
                                          	truth already isn’t it ? U state tat science can only answer Why
                                          	and How but they r not truth. However if the answers are, according
                                          	to u correct, then the answers itself r truth</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nope. Science is the why and how,
                                          	unravelling the mysteries of the universe. Because the How and Why
                                          	can be wrong, hence I do not see it as the Truth. For something that
                                          	can have possibilities of being wrong, I can never see it as a
                                          	higher standard of Truth, and that is Truth in its absolute terms.</span></p>
              <p>U claim things could be true, but not the truth. Tat means u r
                                          	proposing there r things in the world tat is true but not truth at
                                          	the same time. Tat is a contradictory idea since things tat were not
                                          	truth, will not be true. Again u refuse to answer to tis</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, things could be true, but NOT the
                                          	Truth. Yes. Facts and True things changes. They are subjective. What
                                          	we base on now may be wrong in the future, hence I am not so fast as
                                          	to jump to the conclusion that it is the Truth! Simple. Like it is
                                          	True that u are stupid, given the evidence to support my theory of
                                          	your stupidity, but it may NOT be the Truth. Get it ? Things that
                                          	are Truth may not be true. e.g again, Truth that earth is round,
                                          	true that is is flat and everyone believes it so and thinks and says
                                          	its true. But Truth doesnt change. It is absolute regardless of
                                          	perception , belief and knowledge. </span></p>
              <p> And how u avoid the question, u just say your definition of truth
                                          	in different. It is precisely tat it is different, then u should
                                          	elaborate why it should elaborate and answer. U said “truth” =
                                          	actual existence right ? Then reconcile with the above statements
                                          	otherwise u r just a person with no balls and run away from topics</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, I have a higher standard ot Truth. If
                                          	u cannot grasp it and see the separation, its up to you. U can
                                          	believe in your true = truth.  I am a person with plenty of big
                                          	balls. I can equally say you are the one with no balls if u want to talk about
                                          	avoiding questions and not answering them.</span></p>

              <p>I stated the following examples.</p>
              <p>A body of student compared with a body of truth. The usage of the
                                          	words are the same and it is the dictionary example of how to use
                                          	the word body</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I personally think crate of a good apples is better due to the differences of definitions of truth.
                                          	Because like I said, your definition of science consists of body of
                                          	truths. To me, if truths are wrong, it can never be truths. So I
                                          	simply gave u an example of an analogy to see things in my
                                          	perspective. But u cant. U cant see why I cannot accept it. I
                                          	already said, crate of good apples must consists of crate of good
                                          	apples. Body of Truths, MUST consists of body of my definition of
                                          	Truths. If it says Mostly body of truths, I may accept. However it
                                          	fails, hence I cannot accept science as Body of Truths. But if u can
                                          	, good for you. Did I say u cant ? </span></p>

              <p>Some things could be tolerated while other cannot. Most people
                                          	would accept changes like HL mlik over daisy low fat milk without
                                          	problem at all. Tis is in contrast with your example of motors</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oh, so, u can tolerate my maserati engine
                                          	part into your hyundai engine part resulting in your car not even
                                          	working at all. If thats what u meant, I got no problem. I
                                          	personally cant. I need my engine, my car to be functioning
                                          	according to specifications. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It seems to u to say MOST people. Am I MOST people
                                          	? If I eat my Kobe beef, I wanted rare, and u gave me wagynu rare,
                                          	or I requested NO sauce and u added me some sauce, its NOT
                                          	ACCEPTABLE TO ME. Like ur Meepok example, if there is NO kueh tiaw,
                                          	or Meepok, I will NOT eat the meepok or kuehtiaw, unless I am
                                          	desperate and nothing to eat, I may accept it. But I will NOT
                                          	consider myself eating meepok or kueh tiaw, its two different dish,
                                          	two kinds of taste. And yes, even if particular milk brands and low
                                          	fat, I am still particular. Thats why, this again shows that you can
                                          	easily accept what it is. I personally have my own beliefs, my own
                                          	set of principles , my own understanding, and most importablty I know what I want.</span></p>
              <p>U state the following examples:</p>
              <p>Maserati engine could not be fitted to a Hyundai engine. U r
                                          	trying to highlight different things/people could not be fitted to
                                          	one another</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am trying to highlight differences in
                                          	beliefs. The core belief and that is Truth. Because the main issue
                                          	of contention here is the meaning and application of Truth. While
                                          	the engine, is the integral component of the car. The particular
                                          	engine part is what that makes the engine run, and resulting in the
                                          	entire car running according to its specifications.</span></p>
              <p>A crate of apples with some bad one in it. U wanna refer it to
                                          	science and their body of truth.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes. Crate of apples is like a body of
                                          	truths to me. Hence I gave u an example. U can accept crate of
                                          	apples with some rotten apples in it and still deem it as a crate of good
                                          	apples. I cant, I can only accept it as a crate of MOSTLY good
                                          	apples. I gave u another example. I expected a delivery of 27300
                                          	litres of AGO product to my station, however, they cannot gurantee
                                          	me 27300litres, and they know it, hence the order comes with a +-
                                          	variance of 0.05% with the given ullage marker for calculation of
                                          	condensation during discharge from depot to the respective stations.
                                          	Because I KNOW I cannot gurantee them 27300, I gave them a
                                          	differences of of variance. Yes. So what if I am specific and down
                                          	to the detail ?  Because if I said 27300, they will sue me, sue

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats why I said, if he says Crate of Mostly
                                          	Good apples, in relation to Body of Truths. If its Mostly body of
                                          	truths, yes.. I can accept.</span></p>
              <p> Since u r so familiar with your example of the engines, I used it
                                          	to exaplain some of my points to u. A crate of apples and science r
                                          	completely different things, like Hyundai engine and Maserati
                                          	engine. Your example is forcing two different things together which
                                          	is wrong.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U said</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">“f I use your examples, a “crate f good
                                          	apples” is like a Hyundai while “body of truth” is like
                                          	Maserati. Could I put Hyundai engine into Maserati ?(6 Feb)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So I used your meepok kueh tiaw INTO your
                                          	body of truths, showing you that its stupid right ? U agree ? You
                                          	were the one adding it together. Not me, I am showing you how stupid
                                          	it is.</span></p>
              <p> And if u r also comparing engines with people values of truth.
                                          	Using your example, it also highlight tat the engine and truth r
                                          	also different topics as well and forcing them together is out of
                                          	point</p>
              <p>Then u said tat TWIST my example of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Student
                                          	body consist of MEEPOK and Kueh Tiaaw</span> and completely said I
                                          	practice unfair standard. U can use my examples, no problem. Of
                                          	course u have to use it wisely. If u cannot use it wisely, u
                                          	shouldn’t resort to twisting people example by combining them
                                          	together. Tat is just shameless</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Like I said, if u cannot get my

                                          	of apples, I also suggest in YOUR words “ u shouldn’t resort to

              <p> U claimed tat gravity is truth, and not truth during different
                                          	time phrase. U claim tat theory of gravity is a theory and thus u
                                          	cannot accept it as truth. U claimed tat gravity is truth
                                          	afterwards. Later u claim again tat acceleration of gravity is not
                                          	truth again and said acceleration of gravity is not gravity. Tat
                                          	shows how terrible your science standard is again. The acceleration
                                          	of gravity is the effect of gravity. Why r they different ? Again u
                                          	avoid the topic altogether.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Very simple. Again, I shall explain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Theory <strong>OF</strong> gravity is True. However
                                          	Gravity is Truth. </span></p>
              <p>The acceleration
                                          	of gravity is the effect of gravity</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">BRAVO! <strong>EFFECT </strong>of GRAVITY. Thats NOT gravity.. its the effect right ?Acceleration <strong>OF</strong> gravity is True.
                                          	However Gravity is Truth. Do u get it now ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What goes UP must come DOWN = Gravity =
                                          	Truth</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But to question WHY and HOW FAST the UP
                                          	corresponds with the  DOWN is calculated and explained by the Theory
                                          	<strong>OF</strong> gravity using  the acceleration <strong>OF </strong>gravity to come up with
                                          	a scientific value. Accelerations of Gravity differs from planets to
                                          	planets and is true. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But Gravity, the natural phenomenon EXISTS
                                          	on each of those planets and is Truth. Gravity itself EXISTS in the
                                          	universe. It is ABSOLUTE. Its a Truth that regardless of human
                                          	perception, knowledge and all that stuff, will remain, constant,
                                          	there , absolute. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Get it ? I really hope u do. If u dont, and
                                          	continue to equate your definition of Truth into mine, u will NEVER
                                          	understand.</span></p>
              <p> Then u claimed tat 1+1 is a mathematical truth then later say it
                                          	is not truth. Isn’t a mathematical truth, truth ? U said tat truth
                                          	to u is absolute. Then “mathematical truth” should be absolute
                                          	to u too since u use it after “mathematical”. If u say they r
                                          	different, then it means one thing. Your definition of “truth”
                                          	changes whenever u pleased. There is no consistency in your language</p>
              <p>U also claimed tat science can never come out with the truth.
                                          	Later u amend and say tat science could come out with truth. U just
                                          	keep changing your stand repeatedly throughout the whole thread</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, 1+1 is true and a mathematical
                                          	Truth. A mathematical truth is NOT the Truth. Simple. I am simply
                                          	talking in YOUR terms. Hoping that you can understand the subtle
                                          	differences. Mathematical truth is a categorical truth. Thats why I
                                          	categorise them. E.g  Mathematical Truth, Logical Truth.. etc. But
                                          	for it to be THE TRUTH, that is absolute and work in all conditions
                                          	and that is quantities in maths, it has failed. I showed u again
                                          	why, Godel's Theorem. 0/0 = undefined. Those  are just but a few.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">TO me, science is NOT truth. Science is the How
                                          	and Why to unravel the mysteries of the universe. If they happen to
                                          	chance upon a truth, well, good for them. Truth , is already out
                                          	there. To me, science dont NEED to find that truth. The natural
                                          	phenomenon is there. Regardless if science discovers it or not.</span></p>
              <p> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">8)  0/0</span></strong></p>
              <p>Tis is again another joke u created. U claimed tat 0/0 shows tat
                                          	maths is not truth. However it is labeled as a fallacy and it is
                                          	nonetheless truth to the physical world. U claimed tat 0 divide by
                                          	zero is nothing. Tat is again rubbish because there is no logical
                                          	meaning in dividing by zero. Even if u use zero, nothing, NIL,
                                          	ZILCH, to <strong>divide by zero</strong>, there is still no logical
                                          	meaning to it BECAUSE THERE IS NO LOGICAL INTERPRETATION WITH
                                          	DIVIDING BY ZERO. U create a big boo boo and disgrace yourself
                                          	again.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Its very simple. Logically, if u have
                                          	nothing to divide with nothing, u get nothing. If u cant understand
                                          	such a simple logic, what else can I say ?</span></p>
              <p>After which u start to attack me with the graph. I told u
                                          	repeatedly tat it is undefined, and tat it could be anything.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You see, this is also where you have

                                          	showing u an OBVIOUS mistake u made. And I have given u time and
                                          	time again to ommit to it so we can move on. Whatever answer u give,
                                          	will show u the gravity of your mistake. And from here, I will show

              <p> </p>
              <p>Then u claimed it is wrong because anything means “anything”
                                          	u know or I know. Tat is rubbish. U claimed it never cut the graph
                                          	at zero. I told u repeatedly tat u r treating it as a variableand
                                          	expect it to cut the graph. Fact is it shouldn’t. The graph at 0
                                          	is really at –ve infinity to infinity. And again the idea of
                                          	“anything” comes from Wikipedia itself</p>
              <p>This is where u and I come to disagreement again.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">0/0 is undefined. For it to be ANYTHING, u
                                          	are defining it. And defining something is the exact opposite of
                                          	undefined. But if u wish to believe undefined = anything , its really up to you.</span></p>
              <p>I told u repeatedly tat u r treating it as a variableand
                                          	expect it to cut the graph.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When did I say that ?  U better be sure. I explicitly said, 0/0 is not a legitimate operation = undefined. And that means definately, it will NOT cut the graph. What are u talking about ? Are u adding words into my mouth again ? Want me to cut n paste out ur previous response ?</span></p>
              <p><em>But there is another way to explain the division: if we want

                                          	can we satisfy with 1 apple, we divide 1 by 0.5. The answer is, of

              <p>However again u void the point and repeat. It really shows your

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I got no problem with the statements.

              <p>U paste and stick many many articles on truth and I have been
                                          	asking u repeatedly tis question. Wat is the relevance with the
                                          	topic here ? Wat is your definition ? U CANNOT EVEN PUT IT</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Truth = Absolute Existence</strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.
                                          	I said it AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. If this is not as short and as
                                          	concise for you, there is no other way I can explain the definition

              <p> CONCISELY IN WORDS. And whenever u have something u cannot
                                          	answer, u just barrow your head in and say your definition of truth
                                          	differs. In your last article, u claim tat my truth is</p>

              <p> Says who ? U don't even know wat is my definition of truth after
                                          	all tis while ! My definition is tat truth is simply a noun for
                                          	“true” or an objective true. And tat it is basically something
                                          	tat is not shown to be false.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I already said I understood. Yours is
                                          	simple True = Truth. Noun and Adjective. True propositions to be
                                          	Truth. Thats it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Again, you see , very similar doesnt make
                                          	it THE SAME right ? So why keep using UR definition of Truth in MY
                                          	BELIEFS ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I already told you. It cannot work, until u
                                          	can understand the subtle differences and acknowledge that there is
                                          	that difference resulting in the way I percieve things as it is, the misunderstandings will continue.<br></span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>10)   U claimed tat
                          science is wrong before and thus not truth</strong></span></p>
              <p>Tis is an old problem with your logic before. We may believe the
                          same “truth” but to u, if science is ever wrong, then science is
                          never about truth. To me, if it is not proven wrong, then it remains
                          as truth. We could hold the same definition of “truth” here (it
                          is an objective true) but we reached different conclusions. U
                          stereotype and condemn all the theories and laws in it just because
                          it had been proven wrong before.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">True and facts are subjective again like I
                          said. Truth to me is absolute. I do NOT simply use the word Truth. I
                          am extremely careful especially when it comes to the meaning of Truth
                          and usingof  the word Truth. However, I am more then capable of
                          understanding the different definitions. Hence I wil use it correctly
                          with the different people under the different context and
                          circumstances for thier sake. As long as they do no get into the
                          philosophical debate of truth, I will not bother. In normal common
                          usage of truth, I accept it as it is, as true, but I will have my
                          doubts still, and believe in the possibilities. When my client tells
                          me he is telling the truth, I take it as true, not necessarily as the
                          truth. As truth is there already, whether or not he says it is, is up
                          to the judge to admit the facts, up to the jury to decide on the
                          subjective true statements and facts during the trial. The Truth
                          then, is out there, its there, and if during the course of
                          litigation, discovers the truth.. BRAVO. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Same with business, I have a higher standard
                          of truth, thats why, when it comes to business, I am specific, I am
                          particular and I also accept explainations and possibilities. As long
                          as u state the true nature of things, I will not really accept it as
                          the truth but only something true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If some theories had been wrong, u treat
                          everything in the scientific organization like Einstein and Newton as
                          wrong and thus not the truth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, Exactly. Einsten and Newton being not
                          truth, and wrong, does not mean they dispose of their utility in
                          their theories. Are we not still using their theories ? However, it
                          is true that it can be applied to its limited scope, but
                          unfortunately, it is not the truth. Like I said, again, because they
                          are theories, theories can be wrong. Man makes mistakes. Again, I
                          reitterate that I do not simply use the word truth.</span></p>
              <p> I however believe each is based on its own observation and
                          <strong>evidences</strong> and tat it is logical, make <strong>things worked</strong>, it
                          is repeatable etc give me enough grounds to believe it is the TRUTH,
                          the ABSOLUTE TRUTH. If it turns out to be wrong in the end, it is
                          okay.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Like I said, I got NO PROBLEM with
                          your belief. I only have a problem when u start adding ur definitiong
                          into my belief and claiming that it cant work. OF COURSE it cant
                          work. U believe on enough grounds to constitute as a Truth, its all
                          good. But not for me because of that higher standard to truth as I
                          explained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> As wat u said, human errs. I just
                          simply erred in trusting it to be truth. But nevertheless, I still
                          treat it as truth unless it is proven wrong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U erred in trusting it to be the truth, I
                          simply cannot afford to err in trusting it to be the truth. I canot
                          treat it as truth if it has a possibility of being proven wrong.
                          Simple.</span></p>
              <p>it is repeatable etc give me enough grounds to believe it is the
                          TRUTH, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ABSOLUTE TRUTH</span>. If it turns out to be wrong in the
                          end, it is okay.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">An another stupid statement by you, u seem
                          to claim i am stupid and contradict my own statements. For someone
                          who supposely have superior grammar and worships the dictionary, have
                          a look at the meaning ABSOLUTE. If it turned out to be wrong, how the
                          FUCK can it be ABSOLUTE TRUTH ? How can something absolute be wrong ?
                          Maybe to you. But I sure as hell dont dare to say something absolute
                          and be wrong later. U got some balls man.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Can u believe the ramifications  of
                          such a statement ? It just says alot about the person u know. U can
                          believe something/someone to be absolute and be wrong and u think its
                          "okay". To me i dont even DARE to make such claims. And to
                          say its abosolute truth and be wrong, i would stone the S.O.B! I only
                          dare to say its true. Truth.. and Absolute Truth is another matter!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Are u a sheep ? Or an enlightened sheep ?</strong></span></p>
              <p><img src="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b118/badzmaro/Sheep.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="330"></p>
              <p>And yeah u can keep sticking and pasting the same arguments.
                          Because it is obvious tat u r avoiding the topic and refuse to answer
                          my point despite repeat attempts. Watever I said, u just cover your
                          ears and refuse to answer anything. I think there is no point in
                          talking with such a person now. U wanna say I am stupid, or whatever,
                          is up to u. Maybe u had obtained final victory now as I find debating
                          with a person who does not answer people’s point as fruitful as
                          talking to a brick wall and thus give up.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Again, I did not avoid. You notice that many
                          times, it seems your analogies and examples can work. But not mine.
                          And when I give u mine, u say its rubbish, so I say YOURS is rubbish,
                          and u start to bitch and moan. My advice to you is, if u cannot
                          handle people calling ur examples and analogies as rubbish, I suggest
                          u shut the fuck up, and sit the fuck down when it comes to commenting
                          other peoples examples and analogies as rubbish. Man U CAN.. I CANT.
                          Many instances of POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is not about final victory or not, I
                          have already 2 times offered a neutral ground to “Agree in
                          disagreement” but u just had to push it, I even offered to retract
                          all statements regarding your stupidity , but u refused and again
                          think that I meant u are stupid. U must realise, your first name is
                          stupid(stupidissmart) . U can call me whatever name u want, u dont
                          see me going all angry and stuff.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe u had obtained final victory now as I find debating with a
                          person who does not answer people’s point as fruitful as talking to
                          a brick wall and</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Its never about victory. U should know that
                          by now. I even let it slide few threads ago when u said u wanted to
                          stop. I just kept quiet after that, but u just had to add another
                          long post the next day. All I asked for was understanding, is that so
                          hard ? Is it so hard to have differences of opinions? I am just but
                          one of the differing opinions, if u cant handle mine, how can u
                          handle the masses ? All I asked was to sit in the Maserati and feel
                          whats it like to drive a maserati, know its limitations, its
                          specifications, its performance. I sat in your Hyundai. I understood.
                          I understood its performance, its limitations, its specifications.
                          But you dont seem to be able to comprehend mine. Its not my fault to
                          come to the conclusion right ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And speaking of bricks:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I said </strong></span>: “Once again, am i
                          talking to rocks ? I am just saying the simple concept of Science. I
                          do not say Theory is wrong or hold it in disgust. Are u guys so dense
                          ? All i am saying is Science is not TRUTH. Whats so hard to
                          understand ?” (<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>16 Jan)</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now u can understand whats it like.. talking
                          to rocks and bricks right ? For me, I will just hammer the rock..
                          hammer and hammer it until the rock breaks.</span></p>

                          should be a good insight into differences of opinion anyways.</span></p>

              <p>Why not I give both of you idiots a brief summary :</p>
              <p><strong>SCIENCE</strong></p>
              <p>-There are 2 types of science</p>
              <p>1. Theory</p>
              <p>2. Fact and study+experiment.</p>
              <p><strong>THEORIES OF SCIENCE-</strong></p>
              <p>- Biological evolution</p>
              <p>-The origin of modern humans</p>
              <p>-Kinetic Particle Theory</p>
              <p>-Big bang Theory</p>
              <p>-Stellar evolution theory</p>
              <p><strong>FACTS OF SCIENCE -</strong></p>
              <p>-The current universe and how it works</p>
              <p>- Reproduction system of humans and animals</p>
              <p>-Living cells</p>
              <p>-The Spherical shape of the Earth</p>
              <p>- the fact that the Earth stands on nothing</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let ME make it clear of your
              summary and exchanges so far...</span></p>
              <div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) Problem of your
              definition of science</span></strong></p>
              <p>After many exchanges, finally u define science as</p>
              <p><strong>sci·ence</strong></p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>The observation,
              identification, description, experimental investigation, and
              theoretical explanation of phenomena.</strong></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Such activities restricted
              to a class of natural phenomena.</strong></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><strong>Such activities applied to an object of inquiry or
              study.</strong></p>
              </li>
              </ol> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>However it was pointed out to u many times tat the meaning u
              quote is the same as a collection of truth. Natural phenomena is a
              <strong>fact</strong>, occurrence, or circumstance observed or
              observable. And <strong>fact</strong> is still
              <strong>truth</strong>. All these r from the dictionary, which u
              quote “science” and “truth”. SO after all the hogwash about
              defining science, u still go back to the same definition. We could
              substitute the words in your example with the words and have no
              loss in meaning</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Very simple. Again, Fact to me is
              Fact. True is True. True and Facts are subjectives and subject to
              change over time. Subject to our knowledge and perception. However,
              Truth on the other hand, is absolute. Regardless of our preception,
              regardless of our knowledge, regardless of anything, Truth is out
              there, it is absolute. Dont forget, I am not aiming for your truth
              and that is true = truth. I am aiming for a higher
              truth.</span></p>
              <p> <em>If all believe in the theory of evolution, and God was
              actually the one that created everthing, it doesnt change the FACT
              that God was the one that created everything. Even if EVERYONE in
              the word thinks it so. Its not going to change that FACT</em></p>
              <p> Now tell me why is the difference between your definition
              and the dictionary definition of the science ? U said the
              dictionary definition of “truth” is wrong yet u use their
              definition. U claimed tat people r shallow in following dictionary
              strictly yet u use the dictionary definition of “science”. U r just
              having double standards isn’t it ?</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Its very simple really. I
              question everything, I learn and read, I reasearch and study.My
              degrees in different fields showed me the inconsistencies of Truth,
              hence my belief in the meaning of science. So, to me, I have come
              to a realisation that sometimes, the dictionary doesnt explain
              everything. Hence, I categorise my things as u will see as I
              explain further. So , some I will accept in the dictionary, but
              some I dont, then comes the issue of Truth. Now truth has been a
              very interesting topic since my philosophy years. If u accuse me of
              double standard, I dont blame you, because you are having double
              standards too. As I reply, u will notice ur double standard and pot
              calling kettle black.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) The definition of the

              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">No</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Not fully. I believe tat peer review
              and scrutiny should be included as well</p>
              <p>U make a big hoo haa over such a stupid thing and claimed tat I
              added in definition to the word scientific method. Why don’t u look
              at wiki on scientific method and see wat it says ?</p>
              <p><em>Another basic expectation is to document, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_data_archiving">archive</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sharing_%28Science%29">share</a> all data and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methodology</a> so they are available for</em> <strong>careful scrutiny by other scientists</strong><em>, thereby
              allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by
              attempting to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">reproduce</a> them. This practice, called full
              disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_%28statistics%29">reliability</a> of these data to be
              established.</em></p>
              <p>Tat is why I believe peer review and scrutiny should be
              included.</p>
              <p>Then u said I treat u unfairly and refuse to let u add in
              definition. Wat do u really wanna add ? Truth must work for
              EVERYTHING ? TRUTH IS PERFECT ? If u wanna add those definitions
              in, simple. U have to explain and elaborate why they should be
              added. If the reason is satisfactory, it could be added. If u just
              wanna add because u wanna add, then obviously no oneis gonna
              entertain u.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Like I said, I never said u cannot
              add peer review and scrutiny. Did I ? I accepted. You seem to be
              able to add definitions too, so why cant I add mine to make it
              clearer to my belief in my opinion ? Another case of Pot calling
              Kettle Black. Another case of YOU CAN I CANT.</span></p>
              <p> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">3)    </span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Has Theories been wrong
              before ? YES or NO</span></strong></p>
              <p>Lets see your earlier usage of “theory”.</p>
              <p> <em>What happened to your superior logic ? If your
              previous statement is already wrong ,</em> <em>science is wrong
              already</em> <em>, and even if u correct it , u cannot negate the
              fact that it was wrong . Some theories are just so totally
              different and totally wrong that doesnt relect the truth. Like the
              Universe rotates around the Earth. Or how the Earth was Flat. 
              If this happens more then onec, there are probably theories right
              now that are probably wrong, so must accet the possibility of
              fallacy in thoeries now accepted as correct.</em></p>
              <p><em>If that is the case,</em> <em>science CANT be body of
              truths</em> <em>, u have to accept possibilities that the theories
              may be wrong.</em></p>
              <p> U know wat ? YOUR EXAMPLES R WRONG. THEY r not scientific
              theories at all. And u cannot pretend and say u r not talking about
              scientific theories. U states science is wrong, and give examples
              of “theories” tat went wrong and conclude tat because of your
              examples, science can’t be body of truth. Tis shows how bad your
              standard of science is because u cannot tell pseudoscience from
              science.</p>
              <p>Thus when u write an unexplained word theory in the question, I
              simply answer “Unsure”. And I ask u to quote a scientific theory
              tat went wrong. Is tat wrong ? Who know wat is your definition of
              theory ? U change the definition of the words “truth”, “science”
              “fact” and give off wrong examples of scientific theories. What is
              wrong with saying “unsure” in tis case ? However again u exaggerate
              and make a big hoo haa over nothing</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Even if they are not scientific
              theories to you, even though I regard it as theories nevertheless,
              The pre-Socratic philosophers rejected traditional mythological
              explanations of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon">phenomena</a> they saw around them in favor of more
              rational explanations. These philosophers asked questions about
              "the essence of things , so they agreed between scholars and
              intellectuals at the time of the flat earth theory. Back in the
              day, did it not go through peer review and scrutiny ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Regardless of it, u requested
              scientific theories, I showed u a list of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories">Superceded Scientific Theories</a></span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">(4 Feb )</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I make a big HOO HAA.. because, u
              talk so much about how right u are in science, accepting it as a
              body of truths, but u are not even sure whether theories have been
              wrong before, so I came to the conclusion that you really dont know
              ur subject matter well at all.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">4)   Scientific
              Level</span></strong></p>
              <p>Unlike someone, I admit tat I do not know everything about
              science. However compared to u, it is adequate. First u give wrong
              scientific theories. Next u claim tat the laws of thermodynamics r
              wrong in the reply on 4<sup>th</sup> Feb 531pm</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">U know anything about
              Thermodynamics ? When we were in primary and secondary schools,
              what did the teachers teach us. Compare it to what UNI taught us.
              First thing the lecturer said was "WHAT U KNOW ABOUT
              THERMODYNAMICS.. IS WRONG.. THIS IS THE REAL STUFF"</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_state_theory">Transition State Theory</a>.</p>
              <p> Tis is wrong. Thermodynamics is still relevant today. In
              fact there is a whole field of people doing on thermodynamics. U
              also claimed tat the acceleration of gravity is different from
              gravity. They r actually the same</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">When did I say wrong
              theories are not useful anymore ? Being wrong doesnt mean they will
              cease all utility function right ? Wrong just means its not the
              Truth. It may still work in a controlled environment or within its
              scope. But it can still be applied within the boundries of its
              given rules. Like Newtons law, wrong, but it still serves a useful
              utility function in the given context. It doesnt mean it was
              discarded and totally not used. U get it now ?</span></p>

              Avoiding of issues</span></strong></p>
              <p>A lot of questions had went unanswered.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">A lot of questions U have left
              unanswered as well. But u have not answered them for a long time,
              so I just overlook them, and focus on the core
              questions.</span></p>
              <p><em>Do u agree tat a collective collection of truth studied
              together can enhance the understanding of the subject ?</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> ANS</span></p>
              <p><em>Why do u claim tat truth like 1+1 must work for all
              circumstances according to your definition? Why can’t it be true in
              a certain snapshot make it truth ?</em></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">ANS</span></p>
              <p>Isn’t true and real answer to a question the truth ? I ask u if
              u have an sgforum nick Badzmaro and u said yes, tat answer is the
              truth already isn’t it ? U state tat science can only answer Why
              and How but they r not truth. However if the answers are, according
              to u correct, then the answers itself r truth</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nope. Science is the why and how,
              unravelling the mysteries of the universe. Because the How and Why
              can be wrong, hence I do not see it as the Truth. For something
              that can have possibilities of being wrong, I can never see it as a
              higher standard of Truth, and that is Truth in its absolute
              terms.</span></p>
              <p>U claim things could be true, but not the truth. Tat means u r
              proposing there r things in the world tat is true but not truth at
              the same time. Tat is a contradictory idea since things tat were
              not truth, will not be true. Again u refuse to answer to tis</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, things could be true, but NOT
              the Truth. Yes. Facts and True things changes. They are subjective.
              What we base on now may be wrong in the future, hence I am not so
              fast as to jump to the conclusion that it is the Truth! Simple.
              Like it is True that u are stupid, given the evidence to support my
              theory of your stupidity, but it may NOT be the Truth. Get it ?
              Things that are Truth may not be true. e.g again, Truth that earth
              is round, true that is is flat and everyone believes it so and
              thinks and says its true. But Truth doesnt change. It is absolute
              regardless of perception , belief and knowledge. </span></p>
              <p> And how u avoid the question, u just say your definition
              of truth in different. It is precisely tat it is different, then u
              should elaborate why it should elaborate and answer. U said “truth”
              = actual existence right ? Then reconcile with the above statements
              otherwise u r just a person with no balls and run away from
              topics</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, I have a higher standard ot
              Truth. If u cannot grasp it and see the separation, its up to you.
              U can believe in your true = truth. I am a person with plenty of
              big balls. I can equally say you are the one with no balls if u
              want to talk about avoiding questions and not answering
              them.</span></p>
              <p> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">6)  
              Problem with examples</span></strong></p>
              <p>I stated the following examples.</p>
              <p>A body of student compared with a body of truth. The usage of
              the words are the same and it is the dictionary example of how to
              use the word body</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I personally think crate of a good
              apples is better due to the differences of definitions of truth.
              Because like I said, your definition of science consists of body of
              truths. To me, if truths are wrong, it can never be truths. So I
              simply gave u an example of an analogy to see things in my
              perspective. But u cant. U cant see why I cannot accept it. I
              already said, crate of good apples must consists of crate of good
              apples. Body of Truths, MUST consists of body of my definition of
              Truths. If it says Mostly body of truths, I may accept. However it
              fails, hence I cannot accept science as Body of Truths. But if u
              can , good for you. Did I say u cant ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Another case of U CAN I CANT.
              Bravo.. bravo!</span></p>
              <p>Some things could be tolerated while other cannot. Most people
              would accept changes like HL mlik over daisy low fat milk without
              problem at all. Tis is in contrast with your example of motors</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oh, so, u can tolerate my maserati
              engine part into your hyundai engine part resulting in your car not
              even working at all. If thats what u meant, I got no problem. I
              personally cant. I need my engine, my car to be functioning
              according to specifications.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It seems to u to say MOST people.
              Am I MOST people ? If I eat my Kobe beef, I wanted rare, and u gave
              me wagynu rare, or I requested NO sauce and u added me some sauce,
              its NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME. Like ur Meepok example, if there is NO
              kueh tiaw, or Meepok, I will NOT eat the meepok or kuehtiaw, unless
              I am desperate and nothing to eat, I may accept it. But I will NOT
              consider myself eating meepok or kueh tiaw, its two different dish,
              two kinds of taste. And yes, even if particular milk brands and low
              fat, I am still particular. Thats why, this again shows that you
              can easily accept what it is. I personally have my own beliefs, my
              own set of principles , my own understanding, and most importablty
              I know what I want.</span></p>
              <p>U state the following examples:</p>
              <p>Maserati engine could not be fitted to a Hyundai engine. U r
              trying to highlight different things/people could not be fitted to
              one another</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am trying to highlight
              differences in beliefs. The core belief and that is Truth. Because
              the main issue of contention here is the meaning and application of
              Truth. While the engine, is the integral component of the car. The
              particular engine part is what that makes the engine run, and
              resulting in the entire car running according to its
              specifications.</span></p>
              <p>A crate of apples with some bad one in it. U wanna refer it to
              science and their body of truth.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes. Crate of apples is like a
              body of truths to me. Hence I gave u an example. U can accept crate
              of apples with some rotten apples in it and still deem it as a
              crate of good apples. I cant, I can only accept it as a crate of
              MOSTLY good apples. I gave u another example. I expected a delivery
              of 27300 litres of AGO product to my station, however, they cannot
              gurantee me 27300litres, and they know it, hence the order comes
              with a +- variance of 0.05% with the given ullage marker for
              calculation of condensation during discharge from depot to the
              respective stations. Because I KNOW I cannot gurantee them 27300, I
              gave them a differences of of variance. Yes. So what if I am
              specific and down to the detail ? Because if I said 27300, they
              will sue me, sue Shell.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats why I said, if he says Crate
              of Mostly Good apples, in relation to Body of Truths. If its Mostly
              body of truths, yes.. I can accept.</span></p>
              <p> Since u r so familiar with your example of the engines, I
              used it to exaplain some of my points to u. A crate of apples and
              science r completely different things, like Hyundai engine and
              Maserati engine. Your example is forcing two different things
              together which is wrong.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U said</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">“f I use your examples, a “crate f
              good apples” is like a Hyundai while “body of truth” is like
              Maserati. Could I put Hyundai engine into Maserati ?(6
              Feb)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So I used your meepok kueh tiaw
              INTO your body of truths, showing you that its stupid right ? U
              agree ? You were the one adding it together. Not me, I am showing
              you how stupid it is.</span></p>
              <p> And if u r also comparing engines with people values of
              truth. Using your example, it also highlight tat the engine and
              truth r also different topics as well and forcing them together is
              out of point</p>
              <p>Then u said tat TWIST my example of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Student body consist of MEEPOK and Kueh
              Tiaaw</span> and completely said I practice unfair standard. U can
              use my examples, no problem. Of course u have to use it wisely. If
              u cannot use it wisely, u shouldn’t resort to twisting people
              example by combining them together. Tat is just shameless</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Like I said, if u cannot get
              my analogy trying to explain to you what I personally think, its
              not my fault that u cannot use it wisely too regarding my engine
              and crate of apples, I also suggest in YOUR words “ u shouldn’t
              resort to twisting people example by combining them together. Tat
              is just shameless”</span></p>

              <p> U claimed tat gravity is truth, and not truth during
              different time phrase. U claim tat theory of gravity is a theory
              and thus u cannot accept it as truth. U claimed tat gravity is
              truth afterwards. Later u claim again tat acceleration of gravity
              is not truth again and said acceleration of gravity is not gravity.
              Tat shows how terrible your science standard is again. The
              acceleration of gravity is the effect of gravity. Why r they
              different ? Again u avoid the topic altogether.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Very simple. Again, I shall
              explain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Theory <strong>OF</strong> gravity
              is True. However Gravity is Truth.</span></p>
              <p>The acceleration of gravity is the effect of gravity</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">BRAVO! <strong>EFFECT</strong> of
              GRAVITY. Thats NOT gravity.. its the effect right ?Acceleration
              <strong>OF</strong> gravity is True. However Gravity is Truth. Do u
              get it now ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What goes UP must come DOWN =
              Gravity = Truth</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But to question WHY and HOW FAST
              the UP corresponds with the DOWN is calculated and explained by the
              Theory <strong>OF</strong> gravity using the acceleration
              <strong>OF</strong> gravity to come up with a scientific value.
              Accelerations of Gravity differs from planets to planets and is
              true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But Gravity, the natural
              phenomenon EXISTS on each of those planets and is Truth. Gravity
              itself EXISTS in the universe. It is ABSOLUTE. Its a Truth that
              regardless of human perception, knowledge and all that stuff, will
              remain, constant, there , absolute.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Get it ? I really hope u do. If u
              dont, and continue to equate your definition of Truth into mine, u
              will NEVER understand.</span></p>
              <p> Then u claimed tat 1+1 is a mathematical truth then later
              say it is not truth. Isn’t a mathematical truth, truth ? U said tat
              truth to u is absolute. Then “mathematical truth” should be
              absolute to u too since u use it after “mathematical”. If u say
              they r different, then it means one thing. Your definition of
              “truth” changes whenever u pleased. There is no consistency in your
              language</p>
              <p>U also claimed tat science can never come out with the truth.
              Later u amend and say tat science could come out with truth. U just
              keep changing your stand repeatedly throughout the whole thread</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, 1+1 is true and a
              mathematical Truth. A mathematical truth is NOT the Truth. Simple.
              I am simply talking in YOUR terms. Hoping that you can understand
              the subtle differences. Mathematical truth is a categorical truth.
              Thats why I categorise them. E.g Mathematical Truth, Logical
              Truth.. etc. But for it to be THE TRUTH, that is absolute and work
              in all conditions and that is quantities in maths, it has failed. I
              showed u again why, Godel's Theorem. 0/0 = undefined. Those are
              just but a few.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">TO me, science is NOT truth.
              Science is the How and Why to unravel the mysteries of the
              universe. If they happen to chance upon a truth, well, good for
              them. Truth , is already out there. To me, science dont NEED to
              find that truth. The natural phenomenon is there. Regardless if
              science discovers it or not.</span></p>
              <p> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">8) 
              0/0</span></strong></p>
              <p>Tis is again another joke u created. U claimed tat 0/0 shows tat
              maths is not truth. However it is labeled as a fallacy and it is
              nonetheless truth to the physical world. U claimed tat 0 divide by
              zero is nothing. Tat is again rubbish because there is no logical
              meaning in dividing by zero. Even if u use zero, nothing, NIL,
              ZILCH, to <strong>divide by zero</strong>, there is still no
              logical meaning to it BECAUSE THERE IS NO LOGICAL INTERPRETATION
              WITH DIVIDING BY ZERO. U create a big boo boo and disgrace yourself
              again.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Its very simple. Logically, if u
              have nothing to divide with nothing, u get nothing. If u cant
              understand such a simple logic, what else can I say ?</span></p>
              <p>After which u start to attack me with the graph. I told u
              repeatedly tat it is undefined, and tat it could be anything.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You see, this is also where you
              have contradictory statement. When I asked u 0/0, u told me if
              could be:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"STUPIDISMART on the 23rd Jan
              1.03pm</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>I pointed to u, it is not. It could be</strong> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">zero to
              infinity</span></strong><strong>, depending on subject
              matter."</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So I asked u,</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Does the graph ever reaches 0 ? YES or
              NO</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">You said :
              No</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Beside the point, I am again
              showing u an OBVIOUS mistake u made. And I have given u time and
              time again to ommit to it so we can move on. Whatever answer u
              give, will show u the gravity of your mistake. And from here, I
              will show that  u also dont know your subject matter in
              science and maths as well.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then u claimed it is wrong because anything means “anything” u
              know or I know. Tat is rubbish. U claimed it never cut the graph at
              zero. I told u repeatedly tat u r treating it as a variableand
              expect it to cut the graph. Fact is it shouldn’t. The graph at 0 is
              really at –ve infinity to infinity. And again the idea of
              “anything” comes from Wikipedia itself</p>
              <p>This is where u and I come to disagreement again.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">0/0 is undefined. For it to be
              ANYTHING, u are defining it. And defining something is the exact
              opposite of undefined. But if u wish to believe undefined =
              anything , its really up to you.</span></p>
              <p>I told u repeatedly tat u r treating it as a variableand expect
              it to cut the graph.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When did I say that ?  U
              better be sure. I explicitly said, 0/0 is not a legitimate
              operation = undefined. And that means definately, it will NOT cut
              the graph. What are u talking about ? Are u adding words into my
              mouth again ? Want me to cut n paste out ur previous response
              ?</span></p>
              <p><em>But there is another way to explain the division: if we want
              to find out how many people, which are satisfied with half an
              apple, can we satisfy with 1 apple, we divide 1 by 0.5. The answer
              is, of course, 2. Similarly, if we want to know how many people,
              which are satisfied with nothing, can we satisfy with 1 apple, we
              divide 1 by 0. And</em> <em>the answer is any number; we can
              satisfy any number of people</em><em>, that are satisfied with
              nothing, with 1 apple.</em></p>
              <p>However again u void the point and repeat. It really shows your
              desperation</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I got no problem with the
              statements.  Right now, this is NOT the point. My point is,
              plesae, tell me.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) Zero to Infinity
              ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Or</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) Does the graph touch
              Zero ? No .</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ZERO or NO ZERO? Thats
              it.</span></strong></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">And u accuse me of avoiding
              to answer ur questions. U have avoided a lot, but I am specifically
              focusing on this one . U will soon understand why. Regardless of
              it, I will show u the error of your ways.</span></p>
              <p> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">9)      Definition of
              truth</span></strong></p>
              <p>U paste and stick many many articles on truth and I have been
              asking u repeatedly tis question. Wat is the relevance with the
              topic here ? Wat is your definition ? U CANNOT EVEN PUT IT</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Truth = Absolute
              Existence</strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. I said it
              AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. If this is not as short and as concise
              for you, there is no other way I can explain the definition to you
              anymore.</span></p>
              <p> CONCISELY IN WORDS. And whenever u have something u cannot
              answer, u just barrow your head in and say your definition of truth
              differs. In your last article, u claim tat my truth is</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the fourth
              definition</span></strong><strong>(Your truth), on the other hand,
              permits the collective opinion of a group, subject matter experts
              for example, to license a model's representation as truth, a truly
              scary prospect to</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ardent truth
              seekers</span></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p> Says who ? U don't even know wat is my definition of truth
              after all tis while ! My definition is tat truth is simply a noun
              for “true” or an objective true. And tat it is basically something
              tat is not shown to be false.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I already said I understood. Yours
              is simple True = Truth. Noun and Adjective. True propositions to be
              Truth. Thats it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Again, you see , very similar
              doesnt make it THE SAME right ? So why keep using UR definition of
              Truth in MY BELIEFS ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I already told you. It cannot
              work, until u can understand the subtle differences and acknowledge
              that there is that difference resulting in the way I percieve
              things as it is, the misunderstandings will
              continue.<br></span></p>

              <p>By rejecting thermodynamics, he is actually saying Albert Einstein made a mistake. Even though I am not on your side, I would have to say that the 2nd law of thermodynamics is very observable. For example, when something grows older after being made, it will eventually become run down, and not go up into a better state. Animals need to die after living a lifetime, cars get so old they go beyond repair, and to repair the car sometimes you have to replace almost everything and the car will become another car. Hence how can the law of thermodynamics be false if everything regarding it can be observed even without an experiment.</p>

              <p>Don't you all realise stupidissmart just like to have the last post? He hasn't changed a bit since the last time; he just want to win, even at the expense of looking dumb and not answering to the point, or even avoiding questions.</p>
              <p>To the stubborn minded him, what all major scientific bodies says
              must be the absolute truth, and nothing but the truth. E.g. to him,
              wikipedia represents the ultimate truth in his internet world when it
              can be edited by anyone on the net <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Moral of the story: Don't waste your time with him la. Time is better
              spent maintaining and growing a salary which is already twice of what
              he told me his was last time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To be fair, scientific theories have been proven wrong before, which is why the advent of a new branch of physics called modern physics. There were other instances like how it was believed that the Earth was square, or how it was believed earlier that nothing can travel faster than sound.</p>
