              <p>Oi Prove here hor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pan Gu and Nu Wa
                  <br> Long, long ago, when heaven and earth were still one, the entire
                  universe was contained in an egg-shaped cloud. All the matter of the
                  universe swirled chaotically in that egg. Deep within the swirling
                  matter was Pan Gu, a huge giant who grew in the chaos. For 18,000 years
                  he developed and slept in the egg. Finally one day he awoke and
                  stretched, and the egg broke to release the matter of the universe. The
                  lighter purer elements drifted upwards to make the sky and heavens, and
                  the heavier impure elements settled downwards to make the earth.</p>
              <p>In the midst of this new world, Pan Gu worried that heaven and earth
                  might mix again; so he resolved to hold them apart, with the heavens on
                  his head and the earth under his feet. As the two continued to
                  separate, Pan Gu grew to hold them apart. For 18,000 years he continued
                  to grow, until the heavens were 30,000 miles above the earth. For much
                  longer he continued to hold the two apart, fearing the return of the
                  chaos of his youth. Finally he realized they were stable, and soon
                  after that he died.</p>
              <p>With the immense giant’s death, the earth took on new character. His
                  arms and legs became the four directions and the mountains. His blood
                  became the rivers, and his sweat became the rain and dew. His voice
                  became the thunder, and his breath became the winds. His hair became
                  the grass, and his veins became the roads and paths. His teeth and
                  bones became the minerals and rocks, and his flesh became the soil of
                  the fields. Up above, his left eye became the sun, and his right eye
                  became the moon. Thus in death, as in life, Pan Gu made the world as it
                  is today.</p>
              <p>Many centuries later, there was a goddess named Nu Wa who roamed this
                  wild world that Pan Gu had left behind, and she became lonely in her
                  solitude. Stopping by a pond to rest, she saw her reflection and
                  realized that there was nothing like herself in the world. She resolved
                  to make something like herself for company.</p>
              <p>From the edge of the pond she took some mud and shaped it in the form
                  of a human being. At first her creation was lifeless, and she set it
                  down. It took life as soon as it touched the soil, however, and soon
                  the human was dancing and celebrating its new life. Pleased with her
                  creation, Nu Wa made more of them, and soon her loneliness disappeared
                  in the crowd of little humans around her. For two days she made them,
                  and still she wanted to make more. Finally she pulled down a long vine
                  and dragged it through the mud, and then she swung the vine through the
                  air. Droplets of mud flew everywhere and, when they fell, they became
                  more humans that were nearly as perfect as the ones she had made by
                  hand. Soon she had spread humans over the whole world. The ones she
                  made by hand became the aristocrats, and the ones she made with the
                  vine became the poor common people.</p>
              <p>Even then, Nu Wa realized that her work was incomplete, because as her
                  creations died she would have to make more. She solved this problem by
                  dividing the humans into male and female, so that they could reproduce
                  and save her from having to make new humans to break her solitude.</p>
              <p>Many years later, Pan Gu’s greatest fear came true. The heavens
                  collapsed so that there were holes in the sky, and the earth cracked,
                  letting water rush from below to flood the earth. At other places, fire
                  sprang forth from the earth, and everywhere wild beasts emerged from
                  the forests to prey on the people. N? Wa drove the beasts back and
                  healed the earth. To fix the sky, she took stones of many colors from
                  the river and built a fire in which she melted them. She used the
                  molten rock to patch the holes in the sky, and she used the four legs
                  of a giant turtle to support the sky again. Exhausted by her labors,
                  she soon lay down to die and, like Pan Gu, from her body came many more
                  features to adorn the world that she had restored.</p>

              <p>+Carbon dating: has inherent problem of fluctuation with time, calibration is needed, see the solution: <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Coral+corrects+carbon+dating+problems-a09093001">http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Coral+corrects+carbon+dating+problems-a09093001</a></p>
              <p>+Sometimes, when people don't even trust a scientist and his cardon dating technique, we have 7 other radiometry dating techniques to verify:</p>

              <p>All your above argument are rather weak and need to invoke the the power of Almighty.</p>
              <p>We can do so without the need for the power of Almighty.</p>
              <p>If you can provide me where exactly you hear/read the <span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; color: #333333;">fossil sea creatures that are found thousands of feet above the current sea level (provide links, preferably reputable sources such as nature or science journals), I can try to use my reasoning without need of Almighty force.</span></p>
              <p>For your sneak preview, I will use (i) classification of fossil sea creatures; (ii) plate tectonic movement to counter your use of Almight force.</p>

              <p>Gosh you guys are really mistaken. I am merely raising a hypothetical arguement that could be used by those who believe in an almighty being. I know I wasn't typing in a clear mind but you should really learn to look into my veiled sacarsm.</p>
              <p>Consider which is more probable:</p>
              <p>That the fossils ARE very old and are indeed forced from from below sea level to above by tectonic movements that by simple arithmatic suggest the earth must be at least millions of years old. (of course earth is in the order or 10^9 years old but lets not complicate things)</p>
              <p>ps. I am not going to dig up references for a frigging forum. Heck I am not getting credits for Sgforuming, so just take my word that it exists. If you must then go search on on your own. Waddaya want? Spoonfeeding?</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>God planted these fossils that look old but are actually created at the moment of creation. And that for some reason he thinks that earth would be more interesting if the continents drifted. Also he is so perfect that he makes everything else in the universe seem to point at a beginning 14 or so BYA when he created the universe at whatever time the believers believe in.</p>
              <p>If you choose to find solace in the latter, then I can only congratulate you on your unwavering belief. There is nothing more that logic can do to convince you otherwise.</p>

              <p>lazy to argue about evolution...</p>
              <p>However it is sad tat people read one sided and reject established science tat spans many fields just because a book contradicts it. It has clouded their judgement and their only source of belief comes from faith, not science or logic now. If one day their religion says cancer is false and come out with many one sided stories, they will completely believe them and go to faith healing instead. Since they have reached such a state, there is nothing left to say liao</p>
