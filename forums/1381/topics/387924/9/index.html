              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Maybe let me just do a fraction of your summary of the truth.
              Which i have NO PROBLEM with. o.k</p>
              <p>First of all, TRUTH, has a multitude of meanings. DICTIONARY.COM
              is trying to explain. Then u got the THEORIES of TRUTH by
              intellectuals, philosophers and the likes desperately trying to
              theorarize the meaning and definition of TRUTH.</p>
              <p>And here is YOUR primary school level definition
              of truth.</p>
              <p>U equate true = truth. Which i again i have no problem, but its
              ur insistence that YOUR theory is THE TRUTH is what astounds me.
              Your inability to see past the word itself, the verb the noun... of
              it. You think those intellectuals and philosophers did not know
              that ? They have already seen BEYOND that and are on a higher level
              of understanding, while u are still stuck at its infancy level of
              comprehension.</p>
              <p>Next, we have a simple concept of 1 + 1 = 2. I said, its true,
              its a mathematical truth, hence i say, its true, but may not be the
              truth. I totally understand your simple understanding of the
              primary level of maths, but YOU however cant understand anything
              BEYOND that, ONLY after i TEDIOUSLY EXPLAINED to you then u
              understood and start blaming me on the different context n trying
              to riddle you. How hard is it to understand ? DO i have to
              POINT OUT.. n EXPLAIN... that WHY i said it is because it can be
              refered to in a different context ? Again, shows just how stupid u
              are to not even able to see beyond my simple language used. It is
              VERY obvious tat i meant other 1 + 1 = 2 context. Because, its the
              truth. 1 +1 doesnt always equal 2. Its a mathematical truth YES,
              but not the TRUTH in a sense, as an overall 1+ 1 = 2. </p>
              <p>Then we come to the issue of Theologians and Scientists. I
              already said, TWO DIFFERENT FIELDS . How hard is it to understand
              thier different domain ? U say double standard.. OF COURSE&gt; They
              are BOTH different FIELDS.</p>
              <p>I have already explained to you the meaning of TRUTH in my
              context is ACTUAL EXISTENCE.  And i APPLIED it consistently in
              all my statements, and u just dont understand. That again, just
              shows how stupid you are.</p>
              <p>Your version of the truth is extremely easy to comprehend, its
              baby's level, using only simple linguistics direct from the
              dictionary to justify, i again have NOproblem with that. And u are
              here claiming i am not making sense when u are just too stupid to
              understand. You stupidity knows no end. I TOTALLY understand your
              concept, and i accept it. I UNDERSTAND.</p>
              <p>Have some humility and accept that u have misunderstood. I admit
              my mistakes and accept your simple understanding of the truth, but
              u refuse to understand mine, and instead, force ur compliance upon
              me.</p>
              <p>Please, read carefully. And open ur mind, think outside the box,
              instead of inside the box, stuck in ur dictionary defined meanig of
              the truth from the word true. Or else u are no different then those
              conservatice religious fanatics that worships the simple worded
              meaning in the  dictionary like the bible. And please advance
              from primary school level maths to have better understanding, if u
              believe that Science is the search for TRUTH, SO BE IT. I ACCEPT
              YOUR SIMPLE MINDEDNESS.</p>
              <p>I wonder who is the one being arrogant, stubborn and extremely
              stupid.</p>

              <p class="Body">Let’s imagine that you happened to stumble upon a
              unique camera in a low profile and run-down camera store.  This camera
              is better than any digital or film camera that you’ve ever known to
              exist.  It captures a wider range of light in any given lighting
              condition than any camera you’ve ever heard of, and can capture
              pictures instantly even in extremely low light conditions.  It has a
              wide angle view of almost 180° with no barrel distortion, and captures
              images at 30 frames per second, at higher resolution than any high
              definition video camera that exists.  Despite all of these features,
              the camera is small enough to be concealed in a closed hand.  You are
              so impressed by this device, you are ready to buy it no matter what the
              price.  You ask the store owner, “Where did this absolutely amazing
              piece of equipment come from?  What company made this?”  The store
              owner replies, “Nobody made it... I had a box of scrap metal, glass,
              and plastic in my tool shed, and one day I shook the box around and
              this camera just fell together.”</p>
              <p class="Body"> </p>
              <p class="Body">Insulted,
              you demand the store owner explain why he would try to give you such an
              absurd explanation.  He replies, “I don’t believe in camera companies.”</p>
              <p class="Body"> </p>
              <p class="Body">You
              are even more confused now.  “You must be an idiot,” you state, “if you
              don’t believe that a camera company designed this.”  The owner pauses,
              and then finally says,  “If you think that is idiotic... one time a
              college professor told me that the human eye formed randomly, without a
              designer, as a result of evolution.”</p>
              <p class="Body"> </p>
              <p class="Body">Between rods and cones, the <a title="http://naturalselection.0catch.com/Files/humaneye.html" href="http://naturalselection.0catch.com/Files/humaneye.html">human eye</a> has about 126 million photoreceptors.  In terms of digital camera
              speak, this would be 126 megapixel, ten times as much as a high end
              digital camera.  Not only that, but humans have 2 of these, that both
              capture images constantly and send signals to the brain regarding depth
              perception.  This is nothing compared to birds though... birds eyes,
              since they depend much more on vision, can have roughly ten times as
              many photoreceptors as humans, making their eyes essentially higher
              than 1,000 “megapixel!”  This presents impossibilities for
              evolutionists who believe dinosaurs evolved into birds.  Dinosaurs,
              being reptiles, relied on other senses much more than birds, and had
              inferior eyes compared to even humans (unless their extremely complex
              eye evolved impossibly faster than even evolutionists claim).  So for a
              dinosaur to evolve into a bird, it had to shrink its legs, grow large
              arms, become light in weight, grow feathers, and increase the
              complexity of its sight by more than 1,000-2,000 percent!  All without
              leaving a single trace of this transformation in the fossil record.
               Impossible?  But wait... aren’t humans supposed to be more “evolved”
              than birds?  Why are their eyes better?  Ridiculous indeed.</p>

              <p>You can have your beliefs Larry Teo. Its all good in pointing out faults in both creationism and evolution. That is why we are here discussing in the first place.</p>
              <p>I am open to all possibilities, I believe in science as much as i have my faith in religion.</p>
              <p>I am not pointing any faults or whatsoever, i was merely stating my opinion of Science in regards to what is true and what is the truth, what the domain of science is and the difference of interpretations in my context and the theories surrounding it . Thats all.</p>

              <p>Let’s imagine that you happened to stumble upon a unique camera in a low profile and run-down camera store.  This camera is better than any digital or film camera that you’ve ever known to exist.  It captures a wider range of light in any given lighting condition than any camera you’ve ever heard of, and can capture pictures instantly even in extremely low light conditions.  It has a wide angle view of almost 180° with no barrel distortion, and captures images at 30 frames per second, at higher resolution than any high definition video camera that exists.  Despite all of these features, the camera is small enough to be concealed in a closed hand.  You are so impressed by this device, you are ready to buy it no matter what the price.  You ask the store owner, “Where did this absolutely amazing piece of equipment come from?  What company made this?”  The store owner replies, “Nobody made it... I had a box of scrap metal, glass, and plastic in my tool shed, and one day I shook the box around and this camera just fell together.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Insulted, you demand the store owner explain why he would try to give you such an absurd explanation.  He replies, “I don’t believe in camera companies.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are even more confused now.  “You must be an idiot,” you state, “if you don’t believe that a camera company designed this.”  The owner pauses, and then finally says,  “If you think that is idiotic... one time a college professor told me that the human eye formed randomly, without a designer, as a result of evolution.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Between rods and cones, the <a title="http://naturalselection.0catch.com/Files/humaneye.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://naturalselection.0catch.com/Files/humaneye.html">human eye</a> has about 126 million photoreceptors.  In terms of digital camera speak, this would be 126 megapixel, ten times as much as a high end digital camera.  Not only that, but humans have 2 of these, that both capture images constantly and send signals to the brain regarding depth perception.  This is nothing compared to birds though... birds eyes, since they depend much more on vision, can have roughly ten times as many photoreceptors as humans, making their eyes essentially higher than 1,000 “megapixel!”  This presents impossibilities for evolutionists who believe dinosaurs evolved into birds.  Dinosaurs, being reptiles, relied on other senses much more than birds, and had inferior eyes compared to even humans (unless their extremely complex eye evolved impossibly faster than even evolutionists claim).  So for a dinosaur to evolve into a bird, it had to shrink its legs, grow large arms, become light in weight, grow feathers, and increase the complexity of its sight by more than 1,000-2,000 percent!  All without leaving a single trace of this transformation in the fossil record.  Impossible?  But wait... aren’t humans supposed to be more “evolved” than birds?  Why are their eyes better?  Ridiculous indeed.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But BADZMARO let me make it clear, I am pointing out faults in both creationism and evolution, I am not on anyone's side :D</p>

              <p>Hardly evolved than any of the organisms from this planet. What hypocrisy, for awhile all of you say ''oh, humans rule this planet because of their smart brain, which evolved over millions of years''. Then you start to claim that humans are not even much more evolved than any other organism in this planet. If humans are able to form civillization, domesticate almost every common animal from the jungle, then this proves that humans are smart, and the complex brain would need to be VERY EVOLVED THAN ALL OTHER ANIMALS ON THIS PLANET. Aren't evolutionists supposed to be very logical people? Why are they speaking out of context now?</p>

              <p>Gentic limits are limits to the amount of code you can change in an animal's DNA. Too much editing will cause death due to the bad changes. Microevolution, which is minor changes in the body's immune systems, cells, etc do happen, but they are different from macro-evolution. Micro-evolution happens all the time, even to those insects that reproduce a few hundred generations a week, but they are still insects and not morphed into sparrows.</p>
