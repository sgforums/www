              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I said tis before. I only need to prove tat u said in one
              instance tat gravity is not the truth, then I am right in saying u
              said gravity is not he truth before. One instance. In the
              beginning, your view of gravity is tat it is false. Only after
              debating with reservistsianz then u change your stand and said it
              is the truth.If u check the date, on the 15th u keep saying gravity
              is not truth and science is not truth. Only at the 17th onwards
              then u changed your stand</p>
              <p>SO wat if they took "so long". Tat is not important for the
              discussion. U said it is the theory of gravitation. From a
              scientific angle, gravity consists of a theory.SO if it is a
              theory, it is the truth ?</p>
              <p>If u do not like to talk about god, so be it. We can move on
              from there.</p>
              <p>But u said all truth must be scopeless and can work under all
              situations. I do not agree. SO I will still paste the point about
              truth having a scope in</p>
              <p>U claim tat truth must encompass EVERYTHING. It must work in ALL
              scenario. Tat is certainly rubbish because all facts has a certain
              boundary and scope. Gravity works only for physical matters. 1+1
              only works for things of the same context. Medicine only focused on
              curing a certain illness, not all illnesses. Evolution talks about
              living things, not rock and sand. U see. They all have scopes.</p>
              <p>Well according to u, science is NEVER about truth. However u
              also claimed Theologists is the ONLY one tat can handle truth. Tat
              to me, obviously is a double standard and a bad one since
              theologist r the one coming up with the most lies</p>
              <p>SO u r still bringing in God into the picture now ? Tis is again
              another double standard. U claimed god is a truth but u cannot
              produce any evidence supporting it. U claimed science is not truth,
              even when they had brought tons of evidences etc. In tat case, god
              has a scope as well. Only believers think it is a truth. And thus
              its scope is only to believers because to non believers, it failed
              to be even true.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nah.. there is something wrng with your grammer, not mine. I
              said before, science could be wrong, but the moment someone proves
              a part if wrong, tat part is no longer science. SO science is still
              a body of truth.</p>
              <p>Another use of "body" in the form of the "science and its body
              of truth" could be "student body". The student body should consists
              of all students. However people from the student body do graduate
              from their school one day. But the student body is not
              grammatically wrong since those who had graduate simply leave the
              body. The student body is still consists of only students.</p>
              <p>DO u understand now ?</p>
              <p>U still do not understand the meaning of define. Define means it
              can be narrowed to ceratin values. I never narrow to any values so
              the answer I gave is undefined as well since it is any possible
              number. SO u r again wrong, with you tons of errors in tis
              subject</p>
              <p>The rest of your message simply depends on the science
              definition part.</p>
              <p>Now comes your other people definition</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True, he has a different interpretation of science. And then ?
              He is only one digit in the world and obviously his view is not
              very well accepted</p>

              <p>No , I ALREADY said since the beginning that Gravity is Truth. BUT NOT THE THEORY. But i guess u cant understand. As usual.</p>
              <p>“<em>They are theories and theories
                                      can be right  and can be proven wrong like newtonian laws that
                                      only works on earth. U</em> <strong>dont call it the FACT of
                                      Gravity..U never hear Scientists call theory.. the truth right
                                      ?</strong> “&lt;--- so, where did i say Gravity is not truth ? Its quite in your face that the Theory is True, hence u dont call it the Fact or Truth of gravity. U call it the Theory of Gravity.</p>
              <p>If it IS theory , it is NOT truth. Because Gravity is Truth, it has existed long before man defined it as Gravity.  Theory is only True so far and on this planet. Simple.</p>
              <p>I NEVER said Theologists are the ONLY one to handle truth. They handle truth differently from scienctists. They seek the evidence of the existence of God , which is thier Truth and that is God. Simple. Scientists seek the How and Why , explaination, to unravel the Mysteries of the Universe. As the Truth is already OUT THERE, hence they are not seeking that truth, but that explaination. But  i guess, u just keep trying to say stuffs i didnt say. Its kinda weak u know.</p>
              <p>Like i said,</p>
              <p>Regarding your scope, I agree, Gravity works in its scope. I
                                      DONT agree with Maths because it has FAILED in its scopes in
                                      quantity, even within its context, it has failed. And i because i
                                      believe God is scopeless, and even IF ALL the truths work within
                                      its scope, i still cant say ALL truth's work within its scope,
                                      because God is scopeless to me, hence i believe that not all
                                      truth's have to have its scope. Thats why i said move on. Obviously
                                      this is a difference in opinion. N i am willing to accept yours.
                                      Simple. U dont believe God, but I do.  SO MOVE ON.</p>
              <p>U said "could" be. Why arent u certain ?</p>
              <p>Then it still makes the presumption that , if your previous
                                      statement is already wrong , science is wrong already , and even if
                                      u correct it , u cannot negate the fact that it was wrong . Some
                                      theories are just so totally different and totally wrong that
                                      doesnt relect the truth. Like the Universe rotates around the
                                      Earth. Or how the Earth was Flat.  If this happens more then
                                      onec, there are probably theories right now that are probably
                                      wrong, so must accet the possibility of fallacy in thoeries now
                                      accepted as correct.</p>
              <p>I am more then willing to accept your explaination, but it still doesnt really answer the entire contradiction of your logic of :-</p>
              <p>If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>Whether define it or not , once u DEFINE it, I can prove 1 = 2. Thats why it can NEVER be defined. Hence i used the word UNDEFINED. The fallacy of defining it even to work within your scope will yield 1 = 2.</p>
              <p>"True, he has a different interpretation of science. And then ?
                                      He is only one digit in the world and obviously his view is not
                                      very well accepted"</p>
              <p>-  Well, then that means Science is not confied to just the dictionary definition of "Body of Truths" . I was merely pointing out to you that there are different definitions, just like how truth has different definitions. Even if it is not widely accepted, again, history has shown those that were not widely accepted, can become mainstream. My whole point from beginning was that we dont allow ourselves to conform to mainstream always. We have a brain, we challenge the norm and history again has shown that those people brought about new methods, new discovires, new theories. Thats it.</p>
              <p>Hence u may be mainstream, I may not be. Thats why its a difference in opinion and understanding.</p>
              <p>Thats all. Is it so hard ?</p>
              <p>U believe   <span style="color: #ff0000;">Science =  True = Truth </span></p>
              <p>I believe <span style="color: #00ff00;">Science = How and Why to unravel the mysteries of the Universe, and what is True may NOT be the Truth.</span></p>

              <p>Your: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                      The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                      accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                      it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                      on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                                      ?</p>
              <p>Sure, i can accept your definition. I didnt say i dont. BUT , if i were to apply <strong>the SAME argument and reasoning u used on me,</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>So,</strong> IF once again
                                      science can be wrong, and the science is the how and why, wouldnt
                                      that be unable to make your How and Why Truth ? Because they can be
                                      wrong! If u think Science is Why and How and Science can be wrong,
                                      therefore the Why and How can be WRONG TOO. Sounds simliar to MY

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">And back to your definition of
                                      Science = BODY OF TRUTHS , Since, the top of the statement has
                                      already stated the How and Why can be Wrong, and also your LOGIC of
                                      :-</p>
              <p>If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>So,</strong> wouldnt that ONCE AGAIN CONTRADICT your own
                                      DEFINITION OF SCIENCE ? SO.. TELL ME, at the end of the day, how do
                                      you reconcile with all these CONTRADICTIONS with YOURSELF ?
                                      <strong>So is Science Truth ? Is it ? OR isnt it ?Answer this
                                      simple question.</strong></p>
              <p>And as for me writing wrongly on the True and False and whether i can even write correctly or not, I already said, what is True, may NOT be the Truth.Hence i am already prepared to make mistakes and correct them and i KNOW i am as fallible as science.. While urs is Science = True = Truth.</p>

              <p>There will be contradictions. But contradictions are mostly done at the ignorance of both sides. Wrong interpretation and wrong application of theories.</p>
              <p>So its still ongoing. So i am perfectly willing to let them solve the contradictions over time.</p>
              <p>All i am saying is that having an open mind thats all.</p>
              <p>Scientific knowledge is human knowledge and scientists are human beings. They ar enot gods, and science is not infallible. Yet the general public often thinks of scientific claims as absolutely certain truths. They think that if something is not certain, it is not scientific and if it is not scientific, then any other non-scientific view is its equal. This misconception seems to be, at least in part, behind the general lack of understanding about the nature of scientific theories.</p>
              <p>Same goes to Religion, they are not gods too. Thats why they will sometimes fail in the interpretations too.To them God is truth already. But its the interpretations they apply that may not be the truth.</p>

                                          of the existence of God , which is thier Truth and that is God.
                                          Simple. Scientists seek the How and Why , explaination, to unravel
                                          the Mysteries of the Universe. As the Truth is already OUT THERE,
                                          hence they are not seeking that truth, but that explaination.
                                          But  i guess, u just keep trying to say stuffs i didnt say.

              <p>Tat is a problem u see because everybody who know basic maths know tat addition has to work within the same context (talking about same type of object in addition). If u think u r so right about tis, then u wouldn't mind me writing it out for people to see.</p>
              <p>Just a question... How do u really count in real life then ? U already have a big problem with such the most basic arithmetric so I am wondering if u r just trying to be funny or really have lousy maths</p>

              <p>Tat is funny u see. We r saying whether science is a body of truth. U r arguing tat it is not a body of truth. Why ? Because it is wrong before. I told u, if it is wrong, it ceases to be science. SO science still states the truth. On the other hand u said it is once it is wrong, so science will NEVER be TRUTH again. Since most of your argument hinges on tis matter, I shall discuss with u on length now</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For u, u stereotype and judge a whole class of objects by 1 single member. Lets say in a country called A, if one of the people is a criminal, u claimed the whole country is full of criminals. Lets say a christian molest small kids, u claim ALL christians molest small kids.</p>
              <p>For me, I don;t stereotype like u do. In science, everything is documented with independent evidence and facts. If one of the science knowledge is wrong, it doesn't means the rest, all the other knowledges with their evidence and facts, are all wrong. It just meant tat particular proven wrong fact is wrong. So science is still a collection of a body of truth.</p>
              <p>True, there may be some bad knowledge tat is incorrect. U chose to <strong>stereotype </strong>and claimed the whole science is ALL WRONG because there r some wrongs in it. I chose to say only tat these small knowledge r wrong but science is still right.</p>
              <p>If by the same conclusion, u yourself wrote wrongly before. So everything u write now is all wrong as well ? Since u wrote everything wrong, then why should people believe in u ? Using your stereotype, theologists r wrong before, so ALL theologies r wrong ? In fact in the human world, all organisations make a wrong somewhere. So all the human world r all wrong ? The politicians r all wrong, the policemen r all wrong, the philosophers r all wrong. Nothing is right since human made mistakes in all their professions. You r just having an extreme stereotype problem and playing with it</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW Theory of sun revolving around the earth is not science. It is not derived by the scientific method but more fromt he bible. Earth is flat is again not science since it is not derived by the scientific method but mostly by the bible. SO wat other examples of theories or law tat has been rejected before ?</p>

                                          again, history has shown those that were not widely accepted, can
                                          become mainstream. My whole point from beginning was that we dont
                                          allow ourselves to conform to mainstream always. We have a brain,
                                          we challenge the norm and history again has shown that those people
                                          brought about new methods, new discovires, new theories. Thats

              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                      of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm, u said</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>How long did it take them just
                                      to explain the <strong>theory of gravity</strong>.</em></span></p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                                      "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity"</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                                      truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                                      proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                                      <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                                      call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  god is a truth
                                      tat has no scope</span></p>
              <p>My ans: God is not even shown to be true, thus not even truth
                                      and thus is just talking cock. And even if u insist it is true, it
                                      also has a scope because it ceases to be true to a non believer.
                                      Its scope is to believer only</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
                                      NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
                                      finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
                                      about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
                                      truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
                                      Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                                      the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
                                      u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
                                      wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
                                      u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                                      is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
                                      if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
                                      again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
                                      truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                                      be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                                      equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                                      article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                      touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
                                      when I said it could be any value from 0 to
                                      infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                                      meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                                      values. U do not even grasp the basic idea of wat is undefine. U
                                      paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots will
                                      conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat the 0
                                      in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U r still
                                      stuck in your elementary maths and think tat UNDEFINE value must
                                      have a cut in the graph like a variable. And any possible value
                                      from zero to infinity REINFORCE the idea it is undefined, and not
                                      being defined.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                                      definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                                      wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                      The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                      accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                      it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                      on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                                      ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                                      be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                                      definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
                                      knowledge of facts. And u just misquote Richard Feynman</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                                      is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                      it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                      body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
                                      same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
                                      be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
                                      still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                                      student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers , theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>

              <p>U r repeating a cycle. I will put the the previous answer
                              here</p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>How long did it take them just
                              to explain the <strong>theory of gravity</strong>.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U specifically said it is a theory. And gravity do contains a
                              theory stating why it pulls things to the earth. So u did say tat
                              gravity, which is a theory, is false</p>
              <p>U said the below, 15 Jan 1108pm</p>
              <p><strong>Science is not there to PROVE, it is to find out WHY, to
                              EXPLAIN. They are not to discern what is true and false. Its not
                              even thier doman.  It is the Theologists.</strong></p>
              <p>U said later tat u wanna change the words to truth and not true.
                              So your above sentence said theologist r the people tat discern wat
                              is truth or not</p>
              <p>Tat is a problem u see because everybody who know basic maths
                              know tat addition has to work within the same context (talking
                              about same type of object in addition). If u think u r so right
                              about tis, then u wouldn't mind me writing it out for people to
                              see.</p>
              <p>Just a question... How do u really count in real life then ? U
                              already have a big problem with such the most basic arithmetric so
                              I am wondering if u r just trying to be funny or really have lousy
                              maths</p>
              <p>Tat is funny u see. We r saying whether science is a body of
                              truth. U r arguing tat it is not a body of truth. Why ? Because it
                              is wrong before. I told u, if it is wrong, it ceases to be science.
                              SO science still states the truth. On the other hand u said it is
                              once it is wrong, so science will NEVER be TRUTH again. Since most
                              of your argument hinges on tis matter, I shall discuss with u on
                              length now</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For u, u stereotype and judge a whole class of objects by 1
                              single member. Lets say in a country called A, if one of the people
                              is a criminal, u claimed the whole country is full of criminals.
                              Lets say a christian molest small kids, u claim ALL christians
                              molest small kids.</p>
              <p>For me, I don;t stereotype like u do. In science, everything is
                              documented with independent evidence and facts. If one of the
                              science knowledge is wrong, it doesn't means the rest, all the
                              other knowledges with their evidence and facts, are all wrong. It
                              just meant tat particular proven wrong fact is wrong. So science is
                              still a collection of a body of truth.</p>
              <p>True, there may be some bad knowledge tat is incorrect. U chose
                              to <strong>stereotype</strong> and claimed the whole science is ALL
                              WRONG because there r some wrongs in it. I chose to say only tat
                              these small knowledge r wrong but science is still right.</p>
              <p>If by the same conclusion, u yourself wrote wrongly before. So
                              everything u write now is all wrong as well ? Since u wrote
                              everything wrong, then why should people believe in u ? Using your
                              stereotype, theologists r wrong before, so ALL theologies r wrong ?
                              In fact in the human world, all organisations make a wrong
                              somewhere. So all the human world r all wrong ? The politicians r
                              all wrong, the policemen r all wrong, the philosophers r all wrong.
                              Nothing is right since human made mistakes in all their
                              professions. You r just having an extreme stereotype problem and
                              playing with it</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW Theory of sun revolving around the earth is not science. It
                              is not derived by the scientific method but more fromt he bible.
                              Earth is flat is again not science since it is not derived by the
                              scientific method but mostly by the bible. SO wat other examples of
                              theories or law tat has been rejected before ?</p>
              <p>I told u I say it could be any number. So in practise what I
                              said is the meaning of undefined.</p>
              <p>1) I said it could be any number</p>
              <p>2) undefine means it could be any number</p>
              <p>3) SO I do suggest it is undefined</p>
              <p>Now u said 0/0 has a logical meaning of zero.Why is tat so ? U
                              said tat 0/0 could substitute a value and all 0/0 has the same
                              value. WHy is tat so. U claimed tat 1=2. WHy is tat so ?</p>
              <p>U never read the amended reply I made. He is a person who treat
                              science as truths.</p>

                              whats wrong with them taking a long time to explain the theory of
                              gravity ? Gravity is a truth already. It just took them ages to
                              postulate a theory to explain it. They had a long of theories, some
                              were right and wrong, and all were wrong until now.  Until so
                              far..its Einsteins. There may be more theories... we just gotta wait
                              for the new ones to come out.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The problem as usual, like 1 Apple + 1
                              Apple = 2 Fruits. If we confine it purely to maths, how do we define
                              all the quantities in our life ? We might as well not right ? The
                              scope is supposed to cover its quantiy, its not to say its bad, it
                              has issues it cannot solve.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>U said:</strong> “True, there may be some bad
                              knowledge tat is incorrect. U chose to <strong>stereotype</strong> and claimed the whole science is ALL WRONG because there r some
                              wrongs in it. I chose to say only tat these small knowledge r wrong
                              but science is still right. “</p>

                              When did I say science is all wrong ? Did I say science are lies ?
                              You are jumping to conclusions and do u even know what I am talking
                              about ? All I said is, science makes mistakes. Thats why its called
                              Theories.  There is a possibility that it can be wrong. Whats wrong
                              with that ? You are the one being extreme her. Not me. All I saying
                              is u have to accept the possibilities that science can be wrong.
                              Thats all.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Yes, people make mistakes, if they are
                              wrong, they are wrong. I believe certain things to be true, but I
                              cannot accept them to be the truth. I have to open my mind that
                              nothing that anyone tells me, I will just believe them. They may be
                              true, but still not the truth to me.  How hard is it to understand ?
                              <strong>Why must be it the truth if it is true.</strong> <strong>Who is the extreme here,</strong> to
                              you its either RIGHT or WRONG. To me, its a possibility that the
                              statement is wrong, just because someone says 'This is it” I have
                              to believe ?</p>

                              just Christians in the early days, but Ancient greece , China and so
                              on. They too have their own science that time to come out that the world is flat. Dont always put the blame on christians.  It was Copernicus who
                              was a christian that made it known that it was not flat too. And regarding wrong theories, there are a few. And there are a few that are not all wrong and not all correct. Hence its true, but not the truth. Just to show a few.</p>

                              it too was supplanted by the dual wave-particle theory of light that
                              explains all aspects of it.<strong>)</strong></p>

                              the were shown to be not quite right either. For example in relativity
                              or on the very small scale they don't hold<strong>)</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>U said</strong>: “I told u I say it could be any number. So in practise what I
                              said is the meaning of undefined.</p>
              <p>1) I said it could be any number</p>
              <p>2) undefine means it could be any number</p>
              <p>3) SO I do suggest it is undefined”</p>
              <p><strong>My answer: </strong>You assume undefined can be anything, while I assumed undefined
                              cant be defined.</p>
              <p>Undefined : not given meaning or significance, as by a definition;
                              not defined or explained</p>
              <p>I guess this is where ur undefined and my undefined is different.
                              Hence, U could define anything if it is undefined, while I do not
                              define what is undefined. I personally think my undefined is better,
                              because undefined is the opposite meaning of define. I guess if u
                              want to believe in YOUR meaning, I personally believe mine is better.
                              So I guess when we talk about undefined in a normal usage of the
                              word, it can be a chair , table , book. I guess it can be anything
                              for us right ? Good for you if u think undefined can be anything.
                              Unless you have totally different meanings for Maths , Real Life and
                              Religion...etc, maybe u should specifiy, or normally, people will
                              misunderstand.</p>
              <p>A mathematical expression which has no meaning and which cannot be
                              interpreted is known mathematically as 'undefined.'</p>
              <p>Regarding you definition:</p>

              <p>And then u quote:</p>
              <p><strong>“Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against
                              authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong

                              think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and
                              thus perhaps lose what we have gained.”</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>U said: “</strong>The third aspect of my subject is that of
                              science as a method of finding things out. This method is based on
                              the principle that observation is the judge of whether something is
                              so or not. All other aspects and characteristics of science can be
                              understood directly when we understand that observation is the
                              <strong>ultimate and final judge of the truth</strong> of an idea.”</p>
              <p>And yes, gravity the natural phenomenon, was the ultimate and
                              final jduge of that truth. U see the  similiarities here ?</p>
              <p><strong>“We've learned from experience that the truth will come

                              agree or they'll disagree with your theory. And, although you may

                              before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>Your ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                              it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                              body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body
                              is the same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease
                              to be students one day. However the definition of "student body"
                              is still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                              student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p><strong>My Answer: </strong>When it detects a wrong, they sometimes still
                              can find the answer. They know there is a problem, with the
                              equations, with the theory. It does not instantly correct itself and
                              reflect the truth. Hence its not longer a body of truth. When you say
                              body of truth, u HAVE To encompass everything , and can  NEVER be
                              wrong. Thats the whole idea of Body of Truths. Regarding your 
                              “student body” , picture this, all this student body , each of
                              them represents a theory. Now think of it this way, so lets assume
                              the wrong theories as “monkeys”. True when u find the monkeys and
                              kick them out. But the problem is, we still dont know how many
                              monkeys there are. So therein lies a problem. Grammatically it cannot
                              be a “student body” . Because there are monkeys in there. Now
                              another point is, we are not talking about grammatically truths. We
                              are talking about truths. Truths have to be Trut according to you. It
                              cannot be wrong. IF science already make mistakes, it therefore
                              cannot be truth.  Very simple logic.</p>
              <p>“I have said many times liao. Dividing by zero is illegal.
                              Furthermore 0/0 means it could be anything, and the left hand side

              <p><strong>My Answer</strong>: It HAS to be the same. Its the same equation.</p>
              <p>Exmaple: 0/0 + 1 = 0/0 + 2 . Now assume 0/0 = X so X +1 = X +2 .
                              So I assume u know simple algebra. So if X = 1 , both X on either
                              side have to = 1 right ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>U said:</strong> “Defined Variable could touch the graph and u get
                              an exact answer. Undefined value is like the graph u shown and it
                              cannot touch it but its value could means anything”</p>
              <p><strong>My Ans:</strong> My point is, it never touches 0. U can define it , variable it
                              here n there, this and that, it still will NEVER reach 0. Simple as
                              that.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>U said “</strong><em>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">rhetoric</a>, a </em><strong>fallacy</strong><em> is a misconception resulting from

              <p>So it is a truth. It is just tat u r giving a misconception
                              resulting from incorrect reasoning and argumentation.”</p>
              <p><strong>My Answer:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Fallacy :</strong> a false or mistaken idea</p>
              <p>We are NOT dealing with argumentation here right ? So obviously u
                              chose a wrong definition.</p>
              <p>We are talking about Maths, which allowed this 0/0 to exist, due
                              to its rules , but the problem now is they dont know how to define it
                              at the moment. Unless you are telling me, Maths as an incorrect
                              reasoning then? I am sure we both can agree that 0/0 is a
                              illegitimate operation. So if Maths were the one that spawn 0/0 , I
                              guess what u are saying is maths is an incorrect reasoning. Is that
                              what you are saying ?</p>
              <p>In case you may not understand my bad grammar, and sucky english,
                              have a good read of this one:</p>
              <p>“In <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Mathematics">mathematics</a>,
                              certain kinds of mistaken proof are often exhibited, and sometimes
                              collected, as illustrations of a concept of <strong>mathematical
                              fallacy</strong>. There is a distinction between a simple <em>mistake</em> and a <em>mathematical fallacy</em> in a proof: a mistake in a proof
                              leads to an <strong>invalid proof</strong> just in the same way, but
                              in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies, there is some
                              concealment in the presentation of the proof. For example the reason
                              validity fails may be a <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Division_by_zero">division
                              by zero</a> that is hidden by algebraic notation. There is a striking
                              quality of the mathematical fallacy: as typically presented, it leads
                              not only to an absurd result, but does so in a crafty or clever way.
                              <sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">[1]</span></sup> Therefore these fallacies, for
                              pedagogic reasons, usually take the form of spurious <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Mathematical_proof">proofs</a> of obvious <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Contradiction">contradictions</a>.
                              Although the proofs are flawed, the errors, usually by design, are
                              comparatively subtle, or designed to show that certain steps are
                              conditional, and should not be applied in the cases that are the
                              exceptions to the rules.</p>
              <p>The traditional way of presenting a mathematical fallacy is to
                              give an invalid step of deduction mixed in with valid steps, <strong>so that
                              the meaning of fallacy is here slightly different from the <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Logical_fallacy">logical
                              fallacy</a></strong>. The latter applies normally to a form of argument that
                              is not a genuine rule of logic, where the problematic mathematical
                              step is typically a correct rule applied with a tacit wrong
                              assumption. Beyond pedagogy, the resolution of a fallacy can lead to
                              deeper insights into a subject (such as the introduction of <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Pasch%27s_axiom">Pasch's
                              axiom</a> of <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Euclidean_geometry">Euclidean
                              geometry</a>). <sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">[2]</span></sup> <em>Pseudaria</em>,
                              an ancient lost book of false proofs, is attributed to <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Euclid">Euclid</a>.
                              <sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">[3]</span></sup></p>
              <p>Mathematical fallacies exist in many branches of mathematics. In
                              <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Elementary_algebra">elementary
                              algebra</a>, typical examples may involve a step where division by
                              zero is performed, where a <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Root_of_a_function">root</a> is incorrectly extracted or, more generally, where different values
                              of a <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Multiple_valued_function">multiple
                              valued function</a> are equated. Well-known fallacies also exist in

                              geometry</a> and <a href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Calculus">calculus</a>.”</p>

                                          took them ages to postulate a theory to explain it. They had a long

              <p>When it detects a wrong, they
                                          sometimes still can find the answer. They know there is a problem,
                                          with the equations, with the theory. It does not instantly correct
                                          itself and reflect the truth. Hence its not longer a body of truth.
                                          When you say body of truth, u HAVE To encompass everything , and
                                          can NEVER be wrong. Thats the whole idea of Body of Truths.
                                          Regarding your “student body” , picture this, all this student body
                                          , each of them represents a theory. Now think of it this way, so
                                          lets assume the wrong theories as “monkeys”. True when u find the
                                          monkeys and kick them out. But the problem is, we still dont know
                                          how many monkeys there are. So therein lies a problem.
                                          Grammatically it cannot be a “student body” . Because there are
                                          monkeys in there. Now another point is, we are not talking about
                                          grammatically truths. We are talking about truths. Truths have to
                                          be Trut according to you. It cannot be wrong. IF science already
                                          make mistakes, it therefore cannot be truth. Very simple logic.</p>

                  nicely with words ?</p>

                                          article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                          touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
                                          when I said it could be any value from 0 to
                                          infinity. U claimed tat 1=2 is a fallacy. <br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                                          meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                                          values. U do not even grasp the basic idea of wat is undefine. U
                                          paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots will
                                          conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat the 0
                                          in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U r still
                                          stuck in your elementary maths and think tat UNDEFINE value must
                                          have a cut in the graph like a variable. And any possible value
                                          from zero to infinity REINFORCE the idea it is undefined, and not
                                          being defined. And fallacy means u use incorrect arguments and reasonings to substantiate a rubbish statement, which is true to your case</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                                          definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                                          wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                          The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                          accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                          it can never be right or truth. A south korean professor could fake his result but it doesn't means newton law of motion is wrong. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                          on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                                          ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                                          be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ? U still did not answer your thinking with respect to tis statement</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                                          definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
                                          knowledge of facts. And u just misquote Richard Feynman</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                                          is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                          it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                          body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
                                          same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
                                          be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
                                          still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                                          student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
                                          small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
                                          and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
                                          is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
                                          theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
                                          wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>

              <p>So do u agree tat u had said gravity is not the truth before
                          ?</p>
              <p>Is very simple. It is for adding things within the same context
                          or the same unit. If u wanna find out the number of fruits u have u
                          add the number of fruits together. But to u, u r illogical and try
                          to add the fruits u have with, lets say, the number of bags to have
                          to get a figure tat is senseless.</p>
              <p>Why don't we try tis then. Before u do the summation, wat is the
                          question u r asking ? If u can define the question, then addition
                          will give u your answer. If u cannot even come out with the
                          question, then something is wrong with your logics</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wat do u want to find find out ? How many bags r there ? U just
                          add bags. How many fruits r there ? U just add fruits. EVERYBODY
                          know tis</p>
              <p>They could be wrong, but so r the theologists. Why state tat
                          truth and false is the domain of theologists and not scientist
                          ?</p>
              <p>Then let me ask u, why do u take medicine, or live in high rise
                          building of use computers ? If they r not truth to u, these
                          inventions could fail</p>
              <p>Tis goes back to the question if a thing is not truth, it cannot
                          be true as well.</p>
              <p><em>If it is not the truth, it is not true.</em></p>
              <p><em>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</em></p>
              <p><em>b) false is not true</em></p>
              <p>U said u believe certain things to be true, but not the truth.
                          In actual fact they contradict.If u think it is true, it is the
                          truth. If u think it is not truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>All of them r not science because they do not use the scientific
                          method. Christians r the one tat is persistent in tis saying
                          though</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">All these r not scientific method,
                          so they r not science</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>They r not wrong. They r just refined. U still have to use
                          corpuscular theory of light (photon) with waves to fully described
                          light. Motion of body still require laws of motion + einstein to
                          fully describe it</p>
              <p>If I said "it could be anything", is it different from saying
                          "nobody can say what it is".</p>
              <p>U have to tell me wat is the physical difference between the
                          two. U again is just playing with words. If u read at the
                          dictionary, it just says "unable to specify distinctly".Wat is
                          wrong with saying it "could be anything" ?</p>
              <p>And the HOW and WHY r truth. Nothing in it says tat the HOW and
                          WHY r not truth.</p>
              <p><em>All other aspects and characteristics of science can be
                          understood directly when we understand that observation is the
                          <strong>ultimate and final judge of the truth</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">of an idea</span></em></p>
              <p>The idea is the scientific hypothesis. It is judged if it is the
                          truth or not</p>
              <p><em><strong>We've learned from experience that the truth will
                          come out.</strong> Other experimenters will repeat your experiment
                          and find out whether you were wrong or right. Nature's phenomena
                          will agree or they'll disagree with your theory.</em></p>
              <p>Again the experiments etc is the scientific method and is
                          science. And he treat the theory as truth or not</p>
              <p>Simple. It is true and truth until proven false or wrong. A lot
                          of the scientific principles are always true given the same scope.
                          It had proven it is right before isn't it ? So my abc still
                          stands</p>
              <p>If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true”</p>
              <p>Tis is again rubbish. We r talking about "body" here mind
                          u.  Then u go to the "student body" and talk about theory and
                          monkeys. Why does the "student body" becomes theory ?Can u really
                          explain your explanation nicely with words ?</p>
              <p>And according to me, truth simply means conformity with facts
                          and reality. It cannot be wrong is your theory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wrong. When u divide it by X, the operation becomes illegal
                          because u r still dividing by zero. SO tis equation is still
                          wrong.Normally when u do variable equation, u must be sure they r
                          all defined</p>
              <p>As said before, the terms is important. If it cuts the graph, it
                          is defined value, not undefined. It is precisely why it never cuts
                          the graph it is undefined, and it could be anything between -ve
                          infinity to +infinity</p>
              <p>U personally used the word fallcy previously (as in fallacy in
                          maths). And your argument is 1=2 which is wrong because u use
                          incorrect reasoning and reasoning</p>
              <p>They already defined it as "undefined". Tis is already the end
                          of the line for 0/0 to tis moment in time. U still don't get it
                          don't u ? If u look at the graph, it will never cut it, yet at 0,
                          the values could be anything from -ve infinity to infinity. Tat is
                          the meaning of undefined.</p>
              <p>I read it, but it just support my idea.</p>
              <p><em>There is a distinction between a simple</em> mistake and a
                          <em>mathematical fallacy</em> in a proof: a mistake in a proof
                          leads to an <strong>invalid proof</strong> just in the same way,
                          but in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies, there is
                          <span style="color: #ff0000;">some concealment in the
                          presentation</span> of the proof.</p>
              <p><strong>U putting 0/0 as X and then dividing it. U r concealing
                          in the presentation.</strong></p>
              <p><em>Therefore these fallacies, for pedagogic reasons, usually
                          take the form of spurious <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Mathematical_proof">proofs</a> of obvious <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wapedia.mobi/en/Contradiction">contradictions</a>.</em></p>
              <p><strong>It is obvious tat it contradiction using wrong ways to
                          prove 1=2</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The latter applies normally to a
                          form of argument that is not a genuine rule of logic, where the
                          problematic mathematical step is typically a correct rule applied
                          with a tacit wrong assumption.</span></p>
              <p><strong>U assume division by 0 is correct. In actual fact it is
                          wrong.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope tis clear up your understanding of fallacy</p>
              <p>U said science is never about the truth, so it is false.</p>
              <p>I said science is a collection of truths.</p>

                          anything!” because, by asking that question  answering “It could
                          be anyhing?” Is like telling me... it could be anything, which I
                          KNOW. “If could be anything!”. thats why I asked you, “What is

              <p>Should be an extremely easy YES or NO. You have had enough time to explain, elaborate , spin and all that. I know what i said, u know what i said, i know what u said. So lets cut to the chase and work it out from here. U can choose not to answer a simple Yes or No. If that is the case, do not expect me to reply your questions that I have already answered so many times.</p>

                                  I made. I can answer u your questions, but u have to answer back mine
                                  as well. Fair right ?</p>

              <p>It
                                  is because u said gravity is a theory and thus not truth before.
                                  Therefore it is not constantly. Let me ask u a question back then. Yes
                                  or no too</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Did u ever suggest that gravity is a theory or there is a theory of gravity ?</strong> </span></p>
              <p>Let me tell u one thing first. Gravity is really a scientific theory similar to evolution.</p>

                  I can answer u your questions, but u have to answer back mine as
                  well. Fair right ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Did I not state clearly
                  and constantly that Gravit is Truth ? YES or NO</strong></span></p>
              <p>No</p>
              <p>It is because u said gravity is a theory and thus not truth
                  before. Therefore it is not constantly. Let me ask u a question
                  back then. Yes or no too</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Did u ever suggest that
                  gravity is a theory or there is a theory of gravity
                  ?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Let me tell u one thing first. Gravity is really a scientific
                  theory similar to evolution.</p>

              <p>This is because u threw garbage into the equation. I also issue
                  a challenge for u</p>

                                          1 apple =2 apples, 1 apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2
                                          apples or 2 oranges). If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the
                                          equation right and talking cock. Before u do the summation, why not

              <p>If we come across something that we dont even know what it is,
                                          and I asked you, “What is it ?” normally, if a person dont know,
                                          they will reply, “ I dont know” they dont say , “It could be

                                          anyhing?” Is like telling me... it could be anything, which I KNOW.
                                          “If could be anything!”. thats why I asked you, “What is it ?</p>

              <p>The idea is the scientific hypothesis. It is judged if it is the

              <p><strong>We've learned from experience that the truth will come

                                              That a lot of your explainations and these supposedly elaborations
                                              just <strong>further reinforces my point</strong>. Lets just do a

                                              can cut the bullshit, and get down to the gist of it to clear any

                                              certain scope. For 1+1=2, both must be the same context. (1 apple +
                                              1 apple =2 apples, 1 apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2
                                              apples or 2 oranges). If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the
                                              equation right and talking cock. Before u do the summation, why not
                                              u state the question to ask first before doing the sums ?</p>

              <p>If we come across something that we dont even know what it is,
                                              and I asked you, “What is it ?” normally, if a person dont know,

                                              anyhing?” Is like telling me... it could be anything, which I KNOW.

              <p>It is because u said gravity is a theory and thus not truth

              <p><em>If we come across something that we dont even know what it

              anything!” because, by asking that question answering “It could be
              anyhing?” Is like telling me... it could be anything, which I KNOW.
              “If could be anything!”. thats why I asked you, “What is it

              <p>U r again saying rubbish. If someone shows a thing which we have
              no clue at all, a person saying "it could be anything" is
              justified. U know wat is the meaning of "anything" ? It means it
              could be something u do not know too. U could search at google and
