              <p>1. There is no need to capitalize 'science' and 'theory'. They are just words, not some sacrosanct entity.</p>
              <p>2. Your idea of truth still eludes me. Can you define it more objectively, because I suspect that my interpretation is starkly different from yours.</p>
              <p>If some event or observation is overwhelmingly evident and verifiable, then it is true, is it not?</p>
              <p>In simple logic:</p>
              <p>Observation X occurs in all experiments created.</p>
              <p>It is true that X occurs. It is a fact that X occurs. (I find this 2 statements equivalent)</p>
              <p>A theory X* explains why X occurs within the framework on science. X* should be consistent with all phenomena that is predicts.</p>
              <p>So X is true and X* explains why its true.</p>

              <p>To answer it correctly,</p>
              <p>It is the truth, that in our solar system, the planets revolves around our sun. The Heliocentric theory explains the truth of it.</p>
              <p>However , it revolves in an elliptical manner because of this strange geometry of the even stranger thing called spacetime , and it is the equations we use to describe this warping of space (as laid out by Einstein). We have SOME idea of how and why things are the way they are, but the
              equations merely describe the truth, they are not the truth itself.</p>
              <p>Again , Science explains How and Why.</p>
              <p>Do u understand ?</p>

              <p>Perhaps your idea of 'truth' is with absolute certainity, is that what you mean? In that case what you are searching for is technically called a 'proof' in the mathematical sense. As long as we properly define numbers and the addition operator, the statement "1+1 = 2" is true, there is no other way out.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, very few laws of science can be 'proven' rigourously like this. The only one I can think of is the 2nd Law of Thermo because its is largely a purely mathematical derivation.</p>
              <p>I think this 'truth' of yours is no different from asking a never-ending sequence of whys. Do you see the relation?</p>
              <p>At this point you must be aware of the current situation of research theoretical physics. Right now, there are 2 huge fields in physics: general relativity and quantum theory. These 2 theories are hugely successful in predicting many of the physical phenomena. They have answered a long sequences of why's to explain the current state of the Universe.</p>
              <p>However, it is clear that these 2 individual parts are still incomplete because they fail to combine nicely. As such, there are extreme situations such as inside black holes and at the beginning of the universe where science do not have the full answer. Someday in the future, some one smart enough may combine these 2 great theories into what is practically a Thoery of Everything which will describe every aspect of the universe from conception to death.</p>
              <p>Unless the ToE is so powerful it predicts itself, then it is pretty much the end of the road. Science cannot answer why ToE but it can bring us so tantalising close to "understanding the mind of God". I believe it is this final 'why' which is your interpretation of the 'truth'.</p>
              <p>From this point, it will be up to Theologians and Philosophers to debate if the theory was drawn up by a diving creator or a flying monster with sphaghetti appendages.</p>

              <p>k k.. i am glad, it is finally settled. We have come to an understanding that its a never ending WHYs. Thats my whole point. Finally... somebody.. that understands ! I thought i was talking to rocks the whole time in this forum.</p>
              <p>Thats why, we must keep an open mind! The possibilities. Thats what i am trying to bring forth, the relationship between science and religion.</p>

              <p>Do u understand the subtlety of TRUE and TRUTH ? To understand the subtle meaning? If they are the same... why two words ? Fact, True and Truth are different. Something that is true is not absolute. What is wrong with understanding the word?  Truth is something exist whether we know or not and is immutable. 'U cant handle the TRUTH.. not u cant handle the true stuff'</p>
              <p>Whether we KNOW the truth.. is another matter. Whether we can comprehend the truth, based on the current knowledge we have, to the understand , our concept. 200 laters, it may not be the truth, then how can it be the truth if it is not true ? It may be true at that time.. and looking back, they will say we are so stupid, lucky we not born in that era.</p>
              <p>Oh.. and i never said Gravity is not the truth. I explicitly said Gravity is the truth.. Newtons is true on this planet for now, until proven otherwise. But the existence of gravity will still be the truth. Are u putting words in my mouth now ?</p>
              <p> Or is this simple concept overloading your limited capacity to understand. Do u even understand the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understand </span>?</p>

              <p><br>I am not talking about theologist here. Just trying to separate the concept here what is true.. and what is the truth. Science is not about searching the truth. Its about unravelling the mysteries of the universe.</p>
              <p>The Jesus example is correct. Yes u get it. So why is it so hard ?</p>
              <p>Right now, we may have a misunderstanding of the word truth and true.</p>
              <p>In the days of Coppernicus, they regarded that earth is the centre of the universe. And they claim that is the TRUTH. But he managed to discover that it is wrong!  So it is not true. The truth is we revolve around the sun. But my point is, during that time they consider it true. And its not the truth is it. Now, we know the truth. What is true.. may not be the truth. Even if all the people on the planet think otherwise, it is still the truth!</p>
              <p>So yes, accordingly to me, what is true may not be the truth. Bravo. Simple concept yes no ?</p>

              <p>Come on la... u know wat is the subtle difference between true and truth ? True is usually used as an adverb or adjective while truth is normally used as a noun. The definition of truth is really "the <strong>true</strong> or actual state of a matter". Tat is english. U don't define the word truth. U follow. And if u talk about " You can't handle the truth" and "U can't handle the true facts". The meaning is the same. It is just tat the first one sounds shorter.And if u want to add "fact" inside, from the dictionary it is "something that actually exists; reality; <strong>truth"</strong>. Again fact =truth=true except it is adjective, noun or u wanna rephrase the wording of a sentence</p>
              <p>And u don't use time to confuse people. The coffee may be hot a second and cold in an hour. If the time I said "the coffee is hot" is when the coffee is hot, then it is the truth and true and a fact. It may be cold later but it doesn't make my previous statement wrong or a lie or not true, fact or truth.</p>
              <p>Please use the dictionary and show me your definition. Otherwise u r not talking english. It is a basic fact tat if your word used is different from the meaning in the dictionary, u r not talking english.</p>

              <p>Even if the WHOLE WORLD believes the statement to be true, the TRUTH is, the earth revolves around the sun. In actual reality, we revolve around the sun. It doesnt matter !</p>

              <p>Now fast forward to now, based with all the facts and information we have, we may think something is true, but is it.. the truth ? 500 laters we may find out new stuffs, and realised we are wrong. What we say is true now, may not be the truth.</p>

              <p>@Douglas: Proving that fossils can be created within short spans of time does not prove that there were no fossils that originated from 3.5b years ago, and therefore does not in any way invalidate the possibility of Darwinian theory.</p>

              <p> In your statement, u use two different standards here. One is coppernicus impression and the other is your impression. If u look from the english point of view, it is the truth then tat the earth is the center of the universe.If u ask them "is it the truth tat earth is the center of the universe" and they answer "yes it is the truth". From an english point of view, it is not wrong. U got to understand tis. U r really saying the *subjective truth" is not equal to the real truth. But no matter wat, true=truth (except adjective, noun)</p>
              <p>Now the only problem is, u feel tat science can say a lot of things now, but they may be wrong. Is tat the thing u r trying to say all the time ? Isn't it easier if u say it tat way ?</p>

              <p>No, "1+1 = 2" is true regardless of the physical universe. Mathematics is an inpendent and separate entity from existance. Aliens will know "1+1 = 2", other universes (if there are parallel universes) can develop mathematics that is exactly the same as what man has done.</p>
              <p>Its a difficult concept to understand, so I will try to make an example, but not a very good one.</p>
              <p>In mathematics, we can theoretically calculate the value of pi without any physical measurements. However, this value of pi is only true if the geometry of the space is 'flat' (ie, parallel lines never meet and etc.) Yet, this universe of ours might be not perfectly flat (parallel lines can diverge or intersect). Consequently, the real value of the ratio of the circumference to diameter is slightly. Thus, you can see that this value of pi is independent of physical existance. It does not need to be created.</p>

              <p>I am using Truth as concept 5: Actual Existence.</p>
              <p>From an english point of view, its not wrong . I agree</p>
              <p>No, i am here hoping you guys are smart enough to understand. I see all the truth, true and fact, so i wanted to talk more chim with you guys. I didnt know u guys were that stupid.</p>
              <p>Sorry for the language, you may feel anger or irritation, but i dont know what other simple words anymore to describe how i feel.</p>
              <p>You have to forgive me. I am sorry.</p>

              <p>so to the basic statement, 1+1=2 or gravity makes things fall to the ground or earth the truth or not ? U can't win in tis u see. The word is defined as such. U r not fighting about the facts of the world here but the definition of the word "2" and "gravity"</p>
              <p>I can't help laughing when I hear someone say tat 1+1=2 is not the truth. How do u define the word "2" ?</p>
