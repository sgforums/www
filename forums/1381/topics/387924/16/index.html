                                          <strong>OF</strong> Gravity.  I gues u REALLY are too stupid

              <p>Stupid
                  ? Gravity is still a THEORY. U said u do not believe in evolution is
                  because it is a theory. Now gravity is a theory and u simply believed
                  it to be the truth. Double standard again ?  U said THEORY OF GRAVITY,
                  RIGHT ? U said then science cannot tell between truth and false right ?
                  Theory of gravity is science domain right ? Then u said science is
                  never about truth. SO how come gravity is truth now ? Aren;t u

              <p>2) Then u ask, if they make mistakes, how could they be truth</p>

              <p>The

              <p>It

                  Howver there r many things tat could be substituted such as brands of
                  evaporated milk etc. So wat does it show ? Your example of engine is
                  really pointless</p>

                  I am just pointing to u basic english. U said truth as "actual

              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>

              <p>Sorry to say but they generally have the same definition of truth,

                                          science being created by human. I got no problem . All i am

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
                                          truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
                                          And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
                                          both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1
                                          apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2 apples or 2 oranges).

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
                                          Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                          of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                                          "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it
                                          is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                                          truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                                          proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                                          <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                                          call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u.</p>
              <p> There
              r other ways to say tis. Gravity is a theory, U said theory r not
              truth. Gravity in in the domain of science. Since science to u is never
              about truth, then gravity is not truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  truth has no
                                          scope and can works for all circumstances<br></span></p>
              <p>My ans: When I ask u whether gravity can pull aspiration and
                                          etc, u admit tat truth has a scope. All truth has a limit on where
                                          it works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
                                          NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
                                          finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
                                          about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
                                          truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
                                          Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                                          the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ? I asked u the following, why refuse to answer ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
                                          u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
                                          wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
                                          u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                                          is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
                                          if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
                                          again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
                                          truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                                          be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                                          equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                                          article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                          touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
                                          when I said it could be any value from 0 to
                                          infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                                          meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                                          values. U paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots
                                          will conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat
                                          the 0 in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U
                                          provide an example of mathematics fallacy which really just means a
                                          misrepresentation of maths</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                                          definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                                          wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                          The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                          accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                          it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                          on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                                          ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                                          be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ? Why refuse to comment on the above ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                                          definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
                                          knowledge of facts.And no matter who u quote, it is meaningless because u r not the person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                                          is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                          it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                          body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
                                          same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
                                          be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
                                          still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                                          student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
                                          small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
                                          and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
                                          is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
                                          theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
                                          wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>
              <p>If a scientific hypothesis is proven wrong, does it means all
                                          the established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">11) U claimed: It is my version of truth, not yours</span></p>
              <p>My
              ans: When asked u to define truth, the only thing u came out is "actual
              existence". However u add in "must work under all situation",
              "perfect", "all truth cannot be viewed collectively for better
              understanding" etc. U just keep adding things u like into it. Wat does
              it show ? No integrity, lier, fickle minded and absurbness.</p>
              <p>Even the philosophers etc can narrow their definition but u can't because u r grammaticaly incapable.</p>

              <p>Stupid ? Gravity is still a THEORY. U said u do not believe in
              evolution is because it is a theory. Now gravity is a theory and u
              simply believed it to be the truth. Double standard again ?  U
              said THEORY OF GRAVITY, RIGHT ? U said then science cannot tell
              between truth and false right ? Theory of gravity is science domain
              right ? Then u said science is never about truth. SO how come
              gravity is truth now ? Aren;t u contradicting yourself ?</p>
              <p>Then good. I wonder why u ever bring out tis stupid topic in the
              first place</p>
              <p>U see u make rubbish statements again. Let me show u</p>
              <p>1) U claim an organisation/people/field makes mistake</p>
              <p>2) Then u ask, if they make mistakes, how could they be
              truth</p>
              <p>3) U r assuming they make mistakes for EVERYTHING. If they can
              do right things, why couldn't they be truth ?</p>
              <p>4) Fact is they don't always make mistakes. They can do right
              things. Thus u cannot conclude they r never about truth</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am human, and so ? U r human too</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The error is u mis-interpreting it. Sorry but tis is the
              technical term for your mistake. It's called fallacy. It is always
              true and interprete truth and facts well.Tat is why u r incapable
              to explaining the meaning of division by zero</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It may taste different, but u yourself said yes it is
              acceptable. Your analogy about engine say different brand could not
              be substituted. Howver there r many things tat could be substituted
              such as brands of evaporated milk etc. So wat does it show ? Your
              example of engine is really pointless</p>
              <p>Well, I am just pointing to u basic english. U said truth as
              "actual existence" and it doesn't make u escape from the earlier
              question. Unless u wanna say u don't mean wat u say and thus a lier
              ?</p>
              <p>Sure no problem. Two can play tis game</p>
              <p>Then it comes to tis question which u refuse to comment</p>
              <p>If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ? I am afraid not
              because u claimed 0/0 is logically zero</p>
              <p>U don't care lor. So I said u r delusional, thinking answers to
              simple questions like why apples fall to the ground is not truth,
              or how rain comes about is not truth to u. I can't stop u from
              trying to be stupid right ?</p>
              <p>Sorry to say but they generally have the same definition of
              truth, which is something true. And they can express their truth in
              words, u can't because u r grammatically challenged</p>
              <p>Then u can refer to the above</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
                  truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
                  And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
                  both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1
                  apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2 apples or 2 oranges).
                  If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the equation right and
                  talking cock.</p>
              <p>When I asked u wat to state the question which u wana ask for
                  the above equation, u refuse to provide it. Why u refuse to provide
                  a simple question for your ridiculous example ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
                  Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                  of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                  "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it
                  is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                  truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                  proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                  <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                  call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u.</p>
              <p> There r other ways to say tis. Gravity is a theory, U said
                  theory r not truth. Gravity in in the domain of science. Since
                  science to u is never about truth, then gravity is not truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  truth has no
                  scope and can works for all circumstances<br></span></p>
              <p>My ans: When I ask u whether gravity can pull aspiration and
                  etc, u admit tat truth has a scope. All truth has a limit on where
                  it works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
                  NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
                  finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
                  about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
                  truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
                  Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                  the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ? I asked u the following,
                  why refuse to answer ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
                  u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
                  wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
                  u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                  is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
                  if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
                  again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
                  truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                  be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                  equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                  article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                  touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
                  when I said it could be any value from 0 to
                  infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                  meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                  values. U paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots
                  will conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat
                  the 0 in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U
                  provide an example of mathematics fallacy which really just means a
                  misrepresentation of maths</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                  definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                  wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                  The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                  accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                  it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                  on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                  ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                  be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ? Why refuse to
                  comment on the above ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                  definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
                  knowledge of facts.And no matter who u quote, it is meaningless
                  because u r not the person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                  is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                  it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                  body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
                  same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
                  be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
                  still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                  student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
                  small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
                  and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
                  is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
                  theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
                  wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>
              <p>If a scientific hypothesis is proven wrong, does it means all
                  the established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">11) U claimed: It is my version of
                  truth, not yours</span></p>
              <p>My ans: When asked u to define truth, the only thing u came out
                  is "actual existence". However u add in "must work under all
                  situation", "perfect", "all truth cannot be viewed collectively for
                  better understanding" etc. U just keep adding things u like into
                  it. Wat does it show ? No integrity, lier, fickle minded and
                  absurbness.</p>
              <p>Even the philosophers etc can narrow their definition but u
                  can't because u r grammaticaly incapable.</p>

                  but not the truth, because only Richard Feynman is the ultimate judge
                  to whether our statements are the truth to his definition or not.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science is wrong
                  before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                  it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                  body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body
                  is the same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease
                  to be students one day. However the definition of "student body"
                  is still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                  student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
                  small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
                  and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
                  is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
                  theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
                  wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>

                  established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>

              <p>So your analogy is pretty stupid. There is no link between words

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Its obvious that my belief in the meaning of True and Truth is different. I seperate what is True .. and THE TRUTH.  All i said was Science is not truth. Thats all. It can be true, but not necessarily the Truth. I am more then willing to understanding your point of view. I said i can see why u think the way u do. I have no problem with that. So how come u never admit your fault and misunderstandings ? Seems to me like u think  u are Mr Perfect, faultless and god-like and all-knowing. Because u are not, its really hard for me to discard my own beliefs and adopt yours. If u admit ur mistakes and misunderstanding, I am more then willing to be inclined to lean towards your understanding.<br></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U believe crate of good apples can consist of rotten apples and u still deem it a crate of good apples, while i cannot accept it as a crate of good apples when there are rotten apples inside, hence a crate of mostly good apples is the most i can compromise on. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I get it. What else u want me to say ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I believe Science  = How and Why. To unravel the mysteries of the universe. Whether they find the truth or are truths or not doesnt matter to me because the Truth is already out there.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I differentiate between what is true and what is THE TRUTH. Thats all.<br></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I believe that X on one side must be the same as the other X on the other side under the same equation hence X=X</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats all. U can believe in what u want , I can believe in what i want. We have differences thats all. I am fully capable of understanding your POV.<br></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
                                              truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
                                              And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
                                              both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1
                                              apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2 apples or 2 oranges).
                                              If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the equation right and
                                              talking cock.</p>
              <p>When
                  I asked u wat to state the question which u wana ask for the above
                  equation, u refuse to provide it. Why u refuse to provide a simple
                  question for your ridiculous example ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
                                              Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                              of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                                              "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity" And obviously it
                                              is easily understood as "theory of gravity" which</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                                              truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                                              proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                                              <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                                              call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u.</p>
              <p> There
                  r other ways to say tis. Gravity is a theory, U said theory r not
                  truth. Gravity in in the domain of science. Since science to u is never
                  about truth, then gravity is not truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  truth has no
                                              scope and can works for all circumstances<br></span></p>
              <p>My ans: When I ask u whether gravity can pull aspiration and
                                              etc, u admit tat truth has a scope. All truth has a limit on where
                                              it works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
                                              NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
                                              finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
                                              about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
                                              truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
                                              Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                                              the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ? I asked u the following, why refuse to answer ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
                                              u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
                                              wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
                                              u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                                              is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
                                              if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
                                              again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
                                              truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                                              be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                                              equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                                              article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                              touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0
                                              when I said it could be any value from 0 to
                                              infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                                              meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                                              values. U paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots
                                              will conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat
                                              the 0 in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U
                                              provide an example of mathematics fallacy which really just means a
                                              misrepresentation of maths</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                                              definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                                              wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                              The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                              accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                              it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                              on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                                              ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                                              be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ? Why refuse to comment on the above ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                                              definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or
                                              knowledge of facts.And no matter who u quote, it is meaningless because u r not the person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                                              is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                              it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                              body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the
                                              same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to
                                              be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is
                                              still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the
                                              student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
              <p>If a small part of science is proven wrong, it just meant tat
                                              small part is wrong. However u r prejudiced and practise stereotype
                                              and thus claim the whole organisation is wrong because a small part
                                              is wrong. In tat case, politicians, policemen, philosophers ,
                                              theologistsand in fact the whole world's organisation had commit a
                                              wrong before and thus should be wrong to u too.</p>
              <p>If a scientific hypothesis is proven wrong, does it means all
                                              the established laws and theories from einstein etc r wrong ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">11) U claimed: It is my version of truth, not yours</span></p>
              <p>My
                  ans: When asked u to define truth, the only thing u came out is "actual
                  existence". However u add in "must work under all situation",
                  "perfect", "all truth cannot be viewed collectively for better
                  understanding" etc. U just keep adding things u like into it. Wat does
                  it show ? No integrity, lier, fickle minded and absurbness.</p>
              <p>Even the philosophers etc can narrow their definition but u can't because u r grammaticaly incapable.</p>

              <p>U choose to keep cutting and pasting, then I do the same thing lor. And it is not the same</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U believe Science = Body of
                                      Truths</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U equate True = Truth</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U believe crate of good apples can
                                      consist of rotten apples and u still deem it a crate of good
                                      apples, while i cannot accept it as a crate of good apples when
                                      there are rotten apples inside, hence a crate of mostly good apples
                                      is the most i can compromise on.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I get it. What else u want me to
                                      say ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I believe Science  = How and
                                      Why. To unravel the mysteries of the universe. Whether they find
                                      the truth or are truths or not doesnt matter to me because the
                                      Truth is already out there.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I differentiate between what is
                                      true and what is THE TRUTH. Thats all.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I equate True = True</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">             
                                      Truth = Truth</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats why I believe what is true ,
                                      may not be the truth.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U believe 0/0 = Anything = 0 to infinity = Undefined</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I believe 0/0 =Illegitimate
                                      operation = Undefined</span></p>
              <p>U believe that X on one side can be anything , and X on the
                                      other side can be another thing too  under the same equation.
                                      U want to follow your own verion of algebra , its up to you.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I believe that X on one side must
                                      be the same as the other X on the other side under the same
                                      equation hence X=X</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats all. U can believe in what u
                                      want , I can believe in what i want. We have differences thats all.
                                      I am fully capable of understanding your POV.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The problem is from some of the statements made by badzmaro </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Science is about the HOW and WHY, and never about the truth. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">After writing out these statements, a lot of people have problem with it and questioned why he has such an impression and these people include reservistsianz, deadstroke, larry teo etc. However badzmaro dismissed them and repeatedly said they r too stupid to understand his views. As such, tis topic goes to so many pages about arguments on his statements.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He states science answer Why and HOW and these r not truth. However to most people, any real answer to any question r truth. If a person asked “Did u sleep last night” and u answer honestly “yes”. Tat is already the truth. However he views it differently and any answers to questions, such as water cycle or how to make a compuiter r not truth.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also uses a different meaning about “science” and “truth”. Up to tis moment in time, he claims the dictionary is wrong about their definition with these two words yet he refuse to state his definition clearly. He said the definition of science in the dictionary, which is “body of truth” as wrong and he cannot produce any evidence showing other organisation having a different view from the dictionary. He produce a statement made by Richard Feynman, which to his own admission, he cannot judge wat his views on science r. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For truth, he states it is very close to “actual existence”, however he never apply it to the things he said. He keep changing the definition of the word such as it must be perfect or it must work in all context etc which is again different from wat other people interprete. He also states in a wiki article tat various people have different view on truth. However generally they all follow the dictionary description tat it is dealing with true facts and he cannot state the views he follows or whose version of truth he is on. He also state tat wat is true may not be the truth. And when pointed out to him the logical contradiction (wat is not truth is false, and wat is false is not true) he refused to make a comment on it</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also states tat science can never come out with truth, and other people produce facts tat things such as gravity and maths like 1+1 is always the truth. Badzmaro also produce another example of 0/0 and claimed tat 1+1 is not truth. However these r fallacies and 0/0 or 1+1 r truth. He just used misrepresentation and mis-interpretation to force these basic equations to be false. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also claimed tat science could be wrong, and thus not truth. Yet he cannot name a single establish scientific theory/ law to be wrong. It is also pointed out to him tat a wrong scientific hypothesis doesn’t make other establish theories from people like Einstein or Newton to be wrong. All these observations r independent with their independent evidences and we cannot stereotype and claimed all of it is wrong because some of the hypothesis made by other people r wrong</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Lately, he is already not responding to questions and just stick and paste arguments without reading through. And he just say his version of truth is different from mine and thus excused from answering any question. My log in name is different from his too, does tat give me any excuse to not answer his question ? He has stated his version of truth as close to actual existence and thus still has to reconciled it with the questions asked, which he did not</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Nevertheless I am tired of the topic, and it seems pointless to carry on since in the end, the only possible achievement is simply tat he has a view tat is isolated from the world, tat he is wrong is saying other people r too stupid to understand his view since he cannot define his own views as well. And tat really means little to me. And as such, if he does not wish to carry on the topic, I would not like to continue either. </span></span></p>

                  needs to be replaced by a true theory, but even that, cant gurantee
                  its correct. It might later be found to be false again. So because of
                  that, because of the possibility of falsehood in that body of truths,
                  I just cant accept it.  Because I KNOW, there are definitely

                      topic</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The problem is from some of
                      the statements made by badzmaro</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Science is about the HOW and
                      WHY, and never about the truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">After writing out these
                      statements, a lot of people have problem with it and questioned why
                      he has such an impression and these people include reservistsianz,
                      deadstroke, larry teo etc. However badzmaro dismissed them and
                      repeatedly said they r too stupid to understand his views. As such,
                      tis topic goes to so many pages about arguments on his
                      statements.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He states science answer Why
                      and HOW and these r not truth. However to most people, any real
                      answer to any question r truth. If a person asked “Did u sleep last
                      night” and u answer honestly “yes”. Tat is already the truth.
                      However he views it differently and any answers to questions, such
                      as water cycle or how to make a compuiter r not
                      truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also uses a different
                      meaning about “science” and “truth”. Up to tis moment in time, he
                      claims the dictionary is wrong about their definition with these
                      two words yet he refuse to state his definition clearly. He said
                      the definition of science in the dictionary, which is “body of
                      truth” as wrong and he cannot produce any evidence showing other
                      organisation having a different view from the dictionary. He
                      produce a statement made by Richard Feynman, which to his own
                      admission, he cannot judge wat his views on science
                      r.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For truth, he states it is
                      very close to “actual existence”, however he never apply it to the
                      things he said. He keep changing the definition of the word such as
                      it must be perfect or it must work in all context etc which is
                      again different from wat other people interprete. He also states in
                      a wiki article tat various people have different view on truth.
                      However generally they all follow the dictionary description tat it
                      is dealing with true facts and he cannot state the views he follows
                      or whose version of truth he is on. He also state tat wat is true
                      may not be the truth. And when pointed out to him the logical
                      contradiction (wat is not truth is false, and wat is false is not
                      true) he refused to make a comment on it</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also states tat science
                      can never come out with truth, and other people produce facts tat
                      things such as gravity and maths like 1+1 is always the truth.
                      Badzmaro also produce another example of 0/0 and claimed tat 1+1 is
                      not truth. However these r fallacies and 0/0 or 1+1 r truth. He
                      just used misrepresentation and mis-interpretation to force these
                      basic equations to be false.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also claimed tat science
                      could be wrong, and thus not truth. Yet he cannot name a single
                      establish scientific theory/ law to be wrong. It is also pointed
                      out to him tat a wrong scientific hypothesis doesn’t make other

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This whole discussion is betwen you and me. If u think its THAT important to try to clear ur suposedly flawless , perfect arguments... YOU ARE WRONG my dear Stupidissmart.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">U seem to be SO concerned with your own face</span></strong> , thats why i never expect you to admit to your own mistakes and misunderstandings<span style="text-decoration: underline;">.<strong>U are so concerned about how others percieve you thats why u will deny ur mistakes and continue with your supposedly own interpretations  of my explainations</strong></span><strong>. </strong>That is your apparent weakness and that is where i will attack you from. <strong> </strong> And continuely to push for your interpretations and force your compliance on me. But it appears, that 3 times i have decided to come to an understanding. But 3 times u blew it off and insist on continueing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Well, then lets Cross-Examine your latest statements .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence from now on, its all about making you lose face. I have given u time and time again, a chance, an opportunity, a space so u can manuever, well, obviously, u dont want it, u just want to have the final say to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WIN</span>. Well, its not about winning here. U will find out sooner or later.  I already said, to me, its not a matter of face. As i have clearly made omissions and admitted, but the same is NOT to say about you.</span></p>

                          topic</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The problem is from some of
                          the statements made by badzmaro</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Science is about the HOW and
                          WHY, and never about the truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">After writing out these
                          statements, a lot of people have problem with it and questioned why
                          he has such an impression and these people include reservistsianz,
                          deadstroke, larry teo etc. However badzmaro dismissed them and
                          repeatedly said they r too stupid to understand his views. As such,
                          tis topic goes to so many pages about arguments on his
                          statements.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He states science answer Why
                          and HOW and these r not truth. However to most people, any real
                          answer to any question r truth. If a person asked “Did u sleep last
                          night” and u answer honestly “yes”. Tat is already the truth.
                          However he views it differently and any answers to questions, such
                          as water cycle or how to make a compuiter r not
                          truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also uses a different
                          meaning about “science” and “truth”. Up to tis moment in time, he
                          claims the dictionary is wrong about their definition with these
                          two words yet he refuse to state his definition clearly. He said
                          the definition of science in the dictionary, which is “body of
                          truth” as wrong and he cannot produce any evidence showing other
                          organisation having a different view from the dictionary. He
                          produce a statement made by Richard Feynman, which to his own
                          admission, he cannot judge wat his views on science
                          r.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For truth, he states it is
                          very close to “actual existence”, however he never apply it to the
                          things he said. He keep changing the definition of the word such as
                          it must be perfect or it must work in all context etc which is
                          again different from wat other people interprete. He also states in
                          a wiki article tat various people have different view on truth.
                          However generally they all follow the dictionary description tat it
                          is dealing with true facts and he cannot state the views he follows
                          or whose version of truth he is on. He also state tat wat is true
                          may not be the truth. And when pointed out to him the logical
                          contradiction (wat is not truth is false, and wat is false is not
                          true) he refused to make a comment on it</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also states tat science
                          can never come out with truth, and other people produce facts tat
                          things such as gravity and maths like 1+1 is always the truth.
                          Badzmaro also produce another example of 0/0 and claimed tat 1+1 is
                          not truth. However these r fallacies and 0/0 or 1+1 r truth. He
                          just used misrepresentation and mis-interpretation to force these
                          basic equations to be false.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He also claimed tat science
                          could be wrong, and thus not truth. Yet he cannot name a single
                          establish scientific theory/ law to be wrong. It is also pointed
                          out to him tat a wrong scientific hypothesis doesn’t make other
                          establish theories from people like Einstein or Newton to be wrong.
                          All these observations r independent with their independent
                          evidences and we cannot stereotype and claimed all of it is wrong
                          because some of the hypothesis made by other people r
                          wrong</span></span></p>

                          why I believe my statement to be true, but not the truth, because
                          only Richard Feynman is the ultimate judge to whether our statements
                          are the truth to his definition or not.</span></span></p>

                          SCIENCE.   But I supose, the DICTIONARY IS THE BIBLE TO YOU.</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> I guess u are </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no different from biblical fanatics !</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For truth, he
                          states it is very close to “actual existence”, </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">however he
                          never apply it to the things he said. He keep changing the definition
                          of the word such as it must be perfect or it must work in all context
                          etc which is again different from wat other people interprete. He
                          also states in a wiki article tat various people have different view
                          on truth. However generally they all follow the dictionary

                          tat wat is true may not be the truth. And when pointed out to him the

                          cant , others cant, I have nothing to say. What else can I do ? Its
                          pretty simple. Theory OF Gravity. Its not to show people, its a
                          statement to you.</span></span></p>

                          say. The theory of gravity mention why gravity pull things to the
                          ground and to u, tat is a theory and thus cannot be the truth. So u
                          did say tat gravity is not truth</span></span></p>

                          about mistakes in science ? U show no established theories tat had

                          However U said tat science theories r wrong errors. I give u the

              <p style="margin: 5pt 0cm 10.1pt 72pt;"><strong><span>Scientific research is very good at improving our understanding
                          of the natural world, including ourselves. Many of the things that
                          people do, like learning and using language, like feeding
                          themselves, like having and raising children, have been carefully
                          studied by scientists with very interesting and useful results.
                          However, science itself, which is after all another type of human
                          activity, hasn't been studied much, scientifically. As a result,
                          many of our beliefs about science don't really make much
                          sense.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 5pt 0cm 10.1pt 72pt;"><strong><span>From
                          the time of the discovery of the basic physical principles which we
                          know as Newton's Laws, in the middle of the Seventeenth Century,
                          until the revolutionary developments in physics and mathematics at
                          the beginning of the Twentieth Century, scientifically educated
                          people  believed that science produces completely correct
                          knowledge.  (I guess u are one of THOSE “educated
                          people”</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><strong><span>In an amazing
                          feat of sustained intelligence, Copernicus, Galileo, Tycho, Kepler
                          and Newton had developed a body of research that combined
                          observation, experimentation and theory in a new way. The resulting
                          Laws of Motion and Universal Gravitation seemed to explain
                          beautifully every movement on the Earth and in the heavens with a
                          small set of simple principles. Deductive certainty, familiar from
                          the logical precision of geometry, guaranteed the existence of that
                          truth revealed by science.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><strong><span>Our
                          understanding of ourselves and our world, and our understanding of
                          science itself, grew out of pre scientific beliefs and practices.
                          One of those beliefs is the concept of truth.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span>We have been
                          discussing some of the history of the concept of truth as applied
                          to scientific knowledge. In light of that history, we can see that
                          to regard scientific knowledge as true, or even as approaching
                          truth, is actually quite suspect. </span></p>

              <p><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ya ? But I got a problem
                          with yours and thus ask u to clarify. Up till now u refuse to do
                          it. And as said before, your maserati example is just
                          bad</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Its a perfect example. But u are just too stupid to understand it. The engine. The core. The heart of the car.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Clarify ? I clarified with examples of 1+1 , Gravity, science able to be wrong... etc. But i guess as usual, u interprete it the way u do. So whats the point ? So be it.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tis is rubbish again. I said
                          before the graph show x could be –ve infinity to + infinity. And 0
                          is between these values. U r thinking like a primary school kid tat
                          is why u expect the graph to cut. I did not make a mistake here, it
                          is just u refuse to accept the answer</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">IS ZERO =  ZERO +ve , -ve. YES OR NO?  U know, pulling answers ouf o ur ass is one thing, not admitting to a mistake is another.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tat again is another loop
                                                  made by u. Science had stated facts which u cannot reject. They
                                                  stated 1+1=2. They stated gravity. They stated water freezes at 0
                                                  degree. R u gonna say these r not truth </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What loop ?Science explaines the  How and Why . Truth is there. So whats the problem ? Please.. enlighten me. </span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Wat evidence did u produce ?
                                                  Why u refuse to answer the paragraph ? I don’t have any problem
                                                  with the body of truth and I have given u my answers repeatedly.
                                                  Tat is sure a sneaky way to avoid answering
                                                  question</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">SNEAKY ? lol... come on. U can do better then that. The sneaky one is not me stupid. I got no problem with u accepted rotten apples as crate of good apples.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">But if u think u can
                                                  accept existence of falsehood in your body of truths, then I got
                                                  nothing to say. It doesnt negate the effect of falsehood already in
                                                  there. It needs to be replaced by a true theory, but even that,
                                                  cant gurantee its correct. It might later be found to be false
                                                  again. So because of that, because of the possibility of falsehood
                                                  in that body of truths, I just cant accept it. Because I KNOW,
                                                  there are definitely falsehood. But if u dont, good on

                                                  your definition of truth from it ? I think it is as plain as day
                                                  tat u refuse to define it, keep adding arbitrary meaning to it and

                          than the dictionary. Thus science is a body of

U can pull ur ass out n say 0/0 on inside is ANYTHING, 0/0 on one side can be another ANYTHING, in the end of the day, THAT fallacy if i simplify it simply, i can prove 1 = 2.  But i guess again, U R RIGHT.. I AM TOTALLY WRONG in my algebra.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u r too stupid to
                                                  understand undefined variable, I really suggest tat u should
                                                  consult a person who is well versed in maths first. All the while u
                                                  r still stuck in elementary maths and dealing with
                                                  variable</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">lol... u sure ? U better be sure with ur above statement corresponds with X on one sides can equal one thing, and X on the other side can be another in the same equation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Wa lao if u wanna plagarise,
                                                  at least give the website a credit. Plagariser, u lift off section
                                                  from the website</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For someone who supposedly doesnt understand my "english" and "bad grammar" , i hope u can understand things written by others. But as usual, u will dismiss it, like theories, truths and science. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And if u read the article, u
                                                  know wat ? It is simply a person point of view without any
                                                  evidence. And tis is normal since it is from a religious website.
                                                  Wat is your view ? U have no view and u decide to steal other
                                                  people idea ? Wat a shame</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">My view is stated  pages n pages before. Its very obvios its cut n paste with different fonts. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He is human. But u r just
                                                  using fallacy to hide your flawed logic</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">WOW.. so your logic is superior ? So IF MAN makes mistakes, Einstein is a man, and Einstein makes mistakes is NOT logic ? U want me to show u that Einstein makes mistakes ? Do u ? Are u going to cut off ur left nut ?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And it do include
                                                  communicating the idea to other peers. Unlike u, I will agree I
                                                  make a mistake. But u think u r always right and tat u refuse to
                                                  acknowledge tat your definition of the words is so
                                                  wrong<br></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">WOW.. FINALLY.. U ADMIT U WILL MAKE A MISTAKE. Took u QUITE a while didnt it ? </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">They have no problem
                                                  defining their truth but u have. U never even tell which school of
                                                  thought u r following for the word truth. Tat is the biggest
                                                  problem with u. And dictionary .com is English. If we wanna
                                                  standardize our understanding, we use dictionary</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So.. I NEED to follow a school of thought ? I cant have my OWN brain to decide on which are the ones i should adopt and which are the ones i dont ?  U know, dictionary.com , u can treat it as ur bible . I , choose to absorb all information and disseminate it myself and come up with my own conclusion.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Truth is Truth = Actual Existence. But again u just too stupid<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">True = True</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Whats so hard ? I already stated, clearly, with examples, fitting my description of what is true may not be the truth. U understood, but u just want to apply UR definition of TRUTH into my belief. So u ARE stupid. U know it cant work, but u keep insiting it.</span> Hence i am more then willing to entertain u in this loop.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Again rubbish here. To u,
                                                  there is no such thing as grey and everything must be black and
                                                  white. U think u could buy a crate of 500 good apples with 0 spoilt
                                                  apples in it ? Actually wat r u trying to say here ? U wanna
                                                  stereotype ? If in a country there r criminal in it, u gonna say it
                                                  is a lousy country ? If u have diarrhea before, r u gonna say u
                                                  like to eat garbage ? If u say u wrote the wrong things before, r u
                                                  gonna say u r stupid and wrote all the wrong things
                                                  ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Exactly, if there is grey.. U SAY ITS GREY. If its BLACK.. u SAY ITS BLACK.. if its WHITE.. u SAY ITS WHITE.  U dont say something that is NOT.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats why, if u cant gurantee me a crate of GOOD APPLES, u tell me its Crate of MOSTLY good apples, i accept. Of course. So what if i am specific. What if i am down to the detail.  It gets me get the job done. It gets me to identify affidavits and testimonies that are no exact, to find flaws and intentions. I expect my oil tanker to come with 27300 litres. But because they said 27300 litres  with a variance of +- 0.05%, i accept. But just dont tell me its 100% 27300 litres of AGO product. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">YOUR analogy are even MORE stupid. But as usual, UR analogy.. is THE BEST... OH SO PERFECT n MAKES SENSE. Please, spare me the superior analogies.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Since when i said i was not human ? I was the one saying i am human. I make mistakes. I admit my mistakes. Explaination was given to clear any misunderstandings. But like i said, U DONT WANT MY UNDERSTANDING, U WANT MY COMPLIANCE.</span></p>

              <p><em><span style='color: red; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Ya ? But I got a problem with yours and thus ask u to clarify. Up till now u refuse to do it. And as said before, your maserati example is just bad</span></em><em></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Its a perfect example. But u are just too stupid to understand it. The engine. The core. The heart of the car.</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Perfect example ? Wat is the link between “truth” and engine then ? I don’t see the connection here. And there r things tat could be replaceable and things tat could not be replaceable. Most people will not mind eating kway teow instead of noodles or drinking different brand of milk. But of course, u r too stupid to realize tat your example is silly</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">Clarify ? I clarified with examples of 1+1 , Gravity, science able to be wrong... etc. But i guess as usual, u interprete it the way u do. So whats the point ? So be it.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The example of 1+1 is wrong and u keep insisting gravity is truth. Of course to a person who just keep denying, even basic knowledge is false to u</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='color: red; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Tis is rubbish again. I said before the graph show x could be –ve infinity to + infinity. And 0 is between these values. U r thinking like a primary school kid tat is why u expect the graph to cut. I did not make a mistake here, it is just u refuse to accept the answer</span></em><em></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">IS ZERO =  ZERO +ve , -ve. YES OR NO?  U know, pulling answers ouf o ur ass is one thing, not admitting to a mistake is another.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Is zero between +ve infinity and –ve infinity ? Of course again u try to deny and refuse to answer questions in its entirely. And do u know who is the first person who says tat 0/0 is logically zero ? It is u. So u must be pulling answers from your ass</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='color: red; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Tat again is another loop made by u. Science had stated facts which u cannot reject. They stated 1+1=2. They stated gravity. They stated water freezes at 0 degree. R u gonna say these r not truth</span></em><em></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">What loop ?Science explaines the  How and Why . Truth is there. So whats the problem ? Please.. enlighten me.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As said before, any real answer to a question is truth. If u asked whether I slept last night and I answered an honest yes, tat answer is already the truth. So the answer to how and why like why is there rain and simple knowledge like water freezes at 0 degrees r real answers and thus truth. But then u just deny and deny and try to avoid question etc</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">But if u think u can accept existence of falsehood in your body of truths, then I got nothing to say. It doesnt negate the effect of falsehood already in there. It needs to be replaced by a true theory, but even that, cant gurantee its correct. It might later be found to be false again. So because of that, because of the possibility of falsehood in that body of truths, I just cant accept it. Because I KNOW, there are definitely falsehood. But if u dont, good on you.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The loop is really u saying tat there r no truth in science at all, and tat they cannot even make a simple statement. I have asked before. Simple things like things r pulled to the ground by gravity is a fact and truth. Simple things like 1+1=2 is also simple truth, or how water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius etc. However u refuse to believe such simple things to be truth. It don’t even have to be a complicated theory and a simple basic knowledge and fact. But of course u just deny tat these simple facts r even true. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">Well.. let me guess, even when i defined it, u TOO create the loop by saying i never defined it. So why bother ? Right ? Since u are ALWAYS SO RIGHT.. n PERFECT.</span><span lang="EN-US">*clap clap*</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u defined it, then I will stop the loop. Simple right ? When I say u start a loop. It is because I have answerd your points but u just avoid it. But for the definition case, u cannot. If u think your statement is so full of sense, then u should just give a proper definition to it. But u refused. So it is obvious u really is just talking cock</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='color: red; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">U said before tat Richard Feynman had a different definition of science. U and I r not Richard Feynman. Then we cannot conclude wat is his view on science r. So u cannot show any other definition of science available other than the dictionary. Thus science is a body of truth</span></em><em></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">U think its body of truths.. please.. by all means. U and I are not Richard Feynman, he is the ultimate judge to that truth.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ya lor. Then it still go back to the fact tat the accepted definition of science is still body of truth. U never manage to show anybody with opposing views to tis</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">O REALLY... is 1+1 = 2 and 1 Sperm + 1 Ovum = 1 Fertilised egg  are same ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 72pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">Please.. enlighten me again.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Wat do u wanna find in the first place before u start the calculation ? Surely u must have logical problem or question at hand before u apply the solution right ? Otherwise u r really just talking cock</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">OH SO NOW THEY ARE FALLACIES... and i made WRONG interpretation of it. BRAVO !! BRAVO !!!</span><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: red;">Please... enlighten me on my supposedly WRONG interpretation to it. SHOW ME.</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U mean on the definition of fallacy ? U can check the dictionary which states tat fallacy: <span> </span></span><span style='color: #333333; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";'>a misleading or unsound argument</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; " lang="EN-US">A fallacy IS fallacy. U can pull ur ass out n say 0/0 on inside is ANYTHING, 0/0 on one side can be another ANYTHING, in the end of the day, THAT fallacy if i simplify it simply, i can prove 1 = 2.  But i guess again, U R RIGHT.. I AM TOTALLY WRONG in my algebra.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Another logic flaw of yours</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So again u made another fallacy and mis-interprete by providing unsound arguments. </span></p>

I expect my oil tanker to come with 27300 litres. But because they said 27300 litres  with a variance of +- 0.05%, i accept.

              <p><em><span>Ya ? But I got a problem with yours
                      and thus ask u to clarify. Up till now u refuse to do it. And as
                      said before, your maserati example is just bad</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Its a perfect example. But u are
                      just too stupid to understand it. The engine. The core. The heart
                      of the car.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Perfect example ? Wat is the link
                      between “truth” and engine then ? I don’t see the connection here.
                      And there r things tat could be replaceable and things tat could
                      not be replaceable. Most people will not mind eating kway teow
                      instead of noodles or drinking different brand of milk. But of
                      course, u r too stupid to realize tat your example is
                      silly</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Clarify ? I clarified with examples of 1+1 , Gravity,
                      science able to be wrong... etc. But i guess as usual, u interprete
                      it the way u do. So whats the point ? So be it.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The example of 1+1 is wrong and u keep
                      insisting gravity is truth. Of course to a person who just keep
                      denying, even basic knowledge is false to u</span></p>
              <p><em><span>Tis is rubbish again. I said before
                      the graph show x could be –ve infinity to + infinity. And 0 is
                      between these values. U r thinking like a primary school kid tat is
                      why u expect the graph to cut. I did not make a mistake here, it is
                      just u refuse to accept the answer</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">IS ZERO =  ZERO +ve , -ve. YES OR NO?  U
                      know, pulling answers ouf o ur ass is one thing, not admitting to a
                      mistake is another.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Is zero between +ve infinity and –ve
                      infinity ? Of course again u try to deny and refuse to answer
                      questions in its entirely. And do u know who is the first person
                      who says tat 0/0 is logically zero ? It is u. So u must be pulling
                      answers from your ass</span></p>
              <p><em><span>Tat again is another loop made by u.
                      Science had stated facts which u cannot reject. They stated 1+1=2.
                      They stated gravity. They stated water freezes at 0 degree. R u
                      gonna say these r not truth</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">What loop ?Science explaines the  How and Why .
                      Truth is there. So whats the problem ? Please.. enlighten
                      me.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As said before, any real answer to a
                      question is truth. If u asked whether I slept last night and I
                      answered an honest yes, tat answer is already the truth. So the
                      answer to how and why like why is there rain and simple knowledge
                      like water freezes at 0 degrees r real answers and thus truth. But
                      then u just deny and deny and try to avoid question etc</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="color: red;">But if u think u can accept existence of falsehood in
                      your body of truths, then I got nothing to say. It doesnt negate
                      the effect of falsehood already in there. It needs to be replaced
                      by a true theory, but even that, cant gurantee its correct. It
                      might later be found to be false again. So because of that, because
                      of the possibility of falsehood in that body of truths, I just cant
                      accept it. Because I KNOW, there are definitely falsehood. But if u
                      dont, good on you.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The loop is really u saying tat there r no
                      truth in science at all, and tat they cannot even make a simple
                      statement. I have asked before. Simple things like things r pulled
                      to the ground by gravity is a fact and truth. Simple things like
                      1+1=2 is also simple truth, or how water freezes at 0 degrees
                      Celsius etc. However u refuse to believe such simple things to be
                      truth. It don’t even have to be a complicated theory and a simple
                      basic knowledge and fact. But of course u just deny tat these
                      simple facts r even true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Well.. let me guess, even when i defined it, u TOO
                      create the loop by saying i never defined it. So why bother ? Right
                      ? Since u are ALWAYS SO RIGHT.. n PERFECT.</span><span>*clap clap*</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u defined it, then I will stop the loop.
                      Simple right ? When I say u start a loop. It is because I have
                      answerd your points but u just avoid it. But for the definition
                      case, u cannot. If u think your statement is so full of sense, then
                      u should just give a proper definition to it. But u refused. So it
                      is obvious u really is just talking cock</span></p>
              <p><em><span>U said before tat Richard Feynman
                      had a different definition of science. U and I r not Richard
                      Feynman. Then we cannot conclude wat is his view on science r. So u
                      cannot show any other definition of science available other than
                      the dictionary. Thus science is a body of truth</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">U think its body of truths.. please.. by all means. U
                      and I are not Richard Feynman, he is the ultimate judge to that
                      truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ya lor. Then it still go
                      back to the fact tat the accepted definition of science is still
                      body of truth. U never manage to show anybody with opposing views
                      to tis</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">O
                      REALLY... is 1+1 = 2 and 1 Sperm + 1 Ovum = 1 Fertilised egg 
                      are same ?</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Wat do u wanna find in the first place
                      before u start the calculation ? Surely u must have logical problem
                      or question at hand before u apply the solution right ? Otherwise u

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">OH SO NOW
                      THEY ARE FALLACIES... and i made WRONG interpretation of it. BRAVO
                      !! BRAVO !!!</span> <span><span style="color: red;">Please... enlighten me on my supposedly WRONG
                      interpretation to it. SHOW ME.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U mean on the definition of fallacy ? U can
                      check the dictionary which states tat fallacy: <span> </span></span><span>a misleading or unsound
                      argument</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Oh.. so
                      now they are 2 different things... hahaha...  i thought u said
                      0/0 can be ANYTHING. Please, check urself, or this one will really
                      bite u in the ass REAL BAD.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">A fallacy
                      IS fallacy. U can pull ur ass out n say 0/0 on inside is ANYTHING,
                      0/0 on one side can be another ANYTHING, in the end of the day,
                      THAT fallacy if i simplify it simply, i can prove 1 = 2.  But
                      i guess again, U R RIGHT.. I AM TOTALLY WRONG in my
                      algebra.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Another logic flaw of
                      yours</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It could be
                      anything</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So u claimed it could be
                      variable</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However it don’t have to be
                      a variable. It can be anything</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So your argument is still
                      wrong because it could be anything other than a variable and thus
                      my equation is not wrong</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So again u made another fallacy and
                      mis-interprete by providing unsound arguments.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">lol... u
                      sure ? U better be sure with ur above statement corresponds with X
                      on one sides can equal one thing, and X on the other side can be
                      another in the same equation.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yes I am sure. And U r still
                      treating 0/0 as a defined variable and u r just too stupid to
                      realize tat.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">For
                      someone who supposedly doesnt understand my "english" and "bad
                      grammar" , i hope u can understand things written by others. But as
                      usual, u will dismiss it, like theories, truths and
                      science.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Well so u admit u plagarise

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then why not have the
                      courtesy to quote where u take it from ? I guess u did state your
                      view long long ago. Science is never about the truth right ? Even
                      your article do not support tat fact</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">WOW.. so
                      your logic is superior ? So IF MAN makes mistakes, Einstein is a
                      man, and Einstein makes mistakes is NOT logic ? U want me to show u
                      that Einstein makes mistakes ? Do u ? Are u going to cut off ur

                      things</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span>3)</span> <span>We cannot conclude Einstein is wrong with his theories. He may
                      have come out with truth</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 72pt;"><span>He is human.
                      But u r just using fallacy to hide your flawed logic</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So u made a stereotype. U
                      said Einstein make mistake, which I agree. But I do not agree tat
                      his theories which r well established and accepted r mistakes. But
                      to u, it is because he made mistakes before. Again shows your
                      stereotype</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><em><span>And it
                      do include communicating the idea to other peers. Unlike u, I will
                      agree I make a mistake. But u think u r always right and tat u
                      refuse to acknowledge tat your definition of the words is so
                      wrong</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">WOW..
                      FINALLY.. U ADMIT U WILL MAKE A MISTAKE. Took u QUITE a while didnt

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U still have not shown me

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">So.. I
                      NEED to follow a school of thought ? I cant have my OWN brain to
                      decide on which are the ones i should adopt and which are the ones
                      i dont ?  U know, dictionary.com , u can treat it as ur bible
                      . I , choose to absorb all information and disseminate it myself
                      and come up with my own conclusion.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Truth is
                      Truth = Actual Existence. But again u just too
                      stupid</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">True =
                      True</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Whats so
                      hard ? I already stated, clearly, with examples, fitting my
                      description of what is true may not be the truth. U understood, but
                      u just want to apply UR definition of TRUTH into my belief. So u
                      ARE stupid. U know it cant work, but u keep insiting it.</span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The very basic thing to do
                      is simply define it properly, which is something u refuse. If u say
                      u come from your own school of thought, then surely u must tell wat
                      it is about right ? And I did not treat the dictionary as a bible.
                      I treat it as dictionary. The standard way of using English
                      vocabulary and words.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u say it is actual

                      specific. What if i am down to the detail.  It gets me get the
                      job done. It gets me to identify affidavits and testimonies that
                      are no exact, to find flaws and intentions. I expect my oil tanker
                      to come with 27300 litres. But because they said 27300 litres 
                      with a variance of +- 0.05%, i accept. But just dont tell me its

                      when u force people to give a definitive answer ? Isn't it your

              <p> </p>
              <p>The truth is that there are some serious reasons to doubt that
                      'scientific' theories or principles can ever be thought of as
                      absolutely true.</p>
              <p>There are difficulties in the reasoning that anoints any
                      scientific theory as absolutely true, and they have to do with the
                      basic process of science itself. The scientific method can be thought
                      of as a heuristic that always (in theory) moves forward, toward
                      models with greater and greater explanatory and predictive strength.
                      It also leaves open further questioning that will itself be subject
                      to the heuristic.</p>
              <p>There has been a great deal of progress that has come out of
                      science, and this may be evidence that explanatory and predictive
                      models have played out well so far. But there is a certain Western
                      mindset that readily accepts our present world as a state of
                      advancement. There are other ways of looking at the world we have
                      engineered and concluding that we have run amok, or at least that we
                      haven't gotten some of the important stuff right at all. I am wildly
                      enthusiastic about science, but we need to proceed with far more
                      humility and caution than has been our banner up to now.</p>
              <p>It's decided by "Scientific Methods", but will only be
                      true until such time that new evidences are discovered.</p>

              <p>The truth has not changed nor will it be decided by a majority,
                      but by the evidence.</p>
              <p>Facts are facts. Will a vote of over half a group of physicists
                      suspend the effects of gravity? Certainly not. But gravity is hard to
                      ignore.</p>
              <p>Most of those who fully understand the scientific principles <strong>are</strong> convinced.</p>
              <p>Scientific thinking has evolved. Why wouldn't it? Everything else
                      does. Denying it, wishing it away or refusing to accept it won't
                      change it. Scientific truth is not subject to the governance of
                      majority vote. The natural world operates by its own rules. Puzzle
                      them out, understand them, accept them and adapt them to make your
                      life and the lives of your brothers and sisters better, or step off.</p>
              <p>Probably every single advance in science started out as a minority
                      view, as did some that stayed that way because they didn't stand up
                      to scientific scrutiny. Just because something is now in a minority
                      does not mean it will some day attain majority acceptance status.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Its very simple. Someone to be able to
                      come up with thus thinking, does not contradict with my thinking.
                      Just because minority has a little bit differences in belief doesnt
                      mean they are totally wrong.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">U know anything about Thermodynamics ? When
                      we were in primary and secondary schools, what did the teachers teach
                      us. Compare it to what UNI taught us. First thing the lecturer said
                      was "WHAT U KNOW ABOUT THERMODYNAMICS.. IS WRONG.. THIS IS THE
                      REAL STUFF"</span></p>

                      State Theory</a>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But as usual, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">u will deny, but its up to
                      you. U will as usual pull answers and interpretations out of from
                      your ASS</span>. I am here to show u the possibilities. To believe or to
                      accept or not, is up to you. But to say i am talking rubbish, is
                      another. Because the same can be equally said about u. You can
                      believe in what u want. THats why, u will never be a great scientist
                      or a great businessman.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence.. for someone who is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>UNSURE</strong></span> about the subject matters, you are talking as much rubbish... or even
                      more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Truth:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Philosophy 101' would divide the idea of
                      physical 'truth' into small and capital-cased "t"s, wherein
                      small case = transient, fallable, personal "truth" vs. the
                      universal, greater-than-an-individual, (quasi-)permanent capital case
                      "Truth". </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">There are certain things that everyone or
                      virtually everyone agrees on, and are therefor seen as "Universal
                      Truths", but that doesn't make them right, because there's bound
                      to be someone who disagrees with them, and as long as we're all
                      human, all our beliefs are on the same footing, even if one or
                      another happens to be in the majority.<br><br>If you consider
                      something true, then it is true for you, yes. But it's no as though
                      that doesn't mean anything, in fact it dictates your personal reality
                      to a huge degree. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then, there is Emotional truth, where is
                      basically just a statement made by a MAJORITY TO CONTROL THE
                      MINORITY. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Another distortion of the the word TRUE is
                      when truth or falsity doesn't apply to a statement. For instance,
                      another ABer used the example: "'that movie sucked' can be true
                      for you, but not for the next person." This is not something can
                      be evaluated in terms of its truth or falisty. It cannot be true that
                      a movie sucked. It can be true that a movie sucked according to
                      certain criteria, or it can be true that you believe the movie
                      sucked, but whether or not the movie really sucked cannot be spoken
                      of in terms of truth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You so simply equate True = Truth.. DO U
                      WORSHIP DICTIONARY.COM ? Here, we have scholars, intellectuals ,
                      philosophers..  and all u can equate true = truth is ur simple
                      logic. If speaks in lengths about ur limited knowledge. Even if i may
                      not know how to present my definition properly and clearly, my
                      examples has shown again n again the meaning of my truth.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do u understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch%27s_paradox">Fitch's
                      Paradox of Truth</a> ?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_paradox">Moores

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If u come out with your bullshit statement
                      that it all corressponds with.. DICTIONARY.COM and NOTHING ON MY
                      DEFINITION ,u are indeed ultimately, too stupid, too wilfully
                      ignorant or just too Kiasu Si to admit ur bamboozling.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What is Truth ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a theory of truth?</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">&lt;----
                      Notice the word THEORY ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br>Let's take an example from Physics, a science that is
                      famous for theories. A theory of electricity is an explanation of the
                      nature and cause of electricity and a set of laws that electrical
                      phenomena obey. A theory of truth is essentially an explanation of
                      the nature of truth and a set of laws that "true" things
                      obey. Electricity is the property that all electrical things share.
                      What is the property that all true statements have in common? Why is
                      a theory of truth important? Because that is what, ultimately, our
                      cognitive life is all about: truth. Whenever we analyze a scene,
                      whenever we analyze a statement, whenever we recall a memory,
                      whenever we do anything with our brain, we are on a quest for truth.
                      Our cognitive life is a continuous struggle for truth: is that stain
                      in the distance a tree? Is she home tonight? Will my flight take off
                      on time? Why did the Roman empire fall? Our mind, ultimately, is an
                      organ to identify truth. The meaing of our life is truth. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Correspondence </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br>Perhaps the most intuitive theory of truth is the
                      "correspondence theory of truth", that relates truth to
                      reality: a statement is true if and only if the world it describes is
                      real. Truth corresponds to the facts. The statement "snow is
                      white" is true in virtue of the fact that snow is, indeed,
                      white. The statement "my name is Piero" is true in virtue
                      of the fact that my name is, indeed, Piero. And so forth. There are
                      several problems with this theory of truth. The truth predicate (the
                      expression "is true") acts as an intermediary between words
                      (language, mind) and the world. One problem is that this definition
                      of truth relates two things that are very different in nature and it
                      is not clear how we can find a correspondence between things that
                      belong to different realms. Precisely, statements (such as "snow
                      is white" and "my name is Piero") are mental objects.
                      They are in my head. The reality we compare them with is made of
                      objects, such as snow. A statement is made of a number of words (each
                      of which may present its own problems at close scrutiny). The reality
                      is refers to is made of objects and properties of objects. Is there
                      truly a correspondece between the words "snow is white" and
                      the fact that snow is white? How can we compared two things that are
                      different in nature, like a mental object and a physical fact? This
                      point is important because we are supposed to define truth outside
                      us: truth must not depend on us, it must depend on the world.
                      Something is true not because I think so, but because there is some
                      objective truth out there in the world. If this is the case, the
                      problem is: how can a mental object like a statement relate to an
                      object that is outside the mind. Second, most statements just do not
                      accurately reflect reality: is snow white? Not really. The closer you
                      look at snow the less white it is. Is today a "hot" day?
                      Yes, if you don't start arguing about which temperature qualifies for
                      hot. And so forth. The first objection can be answered by observing
                      that, if you believe in modern science, we rarely talk about things
                      that exist and mostly talk about things that our brain presents us
                      with. I don't know if there exists snow. My brain shows me something
                      that we named snow, but Quantum Physics tells me that there is only a
                      clod of particles. I see white, but Quantum Physics tells me that
                      there is a stream of photons. And so forth. When we say that snow is
                      white, we are not referring to something that exists in the world (it
                      may or it may not exist), we are referring to something that is
                      happening in our brain: our brain received some inputs from the
                      senses and generated the perception of snow and of white. Therefore,
                      both statements and "reality" are mental objects, and it is
                      perfectly legitimate to relate a mental object such as the statement
                      "snow is white" to a mental object such as the perception
                      or the memory that snow is white. We can rephrase the correspondence
                      problem in neural terms. A statement (for example, about the snow
                      being white) is a neural pattern in the brain. The fact that snow is
                      white is also a neural pattern in the brain (either a pattern of
                      recalling a memory of snow or a pattern of perceiving the snow). It
                      is perfectly legitimate to compare two patterns of brain activity.
                      <br>Alfred Tarski found his own solution to the problems of the
                      correspondence theory. Alfred Tarski's theory of truth has two
                      components. First, he defines a true staments as a statement that
                      corresponds to reality. This is only a definition of "true
                      statement" and not of "truth" in general. Of course,
                      if one lists all true statements, one gets a definition of truth:
                      truth is "snow is white" and "my name is Piero"
                      and "the Earth is not the center of the universe" and
                      "France won the 1998 world cup" and "..." But
                      this is neither elegant nor practical (most languages have an
                      infinite number of true statements). The second component to Tarski's
                      theory is the idea that truth can only be defined relative to another
                      language. Most languages include the word "true", but that
                      leads to paradoxes like "I am lying" which is both true and
                      false at the same time. The problem is simply that "true"
                      is a word of the language and we are applying it to a statement of
                      the language. Tarski realized that one can't define truth in a
                      language through the language itself and avoid contradictions. So he
                      defined only "truth in a language". One must use a
                      "meta-language" to define truth in the "object
                      language". Truth in the object language can then be defined
                      recursively from the truth of elementary statements (the "sentential
                      functions"). "For all sentences s in language L, s is true
                      if and only if T(s) is true", where T(s) is a formula containing
                      s and L's primitives. Alfred Tarski's theory of truth does not work
                      well with ordinary languages, although it works wonders with the
                      formal languages of mathematical logic. The problem with Tarski's
                      theory is that it is not clear what he defined. He did not defined
                      truth, but "truth in a language". By this, it is not clear
                      if he indirectly acknowledged that the nature of truth is impossible
                      or even pointless. A secondary problem is that his theory does not
                      distinguish the linguistic theory from the metaphysical theory:
                      explaining the word "true" is a linguistic matter, whereas
                      explaining the nature of truth is a metaphysical matter. Tarski's
                      theory is about the linguistic feature, and does not seem to even
                      address the metaphysical question. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coherence </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br>The correspondence theory of truth assumes that the
                      definition of truth is in the world. However, one can object that
                      everything is ultimately in the mind and therefore the definition of
                      truth is inside us. It is pointless to look for a definition in the
                      world. Idealists (as opposed to materialists) believe this. This
                      leads to a difference theory of truth: truth can no longer be defined
                      as the correspondence to the facts of the worlds, but has to be
                      defined as the correspondence with the facts of the mind. The
                      "coherence theory of truth" defines truth as coherence with
                      the system of beliefs in one's mind: the statement "snow is
                      white" is true if the fact asserted by this statement this is
                      coherent with all the other facts that are believed to be true. Truth
                      is defined by the set of coherent statements that make up a whole
                      system of beliefs. Any theory of Cosmology, for example, is of this
                      kind: the truth of a statement about black holes cannot verified
                      (because we can't travel into a black hole and not even close to one)
                      and therefore it only depends on whether it is coherent with the
                      other "truths" of Cosmology. Idealists believe that this is
                      the definition of truth in general: we can never be sure of the
                      world, therefore we can only assess whether a statement is coherent
                      or not with our beliefs. The idea of "coherence" is
                      extended by phenomenology to mean a state of balance with the
                      environment. Martin Heidegger, one of the most confusing and cryptic
                      (not to mention boring) of philosophers, claimed that truth is
                      "freedom". What he calls freedom is an "attunement"
                      with the world (or "letting beings be"). You attune to the
                      world and truth is revealed to you. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pragmatism </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br>Charles Peirce enunciated the "pragmatist" motto,
                      that amounts to: the meaning of an idea consists in its practical
                      effects on our daily lives. If two ideas have the same practical
                      effects on us, they have the same meaning. The idea of truth is
                      defined accordingly: truth is the effect is has on us, and that
                      effect is "consensus". Truth is not agreement with reality,
                      it is agreement among humans. That agreement is reached after a
                      process of scientific investigation. At the end of each such process,
                      humans reach a consensus about what is "true" (e.g., that
                      the Earth is not the center of the universe, that water is made of
                      hydrogen and oxygen, that the Everest is the tallest mountain on the
                      Earth). This set the foundations for relating truth to
                      "verifications": something is true if and onloy if its
                      truth can be practically verified. For Michael Dummett, the truth of
                      a statement must be provable in a finite amount of time, otherwise
                      the statement is not true. The statement "I will never win the
                      Nobel prize" is provable (just wait until I die), but the
                      statement "I am a genius" or "there will never be
                      another like me" are not provable, and thereforetheir truth
                      value cannot be determined. When we say that a statement is true, we
                      mean that it can be verified. Dummett applies to the world at large
                      the same rules that "intuitionists" applied to logic: to
                      decide the truth of a statement is to prove a theorem. The proof
                      determines truth. If no proof can be constructed, then there is no
                      truth. Verification is not just a means to achieve truth: it is
                      truth. The two concepts are virtually impossible to separate. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deflation </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br>In 1927 Frank Ramsey inaugurated "deflationary"
                      thinking about truth by claiming that the word "true" is
                      simply redundant: "it is true that the snow is white" does
                      not say anything more than "the snow is white". By adding
                      "it is true that" we are not adding anything, we are merely
                      making it sound nicer. Quine's "disquotationalism" follows
                      from this claim: to ascribe truth to a statement merely means to
                      remove the quotation marks. For example, the statement "snow is
                      white" is true if and only if it is a fact that snow is white.
                      Now remove the inessential words and what you have is: "snow is
                      white" is true if and only if snow is white. The truth predicate
                      "is true" simply removes the quotation marks. "Truth
                      is disquotation". Quine concedes that the truth predicate (the
                      expression "is true") has at least one useful function: it
                      allows us to generalize, like when I state "everything I told
                      you is true". By using the truth predicate, I can simplify what
                      would otherwise be an infinite list of statements. But this is the
                      only usefulness of the truth predicate: there is no need for a theory
                      of truth, there is no nature of truth. The truth predicate is merely
                      a linguistic expedient to generalize statements. The problem remains,
                      of course, that ordinary humans can easily grasp the concept of
                      "true", whether Quine believes it to be a mere
                      "disquotation" or not. There is something that we call
                      "truth" in our minds. Donald Davidson advocates that truth
                      is a primitive concept that cannot be defined via anyt other concept.
                      In fact, no other concept would exist without the concept of truth. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Functionalism </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br>Inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein's common-sense theory of
                      truth, that different statements can be all true without being true
                      in the same way (that led him to "alethic pluralism", i.e.
                      to accept that truth is a multi-faceted concept), Lynch takes issue
                      with the idea that there is "one" theory of truth. Lynch
                      argues that there is a plurality of "truths", rather than a
                      single all-encompassing theory of truth. For example, truth in ethics
                      and truth in justice and truth in mathematics obey different laws.
                      The nature of truth is difficult to find because there isn't only one
                      nature of truth. One needs a different theory of truth for each
                      domain, and that is precisely what ordinary humans employ in their
                      daily lives. Just like functionalism believes in "multiple
                      realizations" of the same mental phenomenon, i.e. that the same
                      mental state can be "realized" by different physical states
                      (what matters being the function, not the "stuff"), Lynch
                      believes that "truth" (a uniform concept across domains)
                      can be realized by different theories in different domains. For
                      example, pain is a mental state that is causually related to some
                      inputs (e.g., a sore finger), outputs (e.g., facial expression and
                      sounds), and other mental states (e.g., unhappiness). Any state that
                      realizes this causal role is called "pain", even if the
                      pain due to a blister and the pain due to a cold are very different
                      in nature. Lynch claims that "truth" names a functional
                      role, and that we all understand what that role is, regardless of
                      what realizes it. Lynch compares this with the concept of "head
                      of state": both the president of the United States, the king of
                      Jordan, Fidel Castro and the chancellor of Germany are heads of
                      state, although they way they got the job and the way they administer
                      it vary greatly. The "function" of head of state, though,
                      is understood the same way in the US, France and Cuba. (A possible
                      objection is that equality is sometimes merely a form of fuzziness:
                      the closer you look, the less similar Castro and the king of Jordan
                      are, and the less clear the term "head of state" is. One
                      can suspect that "functional role" is a synonym for "vague
                      definition". Relax the definition and just about anything in
                      this universe will have the same "functional role" as
                      anything else). If truth is merely a functional role, if "to be
                      true" is to play the alethic role, what is exactly that role?
                      Lynch thinks that truth is defined by an "alethic network",
                      a set of interdepenmdent definitions that, jointly, define each
                      other: a proposition is whatever is true or false, a fact is what
                      makes a proposition true or false, etc. Lynch claims that each
                      "alethic concept" in the alethic network is defined by the
                      role it plays in the network. One can't grasp an alethic concept
                      (truth, proposition, fact) without grasping them all. Each alethic
                      concept depends on all of the others. Truth cannot be defined as
                      "stand alone", but only as part of the broader definition
                      of all alethic entities. Truth is the property of playing the truth
                      role in an alethic network. </strong></p>

              <p>A big problem in science and social research is the question of
                      proving whether a statement is true or not, where truth is defined as
                      <em>common agreement</em> about the validity of the statement. We all
                      have our individual truths, but only when target people agrees a
                      truth does it have any external value.</p>
              <h2><a name="ass"></a>Assertion</h2>
              <p>The simplest way of creating truth is simply to assert a <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/belief/belief.htm">belief</a> to be true, and this is regularly used even by scientists today.
                      Various means are used to strengthen the assertion.</p>
              <h3>Assignment to unquestionable source</h3>
              <p>In science, the assignment is typically to the current paradigm,
                      whether it is Newtonian Physics, Quantum Mechanics or whatever. It
                      may also be assigned to a canonized text or theorist.</p>
              <p>The religious equivalent is to assign truth to God, either as
                      written in the Bible (the Koran, etc.) or to the Priests who are
                      mouthpieces of God.</p>
              <h3>Common sense and other forms of coercion</h3>
              <p>The other common use of assertion is to state something as 'common
                      sense', with the implication that anyone who challenges the statement
                      does not have common sense and hence is too stupid to challenge it
                      anyway.</p>
              <p>Other forms of coercion includes the physicality with which a
                      statement is made (eg. loud voice, staring, etc.) and various
                      persuasive methods as found elsewhere in this website!</p>
              <h2><a name="rat"></a>Rationalism</h2>
              <p>The <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/rationalism.htm">Rationalist</a> approach is to use logic and structured argumentation to prove a
                      point. Note that as it is internal, a rational truth, although it is
                      more believable, may still be considered to be a <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/belief/belief.htm">belief</a>.</p>
              <p>Rational argument started with the Athenian Greeks and re-emerged
                      after centuries of religious assertion during <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/articles/enlightenment.htm">the
                      Age of Enlightenment</a>, most famously with <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/theorists/rene_descartes.htm">René
                      Descartes</a>.</p>
              <h3>Agreement, not coercion</h3>
              <p>To make a rational argument, all players must be allowed to make
                      assertions, but others must also be allowed to challenge them.
                      Because no external proof is needed in logic, the only conclusions of
                      an argument can be that people agree or they disagree. Truth is thus
                      still an internal construction and comes from <em>agreement </em>rather
                      than the coercive approach of <em>assertion</em>.</p>
              <h3>Conditional truths</h3>
              <p>Rational arguments often use conditional statements, of the form
                      'if A then B', and seeks to gain agreement on <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/belief/types_of_belief.htm">types
                      of belief</a>. The logic applied typically makes significant use of
                      mathematical set theory and Boolean Algebra.</p>
              <h2><a name="ver"></a>Verification</h2>
              <p>Verification (also known as Confirmation or Justification) is an
                      approach used within science for many years for proving that
                      hypotheses are true. It was used for a long time in <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/positivism.htm">Positivism</a>.</p>
              <p>Verification assumes that an assertion of A=B need only be shown
                      to be true once (or a few times) to be forever true.</p>
              <h3>Observable demonstration</h3>
              <p>Proper verification requires observable, <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/empiricism.htm">empirical</a> evidence. Rather than <em>argue </em>that something is true,
                      verification <em>shows </em>that it is true. This is based on the
                      assumption that when several people observe something, they perceive
                      the same thing and can draw similar conclusions and meanings about
                      it.</p>
              <h3>Experimental proof</h3>
              <p>The classic method of verification is to set up an experiment that
                      includes both a control and a target group, and through controlled
                      conditions showing that the target group exhibits the hypothesized
                      behavior solely because of an extra stimulus or different condition
                      that they were given that the control group were not.</p>
              <h2><a name="fal"></a>Falsification</h2>
              <p>The problem with verification, as <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/theorists/karl_popper.htm">Karl
                      Popper</a> pointed out, was that just because you can show something
                      to be true in one set of circumstances, you cannot then use induction
                      to create a general truth that is true in all circumstances.</p>
              <p>Falsification assumes that an assertion of A=B is true only if all
                      possibilities of A&lt;&gt;B are shown to be false (which is often a
                      much larger domain).</p>
              <h3>Start from anywhere</h3>
              <p>Whereas a verificationist inductive approach starts with
                      observation and then forms a theory to test elsewhere, falsification
                      allows you to start anywhere, with any theory or assertion you like.
                      The reason for this is that silly statements are easily falsified.</p>
              <h3>Testing for falsehood</h3>
              <p>The basic principle of falsification is that truth is created when
                      falsification efforts fail. The idea is thus tested with the <em>intent </em>of proving it false, thus deliberately overcoming the trap of
                      <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/confirmation_bias.htm">confirmation
                      bias</a>.</p>
              <h3>Testability</h3>
              <p>The problem so far with falsification is that you could start with
                      an assertion that Elvis has reincarnated on Venus, and because you
                      cannot prove it false you might assume that it is true. Falsification
                      thus includes the condition that reasonable tests can be done - in
                      this case traveling to Venus and searching every nook and cranny (and
                      then doing DNA tests on the glittering creatures found there).</p>

                      GEEE..... WOW... PLEASE.. DONT BE STUPID AND THINK UR DEFINITION OF
                      TRUTH AND SCIENCE.. IS THE ULTIMATE TRUTH.</strong></span></p>
              <p>There is truth that is verifiable - mathematics, chemistry,
                      physics, etc.</p>
              <p>Confucius stated that "absolute Truth is indestructible.
                      Being indestructible, it is eternal. Being eternal, it is
                      self-existent. Being self-existent, it is infinite. Being infinite,
                      it is vast and deep. Being vast and deep, it is transcendental and
                      intelligent."</p>
              <p>Plato said, "truth is the beginning of every good thing, both
                      in heaven and on earth; and he who would be blessed and happy should
                      be from the first a partaker of truth, for then he can be trusted."</p>
              <p>John Locke said, about truth, "to love truth is the principal
                      part of human perfection in this world, and the seed-plot of all
                      other virtues." <br><br>When something is said to be true, it is
                      then conformable to fact, thereby free from being false.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What is true.. MAY NOT be the truth..
                      depending on circumstances.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Truth =
                      Absolute Existence</span> (something so near to that dicionary.com
                      meaning) <span style="color: #ff0000;">SO TELL ME, did ur bible
                      DICTIONARY.COM say anything about it ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I believe the Truth is written everywhere in
                      the universe but never in human handwriting or by a manmade product
                      -- those are only capable of bits and glimpses of Truth if they are
                      lucky or someone's truth being passed off as Truth. I believe we all
                      recognize Truth when we encounter it, even though we may not be fully
                      conscious of what occurred.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">To find out if a truth really exists
                      we would need to have two concepts in mind: </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Time”
                      and “Actuality” </span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #008000;"> now what does Time mean here? to authenticate something as real you
                      would need to see exactly “When” something happened,”How” it
                      happened and “Who” witnessed it. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">The second aspect to
                      have into consideration when about to take something as real is
                      “Actuality”. facts, rather than things that people believe or
                      imagine, the state of the given event being real or really existing. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But how does
                      perception effect truth?  in order for truth to be properly
                      <img src="http://www.realact.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/WhatIsTruth_8526/truth.jpg" border="0" alt="Truth vs Fiction" width="214" height="172" align="RIGHT">defined
                      , it would need to be factually and logically stated. in other words,
                      it would need to be real. There can never be two sets of truths, when
                      one does not come into agreement with the other.</span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #008000;"> Only one can be true, not both. perhaps by digging deeper into a
                      statement or report you could conclude what is not true, truth is not
                      error and is not contradictory. truth cannot be deceptive. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If truth really exists
                      then we should be able to find it, and if it cannot be known then it
                      probably doesn’t exist, but it does exist,</span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #008000;"> for example you know that is true that you are reading this, you know
                      is true that you can see, those are two undeniable truths. it is also
                      truth that your computer display came into existence by means of a
                      creator, the monitor could not have created itself because if
                      something doesn’t exist then it cannot execute an action, ie:
                      creating itself. t</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hose
                      are logical and factual truths, they are all absolute truths.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">At this point we have concluded by
                      undeniable logic that truth exists, but can truth really exist as
                      factual all the time? does truth change over time? If we are hoping
                      to ever discover an eternal and absolute truth which is beyond our
                      cultural, religious and personal preferences, we must understand that
                      we are looking for a truth greater than ourselves, something that
                      goes above and beyond our native environment, something above our
                      cultural and individual inclinations. </span></strong></p>

                              Science had stated facts which u cannot reject. They stated 1+1=2.
                              They stated gravity. They stated water freezes at 0 degree. R u
                              gonna say these r not truth</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">What loop ?Science explaines the  How and Why .
                              Truth is there. So whats the problem ? Please.. enlighten
                              me.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As said before, any real answer to a
                              question is truth. If u asked whether I slept last night and I
                              answered an honest yes, tat answer is already the truth. So the
                              answer to how and why like why is there rain and simple knowledge
                              like water freezes at 0 degrees r real answers and thus truth. But
                              then u just deny and deny and try to avoid question etc</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="color: red;">But if u think u can accept existence of falsehood in
                              your body of truths, then I got nothing to say. It doesnt negate
                              the effect of falsehood already in there. It needs to be replaced
                              by a true theory, but even that, cant gurantee its correct. It
                              might later be found to be false again. So because of that, because
                              of the possibility of falsehood in that body of truths, I just cant
                              accept it. Because I KNOW, there are definitely falsehood. But if u
                              dont, good on you.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The loop is really u saying tat there r no
                              truth in science at all, and tat they cannot even make a simple
                              statement. I have asked before. Simple things like things r pulled
                              to the ground by gravity is a fact and truth. Simple things like
                              1+1=2 is also simple truth, or how water freezes at 0 degrees
                              Celsius etc. However u refuse to believe such simple things to be
                              truth. It don’t even have to be a complicated theory and a simple
                              basic knowledge and fact. But of course u just deny tat these
                              simple facts r even true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Well.. let me guess, even when i defined it, u TOO
                              create the loop by saying i never defined it. So why bother ? Right
                              ? Since u are ALWAYS SO RIGHT.. n PERFECT.</span><span>*clap clap*</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If u defined it, then I will stop the loop.
                              Simple right ? When I say u start a loop. It is because I have
                              answerd your points but u just avoid it. But for the definition
                              case, u cannot. If u think your statement is so full of sense, then
                              u should just give a proper definition to it. But u refused. So it
                              is obvious u really is just talking cock</span></p>
              <p><em><span>U said before tat Richard Feynman
                              had a different definition of science. U and I r not Richard
                              Feynman. Then we cannot conclude wat is his view on science r. So u
                              cannot show any other definition of science available other than
                              the dictionary. Thus science is a body of truth</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">U think its body of truths.. please.. by all means. U
                              and I are not Richard Feynman, he is the ultimate judge to that
                              truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ya lor. Then it still go
                              back to the fact tat the accepted definition of science is still
                              body of truth. U never manage to show anybody with opposing views
                              to tis</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Wat do u wanna find in the first place
                              before u start the calculation ? Surely u must have logical problem
                              or question at hand before u apply the solution right ? Otherwise u
                              r really just talking cock</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">OH SO NOW
                              THEY ARE FALLACIES... and i made WRONG interpretation of it. BRAVO
                              !! BRAVO !!!</span> <span><span style="color: red;">Please... enlighten me on my supposedly WRONG
                              interpretation to it. SHOW ME.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U mean on the definition of fallacy ? U can
                              check the dictionary which states tat fallacy: <span> </span></span><span>a misleading or unsound
                              argument</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Oh.. so
                              now they are 2 different things... hahaha...  i thought u said
                              0/0 can be ANYTHING. Please, check urself, or this one will really
                              bite u in the ass REAL BAD.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">A fallacy
                              IS fallacy. U can pull ur ass out n say 0/0 on inside is ANYTHING,
                              0/0 on one side can be another ANYTHING, in the end of the day,
                              THAT fallacy if i simplify it simply, i can prove 1 = 2.  But
                              i guess again, U R RIGHT.. I AM TOTALLY WRONG in my
                              algebra.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Another logic flaw of
                              yours</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It could be
                              anything</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So u claimed it could be
                              variable</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However it don’t have to be
                              a variable. It can be anything</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4)</span><span>     </span></span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So your argument is still
                              wrong because it could be anything other than a variable and thus
                              my equation is not wrong</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So again u made another fallacy and
                              mis-interprete by providing unsound arguments.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">lol... u
                              sure ? U better be sure with ur above statement corresponds with X
                              on one sides can equal one thing, and X on the other side can be
                              another in the same equation.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yes I am sure. And U r still
                              treating 0/0 as a defined variable and u r just too stupid to
                              realize tat.</span></span></p>

                              someone who supposedly doesnt understand my "english" and "bad

                              usual, u will dismiss it, like theories, truths and
                              science.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Well so u admit u plagarise
                              right ? And u cannot come out with your arguments isn’t it
                              ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">My view
                              is stated  pages n pages before. Its very obvios its cut n

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then why not have the
                              courtesy to quote where u take it from ? I guess u did state your
                              view long long ago. Science is never about the truth right ? Even
                              your article do not support tat fact</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">WOW.. so
                              your logic is superior ? So IF MAN makes mistakes, Einstein is a

                              that Einstein makes mistakes ? Do u ? Are u going to cut off ur

                              But u r just using fallacy to hide your flawed logic</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So u made a stereotype. U
                              said Einstein make mistake, which I agree. But I do not agree tat
                              his theories which r well established and accepted r mistakes. But
                              to u, it is because he made mistakes before. Again shows your
                              stereotype</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">U still have not shown me

                              from.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">So.. I
                              NEED to follow a school of thought ? I cant have my OWN brain to
                              decide on which are the ones i should adopt and which are the ones
                              i dont ?  U know, dictionary.com , u can treat it as ur bible
                              . I , choose to absorb all information and disseminate it myself
                              and come up with my own conclusion.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Truth is
                              Truth = Actual Existence. But again u just too
                              stupid</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">True =
                              True</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Whats so
                              hard ? I already stated, clearly, with examples, fitting my
                              description of what is true may not be the truth. U understood, but
                              u just want to apply UR definition of TRUTH into my belief. So u
                              ARE stupid. U know it cant work, but u keep insiting it.</span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The very basic thing to do
                              is simply define it properly, which is something u refuse. If u say
                              u come from your own school of thought, then surely u must tell wat
                              it is about right ? And I did not treat the dictionary as a bible.
                              I treat it as dictionary. The standard way of using English
                              vocabulary and words.</span></span></p>

                              specific. What if i am down to the detail.  It gets me get the
                              job done. It gets me to identify affidavits and testimonies that
                              are no exact, to find flaws and intentions. I expect my oil tanker
                              to come with 27300 litres. But because they said 27300 litres 
                              with a variance of +- 0.05%, i accept. But just dont tell me its
                              100% 27300 litres of AGO product.</span></span></p>

                              on the crate. Now u state tat we shouldn’t answer so definitively
                              when u force people to give a definitive answer ? Isn't it your
                              answer tat u will NOT call a crate with good apples as good
                              apples. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I gave the answer of unsure then. To u, U
                              gave the answer tat is must never be called a crate of good apples.
                              U sure really use a lot of fallacies</span></p>

                              Explaination was given to clear any misunderstandings. But like i
                              said, U DONT WANT MY UNDERSTANDING, U WANT MY

                              u said u made ? The only one I see is tat u say u type "truth" as
                              "true" a long time ago. After that where else ? Now u said I want
                              your compliance, which is really wrong. I want your understanding.
                              But wat do u say ? U cannot define the word "science", u cannot
                              define "truth" properly then u made a vague encompassing point
                              tat science is never about truth and called other people
                              stupid ! U say the dictinary is wrong, people who follow

                          simple. Someone to be able to come up with thus thinking, does not
                          contradict with my thinking. Just because minority has a little bit

                          wrong.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Frankly speaking, wat the
                          hell r u trying to say here ? Someone to be able to come up with
                          “thus” thinking and does not contradict with your thinking ? Wat r
                          u really thinking ? U put the article, but wat is the message and
                          relevance to you ? It the article, it never states tat science is
                          NEVER about the truth. So wat is your point ? And it doesn’t
                          support your stupid logical flaw of “true” = “true” bla bla bla.
                          Did u read the conclusion of your article</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em>It would seem that

                          read the answers of others there are <strong><span style="color: red;">mis-understandings</span></strong>. <strong>Most certainly truth in science is not decided by majority

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">They specifically used the word

                          mistake, <strong>which I agree</strong>. But I do not
                          agree <strong>tat his theories which r well established
                          and accepted r mistakes</strong>. But to u, it is because he made

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So wat is wrong with the
                          above ? Go back and read carefully before u make a fool of
                          yourself. U should really cut off your left nut
                          instead</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">U know
                          anything about Thermodynamics ? When we were in primary and
                          secondary schools, what did the teachers teach us. Compare it to
                          what UNI taught us. First thing the lecturer said was "WHAT U KNOW
                          ABOUT THERMODYNAMICS.. IS WRONG.. THIS IS THE REAL

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><em><span>During the last 80 years writers have suggested additional laws,
                          but none of them have become well
                          accepted</span></em></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now u tell me “transitional
                          state theory”. Tis basically deals with chemistry. They r totally
                          different things altogether. U really have a bad foundation in
                          science</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red;">Another distortion of the the word TRUE is when truth
                          or falsity doesn't apply to a statement. For instance, another ABer
                          used the example: "'that movie sucked' can be true for you, but not
                          for the next person." This is not something can be evaluated in
                          terms of its truth or falisty. It cannot be true that a movie
                          sucked. It can be true that a movie sucked according to certain
                          criteria, or it can be true that you believe the movie sucked, but
                          whether or not the movie really sucked cannot be spoken of in terms
                          of truth.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then apply the written
                          theory to scientific facts such as gravity and water freezes at 0
                          degrees. The above is really talking about subjective opinions such
                          as movies r good r not however we r talking about science and
                          facts. If a scientific observation is true, can it not be the truth
                          ? If it is not the truth, can it even be true ?</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: red;">I believe the

                          bits and glimpses of Truth if they are lucky or someone's truth
                          being passed off as Truth. I believe we all recognize Truth when we

                          occurred.</span></span></p>

              but are still useful in particular domains or under certain conditions.
              For some theories a more complete model is known, but in practical use
              the coarser approximation provides good results with much less
