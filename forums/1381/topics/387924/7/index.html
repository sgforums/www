              <p>They are not searching for truth. Its already the truth. Its finding out WHY its the truth. Thats all.</p>
              <p>And i am not ignoring , because it will just drag this on to a more complicated matter. Because if u cant understand such a simple concept, there is no point in going any further with ur explainations. I could search for the understanding. Not falsehood. The truth is there, you dont need to prove it. Like blackhole. Its the truth, now, to find out WHY , HOW ! jeezez..</p>
              <p>U are the one playing with words and phrases. Mr Sean made it so simple. Do u agree in what he is saying. Yes or No. Thats what i am trying to put forth MY understanding of what it means.</p>
              <p>Let me ask u simple. Question: Gravity exists and is the truth before man even discover it , whether science can even quantify it or not YES ? NO ?</p>
              <p>I just believe simple that science is search for the answers of unraveling the mysteries of the universe! On the way , they find the truth.. HOORAY. DO u understand ?</p>
              <p>Once again, i have no problem understanding ur concept of science. But you.. on the other hand, do no understand mine.  Mr Sean gets it. He understand what my point of view is. Thats all. The possiblity to contemplate on. I am not saying i am absolutely correct, and its the truth. NO.</p>
              <p>*Another facet is scientist wonder why things fall to the ground.

                                      why things fall to the ground and tat is the truth.* WELL DONE ! You understand !</p>
              <p>But THE SUN rises from the East and sets in the West..yes .. Truth. All they had to figure out was WHY.. they didnt find out WOW! Sun Rises East.. and sets West! Its already there ! Even if it existed before science ! That.. is the search.. FOR THE ANSWERS to the TRUTH.</p>
              <p>Yes, by all definitions, all this information we have, i say, its likely, but my mind, is still in the possibility that its not the truth! Its a very good theory ! Solid evidence, logical explaination, i am quite inclined to side with it. But i think out of the square. I like to believe that there is still possibilities. New information, new theories. I dont go.. OH !! THIS HAS TO BE THE TRUTH ! I am no smart enough.. not omnipotent! Not GOD! I am just a simple man.. trying to grasp, the mysteries of life and the universe and creation.</p>
              <p>And i understand that in this world.. ANYTHING is possible, there is nothing that is impossible. I do not limit myself. My imaginations. Perhaps  u like to stay safe, in ur environment,fair enough. Personally, i like to believe in limitless possibilities.</p>

              <p>after al tis talk, again u avoid the question. Do u take
                                                  evolution as likely to be the truth ? Thinking out of the square is
                                                  good if u r brainstorming for creativity. However if u need to
                                                  perform certain engineering stuff, u have to follow the established
                                                  scientific foundations. &lt;----------- I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION.</p>
              <p>HERE ----&gt; Yes, by all definitions, all this information we have, i say,
                                                  its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">likely,</span> but my mind,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> is still in the possibility that its not
                                                  the truth! Its a very good theory ! Solid evidence, logical
                                                  explaination, i am quite inclined to side with it. </span>But i think out
                                                  of the square. I like to believe that there is still possibilities.
                                                  New information, new theories. I dont go.. OH !! THIS HAS TO BE THE
                                                  TRUTH ! I am no smart enough.. not omnipotent! Not GOD! I am just a

                                                  universe and creation.</p>
              <p>Once agian u misunderstand me. When i am thinking out of the square, i do no think within. I question, i think of the possibilities. To IMPROVE.. TO FURTHER OURSELVES . Thats how science progresses . No ? Like engineering. If it doesnt work, try the other ! U still have to think out of the square. Are u playing dumb ? But in the end of the day, how some people can get my point pretty quickly, i think u are just stupid. Even i dont know what u are talking about sometimes. Do u even udnerstand ? Are u making asssssumptions ? IF not sure.. PLEASE ASK. Evidently, you dont understand.</p>
              <p>So its safe to say, either u are stupid, or u are running out of arguments. If u read carefully, you will know what i am saying. I really dont know, u tell me.  I assume u must be playing stupid, but it is a possibility. A dumbo.. an idiot. But i am a man of possibilities, maybe u can give me an explaination to ur reasons of not understanding. I am open minded. I am willing to listen. I am open to all possibilities, that might explain, ur inadequacies.</p>

              <p>First of all, i will not spread out the lines and respond the way you do. You will realise my reason as you read this post. Because you will try to deviate and nit pick when the answers are there, as i can see you are running out of arguments and now you are attacking me regarding Nouns... grammar... *clap clap*</p>
              <p>Mr Sean has understood my posts and why cant you? It is very simple. Why would u think i dont understand Sean ? Why would i need to ask him again when he understood me? There is no need. And there no Mr Seah, i know a Mr Sean, and yes, he understood me, but i am not sure about ur Mr Seah. And i am not out of point. We are still taking about science.</p>
              <p>And my english is lacking ? Actuality ? Yes, you are human and you are actual existence and you are truth. The table is truth.  See u seem to get it. Nouns have nothing to do with the truth. I am not talking about nouns or vocabs now. I am just talking about the concept of truth. If u with to talk about grammar and vocab, i do not entertain... and plainly, just dont give a shit.</p>
              <p>You say about idiot, No.. once again, u are wrong. My existence is a truth, but being an idiot, is a theory.  A postulation. Conjecture.  So... once again, i hope u get the point i am trying to get to you.</p>
              <p>And yes, i phrase that its likely to be the truth even though it is true. Because like i said, with supporting evidence, the reasoning, and all that good stuff of that is science, makes me inclined to side with it, but its possible still, to not be the truth. Did not Mr Sean simplify it ? Please, refer and understand. Because if he understood, there is no problem with my english. Maybe there is a problem with YOUR english.</p>
              <p>And since when did i say i did not believe in Science ? Are u AGAIN... putting words in my mouth when i stated post after post, regurgitating my belief in science. Is it not obvious that i believe in science for it to explain the truth like gravity?</p>
              <p>Finally, my definition of truth is not english ? I am but a layman, i may not hold a PHD in English, but i have no problem communicating it with someone esle. Regarding how shitty my english is, a normal person can get it, and it should suffice. Maybe u have a PHD in English, perhaps you go over to DICTIONARY.COM and correct them of thier mistake, stating your reasons. I am sure, with ur superior intellect, you will be able to convince them.</p>
              <p>I must make it clear, that u should not be putting words in my mouth, its previous clear where i stand, but if u are not sure, please refer to Mr Sean's simple post, as that is the GIST of it. If he can, so can you. And, dont say i dont understand, i said WELL DONE ! *BRAVO* , he got it. </p>
              <p> And regarding mistakes, you seem to be making the mistakes,if u read ur reply, u will notice that, i never said there is a chance to be true, i said, there is a chance to be the truth regarding the evolution theory. Once again, you are just blind. And stupid. And saying i am the one, that is stubborn and ignorant, when clearly, i understood u perfectly, but u somehow, not one just misunderstood me, u twist the very statements.</p>
              <p>So, there is no point for me to regurgitate. Please go through my posts, and refer to Mr Sean if u have any misunderstanding. Perhaps, u may understand one day. But just not today. There is only so much, a man can teach a monkey.</p>

              <p>The word TRUTHderives from the word TRUE, but in actual fact, they are two different words two different meaning. If they are both the same, why two different words ?You just dont get it. Reservist and you obviosly have a problem with English.</p>
              <p>Once again, u limit yourself. Truth and true has a few different meanings and represent different meanings. Whether they have nouns or adjectives is another thing.</p>
              <p>Are u just too stupid to understand ? Why must i comply to YOUR one meaning of the truth and true, when there is obviously, other meanings used in different context.</p>
              <p>Once again.. u are stupid.</p>

              <p>And another supporting my theory of your idiocy, is Mr Sean exists. Mr Seah however, i do not know. If u cant even differentiate N and H , the most basic foundation of English, then all your posturing about nouns, verbs, adjectives, are pointless.</p>
              <p>I guess its another evidence to back up my theory of your stupidity.</p>

              <p>Here are men of science and intellectuals who have problem defining Truth. And here you are, trying to limit Truth to a noun... a word. U must have limited  capactiy to digest new information, maybe thats why u will never be a renowned intellectual and a great scientist, because u do not think beyond the norm.</p>
              <p>U think it as a word...</p>
              <p>That is ur failure.</p>
              <p>I already said i understood YOUR version and your understanding of the truth in ur context. What are u trying to say ? Are you just too stupid and ignorant ? How can i be ignorant when i am the one here that understands your truth but u are unable to understand mine ?</p>
              <p>Thats why again i said i understand YOUR truth. All i ask is u understand mine. Thats all. Is it so hard ? And u say i am ignorant and stubborn ? </p>

Mr Seah never say tat simple statement like 1+1=2 is not the truth. He never says tat blackhole or other nouns can be simply reworded as truth. He never say tat scientist cannot find truth.

              <p>Those are just examples on the gravity, 1+1 = 2 all that stuff are just examples. If Mr Sean gets it, good for him. You , reservist, deadstroke, whoever that dont get it, u guys are just stupid. There is nothing more i can say. I am serious. Really.. because, u are just playing with my examples. What i sateted is very clear.</p>
              <p>What riddles ? It is a truth that there are stupid people. Yes  No ? Who are they, i dont know. The evidence suggest that u are one of the stupid people. So, I assume u could be one of them. Very likey true, but may not be the truth. U see now ? Am i talking in riddles ?</p>
              <p>Yes, for ur nouns and adjectives with sex and sexy , dark and darkness. Sure, i got nothing against that. So.. whats the problem ? See, once again you are having problems thinking beyond the word. We have philosophers and scholars, trying to theorerize what is truth is. And all u can say is that its a word. Do u know how limited your imagination is ? Please once again refer to WIKI ARTICLE - TRUTH and see what it means, and hopefully u will be able to understand.</p>
              <p>What do u mean that article is not relevant ?  It is very relevant. Because it shows that, truth can have alot of meanings. We have theories hypothesizing the meaning of truth.</p>
              <p>Refer to the article, 1 + 1 = 2 is a mathematical truth. I got no problem with that.AGAIN. Are u stuipid ? Please refer to posts.  1Ovum + 1Sperm = 1 Fertilised Egg. yes no ? That is reality but does not conform to mathematical truth. Correct ? Can your mind handle this ?</p>
              <p>What Theologians are looking for is the TRUTH regarding the existence of God, they work in a different discipline than science. While science is based on logical deductions of the physical world, theologians on the other hand, deal mainly with the matter of the faith. Well, at times,science and theology do intersect, but they are still very different discipline. There are two totally different thing. Like total cure from sickness and there are no scientific explaination to it.  They have been documented evidence. So its still on going. THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT DISCIPLINE.</p>
              <p>Yes, sometimes science is able to support certain beliefs in theology and sometimes it doesnt. Thats how it is. Science doesnt discriminate. Its what it is, on whatever information they can garner.</p>
