              <p>Aiyah.. u r just repeating the same rubbish. Didn't u say u use
              truth as "actual existence" throughout ? U say u use it
              consistently and tat is wat u understand from it.</p>
              <p>So now wat ? U did not use it consistently ? Then wat do u
              understand from it ? U say science cannot seek truth, theologist
              can, and both try to discover existence of something and one is
              seeking truth while the other is not. Wat type of truth r u talking
              about then ? U read your article, copy the version of truth u said
              before and stick it here.</p>
              <p>Then I will see if it can follows "actual existence", science is
              never about "truth", they only seek WHy and HOW and these r not
              "truth" while theology seek "truth" as coherent or not.</p>

              <p>Yes, to me, its Actual Existence in the definition of Truth being defined by the domain of science while finding out the Why and How. Because the Truth, like Gravity, is in Actual Reality.</p>
              <p>Once again, the TRUTH theologians seek, is the Existence of GOD, becuase to them, God IS THE TRUTH. They are merely finding supporting evidence OF IT. Cant u understand ?</p>
              <p>Science like i said again, seeks to unravel the mysteries of the universe. You cant comprehend. The Universe in Actual Existence IS THERE. Now, is to seek the How and WHY of its Existence. Do u get it ?</p>

              <p>Again you are limited. I said again, you believe that , its your opinion. Do u not think i do not know the dictionary meaning of Scienec ? All i am saying is in regards to Science being Truth.  My understanding of the word Truth is different, hence, in your context of the dictionary explaination of the word Science, it does not conform with your definition of science. Simple.</p>

              <p>Dont blame me if you cannot think out of the box , to think beyond, to comprehend my belief and understanding of the word Truth and the domain of Science.</p>
              <p>Its not my fault if you are too stupid to understand.</p>
              <p> Thats why i tried to explain. Hopefully u can see it in my context after all the tedious explainations and statements i made. But you are stuck... in the word itself, i have tried to show u the possibilities of it, u understood, but u revert back to the closed mind argument again.</p>
              <p>So there is not much i can do.</p>

              <p>Hence, let us end here, by agreeing in our disagreement. Think all you want, that i am not talking English, my examples are shitty , i am not making sense and that you are the truth and i am full of holes , fallible and non-sensicle. It is unfortunate that i could understand your norm, thinking within the box, but u were unable to understand mine, thinking beyond the box.</p>
              <p>So i shall cute n paste my my reasons for my beliefs here to end it.</p>
              <p><strong>You once again, limit yourself. I BELIEVE in those philosophers
                                      and intellectuals that think BEYOND, they think DIFFERENT. They
                                      ASK. The whole idea is to KEEP ASKING. To make sure you are RIGHT.
                                      Which so far i have proven in my statements and opinions to be
                                      true. Whatever dictionary put there. fair enoug, I,  like the
                                      Intellectuals and Philosophers DO NOT BELIEVE that the word TRUTH
                                      is so easy to define. Thats it. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>You can believe what u wish, if u believe in what people feed
                                      you, what dictionary tells you, what the government feeds you. So
                                      be it</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I , persoanlly,
                                      believe I have a brain,</span> i would want to see what other
                                      theories are there, what opinions are out there, and all that
                                      stuff, then i would decide where i want to stand, which has the
                                      best argument and which i believe is the most persuasive to me. I
                                      am not  just a SHEEP. I am an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enlightened Sheep.</span></strong> And
                                      frankly, yours is just not compelling and persuasive enough for
                                      me. I have understood yours yonks ago. The logical reasoning behind it.</p>
              <p>I do not follow blindly, i wonder about the world. If you believe the dictionary definition is the truth to all truths because of the word and your superior mastery in the English language. So be it. I accept your opinion. But i however will not comply to your understanding.I understand, but i will not comply.</p>
              <p>Hope this is as simple as it gets.</p>
              <p>I shall go take my lunch, and see if u have any replies. As i get paid sitting on ass sgforuming, i have plenty of time to get back to you if u decide to continue on with this whole misunderstanding.</p>

                                      theorarize and definition of truth. And u can only see it as a word
                                      from the dictionary of true = truth. Which is NOT WRONG, just shows

              <p>I told you already, i made my stand on the truth. Cant u understand that the Wiki - Truth is just an exmaple ? What about the issue of Absolute Truth in the examples given ? They are all EXAMPLES. U get it ? EXAMPLES to show u that your definition of the truth is one of such basic and limited one. There are so many truths out there with different theories and definition.</p>
              <p>I have been consistent with my meaning, Since when does Science equate to Theology. 2 different kind of fish.. 2 different kinds of price.</p>
              <p>The zero, is very simple. In non-mathematicl truth, 0 which is NOTHING divides by 0 NOTHING logically = Nothing. But MATHS cant say its 0. Why ? Its does not conform to the mathematical truth u stated that how 1 +1 = 2.</p>
              <p>You are the one that keeps saying my truth is wrong. I accepted your statement and opinion of the truth, u just continue to nit pick irrelevant points. Even my pet turtle has more brain then you.</p>
              <p>What i am saying is, Truth is Actual Existence. Right now, i think out side the box, if there is another explaination, or i find someone with other that is better then mine. Fair enough. I said i am open minded. ALL this time i am showing examples. YOU are the one trying to limit it, and i have no porblem with your limitation. You the one keep saying 'NO NO NO NO.. its THIS.. its THAT... NOT THAT' I told , i accept and understand yours, but u cant comprehend mine. So after how i explained so much, ur brain stil cant think outside, and beyond. I can only come down with the conclusion that u are stupid! Seriously.</p>
              <p>U are the only person for that cant get it. Because of your limitation. I  admit, I did not even talk about this to alot of people, only with some physicist , engineers and philosophy majors, but they all understood. They dont seem to have ANY problem  in understanding.</p>
              <p>U CHALLENEGE ME to state WHAT IS MY TRUTH ? I EXPLAINED IT ALREADY... PLEASE, REFER TO POST. If u cant figure out, u are really stupid. Simple. The summary there, pretty much sums it all up. The basic idea of how Mr Sean says about what is proven right now, maybe wrong in the future, in regards to Science. Regarding the TRUTH, read urself. I am tired of spoon feeding u. Even if i explain, u may not be able to figure it out. So do it urself.</p>
              <p>Once again, u misunderstand. AGAIN.. i have said.. AGAIN n AGAIN, Theologians, seek the TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD. They dont look for TRUTHS. Thier TRUTH is already GOD to the Theologians.(God .. whatever they regard as the Truth)</p>
              <p>There is NO NEED for me to copy n paste.</p>
              <p>The latest summary pretty much sums it all up, clearly, concisely. Its for u to digest. Its right there.</p>
              <p>Sure, go ahead, u ARE stupid. I have not said anyone stupid but you. Even when i said, IF they cant understand, they are stupid too. But you are the only one, who just cant get it, and continue to challenge , and i reply the same thing over n over again. N u cant get it. U cant even understand. So, i have to come to the conclusion, that u ARE stubborn, dense and stupid. There is no other explaination. Because i am sure as hell am not stubborn , dense and stupid, when i clearly understood your simple meaning of your truth, your context of science and how u bring forth your points.</p>
              <p>Since u are not someone who is bullied or silced away by such words, then continue to prove ur stupidity by asking the same questions and not even able to comprehend a single thing.</p>

              <p>Let me put down how u use truth so far then</p>
              <p>1) U say truth = actuality, and actuality in dictionary = the state of being actual reality, is ok. Then when I show u the dictionary defintion of science, which is stated as a branch of knowledge dealing with a body of facts/truths, u say the dictionary is limited. U believe the dicitionary for one word and do not believe in another. Wat a double standard u have</p>
              <p>2) U said u think out of the box,and said "<strong>Whatever dictionary put there. fair enoug,
                                          I,  like the Intellectuals and Philosophers DO NOT BELIEVE
                                          that the word TRUTH is so easy to define. Thats it."</strong></p>
              <p>But then u keep saying u define the word consistently as "actuality" ? So is it easy to define or not easy to define ?</p>
              <p>3) U say theologist is the only one who can find the truth. It is because they try to find god existence. I said scientist also find gravity existence too. <strong>U say is because they r different field so is okie.</strong> DO u think u can convince any matured person with tat line of thinking and double standards ? <strong>So is reality different for both cases ?</strong> Your definition says "actual reality". Elaborate why it is different for the theologist and scientist then</p>
              <p>4) U say truth = actuality=actual reality. Then u say scientist only find
              the why and how, which r the actual reality, u say they r not truth. To
              u, finding out why there is rain, or wind, or gravity give same
              acceleration to different mass is all not the truth (truth = actual
              reality from your definition) SO u r living in your delusional world
              where all reality is not truth ?</p>
              <p>5) Then u try to say tat mathematics truth is not truth as well. U said 1+1=2 is not the truth and u came out with examples of eggs and sperms and apples and oranges. U claim 1 apple + 1 orange not equal to 2 apples. Isn't tat obvious ? U use the equation wrongly. Then u say sperm + egg = 1 fertilised egg. Then again aren't u using the equation wrongly again ? R we talking about chemistry equation here ? We r talking about maths and u talk about putting garbages into the right equation to proclaim the equation wrong. Tat is nonsene</p>
              <p>6) Not daunted, u again come out with another nonsense.</p>
              <p><strong>0 which is
                                          NOTHING divides by 0 NOTHING logically = Nothing. But MATHS cant
                                          say its 0. Why</strong> ?</p>
              <p>BECASUE IT IS NOT ZERO ! Dividing anything by zero is infinity. So the real answer is, it could be anything depending on wat your subject is. Wat do u understand by dividing zero ? How do u physically describe it ? From logic, there is nothing wrong with tis statement.</p>
              <p>7) U said "Theologians, seek the TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD. <strong>They
                                          dont look for TRUTHS. </strong>Thier TRUTH is already GOD to the
                                          Theologians"</p>
              <p>Lets see your earliest statement</p>
              <p>Science is not there to PROVE, it is to find out WHY, to
                                          EXPLAIN. <strong>They are not to discern what is true and false. Its not
                                          even thier doman.  It is the Theologists</strong>.</p>
              <p>Now u said theologist don't look for truth (actual reality), but the theologists' domain is to discern wat is true or false ? Wat r u trying to say ? Contradict yourself again ?</p>
              <p>8) "Theologians, seek the TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD. They
                                          dont look for TRUTHS.<strong> </strong>Thier TRUTH is already GOD to the
                                          Theologians"</p>
              <p>Actually tis statement is funny. Your first statement say they seek the truth (of the existence of god). Then u say they don't look for truth. Then lastly u say the truth (which they r not looking for) is god (very important?) to the theologians. So r they looking for truth or not ? Is the truth important to them ?</p>

                              <strong>Theologians </strong>have a narrow field, they only <strong>need to find evidence of
                              God's EXISTENCE, they do NOT try to answer WHY, or HOW</strong>. <strong>THEY DO NOT ASK
                              THAT</strong>.</p>
              <p>Where science , knows the TRUTH of GRAVITY, but HOW IT WORKS. Do u understand ?</p>
              <p>Remember,
                          <strong> THESE ARE MY BELIEFS. IF U DISAGREE, I HAVE NO PROBLEM</strong>. All i am
                              saying, is, each of us have a different belief or what each discipline
                              does. <strong>U disagree, i disagree thats it. Simple. Move on.</strong></p>
              <p>4) U say truth = actuality=actual reality. Then u say scientist
                              only find the why and how, which r the actual reality, u say they r
                              not truth. To u, finding out why there is rain, or wind, or gravity
                              give same acceleration to different mass is all not the truth
                              (truth = actual reality from your definition) SO u r living in your
                              delusional world where all reality is not truth ?</p>
              <p>-<strong>NO </strong>, ONCE AGAIN, U MISUNDERSTAND ME. Now, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>READ CAREFULLY.</strong></span> GRAVITY = Actualy Reality ( Existed Before Science)</p>
              <p>-<strong>Science
                              = WHY</strong>(Does the phenomenon of gravity exist?)  And then, <strong>they find out
                              the HOW</strong>, and from there , they call this phenomenon<strong> =</strong> <strong>GRAVITY</strong>.</p>
              <p>-<strong>Gravity
                              is the ABSOLUTE REALITY</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The acceleration is the EFFECT</strong></span> of <strong>Gravity</strong>.
                          <strong> Rain </strong>IS and <strong>ABSOLUTE REALITY</strong>, <strong>Science does not PROVE RAIN EXISTS,</strong> we
                              can see it.. we know it exists, even if Science does not prove it, <strong>we
                              KNOW it exists, because we can see it</strong>. All science did was explain HOW
                              and WHY it comes down from the sky, and therefore condensation....yada
                              yada...etc etc comes in.</p>
              <p>5) Then u try to say tat mathematics truth is not truth as well.
                              U said 1+1=2 is not the truth and u came out with examples of eggs
                              and sperms and apples and oranges. U claim 1 apple + 1 orange not
                              equal to 2 apples. Isn't tat obvious ? U use the equation wrongly.
                              Then u say sperm + egg = 1 fertilised egg. Then again aren't u
                              using the equation wrongly again ? R we talking about chemistry
                              equation here ? We r talking about maths and u talk about putting
                              garbages into the right equation to proclaim the equation wrong.
                              Tat is nonsene</p>
              <p>-<strong>O&gt;K.. U GETTING MY POINT HERE.  </strong>Once again, <strong>THIS </strong>supports the fact that, i said, 1+1 DOESNT ALWAYS = 2 .<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I DID NOT SAY 1+1 DOESNT EQUAL = 2</strong></span> . All i said is 1+1  ONLY EQUALS = 2 <strong>SOMETIMES, AND SOMETIMES, it is SOMETHING ELSE. IT depends on situations and cirucumstances</strong>. <strong>Hence i said 1+1 = 2 is TRUE but NOT THE TRUTH.</strong> GET IT ? Because if ITS THE TRUTH, 1+1 WILL ALWAYS = 2 , which isnt
                              TRUE all the time. Like I already said, depends on cirucumstances !Which u have also proven.</p>
              <p>6) Not daunted, u again come out with another nonsense.</p>
              <p><strong>0 which is NOTHING divides by 0 NOTHING logically =
                              Nothing. But MATHS cant say its 0. Why</strong> ?</p>
              <p>BECASUE IT IS NOT ZERO ! Dividing anything by zero is infinity.
                              So the real answer is, it could be anything depending on wat your
                              subject is. Wat do u understand by dividing zero ? How do u
                              physically describe it ? From logic, there is nothing wrong with
                              tis statement.</p>
              <p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WRONG</strong> </span>. ANY NUMBER OTHER ELSE then 0 = <strong>INFINITY</strong>. Where else 0/0 IS <strong>UNDEFINED</strong>(Which basically means it can be NOTHING). ( N this 0/0 is not the 0/0 =0 example i used previously)*Omitted*</p>
              <p>This
                              example is to <strong>SHOW U</strong>, that Math's itself is <strong>NOT PERFECT. Its NOT
                              INFALLIBLE</strong>. Too many rules and laws that cant solve the problem of 0/0
                              . There is another <strong>rule </strong>saying, <strong>A<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NY NUMBER DIVIDED BY THE SAME NUMBER = 1</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ,<strong> SO Applying that rule, WOULDNT 0/0 = 1 ?</strong> <strong>SEE.. ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.</strong></span></p>
              <p>7) U said "Theologians, seek the TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD.
                              <strong>They dont look for TRUTHS.</strong> Thier TRUTH is already
                              GOD to the Theologians"</p>
              <p>Lets see your earliest statement</p>
              <p>Science is not there to PROVE, it is to find out WHY, to
                              EXPLAIN. <strong>They are not to discern what is true and false.
                              Its not even thier doman.  It is the Theologists</strong>.</p>
              <p>Now u said theologist don't look for truth (actual reality), but
                              the theologists' domain is to discern wat is true or false ? Wat r
                              u trying to say ? Contradict yourself again ?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>-AGAIN, I TOLD U I DID NOT MEAN IT THAT WAY. I OMITTED IT, and ALL SUBSEQUENT POSTS DO NOT REFLECT THAT STATEMENT.</strong></span> U see, AGAIN,  keep bringing up my ommitted statement. Why no the
                              subsequent statement that explaiend MORE CLEARLY. I ARLEADY TOLD YOU
                              ITS WRONG. ITs MY MISTAKE.</p>
              <p>8) "Theologians, seek the TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD. They
                              dont look for TRUTHS. Thier TRUTH is already GOD to the
                              Theologians"</p>
              <p>Actually tis statement is funny. Your first statement say they
                              seek the truth (of the existence of god). Then u say they don't
                              look for truth. Then lastly u say the truth (which they r not
                              looking for) is god (very important?) to the theologians. So r they
                              looking for truth or not ? Is the truth important to them ?</p>
              <p>- WHAT I MEANT WAS THIS. MAYBE i used TRUTH SO MUCH It became blurring. <strong>What i am saying is, to SEEK THE TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD.</strong> <strong>They DO NOT LOOK FOR <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE TRUTH of GOD</span></strong></p>

              <p>1) The dictionary just used the word "truth" in its explanation "a branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or<strong> truths</strong> systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws".</p>
              <p>If u accept the meaning from the dictionary, then u won't argue around how to define tis word or tat word etc. I am pretty sure the organisation writing the dictionary knows more than u</p>

              <p>2) SO wat is your meaning of truth then ? I spent one whole reply asking u to define your truth and all I get is "actual existence" from u. SO now u said it is not really actual existence (it is just close) ? Is it or is it not ? If it is not, then u better specify it clearly and make sure it is consistent with all your other usage of the word. If it is, then wat is the point of tis message ?</p>

              <p>4) I asked u whether is the word "truth" easy to define or not and u come out with a whole load of... I don't know... irrelevent answer. Is truth easy to define, Yes or no ? A simple statement. Your answer suggest it is not easy to define. However u keep using the word "actual existence" consistently and said it is your truth for many pages of reply. Then now u say it is not easy to define after all. Then why didn't u state your stand clearly ? I have challenged u repeatedly to paste your version of truth but u refused and give a two words answer " actual existence". Those philosophers etc made their stand and categorised their truth (most used science and math). Can u make a stand ?</p>

              <p>c) u said scientist have a wider area of search than theologist (but they r still search for existence of something new, and to u tat is something "truth")</p>
              <p>d)u said " <em>Where science , knows the TRUTH of GRAVITY, but HOW IT WORKS. Do

              <p>but however is not discovered at the start of human civilisation. Since u said gravity is truth, then the person who discovered it, a scientist, has found a truth isn't it ? Why will scientist not be finding truth to u then ?</p>

              <p>U really need to brush up your idea of maths. 0/0 can means anything. As said before, wat do u understand by the idea of dividing things by 0 ? There is no physical meaning to it. And your question on dividing the same number by itself is a 1, but again u r dealing with zero here and dividing by zero is itself physically meaningless. It depend on subject matter then. The dividing by zero often means very close to zero, not absolute zero. If u means absolute zero, then dividing by it has zero meaning</p>

              <p>1) The dictionary just used the word "truth" in its explanation

                  <strong>truths</strong> systematically arranged and showing the

              <p>If u accept the meaning from the dictionary, then u won't argue
                  around how to define tis word or tat word etc. I am pretty sure the

              <p> </p>
              <p>2) SO wat is your meaning of truth then ? I spent one whole
                  reply asking u to define your truth and all I get is "actual
                  existence" from u. SO now u said it is not really actual existence
                  (it is just close) ? Is it or is it not ? If it is not, then u
                  better specify it clearly and make sure it is consistent with all
                  your other usage of the word. If it is, then wat is the point of
                  tis message ?</p>
              <p>3) Since u said tat "truth=actual existence", and tat scientist
                  answers questions on the nature world like how rain, wind comes
                  about etc. Where did these "how and why" contradict the idea of
                  "actual existence" ?</p>
              <p>4) I asked u whether is the word "truth" easy to define or not
                  and u come out with a whole load of... I don't know... irrelevent
                  answer. Is truth easy to define, Yes or no ? A simple statement.
                  Your answer suggest it is not easy to define. However u keep using
                  the word "actual existence" consistently and said it is your truth
                  for many pages of reply. Then now u say it is not easy to define
                  after all. Then why didn't u state your stand clearly ? I have
                  challenged u repeatedly to paste your version of truth but u
                  refused and give a two words answer " actual existence". Those
                  philosophers etc made their stand and categorised their truth (most
                  used science and math). Can u make a stand ?</p>
              <p>5) If u really read your article, the basic idea is still "the
                  true or actual state of a matter". If u think I am wrong, then read
                  your article and find an application where it deviates from the
                  above statement</p>
              <p>6) After all tis words in bold and capital letters, wat is
                  precisely the idea u r trying to say ? U claimed tat scientist
                  cannot seek the truth and only theologist can. And your reasons
                  are</p>
              <p>a) theologist never doubt existence of god, (but scientist never
                  doubt existence of gravity as wel nowl)</p>
              <p>b) theologist find evidence to support existence of god (but
                  scientist also find evidnece to support their hypothesis)</p>
              <p>c) u said scientist have a wider area of search than theologist
                  (but they r still search for existence of something new, and to u
                  tat is something "truth")</p>
              <p>d)u said " <em>Where science , knows the TRUTH of GRAVITY, but
                  HOW IT WORKS. Do u understand ?"</em></p>
              <p>but however is not discovered at the start of human
                  civilisation. Since u said gravity is truth, then the person who
                  discovered it, a scientist, has found a truth isn't it ? Why will
                  scientist not be finding truth to u then ?</p>
              <p>7) Now u reject science is not truth simply because u say
                  gravity existed before man or science. But "god" also existed
                  before man or theology. SO wat is the difference between the two
                  here ? And if gravity exists before, so ? Why will tat makes it non
                  truth ?</p>
              <p>8) No u did not prove tat. I have already told u u r simply
                  using the equations wrongly. Tat is not the problem of the equation
                  (it is the truth ALL the time if u apply it rightly), but the
                  problem of the user. U used the equation wrongly, u shouldn;t
                  expect the right result</p>
              <p>9) Aren't u repeating wat I said ? U claim tat logically the
                  answer is zero remember ? Your reply on 23Jan 1.01pm</p>
              <p><strong>0 which is NOTHING divides by 0 NOTHING logically =
                  Nothing. But MATHS cant say its 0. Why</strong> ?</p>
              <p>Now u said tat it is not zero. SO u contradict yourself again
                  ?</p>
              <p>U really need to brush up your idea of maths. 0/0 can means
                  anything. As said before, wat do u understand by the idea of
                  dividing things by 0 ? There is no physical meaning to it. And your
                  question on dividing the same number by itself is a 1, but again u
                  r dealing with zero here and dividing by zero is itself physically
                  meaningless. It depend on subject matter then. The dividing by zero
                  often means very close to zero, not absolute zero. If u means
                  absolute zero, then dividing by it has zero meaning</p>
              <p>So u admitted tat your previous statement is grammatically

                                      state of being actual reality, is ok. Then when I show u the
                                      dictionary defintion of science, which is stated as a branch of
                                      knowledge dealing with a body of facts/truths, u say the dictionary
                                      is limited. U believe the dicitionary for one word and do not
                                      believe in another. Wat a double standard u have</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Unless u start to make your stand clear instead of throwing references, then</strong> <strong>Tis still stands true. U refuse to elaborate wat your truth is about and the only explanation u said is again "actual reality".</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) U said u think out of the box,and said "<strong>Whatever
                                      dictionary put there. fair enoug, I,  like the Intellectuals
                                      and Philosophers DO NOT BELIEVE that the word TRUTH is so easy to
                                      define. Thats it."</strong></p>
              <p>But then u keep saying u define the word consistently as
                                      "actuality" ? So is it easy to define or not easy to define ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Unless u start to make your stand clear instead of throwing references, then</strong> <strong>Tis still stands true. U refuse to elaborate wat your truth is about and the only explanation u said is again "actual reality".</strong> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) U say theologist is the only one who can find the truth. It
                                      is because they try to find god existence. I said scientist also
                                      find gravity existence too. <strong>U say is because they r
                                      different field so is okie.</strong> DO u think u can convince any
                                      matured person with tat line of thinking and double standards ?
                                      <strong>So is reality different for both cases ?</strong> Your
                                      definition says "actual reality". Elaborate why it is different for
                                      the theologist and scientist then</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>U never succeed in showing wat is the difference between theologist and scientist. U just throw a lot of rubbish and double standard but u fail. And when questioned, u refused to elaborate. SO I can only assume u r just talking cock</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) U say truth = actuality=actual reality. Then u say scientist
                                      only find the why and how, which r the actual reality, u say they r
                                      not truth. To u, finding out why there is rain, or wind, or gravity
                                      give same acceleration to different mass is all not the truth
                                      (truth = actual reality from your definition) SO u r living in your
                                      delusional world where all reality is not truth ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>This is again true. If u refuse to clarify your definition of truth, then it will be "actual existence" and then u r living in your delusinal world where everything tat is understood by science is not reality to u</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) Then u try to say tat mathematics truth is not truth as well.
                                      U said 1+1=2 is not the truth and u came out with examples of eggs
                                      and sperms and apples and oranges. U claim 1 apple + 1 orange not
                                      equal to 2 apples. Isn't tat obvious ? U use the equation wrongly.
                                      Then u say sperm + egg = 1 fertilised egg. Then again aren't u
                                      using the equation wrongly again ? R we talking about chemistry
                                      equation here ? We r talking about maths and u talk about putting
                                      garbages into the right equation to proclaim the equation wrong.
                                      Tat is nonsene</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>U do came out with another rubbish statement to the equation. U said tat since it is true, so adding all rubbish into it could also make it true. WRONG. U have to follow the right way to use it then it is true. Otherwise u r just playing with words. U can have the most sophisticated equipment but u still have to obey its instruction manual. SO it is still rubbish from u</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) Not daunted, u again come out with another nonsense.</p>
              <p><strong>0 which is NOTHING divides by 0 NOTHING logically =
                                      Nothing. But MATHS cant say its 0. Why</strong> ?</p>
              <p>BECASUE IT IS NOT ZERO ! Dividing anything by zero is infinity.
                                      So the real answer is, it could be anything depending on wat your
                                      subject is. Wat do u understand by dividing zero ? How do u
                                      physically describe it ? From logic, there is nothing wrong with
                                      tis statement.</p>
              <p>Then u claim stupid thing like why 0/0 should be zero</p>
              <p><em><strong>YOUR REPLY on 23 Jan 101pm<br></strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>I pointed out that 0 divided by 0 , SHOULD be 0 right ? </strong></em></p>

              <p>And not u mention Pi as Pai ! I hope it is a typo error and not because u try to spell it with the pronounciation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7) U said "Theologians, seek the TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD.
                                      <strong>They dont look for TRUTHS.</strong> Thier TRUTH is already
                                      GOD to the Theologians"</p>
              <p>Lets see your earliest statement</p>
              <p>Science is not there to PROVE, it is to find out WHY, to
                                      EXPLAIN. <strong>They are not to discern what is true and false.
                                      Its not even thier doman.  It is the Theologists</strong>.</p>
              <p>Now u said theologist don't look for truth (actual reality), but
                                      the theologists' domain is to discern wat is true or false ? Wat r
                                      u trying to say ? Contradict yourself again ?</p>
              <p>8) "Theologians, seek the TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD. They
                                      dont look for TRUTHS. Thier TRUTH is already GOD to the
                                      Theologians"</p>
              <p>Actually tis statement is funny. Your first statement say they
                                      seek the truth (of the existence of god). Then u say they don't
                                      look for truth. Then lastly u say the truth (which they r not
                                      looking for) is god (very important?) to the theologians. So r they
                                      looking for truth or not ? Is the truth important to them ?</p>
              <p> Now u reply tis again insanity word</p>
              <p><strong>NO. TRUTH OF GOD IS TRUTH OF GOD.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>TRUTH OF HIS EXISTENCE IS TRUTH OF THIS EXISTENCE.</strong></p>
              <p>I ask u to elaborate on the above sentences and u refuse and just repeat the same incomprehensible statements. R u trying to avoid the question altogether ?</p>

                              u trying to say ? Contradict yourself again ?</p>
              <p>8) "Theologians, seek the TRUTH of the EXISTENCE of GOD. They
                              dont look for TRUTHS. Thier TRUTH is already GOD to the
                              Theologians"</p>
              <p>Actually tis statement is funny. Your first statement say they
                              seek the truth (of the existence of god). Then u say they don't
                              look for truth. Then lastly u say the truth (which they r not
                              looking for) is god (very important?) to the theologians. So r they
                              looking for truth or not ? Is the truth important to them ?</p>
              <p> Now u reply tis again insanity word</p>
              <p><strong>NO. TRUTH OF GOD IS TRUTH OF GOD.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>TRUTH OF HIS EXISTENCE IS TRUTH OF THIS
                              EXISTENCE.</strong></p>
              <p>I ask u to elaborate on the above sentences and u refuse and
                              just repeat the same incomprehensible statements. R u trying to
                              avoid the question altogether ?</p>

              <p>First of all, YOU.. based on the evidence, points to that you are STUPID. Its a theory, but i believe in the possibilities you are not stupid but average.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is true , may not be the truth</strong></span> : - You are too stupid to understand this simple concept. Because of your limitation of the understanding of the deeper meaning of the word TRUTH from TRUE, you cant get it out of your head. <strong>U are just stuck at YOUR MEANING of TRUTH deriving from the word TRUE from the dictionary.<br></strong></p>
              <p>My stance is made clear. I elaborated my truth already. U <strong>KNOW</strong> my truth. Unless you are stupid, u keep on asking. Which looks to be the norm to you. Cause u keep asking when the answers are there.</p>
              <p>The references are for YOUR benefit. The thing is, u must have gone confused, thats why u cannot get my meaning. You are just stupid. If u cant get such a simple two word explaination of Actual Existence,  i got nothing to say. Its so simple. U cant get it, sorry.</p>
              <p>You dont answer my questions, becaue u chose not to answer, even with the mistakes you make. I just overlook your mistakes. But i shall just point one out soon in this page, as to NOT confuse your stupid ass. Something simple. Easy to understand.</p>
              <p>I did not question the existence of gravity. Again, you put things in my mouth. You pull answers out from your ass. You are just stupid. No other explaination.</p>
              <p>U and Deadstroke are the one who started the- (I explained to deadstroke, no more queries. He understood but this is ur reply and my response)</p>
              <p>"I can't help laughing when I hear someone say tat 1+1=2 is not
                                                      the truth. How do u define the word "2" ?" -stupidissmart 18 Jan - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I <a href="/forums/1381/topics/387924?page=6">ANSWERED </a>IT.   </span></strong>Again and again i answered. But u are too stupid to understand. But NOW, u seem to understand and want me to explain again.</p>
              <p><strong>Look at MY REPLY on the 23rd Jan 1.03pm</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I pointed to u, it is not. It could be <span style="color: #ff0000;">zero to infinity</span>, depending on subject

              <p>And not u mention Pi as Pai ! I hope it is a typo error and not
                                                      because u try to spell it with the pronounciation-</p>
              <p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WRONG</strong></span> -  0/0 = ITS <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>UNDEFINED</strong></span> . <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEVER INFINITY </strong></span>.  Obviously, you dont have ur facts right. So you are talking rubbish too, gibberish. So you have no right to say i am talking rubbish when you yourself dont know what you are talking about.  Again, proves that u are stupid. Yes i admit, Pais my typo error, like so many typos i make. I admit.</p>
              <p>"Science is not there to PROVE, it is to find out WHY, to
                                                      EXPLAIN. <strong>They are not to discern what is true and false.
                                                      Its not even thier doman.  It is the Theologists</strong>."</p>
              <p>AGAIN, its obvious i said its my mistake, and ALL SUBSEQUENT POSTS <strong>DO NOT RELFECT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THAT STATEMENT(15JAN2010).</span></strong> But obviously, you are too stupid, or u are ignoring my omission, or stubborn, or just being a moron.</p>
              <p>Actual Existence. They are searching for the TRUTH of God's Existence. Once again, you are stupid. U cant differentiate between Search of the Truth, and Search of the EXISTENCE of TRUTH. Obvsiously, you are again, stupid. Hence, i am NOT trying to avoid the question altogether. Instead <strong>U FAIL TO UNDERSTAND.</strong></p>
              <p>Just admit it, you are stupid. Because in this case, being stupid , IS NOT SMART. </p>
              <p>You notice, i have NO problem with YOUR definition of the truth. Yours is very simple.</p>
              <p>All my answers to ALL your questions are in the posts.  Except the ommitted post of TRUE/FALSE that i kept telling you. ALL ANSWERS are there in the subsequent post of the ommited post.  Or i will just regurgitate for your feeble mind to TRY to comprehend.</p>
