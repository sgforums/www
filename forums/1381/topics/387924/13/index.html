              <p>Let me see... so u r talking about the portion</p>
              <p><em>U even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">claimed tat

              <p>Ok lor. U r right. It seems to have been pasted in the wrong
                              place. Then ?</p>
              <p>Bullsh!t ? Tat is wat u WROTE. U asked me "where did i say
                              Gravity is NOT truth ?". The only way is to show the rubbish u had
                              written In tis case, it is</p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                              proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U dont
                              <strong>call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists call
                              theory.. the truth right</strong> ?</em></p>
              <p>Tat is wat u wrote on the 16th Jan 216 am. U can go and refer to
                              it.</p>
              <p>I asked u tis question before. If something is not the truth,
                              can it be true ? Wat is your answer to tis ?</p>
              <p>Hoho.. So u think u r more qualified than the people writing
                              english dictionary and just blatantly refuse to accept it. Yup I
                              think u r talking cock and I am gonna let everybody know about
                              it.</p>
              <p>U know wat is the lie ? Previously u challenge me in the
                              below</p>
              <p>24th Jan 1011</p>
              <p><em>And i NEVER said 1+1 = 2 is also truth no matter what
                              happedn. I said its TRUE, but NOT the TRUTH. See... again, putting
                              words into my mouth.</em></p>
              <p>But then u said</p>
              <p>on 18 jan 1253</p>
              <p><strong>Mathematically 1 + 1 = 2 is a true and a
                              truth.</strong></p>
              <p>on 18th jan 106am</p>
              <p><strong>1 + 1 in a mathematical term is true.. is the truth. I
                              agree.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SO now u r arguing MAthmatical Truth is not the truth ? Isn't
                              "mathematic truth", a truth in the field of mathematics ? Is a dark
                              horse a horse ? Your stupidity has shine out again</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So now u r saying, u do not know how to define it in words. And
                              the reason is, u think out of the box ? Wat is the link between the
                              two ? There r tons of people who think out of the box and can still
                              communicate their idea ! So in reality, u probably r just too
                              stupid to describe it in words or too coward to make a stand</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have asked so many times before. Wat does divide by nothing
                              means ? U just have no logic to even understand such a simple
                              statement</p>
              <p>Huh ? I think u r the stupid one around here ! U says
                              substituting values into 0/0, is only true if u r talking about a
                              DEFINED VARIABLE/UNKNOWN. But we r dealing with a UNDEFINED value.
                              Did u really pass your maths or something ? Do u even know "X", the
                              one used in algebra/solving equation is a VARIABLE, NOT UNDEFINED
                              value ! If we substitute a value inside, since it is DEFINED, it is
                              the same on both sides</p>
              <p>But An UNDEFINED value could be anything ! It could be 1 on one
                              side and 1000 on the other side etc. IT COULD BE ANYTHING and it
                              doesn't have to be the same !</p>
              <p>Why don't u define wat is "undefined" in maths ? Then u will
                              know wat a stupid thing u said</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>As usual , u just cant get it when i said "What is TRUE.. may NOT be the TRUTH" And here u are, trying to put ur definitiong of truth into my concept. Of course its not going to work. U believe True = Truth. So, to you, " What is true.. IS TRUTH"</p>
              <p>"I asked u tis question before. If something is not the truth,
                              can it be true ? Wat is your answer to tis ?" - <strong>OF COURSE. LIKED I SAID, IT DEPENDS ON CIRCUMSTANCES. Acceleration of Gravity is TRUE, but u cant say its LIKE THAT, as Gravity on Earth and Moon are different. Its TRUE, i dont think of it as.. THE TRUTH.</strong></p>
              <p>Like i said, you have YOUR beliefs, and u keep trying to make me SWALLOW UR BULLSHIT. I accept your reasoning and ur beliefs, SIMPLE. But no, thats NOT ENOUGH FOR U.</p>
              <p>So u are going to let everyone know i am talking cock while i let everyone know exactly how STUPID u are.</p>

U just .. too stupid n again, trying to make a lame attack. At least get something better. Do u have NOTHING else to say ?</p>
              <p>Why am i too coward to make a stand, where u are just too ridiculously stupid to understand ? There is no POINT even going further if u keep disagreeing in my definition of the truth, if u keep putting UR Definition into MY beliefs, how the hell am i supposed to even move forward ? We are just stuck right here now, in tuotology.</p>

              <p>"5) He made a lot of contradictions. He said gravity is not
                                                      truth, then say it is truth before finally saying it is not truth
                                                      again. He also said only theologist can come out with truth, then
                                                      he says he cannot accept it as truth then he twist again and
                                                      theologist can come out with truth too" - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MISTAKE, i NEVER SAID GRAVITY IS NOT TRUTH.</strong></span>  Again, that makes ur statement null and void.

              <p>OH.. again u say ONLY theologist can come out with TRUTH ? Why u keep putting WORDS into my mouth ? Pls.. READ AGAIN.

              <p>"7) When u used the definition of truth = "actual existence" into
                                                      applications of science such as water cycle, or strength of
                                                      material, or mechanics etc, they r actual reality and they fit the
                                                      description of "truth". However he just say they r just WHY and HOW
                                                      and, I do not know why, becomes not truth. Can anyone else
                                                      understand tis crap ?"</p>
              <p>- <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONCE AGAIN. THEY ARE ONLY THEORIES. ANYTIME, IT CAN BE WRONG. THATS WHY I ACCEPT THEM AS TRUE STATEMENTS, BUT NOT THE TRUTH.</span></strong> SO many times theories have been proven WRONG. Just because its wrong, doesnt mean its NOT useful.  In certain conditions YES. In certain environment and conditions. Even if they explain they WHY and HOW , NO GURANTEE  ITS THE TRUTH.</p>
              <p>What the hell are u talking about ? I told u aready . I specify 0/0 , DID I SAY 10/0 ? Are u STUPID ? IF i give u maths questions/ 0/0 , u give me 10/0 whats wrong with u ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>U JUST PUTTING THINGS IN TO SUIT UR LOGIC AND PUTTING THINGS INTO MY MOUTH.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8) And u also came out with another rubbbish statement 1+1=2 is
                                                      not truth. U said 1+1=2 is not the truth and u came out with
                                                      examples of eggs and sperms and apples and oranges. U claim 1 apple
                                                      + 1 orange not equal to 2 apples. Isn't tat obvious ? U use the
                                                      equation wrongly. Then u say sperm + egg = 1 fertilised egg. Then
                                                      again aren't u using the equation wrongly again ? R we talking
                                                      about chemistry equation here ? We r talking about maths and u talk
                                                      about putting garbages into the right equation to proclaim the
                                                      equation wrong. Tat is nonsense <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WELL DONE. U SEEM TO GET IT. BUT SAY ITS NONSENSE .</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So whats wrong ? Tell me ? Did i say anything ? I never SPECIFY. I told u from my previous statements, different situation different context. ARE U DUMB ?  Thats why 1+1 = 2 Is a MATHEMATICAL TRUTH , but not THE TRUTH. I personally believe it can only work in certain conditions. When u treat it as a maths equation, but in reality its different. Thats why i consider it a TRUE STATEMENT. Like i said previously. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p>U are making<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> FEEBLE</span> attempts! To make sense. Are u THAT stupid ?</p>
              <p>Are u even trying ? Its a pathetic attempt.</p>

              <p>Once again, we have different definitions. I am more then capable of understanding your definition put in your context, however, if u were to apply ur theory in my beliefs it cant work. Same goes with mine. And i have NO PROBLEM with your definitions. All i ask, is UNDERSTANDING. And see from my points of view. If u keep looking at it in your definition, of course u wont understand.</p>
              <p>See, once again, regardint the 1+1 , long ago, i told u its TRUE, but its not wrong, and not the TRUTH either. Because it doesnt apply to all conditions , all reality. Do u agree with me on that point ? Thats all i meant. U are just an idiot trying to pick a fight. I never said it was false, u kept looking like i said it false, Just because i said its not the truth does not mean its not true.</p>
              <p>I already said Nothing Divides by Nothing = Nothing right ? Logicaly speaking. The 0/0 shows fallacy in maths. Thats it. Whats ur problem ? U cant ready ? Are u that stupid ?</p>
              <p>I told u AGAIN n AGAIN , Gravity is being explained by using Theory. I already said Truth , i only say the THEORY part may be WRONG. Thats it. Whats ur problem  again ?</p>

              <p><strong>Yes. Actual Existence. So when does actual existence mean it must pull freedom or economy or aspirations to the earth ? I didn't say it. I just said ACTUAL EXISTENCE. The 1+1=2 must work for all conditions because it deals with quantities. So therefore it must be able to apply for all quantities. Gravity only works on phsyical universe so therefore it must work only in the physical universe. Its got nothing to do with things like freedom etc etc etc because do not belong in the physical universe. Obviously you are just too stupid to understand that concept. Its like a feeble attempt at disproving me. I'm sure you can do better than that. Sad.<br></strong></p>

              <p>So let me write some of the stupidest thing badzmaro said</p>
              <p>1) His only definition of truth comes from the dictionary, but
                                          he cannot accept the description of "science" (body of truth) from
                                          the dictionary. Somehow he thinks he is mroe qualified than the
                                          english professors in writing english words. And when he is pushed, he will add in additional definition such as "perfect" or "include all circumstances" whenever he need ! Stunning !</p>
              <p>2) When it was shown to him tat even in his article,
                                          philosophers all can communicate their idea of truth in words, he
                                          still refuse to define his meaning of truth. And the reason is,
                                          because he "think" out of the box and thus unable to use
                                          english.</p>
              <p>3) He keep saying "It's true but not the truth". To me tat
                                          sentence is grammatically wrong. If it is not the truth, how can it
                                          be true ?</p>
              <p>4) He said Mathematical Truth is not Truth. Basic english user
                                          can know tat mathematics is an adjective here and thus the noun is
                                          still "truth". In fact u can read dictionary.com and it states</p>
              <h2>math⋅e⋅mat⋅i⋅cal</h2>
              <p><span>–<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">adjective</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>of, pertaining to, or of the nature of mathematics: <span>example mathematical truth.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another stupid use of language by him. And now he never talks about the blunder of saying a mathematical truth is not a truth</p>
              <p>5) He made a lot of contradictions. He said gravity is not
                                          truth, then say it is truth before finally saying it is not truth
                                          again. He also said only theologist can come out with truth, then
                                          he says he cannot accept it as truth then he twist again and
                                          theologist can come out with truth too.</p>
              <p>6) He said 0 divide by 0 should be logically zero. However when
                                          asked wat is the meaning of dividing by zero, he refuse to answer.
                  He just keep repeating his sh!t but it is as clear as day tat he has no idea wat dividing by zero means.                        Lets see wat the experts said about dividing by zero</p>
              <p><em>"There is no way to distribute 10 apples amongst 0 people.
                                          In mathematical jargon, a set of 10 items cannot be <a title="Partition of a set" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set">partitioned</a> into 0 subsets.
                                          So <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/d/9/ed9f7cc4d52d9a98f859e594a77b31b7.png" alt="\textstyle\frac{10}{0}">, at least in elementary arithmetic,
                                          is said to be meaningless, or undefined."</em></p>
              <p>So it really tells how logical he is. Then he framed me saying tat I pull an article on 10/0, not 0/0 so I am wrong. However the title of the article is really division by zero, which includes 0/0</p>
              <p>7) When u used the definition of truth = "actual existence" into
                                          applications of science such as water cycle, or strength of
                                          material, or mechanics etc, they r actual reality and they fit the
                                          description of "truth". However he just say they r just WHY and HOW
                                          and, I do not know why, becomes not truth. Can anyone else
                                          understand tis crap ? He also says science never states Truth. NEVER. SO I wonder why does he think his computer in front of him works. Why does he think the engineering product of our world work ? IF science is never truth, then it is never right and thus should fail all the time</p>
              <p>8) And u also came out with another rubbbish statement 1+1=2 is
                                          not truth. U said 1+1=2 is not the truth and u came out with
                                          examples of eggs and sperms and apples and oranges. U claim 1 apple
                                          + 1 orange not equal to 2 apples. Isn't tat obvious ? U use the
                                          equation wrongly. Then u say sperm + egg = 1 fertilised egg. Then
                                          again aren't u using the equation wrongly again ? R we talking
                                          about chemistry equation here ? We r talking about maths and u talk
                                          about putting garbages into the right equation to proclaim the
                                          equation wrong. Tat is nonsense</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He cannot proved any of these allegations away. Mark my words... they will get longer and longer as the days go by</p>

              <p>Glad tat u realise tat gravity has to work on physical matter !
                      See, all truth only works with the valid scope in place ! Now u
                      talk 1+1=2. It must be talking about things in the same context. I
                      have been saying tis like forever and u just ignore it completely.
                      If u talk about sperm, 1 sperm + 1 sperm = 2 sperms. If u talk
                      about egg, 1 egg + 1 egg = 2 eggs. If u talk about things, 1 thing
                      + 1 thing = 2 things. But u use it STUPIDLY WRONG tat even
                      kindergarten student use it better than u. U just ignore the basic
                      scope of the equation (same context) and throw in garbage inside.
                      If u ignore basic scope within the equation, then gravity also
                      should throw away your assumption of the physical universe and
                      should pull aspiration as well</p>
              <p>Wat a sissy man ! U say your statement is logical and when I ask
                      u wat do u mean by three of the words within, u p!ss in your pants
                      and refuse to answer it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Isn't it your classic line "if it can be wrong, then I cannot
                      accept it as truth" ? Since u say the theory of gravity could be
                      wrong, then to u, u cannot accept it as truth. So wat is wrong with
                      wat i said ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I then need to ask, maybe u can try to freshen my memory, where
                      did u get the idea tat I said science is not about the why and how
                      ? I really need to see the whole paragraph of wat I read before I
                      comment</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So u said science can be wrong so it is NEVER the truth ? (which
                      u clearly said many times before) Then may I ask why r u using the
                      computer in front of u ? If it is made based on falsehood, then it
                      may very well explode suddenly ! Why do u dare to go to high rise
                      buildings ? U r not scare science is wrong and the building
                      collapse ? If science is not truth, how do they make things work ?
                      Surely there must have some truths isn't it ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Get wat point ? Just now u r clapping and cheering bravo now
                      suddenly u say u r trying to get the point across ?</p>
              <p>The article had explained clearly. Division by zero is not
                      legitimate and u cannot explain the meaning of division by zero.
                      All the while the article has explained clearly why zero is a
                      special number. The only problem is because u r so stupid tat u
                      cannot know tat truth need to work within a certain scope,
                      limitation. Addition has it scoe, division has its scope and
                      gravity has its scope. There is no truth tat is scopeless.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, why do u change your definition of the truth again
                      ? U wanna add "perfect" to your defintion as well ? Wow man.. u
                      have such a jumble up interpretation of "truth". No wonder u cannot
                      put in words because if u said it out, people will laugh at it
                      !</p>
              <p>Did u complete graph study ? I told u already from the previous
                      explanation. At 0-, it reaches -ve infinity. At 0+ it reaches 0+. +
                      infinity and - infinity r both extremes ! SO at zero, where could
                      it be ? It can be anywhere between + infinity and - infinity, and
                      tat includes zero !</p>
              <p>Lets put tis simple equation for u to see. 0 here represent
                      absolute zero while (?) represent anything</p>
              <p>(?) X 0 = 0 (anything multiplies by absolute zero becomes
                      zero)</p>
              <p>0/0 = (?) (if u push 0 to the other side, it form (?) )</p>
              <p>Get it ! 0/0 can be anything ! It can be zero ! Tis operation is
                      completely not legitimate, it is just a simplified explanation for
                      a stupid kid like u. An analogy. If I do not state it clearly, I
                      wonder wat stupid conclusions can u reach</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Once again.. i NEVER said  gravity cannot work on physical matter. I said Gravity is the Truth. It works where it should be.  Where else 1 + 1 because it's work is supposed to be  representation of quantity in this case as it is supposed to fullfill, fails in its role. While gravity has succeeded in where it's supposed to. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Again, PLEASE, make sure u know what u are talking about.</span></p>
              <p>U know how many times i have answered your answered ? Ur supposedly superior english , why do i need to KEEP SPOON FEEDING u ?  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>U ask the same questions OVER n OVER AGAIN.</strong></span> There is no point i keep asnwering, like i said before earlier. I am not here to spoon feed your ass.</p>

              <p><strong>YOU SAID 18"JAN 5:55PM </strong>"Why is science not the search for truth ? Isn't discovering
                                              mechanics and how it works the truth ? Isn't discovering gravity
                                              and giving values again the search for truth ? Isn't discovering
                                              how the earth comes about or how life comes about a search for
                                              truth ? Isn't discovering how land eroded, how trees are thicker in
                                              the equator or why there r seasons all the search for truth ?
                                              Science searches for truth and discer wat is true or false." &lt;--- <strong>So what was all that about since that day until now. I said its about the How and Why , and u said its NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not about the Truth ?</strong></p>
              <p>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If science is not trut</span>h, how do they make things work ?
                                              Surely there must have some truths isn't it ?" &lt;---<strong> From this statement didnt u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because u derive True = Truth from the dictionary. So what the hell was all that bullshit from the beginning and only NOW u seem to understand. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THAT WAS MY WHOLE POINT FROM THE BEGINNING.I SAID SCIENCE IS NOT INFALLIBLE.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Do u agree with me that Theories can be wrong ? Do u agree with me that Science is the search of the Why and How ? And do u agree with me that Science is NOT TRUTH ?</strong> If u DO, we dont have a problem here.</p>
              <p><strong>Again, Theory is true, not truth , it may be wrong, SO I CANT ACCEPT IT AS TRUTH. But Gravity is there, it has always been. Its a Truth.</strong> <a href="/forums/1381/topics/387924?page=3">Here</a> I have said it since so long ago.</p>
              <p><br><strong>"</strong>Get wat point ? Just now u r clapping and cheering bravo now

              <p>No, there IS a truth that is scopeless, that is GOD. But then again, that is another matter.</p>
              <p>Since i believe that God is scopeless, therefore i cannot accept your theory that TRUTH's must have scope.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Since
                                              it can't do it means it is not perfect and therefore not truth.
                                              True yes. Truth no." I use the word "perfect" because it once again fails to show its infallible. Like my previos statement on gravity, it fullfills what its suppose to do. But Maths, unfortunately, failed. Gravity has NO fallacy. Maths however HAS fallacy.</strong></p>
              <p>U SAID:</p>
              <p><strong>"I pointed to u, it is not. It could be <span style="color: #ff0000;">zero to infinity</span>, depending on subject

              <p>U were the one who brought it up. Look at graph.. does the answer EVER TOUCHES ZERO ? <strong>NO</strong> . SO once again.. where FOOK did ur ZERO(0) come from ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Until u answer that, i cant be BOTHERED to answer ANYTHING ELSE</span> on THAT SUBJECT.</p>
              <p>Again your points of 1 to 8 , i answered them.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> AGAIN n AGAIN. N AGAIN, ALL I SAID, IS SCIENCE IS NOT TRUTH. ITS A HOW AND WHY. IT MAKES MISTAKES, AND I CANT ACCEPT IT AS TRUTH. LIKE MATHS. IS FALLACY.</span></strong></p>
              <p>U keep forcing me comply to the Dictionary or YOUR ONLY definition of Science = description of "science" (body of truth) from
                                              the dictionary. (<strong>AND  U SAID SCIENCE CAN BE WRONG NOW.. SO HOW CAN U AGREE WITH THIS DEFINITION THEN ? U EQUATE TRUE = TRUTH.. TRUTH = TRUE, And ur stupid 3rd point of :-<br></strong></p>
              <p>3) He keep saying "It's true but not the truth". To me tat
                                      sentence is grammatically wrong. If it is not the truth, how can it
                                      be true ? "&lt;---------<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(And u say)</strong></span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SO.. EXPLAIN TO ME.. DOES IT SOUND LIKE WHAT IS TRUE HAS TO BE TRUTH ? IN YOUR WORDS.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>And U SAID</strong>:</p>
              <p>"And I said, the WHY and HOW r truth. Science can be wrong, but
                                      it got most of the things correct. I never said science is always
                                      true, or always the truth. U SAID SCIENCE IS NEVER ABOUT TRUTH

I dont see BODY OF <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOME </span></strong>TRUTHS. So i guess, u are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> IN CONTRADICTION of your OWN DEFINITION</strong></span>. UNLESS, U THINK.... and want to REPHRASE ur definition ? I got no problem. J<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ust dont BITCH TO ME about how I DONT follow the dictionary definition and YOU DO.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <h3><a name="GNP1">1. the systematic observation of natural events and
                      conditions in order to discover facts about them and to formulate laws
                      and principles based on these facts. 2. the organized body of knowledge

                      be verified or tested by further investigation. 3. any specific branch

                      which humans live and to discover the ways in which this information
                      can be organized into meaningful patterns. A primary
                      aim of science is to collect facts (data). An ultimate purpose of

              <p>Does ANY of these conform to YOUR Dictionary of Science ?</p>
              <p>Again, u can claim that i am talking rubbish, but the Truth is.. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHAT IS TRUE, MAY NOT BE THE TRUTH</strong></span>, This is the GIST OF MY ENTIRE BELIEF IN TRUTH. Unfortunately, u are just TOO STUPID. And TOO IGNORANT.</p>
              <p>As i already PREVIOSLY stated, regarding the meaning of True and Truth.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scientific knowledge is human knowledge and scientists are human
                            beings. They are not gods, and science is not infallible. Yet, the general
                            public often thinks of scientific claims as absolutely certain truths.
                            They think that if something is not certain, it is not scientific and if
                            it is not scientific, then any other non-scientific view is its equal.
                            This misconception seems to be, at least in part, behind the general lack
                            of understanding about the nature of scientific theories.</span></p>
              <p>We have been discussing some of the history of the concept of truth as applied to scienfitic knowledge. In light of that history, we can see that to regard scientific knowledge as true, or even as approaching TRUTH, is actually quite suspect. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW.</p>
              <p>Yes, i take definition of Truth from dictionary, one of them yes. Men of intelligence can pick for themselves the dictionary explaination whether to follow or not, SO CAN I.  These are scientists themselves. IF U HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME TAKING TRUTH from DICTIONARY, SCIENCE FROM ELSEWHERE, TOO BAD. If these MEN of "science" "Philosophers" "Scholars" can do it... so can I.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BY ALL MEANS, i got NO BEEF with the pages getting LONGER n LONGER. I answered ALL YOUR QUESTIONS PAGES BEFORE. AND U KEEP PUTTING WORDS INTO MY MOUTH.  So, there is NO POINT, i continue. I will JUST ask u to refer to my OLD POSTS. Its very clear, I wil just repeat the SAME THING how u REPEAT THE SAME QUESTIONS.  U are just too stupid.</p>
              <p> AGAIN, PASTE where i said Gravity is NOT TRUTH. Simple. U cant, u can only SAY i said. I am still waiting UNTIL NOW...</p>

              <p>I can see tat u r really just denying everything and refuse to read other people's point.</p>

                          U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1
                          sperm = 1 fertilised egg. And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My
                          Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2, both must be
                          the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1 apple + 1 orange = 1
                          apple + 1 orange, not 2 apples or 2 oranges). If u do not obey its
                          scope, u r not using the equation right and talking cock.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory. </strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a
                                                  theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory

              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  god is a truth tat has no scope</span></p>
              <p>My ans: God is not even shown to be true, thus not even truth and thus is just talking cock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for
                                                  TRUTH. Are we both finally in agreement that its about the How and

              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT </strong>truth. Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ?</p>
              <p> </p>

                                                  wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because

              <p>My
                          ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it is right,
                          it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition, if science is
                          ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever again. Theologist
                          r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should be zero. U claimed
                          tat u can substitute values into undefined equation and treat it like a
                          variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the article shows there is a problem
                          with maths.U claim the graph never touches 0 so it is not zero</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                          meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                          values. U do not even grasp the basic idea of wat is undefine. U paste
                          a portion of the article showing tat only idiots will conclude 1=2 and
                          u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat the 0 in the graph has
                          values from - infinity to + infinity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                          The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                          accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means it
                          can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before on true
                          and false. So u can never write the right things again ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All your other definitions is dealing with facts and truth. It does not run in contradiction with the dictionary</p>

                              =  BODY OF TRUTHS , Since, the top of the statement has already

              <p>And furthermore, lets us see the below statement</p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a
                                          theory</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory

              <p> </p>
              <p>Now your argument is, u r talking about the theory of truth of
                  gravity ??! Now why is theory of gravity = theory of truth of gravity ?
                  Your english is really horrible. "Theory of gravity" is obviously
                  "theory of gravity". WHy u can suddenly add in two words inside one ?
                  Like tat I can also play tis game</p>
              <p>U said "Now lets see". Playing by your adding words game, I can make
                  it become totally different like " Now lets see wat an idiot like u can
                  say about the above"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should we move on ? Tis is again evidence showing your cock
                  theory. U claim tat truth must encompass EVERYTHING. It must work in
                  ALL scenario. Tat is certainly rubbish because all facts has a certain
                  boundary and scope. Gravity works only for physical matters. 1+1 only
                  works for things of the same context. Medicine only focused on curing a
                  certain illness, not all illnesses. Evolution talks about living things, not rock and sand. U see. They all have scopes.</p>
              <p>Then u said god is truth. Why ? The moonies r wrong before. So is
                  jehova witness or many other cults in tis world. According to u, since
                  it is false, then all theologists r wrong, including christians
                  theologists. Then god is false since it is a theory by them.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>So,</strong> wouldnt that
                                          contradict your statements that the Why and How are Truths ? Since
                                          u said science can be wrong! <strong>And your Truth = True. U never
                                          specify. Its like the Definition, 'Science is a body of
                                          truths</strong>”, so , based on your previous statement “Science
                                          can be wrong” wouldnt that contradict with that statement too ? In
                                          that statement, it did NOT say “MOSTLY body of Truths” or “ SOME
                                          body of Truths” ...etc , so based on that, the definition u used
                                          would seem invalid at this point. <strong>SO how do u reconcile
                                          with these statements about science can be wrong ?</strong></p>

              <p>Science is a body of truth, and u r complaining because u said tat
                  it has been wrong before, the statement is wrong. However did u realise
                  tat if science detects something is wrong, it will correct itself and
                  reflect the truth. SO it could be wrong before, but it is corrected
                  instantly.SO there is nothing wrong with tis statement because it is always updated to reflect the truth</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>So</strong> u agree with me

                                          in maths. If its a fallacy, how can it be the truth. And u said

              <p>Tis is rubbish. 0/0 is NOT DEFINED. So your assumption is wrong. SO all the cock here is all wrong</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>And so ? The answers to the WHY and HOW could be wrong and then ? If
                  it is proven wrong, it is not true. But if it isn't wrong then it is
                  the truth. And if I am not wrong 99.99% of the theories and law r never
                  proven wrong.</p>
              <p>U wrote wrongly (your false asnd true statements before) before so everything u write is wrong ?</p>
              <p>Now lets see wat r the others things which u had no answers to</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
                                      truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
                                      And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
                                      both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1
                                      apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2 apples or 2 oranges).
                                      If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the equation right and
                                      talking cock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
                                          Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                          of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm, u said</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                                          of gravity</strong>.</em></span></p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity"</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                                          truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                                          proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                                          <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                                          call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  god is a truth
                                          tat has no scope</span></p>
              <p>My ans: God is not even shown to be true, thus not even truth
                                          and thus is just talking cock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
                                          NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
                                          finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
                                          about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
                                          truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
                                          Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                                          the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
                                          u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
                                          wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
                                          u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                                          is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
                                          if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
                                          again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
                                          truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                                          be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                                          equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                                          article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                          touches 0 so it is not zero</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is meaningless. U
                  cannot differentiate between variable and undefined values. U do not
                  even grasp the basic idea of wat is undefine. U paste a portion of the
                  article showing tat only idiots will conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail
                  to read my explanation tat the 0 in the graph has values from -
                  infinity to + infinity. U r still stuck in your elementary maths and
                  think tat UNDEFINE value must have a cut in the graph like a variable</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                                          definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                                          wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                          The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                          accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                          it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                          on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                                          ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                                          be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                                          definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All your other definitions is dealing with facts and
                                          truth. It does not run in contradiction with the dictionary</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong, it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a body of truth.</p>

              <p>This is in reply to the original post.</p>
              <p>Darwinism is still a theory. It is widely accepted because it is more credible han other theories. You are only discrediting the theroy by saying that fossilisation can take place in only a couple of years. While i'm not saying that this is untrue, you must also take into account that the time period the fossil is obtained can be measured by carbon dating. So we can be more or less sure when the fossil comes from</p>
              <p>That aside darwinism does not exist to disprove religion. Have you considered that it may serve as a way to explain our existence with respect to religion. </p>
              <p>Religion states that god placed man on earth. It is generally assumed that god just plucked us out of heaven and placed us literally on earth. Though this is the most obvious interpretation of the religions that are Abrahamic, in no text is this explicitly stated to be true.</p>
              <p>Darwinism and evolution can explain how god made man come to be. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>How long did it take them just
                          to explain the <strong>theory of gravity</strong>.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now your argument is, u r talking about the theory of truth of
                          gravity ??! Now why is theory of gravity = theory of truth of
                          gravity ? Your english is really horrible. "Theory of gravity" is
                          obviously "theory of gravity". WHy u can suddenly add in two words
                          inside one ? Like tat I can also play tis game</p>
              <p>U said "Now lets see". Playing by your adding words game, I can
                          make it become totally different like " Now lets see wat an idiot
                          like u can say about the above"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should we move on ? Tis is again evidence showing your cock
                          theory. U claim tat truth must encompass EVERYTHING. It must work
                          in ALL scenario. Tat is certainly rubbish because all facts has a
                          certain boundary and scope. Gravity works only for physical
                          matters. 1+1 only works for things of the same context. Medicine
                          only focused on curing a certain illness, not all illnesses.
                          Evolution talks about living things, not rock and sand. U see. They
                          all have scopes.</p>
              <p>Then u said god is truth. Why ? The moonies r wrong before. So
                          is jehova witness or many other cults in tis world. According to u,
                          since it is false, then all theologists r wrong, including
                          christians theologists. Then god is false since it is a theory by
                          them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Science is a body of truth, and u r complaining because u said
                          tat it has been wrong before, the statement is wrong. However did u
                          realise tat if science detects something is wrong, it will correct
                          itself and reflect the truth. SO it could be wrong before, but it
                          is corrected instantly.SO there is nothing wrong with tis statement
                          because it is always updated to reflect the truth</p>
              <p>Tis is rubbish. 0/0 is NOT DEFINED. So your assumption is wrong.
                          SO all the cock here is all wrong</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And so ? The answers to the WHY and HOW could be wrong and then
                          ? If it is proven wrong, it is not true. But if it isn't wrong then
                          it is the truth. And if I am not wrong 99.99% of the theories and
                          law r never proven wrong.</p>
              <p>U wrote wrongly (your false asnd true statements before) before
                          so everything u write is wrong ?</p>
              <p>Now lets see wat r the others things which u had no answers
                          to</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) U claimed : 1+1 =2 is not
                          truth. And based on wat ? U say 1 egg + 1 sperm = 1 fertilised egg.
                          And thus u claimed 1+1 not equal to 2.</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Truth has to work within a certain scope. For 1+1=2,
                          both must be the same context. (1 apple + 1 apple =2 apples, 1
                          apple + 1 orange = 1 apple + 1 orange, not 2 apples or 2 oranges).
                          If u do not obey its scope, u r not using the equation right and
                          talking cock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) U claimed: U did not say
                          Gravity is not truth</span></p>
              <p>My Ans:</p>
              <p><strong>a) U say gravity is a theory.</strong></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm,  U specifically said gravity is a theory</p>
              <p><em>How long did it take them just to explain the <strong>theory
                          of gravity</strong>.</em></p>
              <p>15 Jan 1108pm, u said</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>How long did it take them just
                          to explain the <strong>theory of gravity</strong>.</em></span></p>
              <p>and obviously, "theory of gravity"="theory of gravity", not
                          "theory of the watever sh!t u can add in gravity"</p>
              <p><strong>b) U claimed theory can be false thus it is not
                          truth.</strong></p>
              <p>16 Jan 216am, </p>
              <p><em>They are theories and theories can be right  and can be
                          proven wrong like newtonian laws that only works on earth. U
                          <strong>dont call it the FACT of Gravity..U never hear Scientists
                          call theory.. the truth right ?</strong></em></p>
              <p>c) So in other words, u said gravity is not truth to u</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) U claimed:  god is a truth
                          tat has no scope</span></p>
              <p>My ans: God is not even shown to be true, thus not even truth
                          and thus is just talking cock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4) U claimed: U said "<strong>its
                          NOT about the How and Why.. but the SEARCH for TRUTH. Are we both
                          finally in agreement that its about the How and Why then. And not
                          about the Truth ?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>My ans: If u read wat I wrote, i said the <strong>WHY and HOW r
                          truth</strong>. U said how and why, are <strong>NOT</strong> truth.
                          Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                          the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5) <strong>on this statement didnt
                          u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be
                          wrong, so isnt wrong, not true, hence not true = not truth. Because
                          u derive True = Truth from the dictionary.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                          is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,
                          if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever
                          again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as
                          truth then ? Which profession is never wrong before ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">6) U claimed: 0/0 logically should
                          be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                          equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                          article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                          touches 0 so it is not zero</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                          meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                          values. U do not even grasp the basic idea of wat is undefine. U
                          paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots will
                          conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat the 0
                          in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U r still
                          stuck in your elementary maths and think tat UNDEFINE value must
                          have a cut in the graph like a variable</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                          definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                          wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                          The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                          accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                          it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                          on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                          ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                          be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                          definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All your other definitions is dealing with facts and
                          truth. It does not run in contradiction with the dictionary</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                          is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                          it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                          body of truth.</p>

              <p>Well, lets see.. i had to say the Theory of the Truth of Gravity to you, because u just too stupid when i kept telling u that Gravity is truth, theory is true, and the theory is used to EXPLAIN the WHY and HOW of the Truth and that is Gravity. And when i said, they dont go about saying Theory of Gravity as Fact of Gravity or Truth of Gravity , instead using Theory is because it can be wrong, hence Theory is safer and is true.</p>
              <p>Theory of Gravity  ? Whats wrong with that ? It took them ages. Gravity is the Truth, the theory took them ages to explain that phenomenon. SO where and what did i say wrong ? Can you like.. read man ? Are u .. are u stupid ? Its just that u cant understand. I just had to break it down for you.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">So, are u purposely trying to put
                                                  words into my mouth ? U know u can give up on this point ? U can
                                                  give up on trying to say i said gravity is not truth u know. Its
                                                  kinda a pathetic attempt.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>U believe God doesnt exist, not true, not a truth, so be it. U can say i am talking cock all u want, but in the end of the day, to me , he is the Truth and scopeless. And to quote you, " I think that you not believing in God is also talking cock then" , i already said , move on. U still need to answer... guess u just cant accept others beliefs. I already , its a noted difference in opinion.. MOVE ON.</p>
              <p>Again , another stupid question about the theory of Gravity, i already said, its a Theory , it can be wrong, i cannot hold it as Truth, but Gravity on the other hand , IS TRUTH. Are u dumb ? How many times u want me to say Gravity is Truth when i said it since the BEGINNING OF THE THREAD. Guess u ARE just too stupid. There is no other explaination in you continuing to think i dont think gravity is a Truth.</p>
              <p>I got no problem with Theologians being wrong, but God IS Truth to them, they are just finding the evidence to support. I never said Theologians are Truth. They TRY to find the evidence. Simple.</p>
              <p>Regarding your scope, I agree, Gravity works in its scope. I DONT agree with Maths because it has FAILED in its scopes in quantity, even within its context, it has failed. And i because i believe God is scopeless, and even IF ALL the truths work within its scope, i still cant say ALL truth's work within its scope, because God is scopeless to me, hence i believe that not all truth's have to have its scope. Thats why i said move on. Obviously this is a difference in opinion. N i am willing to accept yours. Simple. U dont believe God, but I do.  SO MOVE ON.</p>
              <p>"YOUR ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it

                                                  if science is ever wrong, it will never ever be right or truth ever

              <p>What happened to your supperior grammar ? Thats beside the point. You already stated that Science = Body of Truths , Science can be wrong, and since u get True = True , therefore , that definition of science can also be wrong. You already admitted in falsehood. When there is falsehood, there is no longer body of truths. Unless ur definition includes.. SOME body of truths , or MOSTLY body of truths  , which is NOT the case.</p>

              <p>Your ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                                  it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                                  body of truth.</p>
              <p> What happened to your superior logic ? If your previous statement is already wrong , science is wrong already , and even if u correct it , u cannot negate the fact that it was wrong . Some theories are just so totally different and totally wrong that doesnt relect the truth. Like the Universe rotates around the Earth. Or how the Earth was Flat.  If this happens more then onec, there are probably theories right now that are probably wrong, so must accet the possibility of fallacy in thoeries now accepted as correct.</p>
              <p>If that is the case, science CANT be body of truths , u have to accept possibilities that the theories may be wrong.</p>
              <p>So its cut n paste now ? At least add some extra substance and flavour. It gets boring .. yawn~~</p>

              <p>Darwinism is still a theory. It is widely accepted because it is

              theroy by saying that fossilisation can take place in only a couple
              of years. While i'm not saying that this is untrue, you must also
              take into account that the time period the fossil is obtained can
              be measured by carbon dating. So we can be more or less sure when
              the fossil comes from</p>
              <p>That aside darwinism does not exist to disprove religion. Have

              with respect to religion. </p>
              <p>Religion states that god placed man on earth. It is generally
              assumed that god just plucked us out of heaven and placed us
              literally on earth. Though this is the most obvious interpretation
              of the religions that are Abrahamic, in no text is this explicitly
              stated to be true.</p>

              <p>If u do not like to talk about god, so be it. We can move on from there.</p>
              <p>But u said all truth must be scopeless and can work under all situations. I do not agree. SO I will still paste the point about truth having a scope in</p>
              <p>U claim tat truth must encompass EVERYTHING. It must work
                                                  in ALL scenario. Tat is certainly rubbish because all facts has a
                                                  certain boundary and scope. Gravity works only for physical
                                                  matters. 1+1 only works for things of the same context. Medicine
                                                  only focused on curing a certain illness, not all illnesses.
                                                  Evolution talks about living things, not rock and sand. U see. They
                                                  all have scopes.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I got no problem with Theologians being wrong, but God IS Truth
                                                  to them, they are just finding the evidence to support. I never

              <p>Well according to u, science is NEVER about truth. However u also claimed Theologists is the ONLY one tat can handle truth. Tat to me, obviously is a double standard and a bad one since theologist r the one coming up with the most lies</p>

              <p>SO
                          u r still bringing in God into the picture now ? Tis is again another
                          double standard. U claimed god is a truth but u cannot produce any
                          evidence supporting it. U claimed science is not truth, even when they
                          had brought tons of evidences etc. In tat case, god has a scope as
                          well. Only believers think it is a truth. And thus its scope is only to
                          believers because to non believers, it failed to be even true. The god changes from one form to another as well since different religions taught different gods</p>

                          science could be wrong, but the moment someone proves a part if wrong,
                          tat part is no longer science. SO science is still a body of truth.</p>
              <p>Another
                          use of "body" in the form of the "science and its body of truth" could
                          be "student body". The student body should consists of all students.
                          However people from the student body do graduate from their school one
                          day. But the student body is not grammatically wrong since those who
                          had graduate simply leave the body. The student body is still consists
                          of only students.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think u need to know more about richrad feynman. The quote u gave about is nt complete. He said the following</p>
              <p><strong>Science alone of all the subjects contains within itself the lesson
              of the danger of belief in the infallibility of the greatest teachers
              in the preceding generation</strong> ... <strong>Learn from science that you must doubt the experts. </strong>As a matter of fact, I can also define science another way: <strong>Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bottom line is simply saying one should doubt the experts and keep challenging science. Which is really nothing wrong. WHy not see wat other words he had about science and its truth ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in
              the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle:
              permit us to question — to doubt — to not be sure. I think that it is
              important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose
              what we have gained.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The third aspect of my subject is that of science as a method of
              finding things out. This method is based on the principle that
              observation is the judge of whether something is so or not. All other
              aspects and characteristics of science can be understood directly when
              we understand that observation is the <strong>ultimate and final judge of the
              truth</strong> of an idea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The remark which I read somewhere, that science is all right as long as
              it doesn't attack religion, was the clue I needed to understand the
              problem. As long as it doesn't attack religion it need not be paid
              attention to and nobody has to learn anything. So it can be cut off
              from society except for its applications, and thus be isolated. And
              then we have this terrible struggle to try to explain things to people
              who have no reason to want to know. But if they want to defend their
              own point of view, they will have to learn what yours is a little bit.
              So I suggest, maybe correctly and perhaps wrongly, that we are too
              polite.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this
              tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and
              all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions,
              and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God
              can watch human beings struggle for good and evil — which is the view
              that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>We've learned from experience that the truth will come out.</strong> Other experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether
              you were wrong or right. Nature's phenomena will agree or they'll
              disagree with your theory. And, although you may gain some temporary
              fame and excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist
              if you haven't tried to be very careful in this kind of work. And it's
              this type of integrity, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is
              missing to a large extent in much of the research in <a class="extiw" title="w:Cargo cult science" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science">cargo cult science</a>.</p>

                                              Gravity is a scientific issue. It is the answer WHY things fall to
                                              the ground. Then is gravity truth to u ?</p>

                                              u pretty much say Science Is Truth. And then u say science can be

              <p>My ans: Science can be wrong, but it is mostly right. Since it
                                              is right, it is about the truth. However in your narrow definition,

                                              again. Theologist r wrong as well. How come u still treat it as

                                              be zero. U claimed tat u can substitute values into undefined
                                              equation and treat it like a variable. U claimed tat 1=2 in the
                                              article shows there is a problem with maths.U claim the graph never
                                              touches 0 so it is not zero. U claim I had define the value of 0/0 when I said it could be any value from 0 to infinity<br></span></p>
              <p>My Ans: 0/0 has no logical meaning. Divide by zero is
                                              meaningless. U cannot differentiate between variable and undefined
                                              values. U do not even grasp the basic idea of wat is undefine. U
                                              paste a portion of the article showing tat only idiots will
                                              conclude 1=2 and u did tat. U fail to read my explanation tat the 0
                                              in the graph has values from - infinity to + infinity. U r still
                                              stuck in your elementary maths and think tat UNDEFINE value must
                                              have a cut in the graph like a variable. And any possible value from zero to infinity REINFORCE the idea it is undefined, and not being defined.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">7) U claimed: The dictionary
                                              definition of truth is wrong. And tis is because science has been
                                              wrong before</span></p>
              <p>My Ans: Your only definition of truth is from the dictionary.
                                              The dictionary said tat science is a body of truth. But u refuse to
                                              accept tat explanation. Science has been wrong but it doesn't means
                                              it can never be right or truth. U also said u wrote wrongly before
                                              on true and false. So u can never write the right things again
                                              ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">8) U claimed: Wat is true may not
                                              be the truth</span></p>
              <p>My ans: If it is not the truth, it is not true.</p>
              <p>a) if a thing is not truth, it must be false</p>
              <p>b) false is not true</p>
              <p>It is a simple logic. Do u understand logic ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">9) U claimed: There r many other
                                              definitions of science</span></p>
              <p>My ans: All mainstream organisations treat science as truth or knowledge of facts. And u just misquote Richard Feynman</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">10) U claimed: Tat since science
                                              is wrong before, then it cannot be a "body of truth"</span></p>
              <p>My ans: Science may be wrong before but when it detects a wrong,
                                              it instantly correct itself and reflect the truth. So it is still a
                                              body of truth. Similar to "student body" (the use of body is the same as science and its body of truth), its members will cease to be students one day. However the definition of "student body" is still intact because those who r no longer students just leave the student body and thus it is still grammatically correct.</p>
