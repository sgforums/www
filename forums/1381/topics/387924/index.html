              whether we are studying or working. We can see the evidence of it in what we
              watch, hear and see in the world around us. But imagine what was life like
              before 1859,<span>  </span>before the whole idea of
              evolution and darwinism was brought about by the man himself. The world was
              still the same, people were still people, scientist were still scientists,
              animals were still animals. Why would any commoner believe in it? When there
              were in a sense, ‘better’ and ‘proven’ ways of why the earth was created and
              how man came to be. In the next 150 years, more and more scientist began to
              believe in darwinism. Scientists, of course are of higher intellect and are the
              ‘equivalent of church leaders’ in the atheist society. Because Scientists are
              at such a high position in society, and because they are pretty neutral against
              all religions, they have the most exposure to the media, have the most books
              and are constantly writing in newspapers, they are less criticized and their
              works and understandings are more widely accepted among free thinkers. Most
              free thinkers think that there is no such thing as god but instead everything
              relies on chance and nature, which points to darwinism and the theory of
              evolution. But if most free thinkers think that darwinism is not a religion,
              then they are wrong. The definition of religion in <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">www.wikipedia.org</a> is “</span><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A</span></span><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></span><span><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>religion</span></strong></span><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></span><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>is a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of
              the universe</span>”. </span><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'>Now, think to yourself, is darwinism a
              set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe? Of
              course it is! Now, what sets darwinism or rather degrades darwinism apart from
              the rest of the religions, is that it was inspired by a 100% human man! Charles
              Darwin himself! So if Charles darwin created darwinism, does that make him God?
              Or rather does that make him a person who has seen everything happening from
              the start and till the end? Did he witness the first cell growing into
              something 1 billion times bigger than it? Of course he did not. What Charles
              Darwin did was basically draw conclusions from things he saw around him, which
              is the reason why there is so much evidence for his theory. But again, Charles
              Darwin is still a human after all, and a human’s understanding of the world
              around him is only limited to a certain amount. For me, it’s harder to believe
              in a fellow person who has that certain amount of knowledge and power instead
              of a celestial being who has infinite amount of knowledge and power. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'>Coming back to my topic, the main reason why darwinism is so
              widely accepted in the world, is because it is endorsed by most scientists. Many
              people who have less intellect capability than scientists would probably think “since
              they are smarter than me, then they are probably right and i should believe in
              whatever they believe in”. But the main reason why darwinism is so widely
              accepted by scientists around, is because Charles darwin was practically one of
              them. Average scientists would look up to the better scientists and say “these
              people are smarter and more experienced than me, therefore they are correct”. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; '>Most believe in Darwinism
              simply because it is much easier to comprehend and understand it. But, in
              reality, these people are lazy and just want to lay back and say “this is where
              i come from, but since it is such, it does not affect me presently and i should
              go on living life just as i did”. Darwinism is basically believes that </span><span><span style='font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>“Life on earth evolved gradually
              beginning with one primitive species—perhaps a self-replicating molecule—that
              lived more than 3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing
              off many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not all) of
              evolutionary change is natural selection.”<sup> </sup></span></span><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; '>Now what this means is that it took 3.5 billion
              years (in other words: a very very very long <span style="color: red;">time</span>)
              for a single species to branch out into millions and millions of species, and
              currently the leader of it all are humans. So the whole basis of darwinism and
              the evolution theory is that things CHANGE over a long long PERIOD OF <span style="color: red;">TIME</span> through a course of ‘natural selection’. This is
              basically the assumption that <span style="color: red;">time</span> allows for
              change through natural selection. If you take out <span style="color: red;">time</span> out of this equation, there would not be change and no natural selection. How
              Charles Darwin brought up this approximate time of 3.5 billion years was by
              looking at fossil remains deeper and deeper into ground and examining them for
              age and therefore finding at what <span style="color: red;">time</span> would
              these fossils have been still alive and kicking. How he based this <span style="color: red;">time </span>was by the basic explanation that for things to
              be fossilised, it would take <span style="color: red;">time </span>and tremendous
              pressure to prevent decomposition. So if <span style="color: red;">time </span>was
              again taken out of this equation, Darwin’s theory of evolution would be
              completely wrong. Simply because, if things did not take alot of time to
              fossilise, then Darwin’s approximate time of 3.5 billion years would be wrong
              and the whole length of time would be shortened alot, and that would mean there
              could not have been enough time for evolution to occur. That basic explanation
              that the only way to fossilise something was by<span>  </span>time and tremendous pressure was accepted during Darwin’s time, but is
              something that now is considered wrong. For example, a cat or dog can be
              fossilised in 2 or 3 years as long as there is a huge amount of pressure and
              the right conditions, with the exception of time. This link shows how it’s
              possible:</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><a href="http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm">http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm</a>.
              Therefore, Darwinism is false. This proves that as new discoveries are made,
              and new theories are brought up, old theories and beliefs have to be removed
              from the ‘scientific library’, and evolution and Darwinism are one of them. <span> </span>For more information, please read: <a href="http://www.discovery.org/a/10661">http://www.discovery.org/a/10661</a></span></p>

              <p>Well, u gotta believe that both.. explains .. like how Science n Religion especially the Bible if not taken figuratively, expalains it all.</p>
              <p>We are still at our infancy in understanding the cosmos. Ur faith cant be THAT weak.</p>
              <p>For instance,</p>
              <p>Both Copernicus and Galileo considered themselves to be Christians, yet
                      they knew that their beliefs conflicted with the official teachings of
                      the church on matters of science. Almost everyone today, Christian and
                      non-Christian alike, accepts the scientific validity of the theories of
                      Copernicus and Galileo . Biblical
                      passages that at one time were interpreted as proving that the earth was stationary*Psalms*, or that the sun revolved around th earth (i.e, it rose and set)*again in Psalms* were reinterpreted by Christians, explaining the language of the Bible
                      as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">figurative rather than literal</span>. The problem, Christians began to
                      see, was not with science, nor with the Bible, but with improper
                      interpretations of the Bible, for example, forcing it to be literal
                      when it should have been taken figuratively or phenomenologically
                      (i.e., describing events as they appear from a human perspective, like
                      the "rising" of the sun).</p>
              <p>But most scientists who identify themselves as Protestants also accept
                      Darwin's theory as foundational to the modern, scientific study of
                      biology. Other Christians continue to oppose the theory itself, some of
                      whom also reject the idea that the earth is billions of years old. We
                      will deal with these two subjects separately ... when i have more sit on ass time. hahaha</p>
              <p>Evolution theory does have holes. But these holes like the fossils are the missing links. Bear in mind i am summarising it in the simplest of language and substance.</p>
              <p>But all these leads to a concept that is called by its proponents the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intelligent Design
                      (ID) Theory.</span> The most basic summary of ID is that biological organisms
                      are so complex that they cannot have developed by chance, so they must
                      have had a designer. Although advocates of teaching ID in the public
                      school avoid saying so, it is clear that for the vast majority of them,
                      that designer is the God of Christianity.</p>
              <p>So much more we dont know, i believe we cant let science or the Bible get in the way of each other, but instead, side by side.</p>
              <p>Hope u understand what i mean till this post in all the threads recently regarding to the Bible, Science and the possibilities or miracles to the explaination of God and Christianity as a whole.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">to badzmaro, if you look at my post carefully, i am not criticizing science itself. im jst against darwinism and his explanation of how things happen by chance. which i find is not true. i am a christian and i personally feel that from genesis 1, God created man and woman, not from a single species of plant or animal or whatever, but as a special being to rule over the animals and plants. I do need believe that my ancestor is a animal or plant. sorry to say. but yes. </p>

              <p>Because if your reject Darwinism theory totally,  that means u reject the emergence of the field of genetics in the early 20th century,
              coupled with Watson and Crick's discovery of the DNA molecule in the
              1950s, that confirmed Darwin's theory to an amazing degree that is now the foundation of modern biology.</p>
              <p>Agreed that we dont literally come from plants, i am just saying that i believe that everything has its links towards God from past to present thats all.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>Why it is so widely accepted in modern
              times</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>Darwinism is considerably a huge part of a person’s
              everyday life, whether we are studying or working. We can see the
              evidence of it in what we watch, hear and see in the world around
              us. But imagine what was life like before 1859,<span> </span> before the whole idea of evolution and darwinism
              was brought about by the man himself. The world was still the same,
              people were still people, scientist were still scientists, animals
              were still animals. Why would any commoner believe in it? When
              there were in a sense, ‘better’ and ‘proven’ ways of why the earth
              was created and how man came to be. In the next 150 years, more and
              more scientist began to believe in darwinism. Scientists, of course
              are of higher intellect and are the ‘equivalent of church leaders’
              in the atheist society. Because Scientists are at such a high
              position in society, and because they are pretty neutral against
              all religions, they have the most exposure to the media, have the
              most books and are constantly writing in newspapers, they are less
              criticized and their works and understandings are more widely
              accepted among free thinkers. Most free thinkers think that there
              is no such thing as god but instead everything relies on chance and
              nature, which points to darwinism and the theory of evolution. But
              if most free thinkers think that darwinism is not a religion, then
              they are wrong. The definition of religion in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">www.wikipedia.org</a> is
              “</span><span><span>A</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><strong><span>religion</span></strong></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>is a set of beliefs
              concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the
              universe</span>”.</span> <span>Now, think to yourself, is
              darwinism a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and
              purpose of the universe? Of course it is! Now, what sets darwinism
              or rather degrades darwinism apart from the rest of the religions,
              is that it was inspired by a 100% human man! Charles Darwin
              himself! So if Charles darwin created darwinism, does that make him
              God? Or rather does that make him a person who has seen everything
              happening from the start and till the end? Did he witness the first
              cell growing into something 1 billion times bigger than it? Of
              course he did not. What Charles Darwin did was basically draw
              conclusions from things he saw around him, which is the reason why
              there is so much evidence for his theory. But again, Charles Darwin
              is still a human after all, and a human’s understanding of the
              world around him is only limited to a certain amount. For me, it’s
              harder to believe in a fellow person who has that certain amount of
              knowledge and power instead of a celestial being who has infinite
              amount of knowledge and power.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>Coming back to my topic, the main reason why
              darwinism is so widely accepted in the world, is because it is
              endorsed by most scientists. Many people who have less intellect
              capability than scientists would probably think “since they are
              smarter than me, then they are probably right and i should believe
              in whatever they believe in”. But the main reason why darwinism is
              so widely accepted by scientists around, is because Charles darwin
              was practically one of them. Average scientists would look up to
              the better scientists and say “these people are smarter and more
              experienced than me, therefore they are correct”.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Evidence against Darwinism</span></p>
              <p><span>Most believe in Darwinism simply because
              it is much easier to comprehend and understand it. But, in reality,
              these people are lazy and just want to lay back and say “this is
              where i come from, but since it is such, it does not affect me
              presently and i should go on living life just as i did”. Darwinism
              is basically believes that</span> <span><span>“Life on
              earth evolved gradually beginning with one primitive
              species—perhaps a self-replicating molecule—that lived more than
              3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing off
              many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not
              all) of evolutionary change is natural selection.” </span></span><span>Now what this means is that it took
              3.5 billion years (in other words: a very very very long
              <span style="color: red;">time</span>) for a single species to
              branch out into millions and millions of species, and currently the
              leader of it all are humans. So the whole basis of darwinism and
              the evolution theory is that things CHANGE over a long long PERIOD
              OF <span style="color: red;">TIME</span> through a course of
              ‘natural selection’. This is basically the assumption that
              <span style="color: red;">time</span> allows for change through
              natural selection. If you take out <span style="color: red;">time</span> out of this equation, there would not be
              change and no natural selection. How Charles Darwin brought up this
              approximate time of 3.5 billion years was by looking at fossil
              remains deeper and deeper into ground and examining them for age
              and therefore finding at what <span style="color: red;">time</span> would these fossils have been still alive and kicking. How he based
              this <span style="color: red;">time</span> was by the basic
              explanation that for things to be fossilised, it would take
              <span style="color: red;">time</span> and tremendous pressure to
              prevent decomposition. So if <span style="color: red;">time</span> was again taken out of this equation, Darwin’s theory of evolution
              would be completely wrong. Simply because, if things did not take
              alot of time to fossilise, then Darwin’s approximate time of 3.5
              billion years would be wrong and the whole length of time would be
              shortened alot, and that would mean there could not have been
              enough time for evolution to occur. That basic explanation that the
              only way to fossilise something was by<span> </span> time and tremendous pressure was accepted during Darwin’s time, but
              is something that now is considered wrong. For example, a cat or
              dog can be fossilised in 2 or 3 years as long as there is a huge
              amount of pressure and the right conditions, with the exception of
              time. This link shows how it’s possible:</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm">http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm</a>.
              Therefore, Darwinism is false. This proves that as new discoveries
              are made, and new theories are brought up, old theories and beliefs
              have to be removed from the ‘scientific library’, and evolution and
              Darwinism are one of them. <span> </span>For more

              <p>We are still at our infancy in understanding the cosmos. Ur
              faith cant be THAT weak.</p>
              <p>For instance,</p>
              <p>Both Copernicus and Galileo considered themselves to be
              Christians, yet they knew that their beliefs conflicted with the
              official teachings of the church on matters of science. Almost
              everyone today, Christian and non-Christian alike, accepts the
              scientific validity of the theories of Copernicus and Galileo .
              Biblical passages that at one time were interpreted as proving that
              the earth was stationary*Psalms*, or that the sun revolved around
              th earth (i.e, it rose and set)*again in Psalms* were reinterpreted
              by Christians, explaining the language of the Bible as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">figurative rather than
              literal</span>. The problem, Christians began to see, was not with
              science, nor with the Bible, but with improper interpretations of
              the Bible, for example, forcing it to be literal when it should
              have been taken figuratively or phenomenologically (i.e.,
              describing events as they appear from a human perspective, like the
              "rising" of the sun).</p>
              <p>But most scientists who identify themselves as Protestants also
              accept Darwin's theory as foundational to the modern, scientific
              study of biology. Other Christians continue to oppose the theory
              itself, some of whom also reject the idea that the earth is
              billions of years old. We will deal with these two subjects
              separately ... when i have more sit on ass time. hahaha</p>
              <p>Evolution theory does have holes. But these holes like the
              fossils are the missing links. Bear in mind i am summarising it in
              the simplest of language and substance.</p>
              <p>But all these leads to a concept that is called by its
              proponents the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intelligent Design (ID)
              Theory.</span> The most basic summary of ID is that biological
              organisms are so complex that they cannot have developed by chance,
              so they must have had a designer. Although advocates of teaching ID
              in the public school avoid saying so, it is clear that for the vast
              majority of them, that designer is the God of Christianity.</p>
              <p>So much more we dont know, i believe we cant let science or the
              Bible get in the way of each other, but instead, side by side.</p>
              <p>Hope u understand what i mean till this post in all the threads
              recently regarding to the Bible, Science and the possibilities or
              miracles to the explaination of God and Christianity as a

            <div class='col-md body'><p>to Badzmaro: i personally feel that science and religion can come together, but only to a certain extent. and to believe that i come from a monkey and a bird came from a crocodile or whatever is crossing the line.

              <p>Like i said again</p>
              <p>As comprehensive up until to-date, and as
                                          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">scientifically relevant</span>. I am talking science religion, facts to
                                          supernatural phenomenen.</p>
              <p>So quick to decide creationism is a laughing stock.. to the scientific community eh.</p>
              <p>Many Christian scientists including me embrace both their Christian faith and
                  scientific theories of cosmology and evolution. That is, they accept
                  the factual, testable aspects of these theories, but they also
                  acknowledge a real and tangible role for God in the process.</p>
              <p>But sadly, your mind is so closed and narrow you refuse to accept possibilities when you yourself was never 100% certain of the impossibilities that is presented to you in your own journey of life till this point.</p>
              <p>e.g - Einstein's theory of relativity, and quantum mechanics from a theological perspective.</p>
              <p>That science and religion are neither antagonistic nor unrelated to one another but are rather complementary.And also as discussed by leading physicists and theologians regarding the interface between science and religion and finds that the
                  two have much to offer one another in the search for ultimate truths.</p>
              <p>One of the most recent books on the subject is <em>The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief</em>, by Francis Collins, leader of the Human Genome Project, the project that mapped the genes on human chromosomes.</p>
              <p>So unless you totally disbelieve the scientists, pioneers and discoverers, and ultimately, the Bible, feel free to live in your own little world friend.</p>
              <p>Thats all i have to say for today.</p>
