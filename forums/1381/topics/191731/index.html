            <div class='col-md body'>Why should anyone need dramatic reasons to be an athiest? To be frank the pure athiest code is a hard code to believe because it involves having the unshakable conviction that all things are the naturalistic, irrational products of a meaingless event.<br><br>This would mean that all the things we feel like right or wrong, good or bad, love, hate, sadness, happiness are <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing</span> more then just very convincing biochemical processes in our brain... so why do we have to listen to them? Indeed it seems that when I do hold the pure athiestic code, it would actually be very liberating, I could remove all the boundaries of morality and act in whatever way I please. More so, this says that every thought is equally the result of purely natural processes that should not be given any meaning (meaning is an illusion), this means that all thoughts are equally worthless, including atheism itself. It cuts its own throat.<br><br>If I could get away with it I could murder, rape, loot, lie, steal... why not? All things are just arrangements of matter. Nothing is good or bad, the difference is between those who have power and those who have not. Truth is just a personal illusion that we are better off altering to suit our needs.<br><br>Of course this is not easy to do. While it is easy to say that I am a poached egg, it is more important that I believe that I have the same rights as a poached egg. I must disregard other things like eating, drinking, thinking and the like as equally unnatural for myself. It's odd that in holding the creed of athiesm many still fight viciously against the percieved evils and unfairness of religon when they should realize that vicious feelings have no more right then wanting to eat cheese.<br><br>So this is the strange part, if the greatest rejections of God come from the notion that the world is so unfair... where exactly does this feeling of unfairness come from?<br><br>Certainly for it to be valid it must not be found in naturalistic atheism as that just claims that all thought and feelings are not more rational then your liking for cheese. The odd thing is that in appealing to stuff like how religion is evil and unfair one might have argued in part for a God, as much as they don't believe in Him.<br><br>There might be true athiests out there, and indeed these people might live from the weight of one instinct to the next. But I am of the belief that many people who claim to be athiests are actually not whom they say they are.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">Why should anyone need dramatic reasons to be an athiest? To be frank the pure athiest code is a hard code to believe because it involves having the unshakable conviction that all things are the naturalistic, irrational products of a meaingless event.<br><br>This would mean that all the things we feel like right or wrong, good or bad, love, hate, sadness, happiness are <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing</span> more then just very convincing biochemical processes in our brain... so why do we have to listen to them? Indeed it seems that when I do hold the pure athiestic code, it would actually be very liberating, I could remove all the boundaries of morality and act in whatever way I please. More so, this says that every thought is equally the result of purely natural processes that should not be given any meaning (meaning is an illusion), this means that all thoughts are equally worthless, including atheism itself. It cuts its own throat.<br><br>If I could get away with it I could murder, rape, loot, lie, steal... why not? All things are just arrangements of matter. Nothing is good or bad, the difference is between those who have power and those who have not. Truth is just a personal illusion that we are better off altering to suit our needs.<br><br>Of course this is not easy to do. While it is easy to say that I am a poached egg, it is more important that I believe that I have the same rights as a poached egg. I must disregard other things like eating, drinking, thinking and the like as equally unnatural for myself. It's odd that in holding the creed of athiesm many still fight viciously against the percieved evils and unfairness of religon when they should realize that vicious feelings have no more right then wanting to eat cheese.<br><br>So this is the strange part, if the greatest rejections of God come from the notion that the world is so unfair... where exactly does this feeling of unfairness come from?<br><br>Certainly for it to be valid it must not be found in naturalistic atheism as that just claims that all thought and feelings are not more rational then your liking for cheese. The odd thing is that in appealing to stuff like how religion is evil and unfair one might have argued in part for a God, as much as they don't believe in Him.<br><br>There might be true athiests out there, and indeed these people might live from the weight of one instinct to the next. But I am of the belief that many people who claim to be athiests are actually not whom they say they are.<br><br></div></blockquote>I agree with you. It will take an even greater faith to believe in atheism or be an atheist.</div>
