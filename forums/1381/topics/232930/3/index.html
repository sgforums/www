            <div class='col-md body'>there is more to tithing that the modern day church does not want to teach and want to understand. If you want the whole picture, read the Holy Scriptures. What the churches do today is just pick and choose what suits them. This is what I do not like.<br><br>To the TS, what that person did was wrong. No excuses. Its people like him/her that give believers a really bad name.<br><br>I have to agree with SgMac, if you want to join a church, join a proper one that teaches you the right stuff.</div>

So they count upon other tribes who own land for support. It is like Catholic priests today who live on an allowance, typically &lt; $1k a month.<br><br>When the Temple was destroyed, the tithing commandment became void. But this did not stop the Jews from performing acts of charity, called Tzedakah.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/tzedakah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/tzedakah.htm</a><br><br>The Meaning of "Tzedakah"<br><br>"Tzedakah" is the Hebrew word for the acts that we call "charity" in English: giving aid, assistance and money to the poor and needy or to other worthy causes. However, the nature of tzedakah is very different from the idea of charity. The word "charity" suggests benevolence and generosity, a magnanimous act by the wealthy and powerful for the benefit of the poor and needy. The word "tzedakah" is derived from the Hebrew root Tzade-Dalet-Qof, meaning righteousness, justice or fairness. <strong>In Judaism, giving to the poor is not viewed as a generous, magnanimous act; it is simply an act of justice and righteousness, the performance of a duty, giving the poor their due. </strong><br><br>The Obligation of Tzedakah<br><br><strong>Giving to the poor is an obligation in Judaism, a duty that cannot be forsaken even by those who are themselves in need.</strong> Some sages have said that tzedakah is the highest of all commandments, equal to all of them combined, and that a person who does not perform tzedakah is equivalent to an idol worshipper. Tzedakah is one of the three acts that gain us forgiveness from our sins. The High Holiday liturgy states that G-d has inscribed a judgment against all who have sinned, but teshuvah (repentance), tefilah (prayer) and tzedakah can reverse the decree. See Days of Awe.<br><br><strong>According to Jewish law, we are required to give one-tenth of our income to the poor.</strong> This is generally interpreted as one-tenth of our net income after payment of taxes. Those who are dependent on public assistance or living on the edge of subsistence may give less; no person should give so much that he would become a public burden.<br><br>The obligation to perform tzedakah can be fulfilled by giving money to the poor, to health care institutions, to synagogues or to educational institutions. It can also be fulfilled by supporting your children beyond the age when you are legally required to, or supporting your parents in their old age. <strong>The obligation includes giving to both Jews and gentiles; contrary to popular belief, Jews do not just "take care of our own."</strong><br><br></blockquote>xShevchenkox .. amazingly your thinking is very close to God's intention and the Jewish practice!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Definitely there is some element of good in them, and some aspects Mother Church can learn from them. Just that, how much truth you want to accept and bear, that's all.</div>

Do they keep the law of Hashem? These are your starting points...<br><br>Then you can go on to do they also not keep festivals like easter and christmas which are pagan and thus practice idolatry...</div>
