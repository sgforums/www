Just giving some traces. BTW I am not too sure if the highest mountain actually referred to Mount Everest , it could be the highest mountain in another continent. I am also not too sure if the area around Mount Everest was populated at that time or not. But from the way it seems, even <strong>seabirds</strong> could die and get buried together.

              <p>okay, so one possible reason that animal remains (i don't remember reading about any human remains found in such places, though they may just be indistinguishable from animal remains) were found in high places was that there was a flood that covered the highest peaks of the highest mountains, as the animals would naturally congregate to dryer areas, and would die there when the dryer areas disappear. however, think about it, if all the dry areas disappear, the animals would drown, decompose, and their remains become gassy and FLOAT uniformly throughout the world? it is entirely possible, seeing how messages in bottles are able to cross oceans. so doesn't that mean that animal remains, regardless of location, should be able to be found always at a specific depth below ground level? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one other possible reason, aside from a flood, that animal remains are found thousands of feet above sea level may be due to the movement of tectonic plates. if you took secondary school geography, you would see that when 2 plates collide, one is pushed down, and the other pushed UP, and any fossils stuck in the plate going up would be pushed up as well. that's how mountains are formed anyway. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one last thing, what is the height of our beloved Bukit Timah Hill? wiki says 164 m. think about it, even if all the waters in the world were to flood, it won't even cover a third of the height of our little hill. how would it cover the rest of the world? </p>

              <p>there were many prophesies about the coming of Jesus. all came thru thru the birth of Jesus. this is the fact about omniscience.</p>
              <p>God gave people a choice to how they wanted to live. but people turned away from Him so he used the flood as a warning. God knows but He gives us the liberty to choose. so whatever you do now, affects your destiny in future which is in God's hands.</p>
              <p>You haven't seen God create something He can't lift so you are in no grounds to judge that. and duhh. he won't do such things for he is an all powerful God able to do all things. Like echo said, no logic and science can explain God and its easy to twist words which were not implied in that manner like for example, the verse on if the right eye cause you to sin, gauge it out and throw it away. You don't literally do that. The omnipotence of God was meant simply that he is able to deliver you from any situation if you have the right heart and faith to believe.</p>

              <p>Umm... Jesus did not fulfill all the "requirements" for a Messiah.Stuff he didn't do:</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">A. Build the Third 
                  Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28).</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">B. Gather all Jews back
                   to the Land of Israel (Isaiah
                  43:5-6).</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">C. Usher in an era of 
                  world peace, and end all
                  hatred, oppression, suffering and disease. As it says: "Nation shall not
                  lift up sword against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore." 
                  (Isaiah
                  2:4)</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">D. Spread universal 
                  knowledge of the God of Israel,
                  which will unite humanity as one. As it says: "God will be King over all
                   the
                  world—on that day, God will be One and His Name will be One" (Zechariah
                  14:9).</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">E. Messiah must be descended on his father’s side
                  from King David (see Genesis 49:10 and Isaiah 11:1). According to the
                  Christian claim that Jesus was the product of a virgin birth, he had no
                  father—and thus could not have possibly fulfilled the messianic
                  requirement of being descended on his father’s side from King David.</p>
              <p>F. The Messiah will lead 
                  the Jewish people to full Torah
                  observance. The Torah states that all mitzvot (commandments) remain 
                  binding forever, and
                  anyone coming to change the Torah is immediately identified as a false
                  prophet. (Deut. 13:1-4). Throughout the New 
                  Testament, Jesus contradicts the
                  Torah and states that its commandments are no longer applicable.</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">Taken from a Jewish argument, and as you should know the bible's Old Testament is their Holy Book.</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">The idea of omniscience is a very interesting one, as, if God knows everything, God already knows the choices we are going to make, which means we do not have the freedom to make our own choices, as we are just supposedly fulfilling our destiny, or just writing the story to which God already knows the ending. Which may imply that we do not free choice.</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">Also, if God knows everything, he also knows the decisions he is going to make, and also that he is unable to change them. This shows that he is not able to change everything, which implies that he is not omnipotent.</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">That's the thing, isn't it? Freedom of choice. Yet when you choose not to worship him/her, he/she comes down and kills you and the whole lot? That doesn't sound like a very nice God, as opposed to what you mentioned in the other thread that God is kind and loving.</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">And during the times of the World Wars where murder and sin is rampant, he/she does absolutely nothing. Unless of course you claim that God gave the US the A-bomb, which is impossible to prove.</p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="ArticleText" style="text-align: left;">This is something called the Omnipotence Paradox, feel free to take a look. The train of thought goes like this:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Either God can create a stone which he cannot lift, or he cannot 
                  create a stone which he cannot lift.</li>
              <li>If God can create a stone which he cannot lift, then he is not 
                  omnipotent (since he cannot lift the stone in question).</li>
              <li>If God cannot create a stone which he cannot lift, then he is not 
                  omnipotent (since he cannot create the stone in question).</li>
              <li>Therefore God is not omnipotent.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Of course I understand that this is a just something like a trick question, and I replied this as a joke to one of the things God is unable to do, if you look up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You said: The omnipotence of God
                                          was meant simply that he is able to deliver you 
                  from any situation
                                          if you have the right heart and faith to 
                  believe.</p>
              <p>This implies that God is not absolutely omnipotent, but omnipotent under certain circumstances, which goes against what you yourself have been saying.</p>
