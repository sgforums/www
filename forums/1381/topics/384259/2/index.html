              <p>Ah well, since I posted I might as well reply to this. Let me try to make this as clear as possible. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason Judaism does not accept Jesus Christ as the Messiah (whom as you should know is Jewish, JC is not Christian) is because he supposedly did not fulfill the prophesies that signified him to be the Messiah. These prophesies were in the Old Testament. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was during the New Testament, the time when Jesus was around, that Jesus said he will be coming around another time. However, the Old Testament makes no mention of the Messiah coming around a second time and just says that the Messiah will make all the prophesies come true when he arrives on Earth. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is why I keep saying Old Testament. Do you not need the Old Testament to verify the reliability of the New Testament?</p>

              <p>Question is. if christianity stems from the belief in Judaism that a Messiah will come to save everyone, and if nothing in Torah points to the description of jesus, isnt christianity considered a false religion?</p>

              <p>I think I will convert to Judaism if Christianity is proven false.</p>
              <p>Why not islam?</p>
              <p>Please don't listen to the crap made by those muslims who say that Jews and christians worship the same God as them. No. It is different. If you look through historical texts, Allah was actually one of the 365 gods which the tribe Muhammad lived in worshipped one each everyday. I do not know what were his reasons, but he CLAIMED that Allah was the distorted God of Judaism and Christianity. What crap is that. And are you sure Muhammad was foretold and prophesized? As a prophet, he was supposed to lead a saintly life, but from the sources I read from, he actually <strong>had sex</strong> with 6 and 9 nine year olds. Also, the Koran also states to kill and strike off the heads of unbelievers.(wtf?)</p>
              <p>The God of Islam is a totally different God from the Judeo-Christian God. Not only that, Moses was also confused to have been living at the time of the great flood.</p>

              <p>I am uncertain as to the origin of Allah, but the Muslims believe that Allah is the same god as the one who created Aadam and Hawwa (Adam and Eve). They also believe that Isa foretold the coming Mohammad, just as the Prophet Yahya (John the Baptist) foretold the coming of Jesus. I am not sure where it is mentioned though, as I haven't quite read the Quran yet. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I'm also not sure about the having sex part, but I know he supposedly married his favourite wife, Aisha bint Abu Bakr, at an age of 7. However, this is probably quite common during that time, as her father was the one that introduced Mohammad to his daughter. Mohammad then waited a few years before consummating the marriage. Don't forget that the traditional Chinese and Indians also matchmade their children at a very young age. </p>

              <p>ALRIGHT, I am not well-versed in the bible.  So .. when God told Noah to find 2 of every animals, his intention was for those animals to breed again once the flood ended? OK:<br><br>1. Does that mean the rest of the animals that weren't on the ark died with the flood? Wow, God is an ass.<br>2. Seeing there are only two of every species of animals, the cat I am holding now comes from a generation of inbleeders?  Ewww.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>So God did cover all of the animals. Some animals weren't inbreeders (not inbleeders) but some are, I suppose. Then again, as of 2007, there are ~1.25 million fauna species on Earth, and they are increasing every day. So just assuming that all of them are <strong>un</strong>clean, Noah would already have to take 2.5 million specimens on board? o.O With enough food and clean water for 150+ days...</p>

              <p>Genesis 7:2 </p>
              <p>Of every clean beast, you shall take seven pairs, male and
              female; and of beast that not clean by twos, the male and his
              female. </p>

              <p>So God did cover all of the animals. Some animals weren't
              inbreeders (not inbleeders) but some are, I suppose. Then again, as
              of 2007, there are ~1.25 million fauna species on Earth, and they
              are increasing every day. So just assuming that all of them are
              <strong>un</strong>clean, Noah would already have to take 2.5
              million specimens on board? o.O With enough food and clean water
              for 150+ days...</p>
