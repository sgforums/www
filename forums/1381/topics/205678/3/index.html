I'm quite surprised at such weird replies by you actually, but anyway.<br><br>I sense you have a problem with tithing, then you cannot expect an organisation to function on sunlight and fresh air. But tithing is excessive and members are forced to tithe excessively it's a different thing. If you're against churches because of the act of tithing itself then I got nothing to say.<br><br>$50 may seem a lot to you but this is really depdendant on person. If you're a working adult that draws $2500 a mth, $50 a week is $200 over 4 wks. Some months have 5 weekends so maybe it's $250. Which basically is 10% of the salary. It may seem a lot to a student but to a working adult the same $50 holds a different value.<br><br>Also, some people are born rich, students who have no qualms spending $250 for the weekend, so what is $50? This is dependant on individual. But I don't believe in giving beyond your means. And I certainly don't agree with giving all your money to the church and expect God to give you back the money 10 fold. That's not how it works.<br><br>And it's wrong to assume excessive tithing happens in many churches just because you witness it in one church. Simply wrong. If you can't see this simple logic then too bad.<br><br>Putting aside the idea whether $50 is a lot or not, I'm not saying excessive tithing does not occur. But to say it happens in all churches because of an isolated example is plain wrong.<br><br>I myself do not agree with excessive tithing, but opposing the process/act of tithing itself is a different thing altogether.<br><br>Hope the non-Christians can seperate between the two. Buddhists make donations to the temples they worship at as well and any organisation needs funds to run and operate. But when the funds are used lavishly and extravagently then it's a different thing. Remember the Gold rimmed taps?</div>
