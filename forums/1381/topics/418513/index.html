              <p>Do you, fellow christian pray often to God? Are you disappointed when sometimes God does not seem to answer your prayers? I will encourage you to continue praying, even when God does not seem to answer prayers the way you want to?</p>
              <p>Let me share a personal experience of mine with you.</p>
              <p>I once had a toothache. I was afraid to go to the dentist, so I prayed for God to heal me miraculously. Well, the toothache worsen and I did go to the dentist. That day, while I was surfing online, I clicked onto a picture and it was a picture of Jesus guiding the dentist's hand to operate a person's tooth.</p>
              <p>God spoke to me. God had answered my prayer. He had healed me. He had healed me through a dentist. And that was His answer to my prayer.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, in christian life, what we wanted may differ from what God had intended for us. Netherless, do not give up on prayers, because sometimes, just through prayers, you may be changed by God.</p>
              <p>In my case, I realise that science had a role to play in God's plan and God can heal us through dentists, doctors and scientific inventions.</p>

              what i would like to say is i think that God doesn't neccesarily ANSWERS ur prayers according to what you want /think is right. but what HE wants/think is right. and as always God is always right. The Most important thing about prayer is that you have to ask God for something u either:
              
              1) truly need
              2) seriously want 
              
              and not
              
              1) something negative that would hurt you or others
              2) something selfish.
              
              i always pray that 'if it be God's Will, it shall be done, if not then i know that he would provide for me what he knows is best for me. even if It's not neccesarily what i want or asked for'.
              
              One very strong instance which i really was struck by was when i was returning to Singapore from UK on a plane, and there was alot of turbulence and i kept feeling my stomach grumbling and i was going to vomit anytime, (maybe even multiple times). i prayed this exact prayer (I know it sounds like blackmail, i was young then!)
              
              "Dear Lord, If you are Really there, please help me to not vomit on this flight, and i promise to be faithful "
              
              and the whole feeling as if something is going up ur throat (i was seconds away from vommiting) totally disappeared and i could literally feel everything going back into my stomache, i swear it was freaky but i was very amazed and touched at that event. 
              
              I know this sounds like a really small thing but i think small events that change drastically are also ways for God to show that He is truly there and that He loves us.
              
              Praise the Lord!
              and Merry Christmas [:

              <p>Sure or not. If it is true, I will help you to advertise and those countries like Australia which is experiencing flood will ask you to fly over to their country to pray for the rain to stop. What a joke?</p>

              <p>Do you, fellow christian pray often to God? Are you disappointed when sometimes God does not seem to answer your prayers? I will encourage you to continue praying, even when God does not seem to answer prayers the way you want to?</p>
              <p>Let me share a personal experience of mine with you.</p>
              <p>I once had a toothache. I was afraid to go to the dentist, so I prayed for God to heal me miraculously. Well, the toothache worsen and I did go to the dentist. That day, while I was surfing online, I clicked onto a picture and it was a picture of Jesus guiding the dentist's hand to operate a person's tooth.</p>
              <p>God spoke to me. God had answered my prayer. He had healed me. He had healed me through a dentist. And that was His answer to my prayer.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, in christian life, what we wanted may differ from what God had intended for us. Netherless, do not give up on prayers, because sometimes, just through prayers, you may be changed by God.</p>
              <p>In my case, I realise that science had a role to play in God's plan and God can heal us through dentists, doctors and scientific inventions.</p>

              <p>Amen, an inspiring man after God's own heart.</p>
              <p>Francis is someone who was born rich and powerful, but heard and heeded the call to serve the poor. He surrendered his rights to the family fortune along with all his wealth, honours and privileges to better serve them. Even when he met lepers who were shunned because of their contagious disease, he readily embraced them. Along with the order of Franciscan friars that he founded, they nursed and bathed the lepers, beginning the Franciscan tradition of special attention to the poor and outcast.</p>
              <p>He and his friars touched so many lives that the city of San Francisco is named after Francis of Assisi to honour the work that he did out of love for others.</p>
              <p>Truly amazing :)</p>
