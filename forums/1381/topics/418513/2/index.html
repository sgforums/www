              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Albert Einstein witnessed how the Catholic Church, led by Pope Pius XII, stood up to the moral <em>Blitzkrieg</em> of the Hitler and the Nazis. In his essay "Einstein and God", Thomas F. Torrance relates how the famous German scientist, a Jew who as a child was instructed in the Bible and Talmud, came to a great appreciation of the Church during World War II. In a letter to an American Episcopal bishop, Einstein wrote:<br><br>"Being a lover of freedom . . . I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but, no, the universities immediately were silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone by had proclaimed their love of freedom, but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks.<br><br>"Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler’s campaign for suppressing the truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly."<br><br>One of Einstein’s colleagues at Princeton, Max Jammer, wrote in his 1955 book, <em>Einstein and Religion</em>, that Einstein’s understanding of physics and religion were bound profoundly together. It seemed to Einstein, said Jammer, that nature exhibited traces of God like "a natural theology." Einstein spoke of God so frequently, Jammer wrote, that another scientist friend, Friedrich Durrenmatt, said, "Einstein used to speak of God so often that I almost looked upon him as a disguised theologian."<br><br>Here is a snippet from a 1929 interview in <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em>:<br><br><em>Post</em>: "To what extent are you influenced by Christianity?"<br><br>Einstein: "As a child I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.". . .<br><br><em>Post</em>: "You accept the historical Jesus?"<br><br>Einstein: "Unquestionably! No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life" (<em>Saturday Evening Post</em>, October 26, 1929). <br></strong></span></p>

              <p>This is getting really pathetic.</p>
              <p>A friendly piece of advice - go seek some medical help as soon as you can. Most psychological conditions can be treated, if I'm not mistaken. Good luck and God bless!</p>
