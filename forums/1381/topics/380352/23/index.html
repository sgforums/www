              <p>i don't think "science" itself is "created"... it comes from the latin word "scientia" which means knowledge. i think science, itself, is a means, and not the end to all "secrets"</p>
              <p>folks have known to use science to fake things, eg, the Korean scientists who faked the cloning thing, no different from religious folks faking things too.</p>
              <p>on the flip side, people are also using scientific experiments to prove God exist.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #666666;"> The entire Old Testament sacrificial system was a foreshadowing of
              the atonement and cleansing power of Jesus. The many offerings were
              preparation for the One Offering that would finally atone for the
              "sins of the world." Just as the animals presented had to be,
              without exception, spotless, the ones offering them needed to
              demonstrate some kind of "blemishless purity" as well. When God
              established this law, He was forever engraving in the minds of His
              people the need for absolute purity where atonement was concerned.
              Only the Perfect Man could atone for the sins of all men

              <p>God's moral and ceremonial laws were given to help people love God with all their hearts and minds. Throughout Israel's history, however, these laws had been often misquoted and misapplied. By Jesus's time, religious leaders had turned the laws into a confusing masses of rules. When Jesus talked about a new way to understand God's law, he was actually trying to bring people back to its original purpose. Jesus did not speak against the law itself, but against the abuses and excesses to which it had been subjected. </p>
              <p>If you don't understand why Jesus do it, see John 1:17. Hopefully, my typing all these helps you.</p>
