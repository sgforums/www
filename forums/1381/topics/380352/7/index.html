              <p>i will still post a photo of people who didnt want to attend the
              church. u will see what i meant. but i know, u will still defend ur
              statement. maybe u are the one who is listening to what christians
              are saying about missionaries. I know that not all missionaries are
              like that, just saying most of them are. minorities of them are
              true about providing them a better life, thats for a cause.</p>

              <p>Ya? We are still waiting for that 1 photo you have....</p>
              <p>And yes, you start to acknowledge that there are missionaries that are "true about providing them a better life" only that you refused to acknowledge that they are the majority and not minority.</p>
              <p>Yes, there may be minority that may have done something not right but most will not.</p>
              <p>And what you said about using food to exchange for their beliefs in God is complete nonsense and something that you cannot even prove till now.....except that you have ONE photo from ONE Singapore friend in Africa....which we have yet to see.</p>
              <p>Everything you believed are based on ONE Singaporean friend in Africa and you choose to ignore all others including people here.....and yet you claimed that you are not in self denial?</p>
              <p>You don't even need to go to Africa and right here in Singapore, you can see what is happening and what the Church is doing. You may not know because you are either never a Christian before or you simply mixed with the wrong people....</p>
              <p>I told you in earlier post of what is happening and you can see it with your own eyes (if you want to) and not need to rely on any photos....and you can even talk to people who are receiving those help.</p>
              <p>Also Churches are also reaching out to migrant workers and help those who are in need.....</p>
              <p>Your purpose is simply to say ALL Christians are bad because of what your ONE friend said. </p>
              <p>If truth is what your are seeking, you can easily do so.....but will you?</p>
