              First God is always personal. I read what God has done to the ancient people from the bible. I read what God has done through the good testimonial books that's currently in print today. But I know what God has done for me in my life. Like I said God is always personal.<br><br>
              Anyway you sound as if you had been hurt bad in life. Anyway people who believe in God even chosen must also work hard to bring food to their table. You think people who believe in God have the luxury of doing nothing and getting everything?<br><br>

              <p><br>Ah, but man kind can already do that.</p>
              <p>Genetic modification of foods increases supply and nutritional value for years to come, the haber process for producing ammonia for fertillizer creates 33% of the world's food. Bioengineering and hydroponics means we can grow food without soil.</p>
              <p>As for water, we can take it out of air, out of rocks, out of seawater, and given pure hydrogen gas (most abundant element in the universe) and oxygen gas, we could make our own water as well.</p>
              <p>But then, man has come to the brink of becoming gods ourselves.</p>
              <p>Nuclear Fusion.</p>
              <p>The science of creating another sun. Man will create his own sun to harvest its almost limitless energy to be able to build anything possible. Fueled by the most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen, and producing almost no waste products, electricity will be almost free for millions of years.</p>
              <p>It is actually possible for man to create his own ecosystem.</p>

              Lol mankind has never created anything out of thin air.<br><br> Genetic modification is just that genetic MODIFICATION, Take water out of thin air? lol if the water were already there lol or its component were there.<br><br>
                                                  
              Man has come to the brink of becoming God? You got to be kidding right??! We don't even have a flying engine for example(all we got is a wing design that enable sailing in the air while the engine simply pushes forward) and the whole world technologies are still being too dependent on animal extract that's called oil simply due to the fact that it's flammable.
                                                  
                                                  <br><br>
              Nuclear fusion if it's so advanced why is it not used to replace oil as energy source for most utilities? Our nuclear plant is so BIG and dangerous(risky) that the only place it could be built is a well monitored government run facilities such as lab or giant power plant. And we are talking even after almost 70 years into research the most that man could do is to make it small enough to fit a submarine or to put it accurately to make the submarine big enough to accommodate the reactor.
                                                  
                                                  <br><br>
              And about space technologies. The Fuel tank is bigger than the spaceship. LOL. How efficient. With fuel rocket the spaceship won't go anywhere aside from earth orbits and moon probably mars too but after a long long time so it is not worth the journey.
              Leaving the planet? I would say mankind would destroy itself first before being able to evacuate the population from fatal global threat.
                                                  
                                                  <br><br>
              Today's mankind society is primitive. Many of the elite leaders are only mainly concerned about themselves and think they are above everything. Paranoid, repressive, irrational and unreasonable these elites are that holding on to power is their main concern. If you would judge mankind with its leaders then you would find it to be a primal primitive being largely selfishly following its desires without regard to other people well being.
              Sure we have great ideals and philosophies such as human rights, democracy, rule of law but the practice of these are doubtful and often violated or put as a simple masquerade. 
                                                  <br><br>
              And what is keeping the global peace is the number of nuclear warheads and armies that the owner of hegemony has. Even Countries need to feel intimidated before being approachable. Hardly advanced in civilization and thinking if the leaders try to intimidate its people and each nation tries to intimidate the others.
                                                  <br><br>
              Mankind will either destroy the planet or destroy each other before it could leave the galaxy. Why? Because sole intellectual development when not coupled with moral development will only bring destruction to mankind.

               Funny thing is that criminal acts perpetrated by a political figure in power is termed political instead of merely being a criminal case. Been too long murderers, cheaters, liars are masqueraded as noble people.

              <p>Lol mankind has never created anything out of thin air.<br><br>Genetic modification is just that genetic MODIFICATION, Take water out of thin air? lol if the water were already there lol or its component were there.<br><br>Man has come to the brink of becoming God? You got to be kidding right??! We don't even have a flying engine for example(all we got is a wing design that enable sailing in the air while the engine simply pushes forward) and the whole world technologies are still being too dependent on animal extract that's called oil simply due to the fact that it's flammable.<br><br>Nuclear fusion if it's so advanced why is it not used to replace oil as energy source for most utilities? Our nuclear plant is so BIG and dangerous(risky) that the only place it could be built is a well monitored government run facilities such as lab or giant power plant. And we are talking even after almost 70 years into research the most that man could do is to make it small enough to fit a submarine or to put it accurately to make the submarine big enough to accommodate the reactor.<br><br>And about space technologies. The Fuel tank is bigger than the spaceship. LOL. How efficient. With fuel rocket the spaceship won't go anywhere aside from earth orbits and moon probably mars too but after a long long time so it is not worth the journey. Leaving the planet? I would say mankind would destroy itself first before being able to evacuate the population from fatal global threat.<br><br>Today's mankind society is primitive. Many of the elite leaders are only mainly concerned about themselves and think they are above everything. Paranoid, repressive, irrational and unreasonable these elites are that holding on to power is their main concern. If you would judge mankind with its leaders then you would find it to be a primal primitive being largely selfishly following its desires without regard to other people well being. Sure we have great ideals and philosophies such as human rights, democracy, rule of law but the practice of these are doubtful and often violated or put as a simple masquerade.<br><br>And what is keeping the global peace is the number of nuclear warheads and armies that the owner of hegemony has. Even Countries need to feel intimidated before being approachable. Hardly advanced in civilization and thinking if the leaders try to intimidate its people and each nation tries to intimidate the others.<br><br>Mankind will either destroy the planet or destroy each other before it could leave the galaxy. Why? Because sole intellectual development when not coupled with moral development will only bring destruction to mankind.</p>

              <p>Its a matter of time really. Scientific advance is so fast nowadays, with nanotechnology, stem cells, quantum physics. Oh and you remember the large hadron collider built by CERN? It's going to find the God particle, that proves the big bang. Goodbye god.</p>

              <p>Yes, science itself cannot detroy the earth, it is human that is using science to destroy the earth. Wonder why everyone is talking about eating organic food, going green and saving mother earth?</p>
              <p>Science plus people with no proper moral guidiance will destroy the earth that God has created and entrusted to human. Oops...maybe one day science will find that "particle" one day soon......we'll wait for that to happen in "full confidence".</p>

              And we don't need you to convince otherwise. If you think there's such thing as moral then there must be such thing as evil and good and the moral rule upon which they are measured then there must be the giver of the moral law.<br><br>
              However there's no obligation to worship and to follow God. That is certain. Men are free to decide whatever he wishes to decide. That's free not to put their faith and worship God or to put their faith in God. No man can tell otherwise.

              <p>Ironically the christians swear by the infallibility of the bible, yet now they say that the Old Testament should be disregarded? They claim that the violence propagated in it was due to reasons like the prevalence of violent culture at that time, that Jesus came to share new things, etc. Does this mean that "God" changes with the times?</p>
