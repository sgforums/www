                  <p>Thank for your insight.  But in 2King 16, by the time Ahaz sought the help of Assyrian king, he had already been defeated by the alliance of Pekah and Rezin.  Further more god's promise of destruction of Israel in less than 65 years is not really relevant because Ahaz reigned for only 16 years</p><p>In fact in Isaiah 7.7 god assured Ahaz that the attack the by alliance would not happen</p>

              <p>Of course your holy book is real, just like you and me. But is

              <p>It is not that Christians claim it is so it must be. Muslims
              also have their holy book directly dictated to Mohammad, which is
              more superior than just being inspired, yet the two book do not
              really tell the same fairy tales. So what say you? Which is

              <p>You said simple English also cannot understand and I even give you multiple choices which you cannot choose an answer ..... It seems you cannot even understand what you post yourself... so you should know how dumb you are by now and you are telling me that you are worst than that by the day......with your post.</p>
