              <p>actually we can see it in two ways....</p>
              <p>1. Biblical speaking - which all Christian theology is based upon, yes non-believers will go to hell after they die if they did not accept Jesus Christ as saviour</p>
              <p>2. Factually - no one can prove it if you take the Bible out of the equation.</p>
              <p>your 2nd question:</p>
              <p>It depends - some will see other religions as a manifestation of satan, others will treat these religions with respect.... i happen to fall into the 2nd category.</p>

              <p>that explains why some christians tell non believers that they are going to hell and their religions are satanic. imagine you are of other faiths and someone telling you are going to hell and your religion is satanic.</p>

The Bible is God's letter to humanity collected into 66 books written by 40 divinely inspired writers over a period of over 1,600 years. The claim of divine inspiration may seem dramatic (or unrealistic to some), but a careful and honest study of the biblical scriptures will show them to be true.

An astonishing 668 prophecies have been fulfilled and none have ever been proven false (three are unconfirmed). God decided to use prophecy as His primary test of divine authorship, and an honest study of biblical prophecy will compellingly show the supernatural origin of the Bible. Skeptics must ask themselves, "Would the gambling industry even exist if people could really tell the future?" Again, no other holy book comes even close to the Bible in the amount of evidence supporting its credibility, authenticity and divine authorship.</span></p>
