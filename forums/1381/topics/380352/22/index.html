              <p>Well I wouldn't know what you're looking for. Anyway here's a quote:</p>
              <p>And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was 
              exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians. 
              -- <a href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/2chr/16.html#12">2 Chronicles 16:12</a></p>
              <p>It clearly distinguishes god from medical science, so why do christians even bother visting doctors?</p>

Physicians were meant to heal and for me at least, sent from God. I'm not saying they are idols, but just like scientists, etc., they were sent here for a reason (a tool from God). Physicians (at least in Canada) no longer have the Hippocratic Oath and it has been changed to the Code of Ethics! Talk to most doctors and they'll tell you they've seen one miracle after another. I've worked for a number of doctors and over 1/2 of them have said they have given their patient little hope of coming through surgery or, they will have brain damage, lose a limb, etc., yet these patients made a liar out of the surgeon and survived just fine. Yes, I believe in intervention.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 12px; padding: 0px;">We ask ourselves why a child is born blind or has other maladies, but I feel God sends us special people to make us change who WE are. I saw a program where a young man was not only blind, but in a world of his own. He did sculpting and then bronzed it. He has never seen ANYTHING in his life, but the work he did with his hands so quickly was a true miracle. It gave him peace and joy and that was transferred onto many others around the world. His artwork is sold around the world. Many people have lost children to car accidents or even murder and after the shock and grief is over they not only move on the best they can, but change laws for the better and start up programs to let the criminals know they aren't going to get away with this behavior any longer. Having been mentally/physically abused by my first husband I have volunteered a lot of my time to help other women in an Abuse Center. On and on it goes.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 12px; padding: 0px;">Does prayer help? You bet it does! I've seen miracles upon miracles. Whether we come out the other end with no limbs or any other malady we can choose to feel sorry for ourselves or pass on our knowledge to help others. Just like this Wiki Board many of us are all trying to give our opinions to help others and perhaps without knowing it we truly are helping someone that may be at their wits end or terrified over something or contemplating suicide. For those that believe in God we are the tools of God. Really think about it!</p>

              <p>The words say the blind/ deformed child was sent by god, but this passage implies that god hates them.</p>
              <p>"Whosoever ... hath any blemish, <em>let him not approach to offer 
              the bread of his God</em>. For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach:

                  that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, Or crookbackt, or a
                  dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; No man that hath a
                  blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath 
                  a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. ... Only he shall not go
                  in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish;

              <p>Aleast know something about the bible before you complain.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; color: #666666;">The entire Old Testament sacrificial system was a foreshadowing of the atonement and cleansing power of Jesus. The many offerings were preparation for the One Offering that would finally atone for the "sins of the world." Just as the animals presented had to be, without exception, spotless, the ones offering them needed to demonstrate some kind of "blemishless purity" as well. When God established this law, He was forever engraving in the minds of His people the need for absolute purity where atonement was concerned. Only the Perfect Man could atone for the sins of all men everywhere.<br></span></p>

              <p><br> actually wiki is NOT 100% accurate. it is, at best, a source of

              <p>Aleast know something about the bible before you complain.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #666666;"> The entire Old Testament sacrificial system was a foreshadowing of
              the atonement and cleansing power of Jesus. The many offerings were
              preparation for the One Offering that would finally atone for the
              "sins of the world." Just as the animals presented had to be,
              without exception, spotless, the ones offering them needed to
              demonstrate some kind of "blemishless purity" as well. When God
              established this law, He was forever engraving in the minds of His
              people the need for absolute purity where atonement was concerned.
              Only the Perfect Man could atone for the sins of all men
              everywhere.<br></span></p>
