              <p>U nv think. do u think a christian would admit that what his or
                  her purpose was after becoming a christian. Yes, there are some
                  with initial purposes and thats to feed the poor, well, after that
                  they would have gone into another purpose and thats to lure them
                  into a believe that they do not want to. My friend has become a
                  non-christian already, so, he would tell me everything he knew. his
                  parents had already worked with almost all the missionaries
                  stationed in Africa. He said he took a photo of what the pastor did
                  when he knew 1 of them did not want to attend church. i will post a
                  photo sometime this week since he is not able to use the com
                  everyday.</p>

              <p>If they are giving out food in the Church, how can one get them without going to the Church?</p>
              <p>I am not sure if they deliver food to those who for some reason cannot come to the Church, like sick or handicapped etc...They may not due to the lack of manpower..</p>
              <p>We don't have to go very far as my Church is giving rations every end of the month to needy people in the neighbourhood....they come to the Church, have lunch and collect their ration and go home - no need to listen to any Bible story or preaching...</p>
              <p>And it does not matter what faith you are.....the only requirement is that you need the ration. Yes, the Church have ministry that visit the neighbourhood and seek out those who need help and help them......not preach to them.</p>
              <p>If they want to know why the Church is helping them, then we will share with them that it is God that loves them and the Church is simply doing God's will be loving our neighbour....if they want to become Christians, they are most welcomed..If they don't wnat to, it's ok...</p>
              <p>So I know what you are saying hold no truth. You only based what you said on 1 non-Christain family ignoring many others....</p>

              <p>If they are giving out food in the Church, how can one get them
              without going to the Church?</p>
              <p>I am not sure if they deliver food to those who for some reason
              cannot come to the Church, like sick or handicapped etc...They may
              not due to the lack of manpower..</p>
              <p>We don't have to go very far as my Church is giving rations
              every end of the month to needy people in the neighbourhood....they
              come to the Church, have lunch and collect their ration and go home
              - no need to listen to any Bible story or preaching...</p>
              <p>And it does not matter what faith you are.....the only
              requirement is that you need the ration. Yes, the Church have
              ministry that visit the neighbourhood and seek out those who need
              help and help them......not preach to them.</p>
              <p>If they want to know why the Church is helping them, then we
              will share with them that it is God that loves them and the Church
              is simply doing God's will be loving our neighbour....if they want
              to become Christians, they are most welcomed..If they don't wnat
              to, it's ok...</p>
              <p>So I know what you are saying hold no truth. You only based what
              you said on 1 non-Christain family ignoring many others....</p>
