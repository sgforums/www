              <p>The theory that religion and its resultant effects on human society is a creation of civilization and people itself is a pretty solid theory written by Peter Berger, a Catholic Minister who most definitely believes in God. How could you call the work of a learned Christian sociologist mere baseless allegations?</p>

              <p>Are you refering the the high energy particle research that may accidentally create a black hole and swallow up the earth?  Well, they are cosmic radiations zapping around this little rock we called earth probably since the Big Bang with energy many time above the highest energy achievable by the still half limping LHC . So I think that is something we need not be too worry about</p>
              <p>Or are you worry about the consequence of  breaking into the ultimate inner sanctum of our most holey creator (spying of him taking a shower?).  Not to worry here too.  Judging by the number of fans he has on on this little rock, someone/s will most probably SMS him to warn him beforehand</p>
              <p>Or do you mean the biological reproductive research? I fully agree that we should not venture in there, lest someone will be unemployed.</p>

              <p>I am familiar with your poorly-elucidated argument. To tell me
                  to simply "experience" it? I've done it before, and I've
                  categorically rejected it because your "faith" is built on
                  historical untruths and the Vatican's lust and hunger for power to
                  control the peasantry of Christendom with religion.</p>

              <p>If one could left the Lord after experiencing, this shows that you are lying and you have NOT even experience it yet. My faith is built on my own experience and I will not waver like you.</p>

              accidentally create a black hole and swallow up the earth? 
              Well, they are cosmic radiations zapping around this little rock we
              called earth probably since the Big Bang with energy many time
              above the highest energy achievable by the still half limping LHC .

              <p>Or are you worry about the consequence of  breaking into
              the ultimate inner sanctum of our most holey creator (spying of him
              taking a shower?).  Not to worry here too.  Judging by
              the number of fans he has on on this little rock, someone/s will
              most probably SMS him to warn him beforehand</p>
              <p>Or do you mean the biological reproductive research? I fully
              agree that we should not venture in there, lest someone will be

                                One of the largest failures of the church was trying to challenge
                                science. Esp when they argued that the Earth was the centre of the
                                universe and tried to arrest and imprison dissidents, in the end we

              You mean people have been abusing religion. Science is not religion and religion is not science. One cannot triumph over another they are different fields. People need to differentiate between having faith as a believer as a personal matter with organized religion which many times are abused.
