              This proves nothing special about Christianity.
              
              Steven Weinberg, Nobel Laureate in physics put it succinctly in one of his public speeches (if you are intersted, I am sure I can dig it out): 
              
              "...With or without it, you'd have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do bad things, it takes religion."
              
              Think of the mass killing of American Indians by conquistadors for the reason "so that the souls are saved"
              
              And don't forget the crusade campaigns (which ironically cleansed the holy land of Christians) and the gory conquer of canan by Joshua

              <p>If it is fake, then it cannot be proven real later.....and if it
                  is real, it cannot be proven as fake later......Can a fake LV
                  somehow become real later or vice versa?</p>
              <p>If it is "fake now" and maybe "real later"....it simply means -
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You are</strong> <strong>not sure....</strong></span></p>
              <p>If you insist that the bible is fake, then it is fair that we
                  asked you to proved why it is fake since it must have been proven
                  to you that it is fake....otherwsie you won't say it is fake right?
                  And from what you have written, I conclude that you are unsure if
                  Bible is real or fake which is additional reasons why it is fair I
                  ask you to prove your case....</p>
              <p>I even give you multiple choice answers liao ......</p>
              <p>Can you be more coherent or not?</p>

              <p>Can u prove that its real? 100% not. i dont expect any1 to believe my "claims". And ur examples are really ridiculous. And yes, i insist the bible is fake untill i have hard prove. I dont expect people to believe my "claims" but u expect people to believe ur claims because "God said so". And i guess christianity has made u too dumb to understand simple english.<br><br>I elaborated many many times, i expect u to understand. Just like the fact that some people claim that bigfoot is fake and some say that its real. who knows?</p>

              <p>presbyterian. 5 years. Religions are a restriction. I feel that there is no hard prove as to whether there is a God or not. And also the fact that u in christian term, u have to believe in him to go to heaven, a God like this is a extremely jealous God, i would rather go to hell then heaven, but i dont believe in an afterlife anymore so even if there is i rather go to hell. And also the fact that there are many twists and turns in the events of making the bible. there are the old testaments and the news testaments, which is more trueful?</p>
