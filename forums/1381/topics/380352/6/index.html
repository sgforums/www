              <p>From what i know of, christians who do visit to help always
              talks about how "jesus died for your sins" while helping
              reluctantly. Anyways, now it has been a "tradition" to carry out
              rations in churches already. i dont blame them for that.</p>

              <p>Your "always" could just be 1 case only like when you said about Africa situation when 1 friend is enough for you.......and many more others, you choose to ignore because you are in self denial.....Yes, some people need to be waken up from their traunce...</p>
              <p>And what is wrong with asking people to collect their ration from the Church when the Church is giving out rations?  Where do you think they should do it? At your house?</p>

              <p>i will still post a photo of people who didnt want to attend the church. u will see what i meant. but i know, u will still defend ur statement. maybe u are the one who is listening to what christians are saying about missionaries. I know that not all missionaries are like that, just saying most of them are. minorities of them are true about providing them a better life, thats for a cause.</p>

              <p>he is not from Africa. He is from Singapore, they just move around to do missionary works. and like i said again and again, a christian will do whatever it takes to keep their religion from dieing. his parents even lied to him to make him keep his faith.</p>
