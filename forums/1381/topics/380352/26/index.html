              to reasons like the prevalence of violent culture at that time,
              that Jesus came to share new things, etc. Does this mean that "God"

              <p>I dont know if I answered this but Ill answer it again haha.</p>
              <p>There's many reasons why Im a christian,first top 20 things that come to my mind of why Im a christian.</p>
              <p>1. Because theres hope that theres a Heaven when we die and hope that our loved ones and I can go there and that it's a beautiful place .</p>
              <p>2. Because Jesus unpurposly died and suffered so that we could go to heaven when we die and he not only died for me but the world and my loved ones .</p>
              <p>3. All Jesus stories of love touches my heart of what he did and said and it all makes sense to me.</p>
              <p>4. Iv been raised a christian and have experienced Jesus in my life in my heart, Iv talked to him and he's been in my dreams and talked to me once , he was very loving and understanding .</p>
              <p>5. Gives me hope that we can all stop our bad habbits, like someday my brother could stop drinking, we can repent.</p>
              <p>6. I love his forgivness at the cross he forgives us today .</p>
              <p>7. I like the refreshness knowing that I can go on and start  over and try again to better myself as a christian ,</p>
              <p>8. The christian commandments all make sense we shouldnt kill steal commit adultry and so on and we should work 6 days and we need rest and God allows us.</p>
              <p>9.Iv recieved the Gift of the Holy Ghost in my heart and what it really is is Jesus and I are friends and recieved his love in my heart and I can feel his spirit and when I do Im full of joy my body feels peacful excited I feel new energy to go on with my life and so on, it's exciting.</p>
              <p>10.Jesus conversations has brought love conversations to my family and friends, Jesus conversations has brought hope to us all.</p>
              <p>11. Bottom line for it all is Love, I love my family and Jesus said all commandments are based on Love your neighbour as yourself and Love the Lord your God with all your mind sould heart body,Love is our hope in all this life.</p>
              <p>12.I have wonderful memories of all the times I went to church and Iv met wonderful friends , sung in the choir and everything.</p>
              <p>13. At times when my friends and family cried because of a loss , because of a death, because of fear, we all had this peace and hope because of Jesus.</p>
              <p>14.Alot of the things in the Bible are coming true, the 666 is out and many things are happening that ring true, they discovered traces of evidence of things that could have happened in the Bible , it's all very possable.</p>
              <p>15.I believe there is evil in this world and also Love and good and it really does seem like a spirit world, theres times when my body doesnt want to go but my spirit wants to do things and makes my body move and when I have his peace and love and hope it moves much easier it seems,excitment.</p>
              <p>16.I believe in Adam and Eve story , I really think we all go back to it but its still a mystery everytime I read it.</p>
              <p>17. Its all so interesting to me, the more I learn, the more I want to learn.</p>
              <p>18.Iv read about other religions and none of them have this loving Jesus who gave his life for you and me, why would a God suffer and die for us?</p>
              <p>19.I know God has many great things and experiences to offer if I listen, listen with his ears, see with his eyes.It seems no matter how much we see, we really dont see it all, the more we grow in a relationship with Jesus in his spirit the more we can see, its never ending of what there is to see.</p>
              <p>20.I hope Jesus has his way, I believe Jesus way is that all sins be washed away and pain from everyones life and that we all recieve Love and hope for all our relationships and dreams in our lives and his promises yet to come.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately a non-Christian will go to hell because he hasnt
                                      confessed his sins. You go to hell because of all the sins you've
                                      ever committed, and that is an absolute. The only way out is
                                      through God's forgiveness - that's why when someone believes in
                                      Jesus it's called "salvation", where you are "saved" from your sins
                                      &amp; its consequences.</p>
              <p>Seems really unfair right, that bad people who finally believe
                                      (as in, truly. lip service wont get you anywhere) can end up in
                                      heaven, and good people who dont end up in hell. This is because
                                      it's not about how much good I do - because that is unfair. It's
                                      about whether my heart is willing to believe and realise I am a
                                      sinner and turn away from that. It's a fact it's like you don't question why the sun is only
              hot, or gravity holds us down all the time. Similarly, this is just the
              way it is.</p>
