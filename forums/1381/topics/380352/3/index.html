              <p>i was a christian, does that count? i found out that whenever a
              christian overcomes something, they thank God. Why? Simply cause
              they are brain-washed by their religion</p>

              <p>what do u have to say for Christian "missionaries" going to Africa to "help" the poor people? Yes, they use their money, but they are using the money to build a church there and make them go to the church if not they dont get food. So, are they good people or bad people?</p>

              <p>maybe for christians they never realise what their real objective is. Its wrong in the 1st place that they built a church already. Its like sticking a sharp knife at your throat and asking u to go to the church and listen to the pastor or u will starve to death.</p>
