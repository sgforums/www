              <p>Unfortunately a non-Christian will go to hell because he hasnt confessed his sins. You go to hell because of all the sins you've ever committed, and that is an absolute. The only way out is through God's forgiveness - that's why when someone believes in Jesus it's called "salvation", where you are "saved" from your sins &amp; its consequences.</p>
              <p>Seems really unfair right, that bad people who finally believe (as in, truly. lip service wont get you anywhere) can end up in heaven, and good people who dont end up in hell. This is because it's not about how much good I do - because that is unfair. It's about whether my heart is willing to believe and realise I am a sinner and turn away from that. It's a fact it's like you don't question why the sun is only hot, or gravity holds us down all the time. Similarly, this is just the way it is.</p>

              <p><br>crap, I doubt you know the bible well.</p>
              <p>jesus brought someone he chosen down to hell, there the christians were in hell.</p>
              <p>Jesus said that not everyone who called Him "Lord, Lord" will enter the kingdom of heaven but those who repent and do the will of God.    BY accepting christ, go to church, condemn people and refuse to repent, change for the better and ignore God's will will lead to christians end up in hell.</p>
              <p>The road to heaven is narrow, very very narrow.</p>

              <p>Anw I was saying yes, a good non-Christian will go to hell. But by "Christian", it doesnt merely mean going to Church every sunday and reading your bible &amp; praying. Sure, Christians do that, but doing that doesnt make you Christian. It's about your heart, whether it truly believes in and loves God. being Christian is about confessing your sins &amp; acknowledging Jesus is God, who paid for your wrongdoings already.</p>
              <p>The thing is, the 'criteria' to get into Heaven is not by good works, but through the belief in Jesus Christ &amp; being right with God. It's like for e.g., i wanna get into NUS Medicine. So if I get straight As, which is great, but if i dont take any science... then I still cant get in! So similarly, if I do alot of good things and love people, it doesnt get me in.</p>

              <p>jesus brought someone he chosen down to hell, there the

              <p>Jesus said that not everyone who called Him "Lord, Lord" will
              enter the kingdom of heaven but those who repent and do the will of
              God.    BY accepting christ, go to church, condemn
              people and refuse to repent, change for the better and ignore God's

              <p><br>Anyway, sad to say majority of christians have the wrong concept that accepting christ as personal savour and LOrd is good enough for getting free passport to heaven.   They either refuse to know, ignorant or whatever that this is not true.    Jesus said clearly that not all will go heaven, only those who REPENT and do the will of God will enter the kingdom of heaven.    </p>
              <p>Ok, I will be clear.   According to christianity:</p>
              <p>First, accept christ as personal saviour and Lord</p>
              <p>Then REPENT and do the will of God </p>
              <p>This way christians will enter the kingdom of heaven.    </p>
