It is a historical book that is <span style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>backed by archeology</strong></span>, and a prophetic book that has lived up to all of its claims thus far. The Bible is God's letter to humanity collected into 66 books written by 40 divinely inspired writers over a period of over 1,600 years. The claim of divine inspiration may seem dramatic (or unrealistic to some), but a careful and honest study of the biblical scriptures will show them to be true. Powerfully, the Bible validates its divine authorship through <span style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>fulfilled prophecies</strong></span><strong>. </strong><strong>An astonishing 668 prophecies have been fulfilled and none have ever been proven false (three are unconfirmed).</strong> God decided to use prophecy as His primary test of divine authorship, and an honest study of biblical prophecy will compellingly show the supernatural origin of the Bible. Skeptics must ask themselves, "Would the gambling industry even exist if people could really tell the future?" Again, no other holy book comes even close to the Bible in the amount of evidence supporting its credibility, authenticity and divine authorship.</span></p>
              <p>Are you saying that 668 prophecies are fake ? Gain some knowledge before you stat that you are correct in your opinion.</p>
