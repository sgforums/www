              <p>no offense to anyone... i agree with Sgforum King... tho i only
              read through the last page...<br> <br> my opinions are, gods, regardless of exist or not, does not matter.
              but i personally believe there is no such thing as god, but there
              is no harm believing in him. i believe that all religion teaches
              ppl to be good, and i respect that.<br> <br> my deduction comes from, there are so many different religions, and
              each religion have their own gods, and i dun think there are so
              many ppl with such power. in some story, it is said that some
              religions comes from normal people words and action, the
              misunderstanding and admiring of the other ppl, and thus resulting
              in the god that we believe.... what i said might be false, but it
              could be true too...<br> <br> there is no such thing as certain in religion, i dare say.. if u
              want to believe in god, then is ur problem, please do not force ur
              opinion on others, same for the other side. <br> <br> also, if any debates continues, please give prove, in this world,
              no prove no talk.</p>

              <p>Your perception of the holy tongue is different from every truthful Christian. Why does 1 million people able to speak in tongue and God give them the inner peace while you can't ? The problem is believing. You have already decided in your heart that Christians are fake instead of asking God why you have to think like this.</p>
