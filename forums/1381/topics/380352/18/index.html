              <p>You said "who can trust just some writings on the bible? Thats
              why i say its fake." so all those anti chritisans materials you
              read on the internet should also be treated the same and you should
              also declare them as fake right? Or it will be double standard
              right?</p>
              <p>Any then you are in fact not certain that the Bible is fake
              because you also said: "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>maybe it will
              be</strong></span></span> revealed that it is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>real</strong></span></span> by other people" and "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it
              could be real</span></span></strong> but then again it could be
              fake"</p>
              <p>And since you said if Bible is true, then God is real, at best
              you are only unsure if God is real and cannot be sure that God does
              not exist.</p>
              <p>And if you still insist that Bible is fake, then how can you
              come to any conclusion using something that is fake? So, even if
              bible is fake, it does not means God did not exist. On the other
              hand, you are right that if Bible is real, then God is real....</p>
              <p>Don't get diverted and remember to back up your baseless
              allegations and lies with your ONE photo from your ONE friend in

              <p>Aiyoooooo.....I really don't care the reason you are not a

              <p>And no point saying it is fake when you cannot proved it is
              fake.....and in fact from your own writting, proved that in actual
              fact, you are just unsure....</p>
              <p>And you are quoting from anti-christians website to back up your

              <p>If it is fake, then it cannot be proven real later.....and if it
              is real, it cannot be proven as fake later......Can a fake LV
              somehow become real later or vice versa?</p>
              <p>If it is "fake now" and maybe "real later"....it simply means -

              <p>If you insist that the bible is fake, then it is fair that we
              asked you to proved why it is fake since it must have been proven
              to you that it is fake....otherwsie you won't say it is fake right?
              And from what you have written, I conclude that you are unsure if
              Bible is real or fake which is additional reasons why it is fair I
              ask you to prove your case....</p>

              <p>Hi happyinfo2,</p>
              <p>okay I give you benefit of doubt, please go back and study your bible carefully, especially on book of genesis. Please discuss with your pastor on genesis. Be open minded, look deeper, read it critically. Then you will understand why I want to ask you the origin of cain's wife.</p>
              <p>Have a nice day.</p>

              <p>Hi iceFatboy,</p>
              <p>No, i did not want to confuse people. This is the last thing I want to do.</p>
              <p>I just want people to open up and be critical. Judge for themselves. If they find happiness, so be it. </p>
              <p>I just hate people indoctrinate their children at a very young age. Very sad...</p>
              <p>I wish you happiness in your life journey and your faith.</p>
