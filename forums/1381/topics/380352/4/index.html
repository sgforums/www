              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">and also, maybe u dont know bragging gets irritating at times. even when people does not want to hear about it cause they do not believe in it, they still keep on bragging about it. like 1 time there was 2 christians going around blocks to talk about christianity. So, they walked to my doorstep and the 1st thing he said was " do u know jesus died for your sins"? before i could answer he started talking crap and finally, he said "come to our church we give refreshments" and of course i shouted at him " YOUZ TRZYING TO CONVERTZ WITH FREEZBIEZ?"</p>

              <p>no, you didnt get it. i only took that as another example of 1 of the hundreds i had encountered with. i only used that as an example in a different context.

              <p>See, come back to square one. You based everything you hear from 1 family only. Yet, most of the others will tell you otherwise because "they
                      would have denied everything because it will make people lose faith
                      in their religion." ?</p>
              <p>More like they (the other families other than the one you contact with) will be proof that what 1 family tells you may not be the actual situation and thus, you are just in self denial....and refuse to hear the truth.</p>
              <p>You said it is common sense to love your neighbour but look around and you see many don't.......And so what is so wrong to share this "common sense" beliefs with others?</p>
              <p>And to put what you preach into practice by actually extending the help.....</p>
              <p>So I take it that you agree that all those missionaries are good people since they have the common sense to love their neighbour and not just by saying but by taking actions.</p>
              <p>Unless they tell the straving : " Believed in God or I won't give you food", your claimed that "They giv them food and
                      in return they want them to believe in God." hold no truth.</p>

              <p>See, come back to square one. You based everything you hear from
              1 family only. Yet, most of the others will tell you otherwise
              because "they would have denied everything because it will make
              people lose faith in their religion." ?</p>
              <p>More like they (the other families other than the one you
              contact with) will be proof that what 1 family tells you may not be
              the actual situation and thus, you are just in self denial....and
              refuse to hear the truth.</p>
              <p>You said it is common sense to love your neighbour but look
              around and you see many don't.......And so what is so wrong to
              share this "common sense" beliefs with others?</p>
              <p>And to put what you preach into practice by actually extending
              the help.....</p>
              <p>So I take it that you agree that all those missionaries are good
              people since they ahve the common sense to love their neighbour and
              not just by saying but by taking actions.</p>
              <p>Unless they tell the straving : " Believed in God or I won't
              give you food", your claimed that "They giv them food and in return
              they want them to believe in God." hold no water.</p>

              <p>U nv think. do u think a christian would admit that what his or her purpose was after becoming a christian. Yes, there are some with initial purposes and thats to feed the poor, well, after that they would have gone into another purpose and thats to lure them into a believe that they do not want to. My friend has become a non-christian already, so, he would tell me everything he knew. his parents had already worked with almost all the missionaries stationed in Africa. He said he took a photo of what the pastor did when he knew 1 of them did not want to attend church. i will post a photo sometime this week since he is not able to use the com everyday.</p>
