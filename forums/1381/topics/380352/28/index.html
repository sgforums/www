              <p><br>Anyway, sad to say majority of christians have the wrong concept that accepting christ as personal savour and LOrd is good enough for getting free passport to heaven.   They either refuse to know, ignorant or whatever that this is not true.    Jesus said clearly that not all will go heaven, only those who REPENT and do the will of God will enter the kingdom of heaven.    </p>

              <p><br>Hey there okay I'm back for a bit. Like I said it's the heart that counts. Like you said "Jesus said clearly that not all will go heaven, only those who REPENT and do the will of God will enter the kingdom of heaven." and you are right. When your heart is truly repentant and right with God, it will spur you to do the things of God. It's not just the ACT.</p>
              <p>I know it seems that there are many loopholes, and I can tell you are person who chooses to follow logic. The thing is that, believing in God is called "Faith". It wouldnt be faith if you can reason entirely right?</p>
              <p>And you like to quote the Bible, so remember that God's ways &amp; thoughts are above ours? Like he thinks in a different dimension. And we're human, and limited so this is only as far as we can reason.</p>
              <p>I hope you find your way back one day, because honestly, it's your loss.</p>

              <p>And yep, likeyou, I was trying to say to get into heaven, it doesnt matter what you have done or have not done. Because what you DO isnt the criteria. It's the belief in God that holds. And truly believing will translate into action that will mean living right. </p>
