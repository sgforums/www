              <p>Turning point... Hmm, I don't know if you will believe it but I was a rascal during my lower sec times, I left God for my friends. Well, it was a bad choice made by me as I'm starting to suffer now because of my past. During the end of last year, for me, I realised that without the Lord, I was suffering all along and doing all the stupid things. I decided to go back to church and regain my faith. It worked out and even though I had some stupid setbacks nowadays, I felt happy inside because I know that God had help me through these times and given me the faith i needed to continue this path. If I were to think now, if i hadn't go back to church and continue being wildful, maybe this wouldn't turn out like this.  </p>

              <p>Have you ever sincerely ask youself if the transformation is truly brought about by your believe in christianity? I am sure you must pray a lot for god to help you.  But do you always get what you prayed for?</p>
              <p>Matthew 21:22 -- And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive
              , if you
               have faith</p>
              <p>If not then it shows that you do not have faith; or have you may be the god is just not at home</p>

              <p>In Jesus i behold the face of God, He is the truth , the everlasting truth. God in the flesh, i know that in his life, death and resurrection i'm reconciled to God, the giver of life. I believe that nothing can separate me from the love of God. He has all power and goodness. I trust him in his promise. To him i offer my life, damaged or whole, belief or full of years, it matters not. He is the one certain thing in an uncertain world. He is to be worshipped, not so somethign will happen to me or to the world (something indeed had already happened to me and to the world? but because he is God, who through Christ has reconciled the world to himself. He saved me, he is my justification, he is the center that holds in my life.</p>
              <p>To worship God of my salvation, to offer sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, that alone is my vocation. I offer my life to God, not so as to be healthy, wealthy or wise. I offer my life to Him because he alone had claim me!</p>
