              <p>actually, i don't deny the fact that churches use the distribution of food to preach the gospel.</p>
              <p>reality is, most religious organisations use such techniques to get to the masses.</p>
              <p>however it is untrue that if one doesn't believe one will not get any food the next round. there is no record as to, say, a person living in this household had rejected hence we will not come back again.</p>
              <p>aside from the command to preach the gospel, there is the objective of having social concern for the society. such kind of effort is in-built in all churches, many of which will have social concern committee.</p>
              <p>it will be interesting, however, to see an atheist organisation having food distribution to entice the masses in NOT believing in god. i wonder, if such an event happens, what the success rate will be?</p>
              <p>or have an atheist organisation reaching out to criminals and thugs and say reform, do not be a bad person because there is no god to look after you, you have to look after yourself.</p>
              <p>not trying to flame atheists here.... just an interesting paradigm to think about.</p>

              <p>actually we can see it in two ways....</p>
              <p>1. Biblical speaking - which all Christian theology is based upon, yes non-believers will go to hell after they die if they did not accept Jesus Christ as saviour</p>

              <p>I rmb that Singapore invited Prophet T.B Joshua here to talk about Christ around two years ago ? It was a grand event and Prophet Joshua drive out alot of spirits that are bothering people's life. </p>
              <p>This is got to do with the spiritual realm, but I guess you will just harden your heart like what the Pharaoh did to Moses in the bible.</p>
