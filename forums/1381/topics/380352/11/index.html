              <p>fact remains that the allegations are always the same.... those who believe in some religion are either brain-washed or too stupid to think.</p>
              <p>fact also is that such arguments, including this one, will lead to nowhere. i've participated in enough of such arguments to know that it is pointless.</p>

              <p>Catholics believed that there are salvation outside the Church...and you can go and find out more...if that suits you..</p>
              <p>So, there are Christians that believed that non-believers will go to hell and there are those who believed that there is hope for all....and yet there are those who only wants money and believe that God will enrich them etc....</p>
              <p>So you have a wide variety to choose from and most (except those who are greedy for money and cults) will teach you to be a good person.</p>

              <p>Catholics believed that there are salvation outside the
              Church...and you can go and find out more...if that suits you..</p>
              <p>So, there are Christians that believed that non-believers will
              go to hell and there are those who believed that there is hope for
              all....and yet there are those who only wants money and believe
              that God will enrich them etc....</p>
              <p>So you have a wide variety to choose from and most (except those
              who are greedy for money and cults) will teach you to be a good
              person.</p>
              <p>And I think all main stream Churches do teach and respect all
              faith especially in Singapore. You don't find 1 extreme case and
              keep harping on it and make it sound as if all are like 1 bad
