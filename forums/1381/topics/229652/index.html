            <div class='col-md body'>I think its not easy to reconcile the Old Testament events and how God deals with His people and those around them, with the way God deals with His Church in the New Testament. For one, we need to take the location, people, situation, history, cultural, events, politics ...etc into consideration when studying the Old Testament.</div>

Thus, it is not surprising to have draconian laws to scare off potential challengers and maybe even hv some sacrificial persons within the group as a show of strength.<br><br>Perhaps there were some Gandhi-like leaders with humility and non-violent tendencies but somehow they never lasted long unless they demonstrate some superhuman feat during that time...</div>

The TS's comments were flippant at best, and confrontation at worst. It is very easy to make passing statements on things that we do not agree. Within such a forum, we hope to dispense with such comments as they are neither edifying nor educational.<br><br>The one thing we do not want happening here is another flaming war.<br><br>Something that all non-Christians should realise: not every Christian is in TOTAL agreement of the events recorded in the Bible, while we may not talk about it in an open forum like this one, topics and issues are heavily debated in Bible Studies and Cell Groups, and even go up to the pulpit ministries.

It would have been remarkably weird if we turn to the Bible and it records a Hebrew society that is TOTALLY different and out of sync with the rest of the world.... and if THIS REALLY HAPPENS, we'd be debating on whether this recorded history is real or not.
