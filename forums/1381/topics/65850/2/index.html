After all, a lot of Christian books on the occult also mention such things. However, the key lies in the context in which these activities are shown in.<br><br>Harry Potter tells you that the occult is cool, that you are not living a life worth living (as a muggle) if you do not wield such powers, and that we can and should use these powers. It is effective, and not so subtle propangada for dabbling in the occult, which is what Harry and co. does most of the time in the book anyway.<br><br>Note that in all the magic and happenings in the book, there's no mention of God, or even a higher power at all? Basically Harry Potter represents the worldview that there is no absolute truth (or God for that matter), that we should all forge our own truth and way in the universe using supernatural powers to enforce our will. A classic witchcraft worldview.<br><br>The theme of triumph of good over evil? I'm afraid you won't really find that in Harry Potter at all. All of Harry's exploits range through a theme of gaining more power, vengence on his own muggle kin, searching for more power, and so on and so forth. The perfect, self-sufficent God-empty worldview that relies heavily on the occult to be appealing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Couple of points:<br>1. The allegation that JK Rowlings is a white witch probably originated from a satirical article from a website called The Onion. This allegation was supported by a email-circulated article that falsed stated that Rowlings made some very derogatory statements regarding Christianity.<br>2. As Harry Potter was never intended to be read as a Christian book, the fact that "God" was never mentioned should not even be brought in the discussion.<br>3. Whether the practices described in the books are really paganistic or sorcery remains to be seen. Wiccans have made it clear that none of the practices in the books are similar to what they are doing.<br>4. The practices described has very little relevance to Chinese occult.<br><br>Firstly let me say that I am not here looking for a fight with anyone. I like and respect this forum and in the spirit of exchanging different ideas I ask for at least a cordial spirit in writing.<br><br>While what I have written above seems that I am a red-blooded HP fan. Let me state that I neither support or is against Rowlings and her writings. I see Rowlings as another novelist out to make some money. She is no different from Robert Ludlum or Tom Clancy.<br><br>Whether any individual likes Harry Potter or not remains as an individual choice. It does not mean that because I have read all her 5 books, I am now a supporter of witchcraft.<br><br>Many anti-HP fans had stated that the books were loaded with various imagery of witchcraft. This I cannot deny. However with just a cursory look at any Brothers Grimm novels, you will that this is nothing new. Each culture will have our own bogeyman and fairies.<br><br>There greater issue is whether such writing will influence the readers or not. If the influence factor exist, then the argument should be: is this factor Satanic or is it a fad?<br><br>My children has seen the movies and read the books but I have not observe any negative behaviour emerging from them. As a matter of fact, my children also like Pokemon (another major bugbear among the churches and Christian school). Why are my children not affected? It is because they are taught from a very young age to discern good and bad, and real and fantasy. They know that their hands will not have the ability to create hooks to climb walls like Spider-man, and that Power Rangers are five guys in rubber suits. They place great priority in church life, prays regularly, learning hard to tithe and generally learning to be an example of a good Christian in school evening garnering various commendations from their teachers.<br><br>Are children obsessed with Hi-Five or Manchester United in less of a danger than other children who read HP? I think not. As long as a child (for that matter, an adult) who is obsessed with one thing other than God, this obsession is just as bad.<br><br>To label HP as evil only is insufficient. This will cause the child not to be able to discern for himself good and evil. As adults we have the responsibility to impart skills, especially discernment, not enforce our own preconceived opinions.<br><br>As a note of interest, there are also Christians who think that Tolkien and LOTR is satanic.... hmm.... there is no pleasing all....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christ told the apostles to follow his example: "As the Father has sent me, even so I send you" (John 20:21). Just as the apostles were to carry ChristÃ¢Â€Â™s message to the whole world, so they were to carry his forgiveness: "Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matt. 18:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>This power was understood as coming from God: "All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation" (2 Cor. 5:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Indeed, confirms Paul, "So we are ambassadors for Christ" (2 Cor. 5:20).<br><br>Some say that any power given to the apostles died with them. Not so. Some powers must have, such as the ability to write Scripture. But the powers necessary to maintain the Church as a living, spiritual society had to be passed down from generation to generation. If they ceased, the Church would cease, except as a quaint abstraction. Christ ordered the apostles to, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations." It would take much time. And he promised them assistance: "Lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age" (Matt. 28:19Ã¢Â€Â“20).<br><br>If the disciples believed that Christ instituted the power to sacramentally forgive sins in his stead, we would expect the apostlesÃ¢Â€Â™ successorsÃ¢Â€Â”the bishopsÃ¢Â€Â”and Christians of later years to act as though such power was legitimately and habitually exercised. If, on the other hand, the sacramental forgiveness of sins was what Fundamentalists term it, an "invention," and if it was something foisted upon the young Church by ecclesiastical or political leaders, weÃ¢Â€Â™d expect to find records of protest. In fact, in early Christian writings we find no sign of protests concerning sacramental forgiveness of sins. Quite the contrary. We find confessing to a priest was accepted as part of the original deposit of faith handed down from the apostles.<br><br>http://www.catholic.com/library/Forgiveness_of_Sins.asp<br></div>
