            <div class='col-md body'>LOTR is based on the two World Wars as well as Tolkien's beliefs.<br><br>Harry Potter is pagan and encourages readers to "explore" the pagan practices such as witchcraft. So Christian parents should discourage their children from reading them.

            <div class='col-md body'>by the way, i got the feeling that nowadays, people associate Catholics as Christians.<br><br>Also, they dun call themselves Roman Catholic anymore.<br><br>And newspaper articles also label the pope as the head of Christianity.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I wonder what's the real distinction sometimes between catholics and christians?<br><br>Back then before the reformation, when there was just the catholic church, does this mean that christianity did not exist back then?<br><br>Since when did christians=protestants?<br><br>Do not get me wrong, I certainly do not agree with many of their pratices, but it is clear to me that many catholics have accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour (though many still go about their lives not knowing if they are saved), how would you regard them?<br><br>Thelogy and pratices aside, I believe the bottom line is if who is saved or not. And what are those who are saved considered? Christians.<br><br>About the dilution of truth to create One Religon where everybody compromises, I'm sure we all have our stand on that. But at the same time we must be mindful if we are getting the "corner on truth" mentality, where we feel that we are the only right ones and the rest are teethering on the edge of hell. It helps to take a step back and see things from the big picture.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not a Christian, but here is the most damning collection of critiques on the Harry Potter series that I know of :<br><br><a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/hpmain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/hpmain.html</a><br><br>The site is run by an "orthodox" Christian - as opposed to, say, "charismatic"?<br><br>As for LOTR, there is an alternative, non faith-based interpretation of his writings.<br><br>I can't remember the URL now, but it goes something like this : the elves, dwarfs and other creatures are aliens who have roamed the earth at some point in the distant past.<br><br>The various races have both worked together with and fought against the humans who are the "native people".<br><br>At the end of the story, the elves are seen to be leaving in boats. This may be considered an allegory which can be compared to, say, the Vorlons of Babylon 5 leaving the known galaxy in their starships.<br><br>And as for Frodo and his uncle joining them? They were invited, and accepted the invitation, to make the trip "way out there" together with them!<br><br>Incredible? I thought so too!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's an interesting interpretation of the classic.  Tolkien was a staunch believer of God.  I doubt he meant it that way.  Not forgetting the stories he wrote were meant to be told to his children in the early years.</div>

Clearly they were outnumbered by tens of thousands. The relevation that comes is mind-blowing, 'Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of it' Mark Twain<br><br>Also the theme of friendship, loyalty. How Sam stuck with Frodo to the end.

None of my friends ever tot of LOTR as having christian themes running underneath nor do they catch any christian themes nor do they want to find out abt Tolkien being a christian. All they are interested is the power, fantasical (if there is such a word) characters.  Harry Potter is bad? Yes i think so but LOTR isnt any better. Just my view.
