Two of my frens also from that church, from the same cell group. The cell group leader asked them to break up, saying that they are not suitable for each other. Even the pastor intervened and want them to break up.<br><br>Another story is the said church refused to accept offerings of coins...."sorry we won't accept coins.."<br><br>These things should not happen in a proper church.<br><br>Being a Christian doesn't mean u belong to an exclusive social club. As far as possible, I do not think the church should intervene in their members' private lives. We go to church for fellowship, to pray and to encourage each other, not to alienate pple.<br><br>I believed this kinda church only reflected an extreme minority.....i have been to other churches and it was okay....<br></div>

I will try not to name this church i am going to talk about. I have a friend who is a non christian himself and a few months ago started going to church with her girlfriend at Jurong East. Things are going well very normally when he realised that the cell group leaders are trying to get control of everything. The leader actually tried to talk his girlfriend into breaking up with my friend, which leaves her unstable for a moment.<br><br>My friend mentioned that those people at church also tried to talk him out from friends like us, even mentioning that hanging out with his "outside friends" will spoil his own image and he shld keep his class, and we will eventually bring him to the wrongdoings.<br><br>He is really pissed but continued going to the chuch but participating lesser in the activities and there are people who labeled him "Judas".<br><br>Recently they are raising money and the cell group leader told him that they have got to raise 12K from the group, which consist of 12 people.  Imagine this, most of them in the group are students and instead of understanding the situation, the cell group leader is making thigns worst by pressurising them, for instance my friend donated 20 bucks, and instant comment was made. One of the group member, cant over and told my friend things like this. " Hey you donated only 20 bucks? where is your devotion for the church? I am not suppose to show u this slip but i donated 500 bucks." my friend was instantly like, WTF?<br><br>Another things is that the cell group leaders actually discourage eating at "low class" places like Hawker Centers when they are outside together. Which means restaurants and money badly spent.<br><br>What is the leaders in church teaching their members? from what i heard i think its doing more harm then good.</div></blockquote>this is fcuk lor. they r more like satans rather den christian</div>
