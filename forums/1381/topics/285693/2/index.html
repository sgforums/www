Please don't be so close-minded.<br><br>Being nice and polite doesn't necessarily mean being pretentious. Maybe such a train of thought is alien or foreign in your world, but you know, alternative view?<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>Isn't this statement sweeping: all non Christians go to hell?</strong></blockquote>This statement is a different thing, it involves ideology. True or not is one thing, but even if you don't believe that non-Christians go to hell, it is not a sweeping statement.<br><br>I would previously have tried to explain, but I do not know if you might understand me or refuse to see my point/different perspective/view that is alternative to yours.<br><br>Ultimately, I think your agenda is not so much about the sweeping statements, who's being pretentious or not. It's not even about difference in ideology.</div>

You only see different view as anger and hate. Just like I see the way you try to sweep aside my claim that the statement "non Christians go to hell" is also a sweeping statement. You gave excuse that it is theology. So theological statement cannot be sweeping?  Indeed, you showed what bigotry is all about.</div>

Moreover, this one is a general statement. Those who have been in this forum long enough will know what I mean. This comment as well as TS's orig post was based on things that have happened in EH not just recently but over the past year again. If anyone is mistaken, it is you.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>You only see different view as anger and hate. </strong>[/quote]<br><br>This is your mistaken conclusion.<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]Just like I see the way you try to sweep aside my claim that the statement "non Christians go to hell" is also a sweeping statement.
