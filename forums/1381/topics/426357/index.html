              <p>Professor Bart D Ehrman claims much of the New Testament was forged by imposters of apostles Peter, Paul or James.</p>
              <p>Professor Ehrman, author of 
              'Misquoting Jesus' and 'Jesus, Interrupted', said some religious scholars 
              were well aware of the 'lies' and were happy 
              to acknowledge them.</p>
              <p>In his new book , Why 
              the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are, Professor Ehrman 
              claims The Second Epistle of Peter was forged. </p>
              <p>'...scholars everywhere will tell you that there is no 
              way on earth that Peter wrote the book. Someone else wrote 
              it claiming to be Peter,' he writes.</p>
              <p>He said scholars who
               say it was acceptable in the ancient world for someone to write a book 
              in the name of someone else, are wrong.</p>
              <p>Scholars think 6 of the 13 letters allegedly written by Paul were 
              actually authored by somebody else claiming to be Paul.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Professor Ehrman writes how the Bible is filled 
              with the need for 'truth' but many of its writers were telling a lie.</p>

              <p>the bible being mostly made of paper..cannot stand the heat of fire, thus does not make a good material to forge things with..metal on the other hand is great for forging..</p>
              <p>we have to understand the difference between authors and writers..it doesnt matter if its paul or matthew or john or the guy next door that write funny internet comedies is doing the writing or not...</p>
              <p>the fact remains that all the bible writers are divinely inspired by God's holy spirit..they write not knowing fully what they are writing most of the time..like daniel for an example..</p>
              <p>the greek scriptures tally with the hebrew scriptures..combine both and we get the full picture...how is a human writer able to write a story spanning thousands of years?how are a group of writers able to write a story that dont contradict each chapter spanning thousands of years?</p>
