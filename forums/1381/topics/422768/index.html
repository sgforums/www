              <p>Catholics believe that Mary did not sin against God. that’s nonsense, because if she didnt sin, she would be on equal ground as God, but she is full human, so that is absolutely important. and as a protestant, i think that the pope is a bum whos corrupted, but it has been mentioned countless times in the bible that there would be false preachers throughout the world, we just have to be wary of what is taught to us and analyse the word for ourselves to fully understand what other people say, dont just take it as that.</p>

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>To clarify, the Catholic belief on Mary being sinless is not that she's able to do what God can do, but because it's a <em>special grace</em> endowed upon her by God - for being the woman who would be chosen (and who would <strong>respond positively</strong>) to bear the Son of the Most High.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>To announce the impending birth of Jesus, the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and said, 'Hail Mary, <strong>full of Grace</strong>, the Lord is with you.' When Mary visited Elizabeth, she exclaimed, '<strong>Blessed are you amongst women</strong>, and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus'. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Do these events hint at Mary's sinlessness?

              <p>If Catholicism is false, then the Bible that you believe in is false too. It may surprise you to find out (from <strong>objective sources</strong>) how the Bible came about.</p>

              <p>numerically speaking, that's less than 2% of popes considered evil... which by constrast to your allegations.... <em>"many popes are involved"</em></p>
              <p>of course, i am not saying that even with such a small percentage, it is acceptable or should be condoned, i am merely pointing out that your allegations are always.... laughable....</p>
              <p>obviously one also need to note how the evil popes came to meet their maker..... their acts were never condoned by the church.</p>

              <p>Believe you? Isn't it plain obvious who has more credibility?</p>
              <p>Once again, someone confronts you with the facts and then with nothing to show, you dodge, distort and continue to slander others. Nothing new.</p>
              <p>Yeah, I'm pretty sure you have a cooler name and you're more handsome than Pope Benedict VI (he'll probably tell you the same thing).

              <p>numerically speaking, that's less than 2% of popes considered evil... which by constrast to your allegations.... <em>"many popes are involved"</em></p>
              <p>of course, i am not saying that even with such a small percentage, it is acceptable or should be condoned, i am merely pointing out that your allegations are always.... laughable....</p>
              <p>obviously one also need to note how the evil popes came to meet their maker..... their acts were never condoned by the church.</p>

              <p>Catholics do not worship Mary, worship is for God and God alone. Having said that, as I mentioned at the beginning of this thread, Catholics honour her for the special role that she has in being the mother of Christ.</p>
