            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, my previous introduction was too brief.<br><br>Ok... I was a cradle Catholic from Queen of Peace.  For years, my family has stopped going to church.  They have become what we called the lapsed Catholic.  So when I reached the age that I should be attending Catechism classes, nobody registered for me, nobody brought me to church.<br><br>Then slowly, I was introduced to a Protestant church, under the denormination of Presbyterian.  Many years later when I reached 18, I decided to go back to the Catholic Church, for the confirmation.  As I was a special case (most catholics got confirmed at the age of 14 or 16 ... can't remember), the church arranged for a one-to-one crash course on the sacrements.<br><br>After some months of preparations, I was finally confirmed at the church where I was baptised  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .<br><br>This year, I have just moved to Bukit Batok and have since cut myself away from the church activities in the East district, due to the distance and commitment.  I have yet to meet anybody in SMOA or take part in anything.<br><br>End of story....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
