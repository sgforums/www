Especially when a group or individual is being questioned of it's credibility. There were many occasions where new-generation churches were questioned of their doctrines, their followers (as well as leaders) will use this line as a first line of defense.... but how wrong are they.<br><br><strong>Geneva Study Bible</strong><br>7:1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.<br>We ought to find fault with one another, but we must beware we do not do it without cause, or to seem holier than others or because of hatred of others.<br><br><strong>People's New Testament</strong><br>Matt 7:1<br>Judge not, that ye be not judged. The term judge is used in more than one sense, but Christ's meaning is plain. (1) He does not prohibit the civil judgment of the courts upon evil doers, for this is approved throughout the whole Bible. (2) He does not prohibit the judgment of the church, through its officers, upon those who walk disorderly, for both he and the apostles have enjoined this. (3) He does not forbid those private judgments that we are compelled to form the wrong-doers, for he himself tell us that we are to judge men by their fruits. (See Mt 7:15-20.) What he designs to prohibit is rash, uncharitable judgments, a fault-finding spirit, a disposition to condemn without examination of charges<br><br><strong>Wesley's Notes</strong><br>7:1 Judge not - any man without full, clear, certain knowledge, without absolute necessity, without tender love. Luke 6:37.<br><br><strong>Matthew Henry Commentaries</strong><br>7:1-6 We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make our word a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgment upon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst of people. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethren for small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Some sins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others as a camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, or splinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both are painful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are got out. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in our brother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call a beam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful, miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should have a beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this world blinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reform thyself.<br><br>Source: <span style="font-style: italic;">http://biblecommenter.com/matthew/7-1.htm</span><br><br>See also: <span style="font-style: italic;">http://www.studylight.org/com/bnn/view.cgi?book=mt&amp;chapter=7</span><br><br>If we are allowed to judge on any situation, how then are we to know what is right and wrong?</div>
