              No need to go into such infinite regression. lol
              
              There are so many possible arguments. From a moral pov, ontoligical pov, cosmological pov... etc.
              
              From all these arguments, we must be aware and be cautioned in extrapolating from common sense notions of causality to philosophical conclusions about the nature of all of reality.
              
              Man have always wondered about what is between God, the physical world, time and causality.
              
              We must be humble at our own limited intellect. I would not be so certain to make a universal negative assertion.
              
              I think you meant to suggests that any God complex enough to account for all of creation would necessarily be complex enough to require an explanation.
              
              My question is... does it really ?
              
              So while you may not believe there is one and with good reason, there are those that believe there is one. Also with good reasons.

              <p>hey, i am back again...</p>
              <p>well i tot abt this for some time and decided ok, i shall share why i say ''who created God'' is a flawed question...again i must emphasise wadever i share is the way i myself see it...so here goes...</p>
              <p>1st, we need to set certain premises..1) do we agree tat God(if he exist) is infinite? 2) do we agree tat all matter are finite and limited by space and time? in other words, nothing whether living or non-living is infinite. once these premises are set, i can start sharing...</p>
              <p>so now we noe tat matter is finite and limited but God is infinite...i bring forth the concept we learn in maths where we have the number series and the infinity sign...the numbers each have a value and are limited to their own values...infinity as we are taught has no value cos its beyond value...also, we cun give infinity a value cos if we do, then it will cease being the largest in the numerical series...</p>
              <p>Now God is infinite, matter is finite...so ''who created God?'' is tantamount to asking ''whats the value of infinity?'' has anyone found the value of infinity? perhaps when tat day comes, we will also noe who created God..:)</p>

              As usual Tcmc has to resort to distorting what I said. I said that Christ coming was foretold way back in Genesis 3, and in this sense Christianity went all the way back. Of course Christ came to earth 2000 years ago and His followers made up the church. Byte even tracing Christianity to Christ does not prove your point that it is a man-made religion because Jesus was not just man, He was God.

              Organized religion is the highest plight (as well as a flight) of human consciousnes and an individual search for existential expereince. Inner ''truth'' cant rest on the commonality of knowldege. However, one going inwards and sequentially when the sense of self is no longer a participant but a witness, a watcher to what is truth descends as it is! Truth spoken is truth negated. Behind the facade of roles/prjections truth abides to indivisibility. The questions/answers transcended truth simply IS.
              
              Organized religion is collectively organzied and altogether a different affair.  Authentic religion is always an individual expereince and in that ''indivisibility'' of individuality it transforms one''s experience to that of being authenthic. Truth when ''organized'' dies. It is reduced to a dogma, a belief system, a theology, a philosophy, though the truth is may be expereinced it is not longer authenthic but an adulterated expereince. How can a crowd expereince truth!
              
              It happens only to individuals. It is akin and can be likened to love. One cant have ''organizations'' of love and where it is organized one need not bother; the organization will take care, the ''priest'' will love on one's behalf. That is what seems to be happening in religion (especially organised ones). When one discovers the truth, immediately one of the most cunning parts of humanity manifests itself lah, the priests encroach. They start accumulating words; they interpreting words. What is divisive is that they start making it clear that if one want to know truth, one has to go thru them and assume a role of being a mediator, a medium to Truth, God (any label does not matter). The reality is, self-appointed they circumsribe, they dictate.It is exploitation behind the facade behind the cloak of religiosity. In fact it is politicised. When it is organised - one has to abide by and live by the four corners of the ''document''. This is the fallacy and undoing of organised religion. In fact it is politics but so very subtle.

              <p>In that movie, Tom Hanks was separated from his family and friends, cut off from civilisation. As a social being man needs companionship. But loneliness alone does not explain why man would want to create religions. Anyway, the Bible teaches that it is God who created humans, not the other way round. Of course man can invent deities and gods to believe in, but this only shows that man is incorrigibly religious because that's how God made man to be, in fellowship with Him. But sin has cut off that fellowship with God. But man still yearns for the divine and many has invented religions to meet this spiritual void.</p>

              <p><br> Just pointing out the double standards that Jacky is holding to. If
              I am labelled extremist for believing only Christianity is true,
              then why should atheists like Jacky not be labelled even worst than
              extremist for believing only atheism is true and ALL religions are
