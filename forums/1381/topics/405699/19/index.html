              <p>that is why extremism and fundamentalism are dangerous in this world. they have no concept whatsoever, think they will be a matyrl when they die and go to heaven to enjoy eternal life forever. this is a dangerous mindset</p>

              <p>Jacky Woo, can you please explain what is meant by a beginning before THE beginning??? Let's see if you can reasonably explain it. Perhaps your ability to reason is debatable.</p>

              <p>I don't think he meant that though, since he is a godless person, I mean, he says there is no Creator God.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to ask who created God is to beg the question and ASSUME that God is also a created "thing". The atheist then needs to justify that assumption.</p>

              <p>Open up your mind though.</p>
              <p>It depends on which God you are talking about.</p>

              <p>Sure.</p>
              <p>You keep showing me creationise websites and insisting you believe the earth is 6000 years old, but then when I ask you if you would write that in an exam or test, you say "No".</p>
              <p>Seriously contradicting on your part.</p>
              <p>It's like me saying I believe that the earth is 4.5 billion yo but then I would write in the exam that the earth is 6000 yo,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LOL. I seriously doubt if you truly believe that the earth is 6000 years old.</p>
              <p>If you truly believe in it, then write it in the exams! </p>

              <p>You didnt answer me the last time. Try to answer if you can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) You said you believe the earth is 6000 years old. Then I say that radiometric dating is very accurate and is also used to date the deadsea scrolls and christian relics. It is also use to date the age of the earth. So if you trust radiometric dating for the dead sea scrolls, why do you suddenly not trust radiometric dating for the age of the earth to be 4.5 billion years old? Special pleading? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading</a></p>
              <p>2) Also, if you truly believe that the earth is 6000 years old, would you write that in an exam/test if you were required to? Would you ask your students or children to write that the earth is 6000 years old?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
