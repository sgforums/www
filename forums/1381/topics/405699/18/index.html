              <p>You mean love is always correct?</p>
              <p>If love is not always correct, then its subjective.</p>
              <p>But for 1+1=2, it is not a viewpoint and it is not subjective. It is a fact.</p>
              <p>An opinion/viewpoint becomes a fact when you have evidence to back it up.</p>
              <p>Similarly reincarnation is also a viewpoint/belief as long as theres no evidence. But if one day ther is evidence, reincarnation becomes a fact. :)</p>

              <p>Your lack of knowledge is showing again. You need to read more.
                      Our national library have books on how the Bible has been largely
                      influential in many ways. If you need some references because you
                      are just too lazy to find out, let me know ya?</p>

              <p>Sufferings?</p>
              <p>Diseases, disasters. Yea its all part of the natural world. EVen animals "suffer" from diseases every day. A human being dies every second, That is 60 dead people in 1 minute.</p>
              <p>Of course from a philosophical POV, sufferings make us stronger. BUt sufferings are not because of some supernatural force. Got to look at it case by case. </p>
              <p>If its accident, then its human error. If its disasters, it cannot be prevented. etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes I have told BIC before that no scientists (or myself) knows what caused the big bang exactly although there are many theories and attempts to reproduce the the situation prior to the big bang. </p>
              <p>There are so many things we dont know. You and I also dont know if there are Elves or Fairies beyond our universe, but for now we jus conclude there arent because of lack of evidence :)</p>
