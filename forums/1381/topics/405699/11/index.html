              <p>blindly following something not as good as confused meh?</p>
              <p>but i do agreed that ppl ard here seems too uptight about all these religion thingy, i mean i do read up about religion and stuff and i do follow the teaching of religion to the best that circumstances permits but not to that extend of questioning and putting down other religion, faith in religion is more so for your belief then anything, ã€Šå¿ƒç�µå¯„æ‰˜ã€‹kinda thing, but at the end of the day its still going be you who is making the final decision, even if heaven is supposed to drop money its still going to be your own effort in bending down to pickup that'll determine the amount you get from such windfall (if any) </p>

              <p>the Human Ego and Desire to Exist led to the creations of
              religions..............think about it and instinctively, you know

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>people can't accept that after their physical lives ended,
              they'll be gone and forgotten............. they feel they're
              special and their lives mean something............that ego, the
              fear of dying and the desire to exist created the idea of a
              permanent soul/self......................they think they're
              separate and different from all others...........</p>
              <p>but then they've seen and know people suffer physical
              deaths..............so they thought '' Ah Ha ! there must be an
              Eternal After-Life after my mortal life ends !''</p>
              <p>but where will that After-Life be at ?..................so
              people think it must be a most pleasurable and happy place since
              who wants to live Eternally in a shithole, right ?...............so
              let's call that dreamed-up Utopia........Heaven !</p>
              <p>so the next question will be WHO created Heaven ??? well, just
              as Man has to create the tools he needs..........then SOMEONE must
              have created Man and Heaven and everything else !</p>
              <p>so.........HEY PRESTO !!!............let's call this dreamed-up
              Creator/Maker...........God............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's the reason why all religions contained stories that's far
              far too HUMAN to be Divine.............plus full of loopholes and
              flaws...........</p>

              <p>yes.. for me a fool.. like i said.. i rather be a fool according to your "wisdom" than be clever all ard.. thinking that we human beings know better than God.. Better to be humble than be clever and all knowing....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>asro.. what's yr "intentions" to provoke christians?.. may i ask.. were you disapointed with the faith or the people or just "want" to provoke for the sake of provoking? or has any christians hurt you in one way or other? share lah! dun be shy..maybe they attacked yr faith.. you're buddhist or hindu or atheist? dun worry for me i wun say anything to hurt you.or you faith . As a catholic, we are taught to respect other people beliefs since young. . but hope you respect the christian faith 2.. No doubt we're in cyberworld and you can't see me and neither do i.. but let common sense and politness prevail thruout this forum..   </p>
              <p>We all have different beliefs' or explanations abt God.. or not believing  in God.. at all.. On my part.. since this is a christian forum..for me i just state my catholic  beliefs openly without resorting to attacks on other faiths. and that's my goal.. not sure for others.. ..</p>

              <p>yes.. for me a fool.. like i said.. i rather be a fool according to your "wisdom" than be clever all ard.. thinking that we human beings know better than God.. Better to be humble than be clever and all knowing....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>asro.. what's yr "intentions" to provoke christians?.. may i ask.. were you disapointed with the faith or the people or just "want" to provoke for the sake of provoking? or has any christians hurt you in one way or other? share lah! dun be shy..maybe they attacked yr faith.. you're buddhist or hindu or atheist? dun worry for me i wun say anything to hurt you.or you faith . As a catholic, we are taught to respect other people beliefs since young. . but hope you respect the christian faith 2.. No doubt we're in cyberworld and you can't see me and neither do i.. but let common sense and politness prevail thruout this forum..   </p>
              <p>We all have different beliefs' or explanations abt God.. or not believing  in God.. at all.. On my part.. since this is a christian forum..for me i just state my catholic  beliefs openly without resorting to attacks on other faiths. and that's my goal.. not sure for others.. ..</p>

              <p>people can't accept that after their physical lives ended, they'll be gone and forgotten............. they feel they're special and their lives mean something............that ego, the fear of dying and the desire to exist created the idea of a permanent soul/self......................they think they're separate and different from all others...........</p>
              <p>but then they've seen and know people suffer physical deaths..............so they thought '' Ah Ha ! there must be an Eternal After-Life after my mortal life ends !''</p>
              <p>but where will that After-Life be at ?..................so people think it must be a most pleasurable and happy place since who wants to live Eternally in a shithole, right ?...............so let's call that dreamed-up Utopia........Heaven !</p>
              <p>so the next question will be WHO created Heaven ??? well, just as Man has to create the tools he needs..........then SOMEONE must have created Man and Heaven and everything else !</p>

              <p> </p>
