              <p>Agreed</p>
              <p>We have to understand the mindset of primitive men in the past</p>
              <p>The world WAS SO UNPOPULATED AND HUGE THEN. Everything seems so unexplainable. There were no instruments, no technology to help them understand pain, sickness and disasters.</p>
              <p>So religion was really a comforting thing for them. To explain all of these with a supreme being who looks over them.</p>

              Yes, the Bible teaches that all death and suffering has its origins in the rebellion of Adam at the Garden of Eden. That many cultures around the world also hold to something similar supports the idea that there was a common thread of knowledge about the past. The same with animal sacrifices that would take the place of man to atone for sins. Again the Bible contains the true account of history and accounts for the origins of these beliefs and practices.

              <p>That's just how one chooses to use words to describe the contents of the cup. If a cup is filled with water halfway, one is right whether he says half full or half empty, though I would say to use the term "half empty" is pretty oxymoronic and just a playful use of words. Empty means nothing. Half-nothing is really a meaningless term if you ask me. Half of nothing is nothing still.</p>
