              <p>God was and never is a thing or a person. One will never encounter him/her/it/? anywhere. It is in the nameless, formless and a presence and can be only partaken of by (presupposing) one  is utterly awake and sensitive to the presence within him/her self. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If one is abent to one''s being how to be present to the presence of another?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Eg, to simplify, one sees ( and unconsciously carries) a map of a mountain in oneself and the map is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">about </span> how to see, what to see, it is always <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>about</em></span> ....One can be standing right in front of the mountain - one would still miss it. Even when seen it is distorted, adulterated. Why? Cos the map(s) block n project its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">own meaning</span> onto the mountain. It is the same with life with ''god' What is real is missed, what is true is missed. One simply is projecting which is merely psychologcal and the tendency is to stick to that projection(s) cos the fear is the beleif, the knowledge may be rant asunder by what is true.</p>
              <p>PS - Maps are knowledge (dust that gathers on one's inner mirror), conditionings, programming, what society says about ...., what parents say about ... what priests say about .... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To know (knowing)</span> is intelligence, to know is one's experience of ... . It is the willingness to question, the willingness to be open to possiblities of one's folly, one's delusions, one's conditionings and so on so forth.</p>

              <p>Science is behind time of Buddhism. When Buddha said there were living things in a cup of water, people would think that was part of religion because they could not see with their naked eyes. It was much later that scientists proved that there are germs and bacteria in water.</p>
              <p>Wait and see, may be in our lifetime, scientists will prove aliens and rebirth are true. In fact, reincarnation is already proven by scientists but you just do not accept it. May be it is because reincarnation has not much impact in our present life and it does not help much to improve our society, thus very few people pay attention to it.</p>

              <p> Many of you who replied to the thread starter probably quote what you have read in books about the religion mentioned in your replies. Yet how many of you have actually met someone in this lifetime who spoke to God, commune with Him just Like Jesus or other spiritual masters did in entire time? Yet if I said that I have met someone who have realised God in this lifetime, communed to Him and did some very spiritual things for the world, who would believe me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question of God is One single question that surfaced in many forums all over the internet world. People are so interested to know if there is a creator called God. My search since I was a teenager boy has confirmed that there is really a God. This Being or Creator is beyond any definitions. I have the rare privilege to meet someone who realised Him in this lifetime of mine. He is a family friend of Russian President Mikhail Govbachev, Carl Lewis, Boxer Muhammed Ali and musician Ravi Shankar and many more. He came to Singapore a few times, he physically lifted Teresa Hsu </p>
              <p>He lifted 12 elephants in Changmai, lifted airplanes in USA, lifted 7,063 lbs of dumbbells overhead with 1 arm. Dominated for the Nobel Peace award by the government of Iceland, played more than 100 musical instruments. Founded the world longest certified footrace ultramarathon of 3,100 mile, drawn over 200,000 paintings, composed over 20,000 songs. Met Prime Minister Hun Sen, former President Aquino, and many others, unfortunately, did not meet any PAP members because they were too engaged with other matters. He died only 3 years ago. </p>

              <p>dont look at religion so narrowly that will only tell us where we go after death. In fact religion did contribute a lot of great things to out humanity.</p>
              <p>It not only created philosophy for us to learn. it come out with moral value that guide our daily behavior and also help out on our social problem when there are disaster dont they?</p>
              <p>and let not forget about the greats religion leaders and thier legends they created in history. have we ever wondered why we have the most beautiful architecture of the churches, cathedral, mosque and also the Shoalin temple on earth? dont u think that the design of the building is beautiful internally and externally. werent this because of religion?</p>
              <p>how about the alchemist, martial arts and the traditional chinese medicine that the taoist created, dont you think they contribute too?</p>
              <p>have we ever wondered what make the christian crusader went all the way from europe to jerusalem, how about the muslim that fought the holy war. dont you think that they are incredible?</p>
              <p>so after knowing all this, dont you think that we need religion? do you think that where we go after death still matters any more?</p>

              <p>Many people do not doubt there is  God. However, God is just one of the many Gods out there and that is why many religions claim that their Gods are real. I don't believe he is the creator nor he is as powerful as what people think he can be.</p>

              <p>Again assuming nameless and formless and that such single person alone cannot commune or do spiritual things for the world. You cannot assume one's is all powerful yet unable to do anything.</p>
              <p>Why cant intellect that is identified with knowledge, beliefs and/or ...  not with spiritual experience ? Even with extended intellectual capacity, it is still something beyond our comprehension to even fathom what one has just experienced, and the logical conclusion howeve if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains however improbable must be the truth or so we think with our limited understanding of everything.</p>
              <p>I feel your total dogmatic conviction of correctness is akin to  religious fundamentalism which refuses to allow its ideas to be examined or challenged.</p>
              <p>While you propose such fundamental dualism , perhaps the question is whether we are psychologically primed for religion?</p>
              <p>To  considers this important question, which clearly requires a 
              psychological answer, and I do not think I am qualified or even experienced enough to give. Unless you are ?</p>
              <p>While you propose this seperation within ones logic and the externalities to the illogical self-deception and egoism, it still does not discount the idea that the probability of a higher being exists and may or may not even be in this realm and perhaps in a platonic realm of existence.</p>

              <p>That which is pyschological is not eternal (herenow, existential) and that which is psychological is time-bound ( past n future). The thread is entitled eternal hope. Hope is <em>futurizing</em>. Perhaps what was meant was everlasting (which is time-bound) Intellect is acquired thru learning from outside of oneself thru books, parents, schools or theology/ideology and it bound to react to what is. That which transcends psychology is spirit soul or god or whatever one feels resonates with oneself. It is a knowing, a surrender (not to a person or a theology or ..) to what is; an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">acceptance of what is</span>. When one is being kind, being loving, being , a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">process</span>, in being so one is already emobodying the qualities so very much espoused in religion or what-have-you. This person has transcended the duality of what is good, what is ugly or ... (the latter are divisive and a consequence of conditioning or ...)</p>
              <p>Jesus was spiritual. How? His being kind, his being .... So it was with Buddha, Krisha and so many others, too numerous to mention here. Theirs was a spiritual experience shared with human beings. Of course, those around them were open and willing to surrender. The mistake or the erroneous assumption is that it was a  surrender to a person or ... No it is in the disappearnce of one 'self" that the ''merger'' happened or happens. Buddha, Jesus embody the nameless, the formless!</p>
              <p>My standing in a garage does not make me a car nor does my standing in a church or t emple make me spiritual, in the latter it may make me religious, spirituality all said and done is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> transcendence</span> of all creeds, dogmas, theology, ideology and it is thru the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unlearning</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of one 'self'</span> that it may happen or at least an understanding , a knowing. It is the synthesis of poralities that one is free - eg love n hate (actually it is fear!) are not two but non-dual. Human mind divides and chooses and in choosing the split happens within. Hot and cold are not two but one. One can choose and deny or keep  the other at bay. How long? It is mere suppression and it woud surface. It is the nature of existence! <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Religion is learning .... and spiritual is unlearning ....</span></strong> and hence the word spirit! Religion is collective and spirituality is individual. Truth is collective hence the talking about it and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what is true</span> is an individual experience and a partaking of what unfolds </p>
              <p>When one assumes that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">something/someone higher</span> is above us - it is negating oneself, it is disrespecting oneself. It is bondage, it is servitude. It has come about cos of the utter folly of man creating god in his own image (man'' image of ...).</p>
              <p>Lest it is misconstrued - i dont believe or disbelieve and it matters that one is willing to question oneself and be open to possibilites. However and whatever it is unwise to blindly imbibe or follow ....</p>
