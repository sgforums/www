              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hmmmm how much have you people being reading up? There's so much debates on theoretical physics with astronomy about the flaws in the Big Bang Theory. Instead, a group of scientist subscribe to the idea of the initiate universe was inflated instead of an explosion because of the particles movement, the temperature to space ratio which clearly points not to the Bang Theory. And yet, the inflation theory cannot quantify why did the universe "inflates".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Subsequently, in whatever belief that you are in (minus non-creationist) there's creation and since the root word for creation is create and in order to create therefore a creator needs to be present there isn't much of a debate on just this definition</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Now to some others, whether this creator is God or Aliens or some other intelligent lifeforms I honestly do not wish to debate on this because it's a never ending debate which benefits no one. But if you subscribe to creation then the common ground would be that life is created with a being of higher intelligence</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">One suggestion to all including myself. Read up and discuss without making unnecessary comments.</p>

              <p>lastly, we came to this.</p>
              <p>IMHO, why can't people just respect other people and go on with their lives??</p>
              <p>so some people choose to go with their beliefs/religions, but some people think they are above everyone and mount a crusade to "save". Allow me a few words, just let it go.</p>

              <p>When one wears a Badge (organized religion) - be it Islam (Muslim), Hinduism(Hindu), Buddhism(Buddhist), Christianity (Christian) - one is merely a prisoner- one is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bound</span> by so many tenents/???. It limits one in many ways. It is an unfreeing experience, one is in bondage.</p>
              <p>However, when one is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEING</span> Mohd, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being</span> Krishna(?), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being</span> Buddha or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being</span> Christ - one is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">flowing</span> and one is relating to oneself and vice versa. The first ripple of being ...??? emanates from what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one is</span>. One embodies (Buddha-consciousness, Christ-consciousness or ...) consciousness of being eg Christ or .... one is free and one is longer bound to ....</p>
              <p>Sadly, in today's organized religion it is more of rituals and dogmas and doctrines. One is no longer flowing one is merely trapped. I say trapped cos how can beliefs (inherently binding) allow one to expereince or partake of another existentially! The seekers of truth unlearn and discover what comes as it is. Beliefs are an invention.</p>
              <p>Real religion (religiouness) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> one who is loving, being kind, being grateful and I m sure many of us have across such a person. He or she has arrived. He/she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has not alienated the ''God'' within him/herself</span>. Many today are so alienated they go around searching looking for ''God'' (call whatever it may suit u) in a church , temple, mosque or ...</p>
              <p>When one cannot find ''God'' (the name does not matter) within him/herself one cannot find it in a church, temple , mosque or ... even in scriptures, sutras or texts.</p>
              <p> One is already enlightened, it is awaiting <strong>recognition</strong>. How can recognition happen when one is leaning on somehting outside of one''self"' and hope to be ... (enlightened not in the sense of Buddhism or Christianity or ...)</p>
              <p>This is the predicament of many. It is a squirrel in a cage - just going around and around. An inward journey is the essence of being religious.</p>
              <p>All human beings long to be free. I would surmise and dare say that only love frees and of course it presupposes the one who purports to love is him/herself free on the inside. Love that is being kind, love that is being emphathetic</p>
              <p>PS - Has anyone questioned or even wondered how come there is a Christian God, A Hindu God or ... ? Existence is non-dual. Human mind is so divided and hence the utter confusion.' One who is being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">religious is godliness</span> - a fragrance of being ....???</p>

              <p>people can't accept that after their physical lives ended, they'll be gone and forgotten............. they feel they're special and their lives mean something............that ego, the fear of dying and the desire to exist created the idea of a permanent soul/self......................they think they're separate and different from all others...........</p>
              <p>but then they've seen and know people suffer physical deaths..............so they thought '' Ah Ha ! there must be an Eternal After-Life after my mortal life ends !''</p>
              <p>but where will that After-Life be at ?..................so people think it must be a most pleasurable and happy place since who wants to live Eternally in a shithole, right ?...............so let's call that dreamed-up Utopia........Heaven !</p>
              <p>so the next question will be WHO created Heaven ??? well, just as Man has to create the tools he needs..........then SOMEONE must have created Man and Heaven and everything else !</p>
              <p>so.........HEY PRESTO !!!............let's call this dreamed-up Creator/Maker...........God............</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>It's alright if you're not ready to accept any religions.</p>
              <p>And since you're born without the knowledge and need for any religion, certainly you can also die without knowledging the need for any religion.</p>
              <p>So you'll just go back to the dark hole with endless depth from where you came from.</p>

              <p><br>So you tricked yourself into denying the existence of GOD? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>But how do you know your conviction is correct when there are many evidence of people experiencing GOD compared to those who denied the existence of GOD?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Usually, people who denied GOD are people who are not doing well in their society, which I usually labelled them as "SOCIETY FAILURES".</p>

              <p>By the way, an experience with GOD is not a traumatic event, it's a dramatic event.</p>
              <p>But to feed your self-pitying consolation-seeking soul, that's a traumatic event which I won't bother to babysit.</p>
