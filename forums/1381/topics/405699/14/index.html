              <p>I'm no idea why humans created religions. But God created the world. And God so loved the world He gave His beloved son to die on the cross for all our sins. </p>
              <p><sup>19</sup><span style="font-family: 'Charis SIL', charis, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. Romans 5:19</span></p>
              <p>Because of Adam all were made sinners. Because of Jesus's obedience, all were made righteous.</p>
              <p>Now God don't see your sins because you are His child. He sees you the same way as Jesus is.</p>
              <p>Christianity is not a religion, a way of life, etc. It's about having a relationship with our Heavenly Father. God is love. Because of His perfect love for you, you will not sin. I won't say that we humans are perfect and holy. The only perfect one is Jesus. </p>
              <p>Dear brethrens, there is no point in fighting against non-believers. The fight is not ours but the Lords. He will fight our battles. All we got to do is seek Him and He'll do the rest. </p>
              <p>Ignore the devil. The more we focus on them we will be devil conscious instead of God conscious. Set our focus right. Focus on Jesus and Daddy God. </p>
              <p>Let others say what they want, "The Lord will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before your face; they shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways. (Deuteronomy 28:7)<span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"> </span></span></p>

              <p>I have no idea if god created the world, cos I have not seen it. but god was invented by man is irrefutable truth. why I say this? cos its man who preached and propagated it, not god right? man wrote bible or god wrote one, surely not god right? so isnt this proof that man created god concept already?</p>

              <p>despondent,</p>
              <p>For your information, the age of the earth is determined by radiometric dating. It is a process that is very strict and accurate.</p>
              <p>Radiometric dating uses "decay chain" to determine age of rocks and any items, including the Dead sea scrolls.</p>
              <p>The final decay product in all matter, lead-208 can no longer radioactive decay. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Try to click on the link and learn more? Radiometric dating is used to date christian relics, churches, dead sea scrolls and ancient christian scriptures and also most imptantly, the age of the earth </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is tested and proven, which means it is also use to test the age of modern products.</p>

              <p>I thought the answers to the first few questions you should know? You "studied" the Bible "objectively", didn't you? Why don't you tell me what you know and I confirm it?</p>
              <p>Concerning age of human civilisation. Recorded human history dates back to about 5000 years, a dating that I believe sits very comfortably with Biblical chronology. See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history</a></p>

              <p>if you accept the date of dead sea scrolls using radiometric dating, then you must also accept the age of the earth using the same method. Which means, you are most likely wrong about the age of the earth.</p>
              <p>Yes the age of the earth doesnt affect your beliefs in jesus, but you need to admit that you were wrong about the age of the earth.</p>
              <p>If you still insist that radiometric dating isnt accurate to date the age of the earth, then you cannot quote the age of the deadsea scrolls too because they were dated using radiometric dating too</p>

              <p>It is only logical that Christian beliefs are confirmed by the Bible and other Christian websites! Why would non-Christian websites want to confirm any Christian beliefs? While non-Christian websites or books may inadvertently confirm certain Christian beliefs I think as a whole that's not their intention. There is no confirmation bias at all. Rather, I think if you are taking issue with Christian websites you may well be committing the genetic fallacy. In any case, I do quote from secular sources and non-Christian writers as well. You need to keep your eyes open for them.</p>

              The correct analogy would be for me to quote "The university of so and so said this" and you quibble over why I only quote this university.

              So what if a child laughs at my view? Many things we now hold true were once scoffed at when first put forth. Yes, many people in the past did not know of what we now know. But that does not mean you should fall into chronological snobbery.

              <p>2. Special pleading - He can use mostly christian sources but when asked if a muslim can do that, he says he will "evaluate" the sources. And he also have problems if an atheist quotes from DIFFERENT sources.</p>
              <p>But he keeps saying I am the biased one when I take info from BOTH christian and nonchristian sources. For one, I agree the bible has remained unchanged and that jesus did exist as a preacher and I got this info from CHRISTIAN and nonchristian sources.</p>
              <p>But he only quotes from religious sources....and then shoots me down for being "too objective". He also says its ok to be biased.</p>

              <p>He commits</p>
              <p>1. Confirmation bias - use too many christian sources ( I am ok with christian sources but he shouldnt be using MOSTLY christian sources)</p>
              <p>2. Special pleading - He can use mostly christian sources but when asked if a muslim can do that, he says he will "evaluate" the sources. And he also have problems if an atheist quotes from DIFFERENT sources.</p>
              <p>But he keeps saying I am the biased one when I take info from BOTH christian and nonchristian sources. For one, I agree the bible has remained unchanged and that jesus did exist as a preacher and I got this info from CHRISTIAN and nonchristian sources.</p>
              <p>But he only quotes from religious sources....and then shoots me down for being "too objective". He also says its ok to be biased.</p>
