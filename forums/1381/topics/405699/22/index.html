              <p>We are atheists SIMPLY and ONLY because of the lack of belief in gods. Some atheists extend this lack of belief to spirits, angels, ghosts and anything supernatural.</p>
              <p>The main thing we lack belief in is anything that is "supernatural".</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>You got the definition of atheism wrong. Atheism is NOT the lack of belief in God or the supernatural, it is the DENIAL that there is a God or that there is a supernatural realm. Atheism says that matter is all there is. So it is entirely misleading of you to insist that it is the mere lack of belief. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This "lack belief" definition has been popularized, at least, since Charles Bradlaugh (circa 1876). It appears to be preferred so as to escape the philosophic difficulty of proving a negative—God does not exist—and in order to shift the burden of proof to the theist, since the theist is making the positive affirmation that God exists.</span></strong> Under the atheist's naturalism worldview, matter is all there is, so the supernatual does not exist at all. Any claims of the supernatural is simply dismissed as superstitious and irrational and wishful thinking. You know what, Tcmc? You really need to study and know more about atheism here <a href="http://creation.com/atheism">http://creation.com/atheism</a></p>

              <p>my stand and belief is this. all the god religion are becoming obsolete and outdated in this day and age. pls bear in mind that these beliefs were inherited and passed down for a few millennium years. during that era, science &amp; technology were not as advanced now. during that era, religion reigned supreme, as only faiths were required.</p>
              <p>why humans created religion? because of fear? because of fear of the unknown? because of fear of being punished by a supernatural or divine being? fear and in awe of unknown and nature. hence rituals such as praying and offerings, sacrifises of animals and babies, even humans took place. fear that if you do not offer sacrifises, the whole tribe or cavemen will be punished. so you see, fear  is the primary motivation for creating a religion.</p>

              <p>No I dun care about christians belief. but one thing I am concerned is this. christians beliefs are not the truth as far as science and I am concerned. I am also annoyed when christians claimed of good news to be saved when prolsetying, but its an insult when christians said your religion are false and satanic. If I am being truthful, who is more false than true here?</p>
              <p>also why is it stupid to think one has a view in something that doesnt exist? it is stupid for you to think there is something that exists when it doesnt isnt it. look, who is more stupid here I wonder <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>What some of you are against is some Christians aggressive "proselytising", well you should treat it as some aggressive salesman trying to sell you cosmetic face cream. There are so many ways to tell them to go away, but if you choose to believe that it is an insult that you face needs face cream, 'harrr.....you think my face is not nice huh" that is also your perogative.</p>
              <p>I am not concerned if you accept christians belief or not, what i am concerned is when you take on the whole cosmetic industry just because of 1 or 2 aggressive salesmen, then I want to tell you, I use the cream and it works! True or false, I said it before, it is an experience, you don't have it, I have it...who is to say who is right, and how does it matter to you?</p>

              <p>creationism said universe is created out of nothing, but energies are not nothing. it cannot be created nor destroyed. it is a fallacy to say it was created by nothing. is dark matter nothing? is hydrogen and helium nothingness?</p>
              <p>obviously these zealots are narrow minded and refuse to accept that their beliefs are flawed and false. why? because that will indicate their god does not exists.</p>
              <p class="i1"><strong>How did the universe come to be? </strong></p>
              <p>It is perhaps the greatest Great Mystery, and the root of all the others. The rest of humanity's grand questions — How did life begin? What is <a href="http://www.livescience.com/health/050808_human_consciousness.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">consciousness</span></span></a>? What is dark matter, dark energy, gravity? — stem from it.</p>
              <p>"All other mysteries lie downstream of this question," said Ann Druyan, the author and widow of astronomer Carl Sagan. "It matters to me because I am human and do not like not knowing."</p>
              <p>Even as the theories attempting to solve this mystery grow increasingly complex, scientists are haunted by the possibility that some of the most critical links in their chain of reasoning is wrong.</p>
              <p><strong>Fundamental mysteries <br></strong>According to the standard <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060911_mystery_monday.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Big Bang</span></span></a> model, the universe was born during a period of inflation that began about 13.7 billion years ago. Like a rapidly expanding balloon, it swelled from a size smaller than an electron to nearly its current size within a tiny fraction of a second.</p>
              <p>Initially, the universe was permeated only by energy. Some of this energy congealed into particles, which assembled into light atoms like hydrogen and helium. These atoms clumped first into galaxies, then stars, inside whose fiery furnaces all the other elements were forged.</p>
              <p>This is the generally agreed-upon picture of our universe's origins as depicted by scientists. It is a powerful model that explains many of the things scientists see when they look up in the sky, such as the remarkable smoothness of space-time on large scales and the even distribution of galaxies on opposite sides of the universe.</p>
              <p>But there are things about it that make some scientists uneasy. For starters, the idea that the universe underwent a period of rapid <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/map_discovery_030211.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">inflation</span></span></a> early in its history cannot be directly tested, and it relies on the existence of a mysterious form of energy in the universe's beginning that has long disappeared.</p>
              <p>"Inflation is an extremely powerful theory, and yet we still have no idea what caused inflation — or whether it is even the correct theory, although it works extremely well," said Eric Agol, an astrophysicist at the University of Washington.</p>

              <p>creationism said universe is created out of nothing, but energies are not nothing. it cannot be created nor destroyed. it is a fallacy to say it was created by nothing. is dark matter nothing? is hydrogen and helium nothingness?</p>
              <p>obviously these zealots are narrow minded and refuse to accept that their beliefs are flawed and false. why? because that will indicate their god does not exists.</p>
              <p><strong>How did the universe come to be?</strong></p>
              <p>It is perhaps the greatest Great Mystery, and the root of all the others. The rest of humanity's grand questions — How did life begin? What is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/050808_human_consciousness.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">consciousness</span></span></a>? What is dark matter, dark energy, gravity? — stem from it.</p>
              <p>"All other mysteries lie downstream of this question," said Ann Druyan, the author and widow of astronomer Carl Sagan. "It matters to me because I am human and do not like not knowing."</p>
              <p>Even as the theories attempting to solve this mystery grow increasingly complex, scientists are haunted by the possibility that some of the most critical links in their chain of reasoning is wrong.</p>
              <p><strong>Fundamental mysteries<br></strong>According to the standard <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060911_mystery_monday.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Big Bang</span></span></a> model, the universe was born during a period of inflation that began about 13.7 billion years ago. Like a rapidly expanding balloon, it swelled from a size smaller than an electron to nearly its current size within a tiny fraction of a second.</p>
              <p>Initially, the universe was permeated only by energy. Some of this energy congealed into particles, which assembled into light atoms like hydrogen and helium. These atoms clumped first into galaxies, then stars, inside whose fiery furnaces all the other elements were forged.</p>
              <p>This is the generally agreed-upon picture of our universe's origins as depicted by scientists. It is a powerful model that explains many of the things scientists see when they look up in the sky, such as the remarkable smoothness of space-time on large scales and the even distribution of galaxies on opposite sides of the universe.</p>
              <p>But there are things about it that make some scientists uneasy. For starters, the idea that the universe underwent a period of rapid <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/map_discovery_030211.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">inflation</span></span></a> early in its history cannot be directly tested, and it relies on the existence of a mysterious form of energy in the universe's beginning that has long disappeared.</p>
              <p>"Inflation is an extremely powerful theory, and yet we still have no idea what caused inflation — or whether it is even the correct theory, although it works extremely well," said Eric Agol, an astrophysicist at the University of Washington.</p>

              <p>Jacky,</p>
              <p>You obviously missed the truth in your very first statement! You said, "creationism said universe is created out of nothing..." and that is so so true. But your blind spot is that you missed the word "created". Created by who? God. God is omnipotent (here's a Being with infinite power or energy for you). Scientists who are atheists are dumbfounded on many mysteries. Why? Because of their clinging to naturalism and scientism. By rejecting God they invoke all sorts of theories that are even more miraculous than a six day creation!</p>
