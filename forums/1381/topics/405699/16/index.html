              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>Yes indeed religions were created by humans. Even today, humans
              are still creating new religions.</p>
              <p>I also agree that many humans (not all) depend on religion.
              Religion can be good.</p>
              <p>But like any creation of mankind, it can be misused.</p>

              <p>1. You have not answered my question on the other topic.</p>
              <p>2. I say Gods because I am speaking generally. Hindus find happiness in their God, christians in theirs, and muslims in theirs.</p>
              <p>3. Actually do you ever wonder why people only question christianity and christians? Because christians are the ones among the religious people who promote their religion the most. So people will have many questions. Cause and effect. </p>
              <p>Look at hinduism or taoism. They dont promote their religions and that is why no one really questions them. </p>

              <p>1. I am explaining to you why it is more neutral for me to use Gods. Because I am referring to all religions, including yours. So to be neutral, I should not use God but use Gods.</p>
              <p>2. No. Did you get my point?</p>
              <p>Because previoulsy you say that if people dont find happiness in religion, they should stay far far away from religion. You said that correct?</p>
              <p>So I say, yes we WANT to stay far far away from religion but christians keep promoting their religion to people who dont want to hear. That is why many people question christianity and christians. Cause and effect. You promote aggressively, people will question aggressively</p>
              <p>That is why no one questions hindus or buddhists because they dont promote aggressively</p>

              <p>Anyway, here's a good answer I googled. See, you just need to do some simple search:</p>
              <div class="entry-content">
              <p>I’m always amazed that atheists, who advertise themselves as practitioners of reason, are always making arguments that don’t hold water. The thrust of their <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/18/opinion/la-oe-thompson-atheism-20110718"><strong><span style="color: #305cb6;">argument</span></strong></a> is that human beings exhibit many <strong>behaviors that fit nicely with a belief in God</strong>. Since a belief in God meets psychological and social needs, they argue, God can be explained simply as <strong>something invented</strong> to meet human needs. <strong>Therefore</strong>, God does not exist. Since God does not exist, they argue, <strong>John Lennon</strong> was right: “no heaven, no hell, and no religion too.” “Imagine that,” they chortle, picking up on the former Beatle’s iconic song. Specifically, they go to great lengths to point out human behaviors that we all observe, but then draw an arbitrary and unsupported conclusion from those commonly observed behaviors: <strong>that man invented God</strong>.</p>
              <p>Wait a minute! <strong>How does that follow?</strong> Obviously, it does not. Just because I exhibit a psychological need that fits with God does not disprove God. The argument is like saying that because I exhibit a need that fits with Chicago (like wanting to watch a Cubs home game), the Windy City does not exist. Not surprisingly, they assert that the capacity for these behaviors has <strong>evolved</strong>. “Like our physiological DNA,” they assert, “the psychological mechanisms behind faith evolved over the eons through natural section.” Anything humans are, they are as a result of the Darwinian mechanism.</p>
              <p>But again, not so fast. A theistic explanation of those human behaviors flips the equation. If God exists, it is equally plausible that God created human beings with those “God friendly” capacities the authors observe. So the atheistic conclusion, which they attribute to “reason,” is really an unreliable sleight of hand. Sometimes they speak of God as the Big Daddy in the Sky, a simplistic stick figure. That’s the God that atheists don’t believe in. Well, I don’t believe in that kind of God either. Nobody more theologically mature than a fourth-grader believes in that kind of God.</p>
              <p>It is common for atheists elsewhere to <strong>conjure up other caricatures of God</strong>. For example, atheists demand that God always has to be “nice” to people – or else he’s not really God. Or, God has to “prove” he exists, in terms set by the atheist, or else God doesn’t exist. Arguing against a cartoon version of God, a “super-parent,” is an “easy out” for atheists. It lets them escape from the tough but real question – what to do with the claims of the biblical revelation of God.</p>
              <p>If man truly invented God, he <strong>would not have come up with the idea of man’s inability to gain salvation through good deeds</strong>, or the idea of God’s son dying for hostile men to provide that salvation. Those ideas are counter-intuitive to how man thinks. So, in a sense, the atheists are correct in their assessment about the various gods that man has made up. The only problem is that there truly is a real God who doesn’t operate according to man’s wisdom. He’s not bound by our puny concepts that we ascribe to deity. As we’ve seen, we can’t conclude that human needs are “the real roots of religious belief,” nor are they evidence against God. So it does not make rational sense to decide against God based on observations of human psychology.</p>

              <p>1. When we say humans created religions and gods, it means we can trace the creation and beginning of your religion Prior to the existence of the old testament, there was no torah teaching adam and eve. That means humans existed before the torah was even written, or before adam and eve was being taught.</p>
              <p>2. Most major religions roots can be traced today. That is what we mean when we say we invented gods.</p>
              <p>3. Your article is irrelavent because atheists dont say we invented god because we have needs (yes thats one of the reasons but not the main reason) but mainly because all major religions can be traced to their beginnings.</p>

              <p>1. Its not that i dont want to do the tracing for you. It's just that when you can believe that "god wrote genesis1:1 by himself" and that "god dictated genesis to adam" without a shred of evidence, its really quite pointless to point you to real evidence because you dont even understand what real evidence is.</p>
              <p>2. You can even believe that adam was a real person.</p>
              <p>It's like believing that liang shangbo, Zhong Kui or Nezha were real people. Tell me why you dont believe in Nezha or Zhong kUi were real people?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. On  a sidenote, many christians do not believe that adam and eve were literal people. THey believe genesis is metaphorical, stories, to teach them morals.</p>

              <p>1. Its not that i dont want to do the tracing for you. It's just that when you can believe that "god wrote genesis1:1 by himself" and that "god dictated genesis to adam" without a shred of evidence, its really quite pointless to point you to real evidence because you dont even understand what real evidence is.</p>
              <p>2. You can even believe that adam was a real person.</p>
              <p>It's like believing that liang shangbo, Zhong Kui or Nezha were real people. Tell me why you dont believe in Nezha or Zhong kUi were real people?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. On  a sidenote, many christians do not believe that adam and eve were literal people. THey believe genesis is metaphorical, stories, to teach them morals.</p>

              <p>1. You claimed to be able to trace religions to prove their man-made religion. Please provide the support for that claim. Don't go ad hominem on me. What I believe about Genesis 1 has nothing to do with you supporting your claim that all religions are man-made.</p>
              <p>2. If you can believe your ancestors were real apes with no names, why can't I believe my ancestor was a real person with the name Adam? And why should my believing in the Bible requires me to believe every other thing? See the nonsensical and fallacious nature of your reasoning? It's like saying that if I like orange then I must like every other fruit in the world.</p>
              <p>3. Yes, many Christians do not believe that Adam and Eve were real people. Why? Because they have compromised. I can easily refute their beliefs but they can't refute mine. The entire Christian message collapses when we deny the historicity of Adam and Eve. You wanna try defending them just for the sake of debating this? Jesus is called the Second Adam. If there was no real first Adam, then there is no need for the second Adam. And if Adam was not real, then we are not dead in Adam. You can't be dead in a metaphorical person. And if there is no real sin, there is no real fall. What then is the need for a Saviour? Luke traces Jesus' lineage all the way back to Adam. At which point did Jesus' human ancestry becomes allegorical? You tell me.</p>

              <p>1. Nah there's nothing to discuss. It's like me insisting that Nezha is real but i cant give you any evidence for it and then I counter ask you to give me evidence for my religion in Nezha. </p>

              <p>1. You got nothing to discuss because in the first place you claim was a Tcmc-made claim! Duh! I am not asking you about Nezha or what not, so please don't skirt the issue.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, there are fossils. How did they come to be there? When did they become fossils? By what process? How come all over the world there is a deep layer of sedimentary rocks laid down by water that contains billions of fossils? Yes, there is no remains of Adam and Eve. Even if there is, there's no way you can tell or prove it, so this really isn't the issue. The issue is, you believe your ancestor is ape or man?</p>
              <p>3. You complain about me attacking beliefs while all these while you are guilty of that? Sheesh. Anyway, there is nothing wrong with refuting beliefs. You are only upset because you cannot defend your beliefs from my scrutiny.</p>

              <p>Yes the main religions today can be traced to their beginnings.</p>
              <p>For example, Judaism, the Torah can be traced back to about 4000 years ago.</p>
