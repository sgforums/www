              <p>Dude, obviously if I am billigual and have been to Uni before I know the problem of translation. You dont have to be a language expert to know meaning is lost in translation.</p>
              <p>But sorry dude, this explanation does not work when an allknowing, allpowerful and creative god is in the picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really want to explain why the bible contains translation errors/inconsistencies there are a few ways -</p>
              <p>1. "God" was incapable or unwilling or not powerful enough to preserve the meaning through translation, therefore there is no "God" in the picture, merely a religious book written by men</p>
              <p>2. There are errors in the current bible but the original supposedly inspired by God is perfect. (Unproven)</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>If you claimed to be so knowledgeable with translation issues, then why did you harp on "winged creature" as a word used for bats? It wasn't wrong, yet you keep pecking at it and bring up all sorts of efficiency issues just to want to win the argument.</p>
              <p>The meaning of the Bible is NEVER changed. Truth does not change, but our understanding of it does. We align ourselves to the truth, truth is discovered. Likewise the meaning of Scripture is discovered, not determined by us. The doctrine of inspiration extends only to the Autographs. Yes, there's no Autographs in existence today so I cannot prove to you anything on that, but translation issues are handled by textual criticism, and so far the Bible has withstood the attacks of people like you. Are there translation errors? Yes. How we know? Textual criticism. That means we know the truth behind these errors and how they occur. What's lost then? Nothing.</p>

              <p>1. Is "winged creature" an inconvenient word? Inconvenient to who? To Bible bashers only when they know that they don't have a case.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, truths don't change. Of that I am sure. Otherwise, when you are dead in a 100 years and someone says you are a girl will you say it is true? Truth changes mah! Duh!</p>
              <p>3. I already answered you. Inspiration is only extended to the Autographs, not to the copies. But if you failed to marvel at what textual criticism has accomplished for us, then it only shows you are ignorant of it.</p>

              <p>Many reasons why people create/follow religions</p>
              <p>1. Comfort</p>
              <p>2. Explain the the things that they are ignorant/uneducated/unaware of</p>
              <p>3. Friends/Social network</p>
              <p>4. Satisfaction </p>
