              <p>1. Again, please explain what examinations are about. Test of knowledge, or test of one's beliefs? If I take Buddhist study today to learn more about Buddhism and choose to sit for an exam, what should I write in order to pass the exam? Should I be guilty of betraying my own faith if I pass the exam? You tell me.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, you were guilty of appealing to the majority. Also, you have also conceded that for you it is a matter of choice as to who you choose for your authority. Scientists have been wrong on many matters, but the anvil of the Word of God has worn out the hammers of atheists and critics and skeptics for centuries. So the bottom line is that you have chosen fallible men as your "right" source whereas I have chosen the infallible Word of God for my right source. Like I said many posts before it is all about authority.</p>

              <p>You are skirting the question again. Please prove empirically that empiricsm is true. The myth of neutrality was addressed earlier by me. And I also said before that all facts and evidence are interpreted according to one's worldview. You cannot use science to prove your worldview when you are using your worldview to interpret science.</p>

              <p>1. Because I said already for the 1000 times, examinations are a test of knowledge, not a test of your beliefs, nor asking you to vouch for the truth. Gee, I suppose when you sit for your exams they asked you to swear on some holy book that what you write is the truth?</p>
              <p>2. I also understand that when it comes to the Bible you are completely incompetent to read it as it is meant to be read and understood, and so all your objections are merely a projection of your own ignorance and rebellion against God's truth.</p>

              <p>1. Now you are trying to change goalposts to score points even when you know you don't have anything to whack on. Lame sia! Anyway, as I mentioned before which you could not refute, if I write that so-and-so textbook says that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, how is that not being truthful at all?</p>
              <p>2. In the first place, does the word "unicorn" means the white horse with a pointed horn on its forehead? That's what you are thinking of obviously right? Then what makes you think YOUR interpretation of this word is correct? A unicorn would simply mean a one horned creature and it does not necessarily have to mean the imaginary one horn horse we all grew up reading about in fantasy novels.</p>
              <p>3. A person like you who is completely INCOMPETENT to interpret Scripture should not presume to judge those who can. That's just pure arrogance and being presumptuous. Many times these are actually TRANSLATION issues and not errors in facts. And BTW, these articles in Creation.com ought to put you to shame, if you have any sense of decency at all.</p>

              <p>Like it or not, when you translate from one language to another this kind of things happen but causes problems because the meaning of words changes over time, and languages do "evolve" over time. Example is the word "gay" which you can find in the Bible to mean happy but which means same-sex preferences today. But I think you obviously have NEVER studied or read about language or involved in Bible translation work, ya? But then again Bible bashers like you are always eye-balling every word of the Bible and find fault to justify your own unjustifiable rejection of the Word of God.</p>

              <p>Dude, obviously if I am billigual and have been to Uni before I know the problem of translation. You dont have to be a language expert to know meaning is lost in translation.</p>
              <p>But sorry dude, this explanation does not work when an allknowing, allpowerful and creative god is in the picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really want to explain why the bible contains translation errors/inconsistencies there are a few ways -</p>
              <p>1. "God" was incapable or unwilling or not powerful enough to preserve the meaning through translation, therefore there is no "God" in the picture, merely a religious book written by men</p>
              <p>2. There are errors in the current bible but the original supposedly inspired by God is perfect. (Unproven)</p>
