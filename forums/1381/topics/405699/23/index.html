              <p>No, you have the responsibility to decide whether you want to stop to listen to the salesman or not? unless you are underaged and not in a position to decide for yourself, then the law will protect you. If you go in and sign to buy a 3 millions $ house, you are not responsible.</p>
              <p>But if you know that this is a church, a temple and a mosque, and you, an adult, go in and tell them there is no God, what you guys doing are wrong, then you are being insensitive, and rude, and show no respect.... you are worse than the road side sales man, for they sell in a public place, you walk into a place where people worship God!</p>

              <p>you and I jolly well know that this christians explanation was simply simpleton, irrational and warped. read below how far humans has discovered so far and you will amaze. no longer do humans need to believe in god anymore, cos god exists in the figment of their imagination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 20<sup>th</sup> century saw a giant leap in how humans perceive the cosmos. No longer did people assume that the universe was static in size. By looking at how distant galaxies recede from us, we learned instead that the universe is expanding in volume. Tracing the expanding universe backward in time, we imagined a dense, hot beginning of our universe in a finite past. In the middle of the century, we found out that the nuclear reactions in this hot early universe accurately account for the previously mysterious abundance of helium and deuterium. Moreover, we detected a faint afterglow of the big bang that occurred billions of years ago. That the universe began with a big bang is essentially conclusive and may stand as the most profound discovery humans have ever made.</p>
              <p>The big bang, however, is merely a global description of the origin of the universe. Today, particle physicists have consistent theories about the <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/bb_history.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">history of the universe</span></span></a> down to only a trillionth of a second after its birth or even earlier. They can test their theories experimentally with <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/hepaccel.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">particle accelerators</span></span></a> that can simulate events involving enormous energies similar to the condition at the beginning. To learn more about how exactly the universe began, physicists must develop a theory that works at even earlier times after the big bang. Such theory must combine both the <a href="http://www.neutron.anl.gov/hyper-physics/rgeneral.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">general relativity</span></span></a> (because of the extreme gravitational field at the beginning) and <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/quantum.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">quantum mechanics</span></span></a> (because of the extreme compactness of the universe at the beginning). The goal of physics today is to develop this <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/qg_home.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">quantum theory of gravity</span></span></a> so that we may one day understand what exactly happened around the moment of the big bang to get the universe started.</p>

              <p class="infuse">Hawking's position on religion has remained unchanged since he wrote his bestseller, <em>A Brief History of Time</em>.

              <p class="infuse">This quotation is billed in <em>The Times</em> today as his "previous view" on religion.

              <p class="infuse">But Einstein was not really religious. He remarked that "the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously".

              <p>you and I jolly well know that this christians explanation was
              simply simpleton, irrational and warped. read below how far humans
              has discovered so far and you will amaze. no longer do humans need
              to believe in god anymore, cos god exists in the figment of their
              imagination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 20<sup>th</sup> century saw a giant leap in how humans
              perceive the cosmos. No longer did people assume that the universe
              was static in size. By looking at how distant galaxies recede from
              us, we learned instead that the universe is expanding in volume.
              Tracing the expanding universe backward in time, we imagined a
              dense, hot beginning of our universe in a finite past. In the
              middle of the century, we found out that the nuclear reactions in
              this hot early universe accurately account for the previously
              mysterious abundance of helium and deuterium. Moreover, we detected
              a faint afterglow of the big bang that occurred billions of years
              ago. That the universe began with a big bang is essentially
              conclusive and may stand as the most profound discovery humans have
              ever made.</p>
              <p>The big bang, however, is merely a global description of the
              origin of the universe. Today, particle physicists have consistent
              theories about the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/bb_history.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">history of the universe</span></span></a> down to
              only a trillionth of a second after its birth or even earlier. They
              can test their theories experimentally with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/hepaccel.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">particle accelerators</span></span></a> that can
              simulate events involving enormous energies similar to the
              condition at the beginning. To learn more about how exactly the
              universe began, physicists must develop a theory that works at even
              earlier times after the big bang. Such theory must combine both the
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.neutron.anl.gov/hyper-physics/rgeneral.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">general
              relativity</span></span></a> (because of the extreme gravitational
              field at the beginning) and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/quantum.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">quantum
              mechanics</span></span></a> (because of the extreme compactness of
              the universe at the beginning). The goal of physics today is to
              develop this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/qg_home.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">quantum theory of gravity</span></span></a> so
              that we may one day understand what exactly happened around the
              moment of the big bang to get the universe started.</p>

              <p>Fallacious appeal to authority. Is Hawkings an authority on God or theology? However brilliant he may be as a scientist, he is still a limited person and a specialist in his own fields only. Scientists who pontificate on the existence of God are asserting their beliefs about God, for science is INCAPABLE of proving anything that does not fall within the ambits of the scientific method. The danger for people like Hawkings is to insist that what their nets don't catch ain't fish.</p>

              <p>Urrrmmm....I'm not to be included under the "u guys". I don't
              agree that all religions are man-made. At the very least I am
              saying that the Christian religion is "God-made" since Jesus is God

              <p>Of course. I'm just saying that I am not in agreement with "u guys" that all religions are man-made. Only the atheists are in agreement with each other on that.</p>
