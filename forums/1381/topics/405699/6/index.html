              <p>Didn't Christians tell you that God is beyond humans' comprehension ? So how to know God to discover the true meaning of your lives ? Why God created this world and humans ? Who created God. Christians will tell you we cannot question God or God has a plan.</p>

              <p>the Human Ego and Desire to Exist led to the creations of

              they'll be gone and forgotten............. they feel they're
              special and their lives mean something............that ego, the
              fear of dying and the desire to exist created the idea of a
              permanent soul/self......................they think they're
              separate and different from all others...........</p>
              <p>but then they've seen and know people suffer physical
              deaths..............so they thought '' Ah Ha ! there must be an
              Eternal After-Life after my mortal life ends !''</p>
              <p>but where will that After-Life be at ?..................so
              people think it must be a most pleasurable and happy place since
              who wants to live Eternally in a shithole, right ?...............so
              let's call that dreamed-up Utopia........Heaven !</p>
              <p>so the next question will be WHO created Heaven ??? well, just
              as Man has to create the tools he needs..........then SOMEONE must
              have created Man and Heaven and everything else !</p>

              <p>the idea of god has no place in this present era, if this was still in the 19th century, god  idea and teachings are still prevalent and logical to their followers. in this age of knowledge, discovery and enlightenment, alot of new discoveries and technological advancement has reduce the idea of a almighty god concept to a pauper's concept.</p>

ARE ALL THESE QUESTIONS MEANT TO SATISFY YOUR HUMAN MIND AND TO CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT GOD IS HUMAN-LIKE? Humans have a creator and that is GOD. But who told you that GOD must also have a creator or GOD was created? Didn't the Bible stated that GOD existed long before there was Humans?</p>
              <p>Please go and read the Bible and find out the answers for yourself.</p>
              <p>If you try to perceive GOD as a Human, then of course you are not ready to accept or understand any religion.</p>

              <div>God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we

            <div class='col-md body'><p>For me when I think of a world without god and an eternal world, most probably the task for humans is daunting and quite nihilistic. There's no prospect of any hope at all. That's for me where the <strong>Übermensch </strong>(Superman) comes in. When in danger or in some situation when we have to sarcifice ouselves, and we do it knowing full well, we will cease to exist permanently without any redemption, without hope, without joy, without even without. There exists a nothingness but transcended by a noblessness of a true human spirit which revealed its' true form on that moment of realization and follow through knowing full well there's only nothingness in this deed. A truely free human, unshackle by the chains of cause and effects.</p></div>

              <p>The Bible was written many hundreds/thousands years ago and people often tries to take an example out of the pages of the Bible to enslave others for their own personal gains.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind that the morals and wisdoms do not falter even with the passing of time. But the situations and scenarios and lifestyles must be applicable to our current lifestyle if people wish to use those examples to enslave others for their personal gains.</p>
              <p>For example, tidings and offerings. It's not 10% of your money for tidings, it's actually 10% of your harvest. So Go!! and USE 10% of your money to bless and help people in GOD's GRACE, but not to give to a rich and NOT-NEEDY organisation called church. BECAUSE YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR 10% ACTUALLY GOES TO HELP REAL PEOPLE INSTEAD OF BEING CASHED INTO A BANK ACCOUNT OR TRUST FUNDS.</p>
              <p>Churches ALWAYS relate themselves to GOD, but they are no where near GOD.</p>
              <p>WHY DOES GOD NEED 10% OF YOUR MONEY? To shop in Orchard Road is it?? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
