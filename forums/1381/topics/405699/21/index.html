              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ancient people sacrificed children and animals (some still do) to the Gods because they didnt know how to keep themselves safe in times of disasters and they didnt know what caused the disasters.</p>
              <p>So they can only turn to "the Gods"when such things happen. They sacrifice animals and children in hope to appease the Gods.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at what BadMaroz said on the other topic under "konghee", with regards to killing if God told him to.</p>
              <p>He said "<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px;">Given that if we are talking about an Omniscient being here, that knows and can see ahead and commands thee. Not particular Old testament context, but like I said, given the circumstances as I understand it to be, Yes, I will kill woman, children and babies. Its going to be hard.. its gonna be tough, but somebody's gotta do it."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any thoughts?</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>It's not me having double standards, but you completely IGNORING what I have said. And it also shows that you have NEVER been the YEC you claimed to be, since you demonstrate NO KNOWLEDGE of creationist arguments at all and the problems and failures in radiometric dating methods. For those interested and REALLY sincere here's a sampling of the numerous articles asking you to RETHINK the whole radiometric dating methods:</p>
              <p><a href="http://creation.com/radioactive-dating-failure">http://creation.com/radioactive-dating-failure</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://creation.com/radio-dating-in-rubble">http://creation.com/radio-dating-in-rubble</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://creation.com/once-upon-a-time">http://creation.com/once-upon-a-time</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://creation.com/radioactive-dating-no-problem-for-the-bible">http://creation.com/radioactive-dating-no-problem-for-the-bible</a></p>
              <p>About carbon dating? It seems that you are ignorant of the fact that it can only be used to date things that are thousands of years old, evolutionists do not use it to date the age of the earth because they BELIEVE the earth is so old that carbon dating cannot be used. BUT creationists have been using carbon-14 to <em>undermine</em> alleged “millions of years” dates. Since carbon-14 should be decayed so much as to be undetectable within about 100,000 years, then a sample tested by using methods based on <em>uranium decay</em> or <em>potassium argon</em>, etc. which yields a date of 200 million years should not contain measurable amounts of carbon-14 in the sample, and yet such samples <em>have</em> been found! Please see <a title="Baumgardner paper on RATE research (pdf)" href="http://www.icr.org/pdf/research/RATE_ICC_Baumgardner.pdf"><span style="color: #1e80bc;">Measurable <sup>14</sup>C in Fossilized Organic Materials: Confirming the Young Earth Creation-Flood Model</span></a>.</p>

I am also annoyed when christians claimed of good news to be saved when prolsetying, but its an insult when christians said your religion are false and satanic. If I am being truthful, who is more false than true here?</p>
              <p>also why is it stupid to think one has a view in something that doesnt exist? it is stupid for you to think there is something that exists when it doesnt isnt it. look, who is more stupid here I wonder <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
