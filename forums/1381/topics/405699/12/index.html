              <p>There was this documentary on CNA which was shown some time ago. In it, it was revealed that the earliest forms of religion were shamanic beliefs, proably brought about by some young maniac who thought an animal sacrified itself and brought his sister back to life.</p>

              <p><strong>Telling the truth.</strong></p>
              <p>At the inquiry of a train collision accident.</p>
              <p>The gate keeper told truthfully that he was on duty the night of the accident and he did signal the approaching train to stop. He recounted the time he received the message and he got out to the track and wave the red lamp in good time for the approaching train. Everything he did was told clearly and accurately. But the train driver did not heed the signal and smashed into a stalled train. So the gate keeper was not at fault, it seemed so. He told the truth.</p>
              <p>It was found out later, there was no light in the lamp!</p>
              <p>And the moral of the story is.............</p>
              <p>Omission are not lies.</p>

              <p>Beliefs by definition are usually grounded in insufficient evidence &amp; are subsequently based in faith.</p>
              <p>So over and above what we <strong>BELIEVE MAY BE TRUE</strong>, ie does <strong>GOD EXIST</strong>,
               is my particular religion true...etc, as long as what we believe 
              motivates us to be loving, kind compassionate &amp; especially 
              non-violent to others then we should be ok with this. However, we should
               not have to accept behavior inspired by beliefs that causes unnecessary
               suffering.</p>

              When one wears a Badge - be it Islam (Muslim), Hinduism(Hindu), Buddhism(Buddhist), Christianity (Christian) - one is merely a prisoner- one is bound by so many tenents.
