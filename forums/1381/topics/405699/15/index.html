              <p>This is getting boring. *Yawn*</p>
              <p>For the thousandth time, the Consitution provides for the freedom to propagate religion. That's all that needs to be said as far as I am concerned. I don't have to prove that the Constitution did not say that banning evangelism is unlawful. It's a common sense thing if you have even studied any law at all. To disallow what the Constitition permits is unconstitutional and unlawful. If we take this matter to court today I will win hands down. You can bet on that. All I need to prove is that evangelism per se is a freedom protected by the Law. And that I have done. Thank you very much.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>The same argument applies. There is nothing wrong with quoting from atheistic sources or Muslim sources predominantly. It's IRRELEVANT to the merits of the argument itself. If the argument is valid and logical, then so what if it is Christian, Muslim or Buddhist? Beware the genetic fallacy. You keep falling into that.</p>

                  from atheistic sources or Muslim sources predominantly. It's
                  IRRELEVANT to the merits of the argument itself. If the argument is
                  valid and logical, then so what if it is Christian, Muslim or
                  Buddhist? Beware the genetic fallacy. You keep falling into
                  that.</p>

              I think I have read through and responded to most if not all of your posts that unceasingly attack the Christian faith. If I did miss your reply, then please paste the reply here again. All I remember is your unceasing complaint about the Christian answers that IMO is just committing the genetic fallacy on your part. BTW, so what if you find my way of sourcing strange? Being "strange" does not mean being false. Again such claims merely deviate from the need for you to address the articles on the merit of their contents.

              When one concludes what should be at the other end, one is no longer â€™â€™seekingâ€™â€™ but hiding behind oneâ€™s vested interest(s). Also, when something is not an experiential reality for oneself, just talking ABOUT it is tantamount to lying to oneself. That seems to be the predicament that many are oblivous to this mind-games. Trying to intellectualize that which is beyond the comprehenshion or expereince of oneâ€™s existence, is no matter what still a mind game.
               I can go on for aeons about the taste of water, the other can imagine, conceptualize and hope and hope, until he/she is tasting it, there is no living excepting living in the mind - the latter is akin to a squirrel in a cage simply spinning and spinning!

              <p>It matters if some christians (not all christians believe in the 6000 year old thing) believe that the earth is 6000 years old because some of these christians are parents, teachers etc.</p>
              <p>They would be passing the wrong information to their kids and students. Having a religion is fine and sometimes even good, but teaching misinformation like this is just wrong.</p>
              <p>The age of the earth is well proven by the strict process of radiometric dating. Radiometric dating is also used to date dead sea scrolls, christian relics and all other historical items.</p>
              <p>So the only good thing to do is to inform the young earth creationists about the correct information and to stop dwelling in the error.</p>
              <p>It is not because we are prideful. It is because we need to correct the error pertaining to the age of the earth.</p>

              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>Yes indeed religions were created by humans. Even today, humans are still creating new religions.</p>
              <p>I also agree that many humans (not all) depend on religion. Religion can be good.</p>
              <p>But like any creation of mankind, it can be misused.</p>
