              empty, in the same way as either there is a God or there is no God.
              To say there is no water when there is would be making a false
              statement or else it would be self deception. You can't say that
              there is no water and there is water at the same time in the same
              sense. That would be akin to throwing truth out of the window,

              The law of identity and the law of the excluded middle applies in this instance. When we are talking about water in the cup we are just talking about whether there is water or not. We are not talking about air that is present and in a sense fills up the space. This I think forms part of communication.

              Calling it water or h2o is still labeling the same real substance. Where terms are used interchangeably there is no issue. But call water o2 and that would be violating the law of identity.

              <p>I think I answered this before. For something to have created itself would be an impossibility as it involves a contradiction. To be able to create yourself you would need to exist prior to that, but how can that be? So the Bible is logically right in this, that God is eternal. That which is eternal has no beginning and thus does not have a cause, and thus it makes no sense to speak of a creator of an eternal being.</p>

              <p>God created the angels to serve Him and to minister to His people. You can read about what the angels did in the Bible. They were created BEFORE Adam and Eve but still within the creation week. Remember that Adam and Eve were created as the climax of God's creation on Day 6, after which God blessed the 6th day and rested on the 7th day.</p>

              <p>If you would ask me, I think 6 days is too long for God to create the universe! Remember that God is omnipotent. He could create the universe in a blink of an eye if He wanted. In fact, Augustine had this issue with 6 days too, and he believed God created in an instant, but nevertheless he believed in a universe that was not even 6000 years old at the time of his writings. So why 6 days of work and 1 day of rest? You think God needed that rest from exhaustion? No, but so that it would set a pattern for man, to work for 6 days and rest for 1 day, thus this is the basis for our 7 day week. Think about it, the week is the only period of time that has no corrollary in any astronomical body in the heavens.</p>
              <p>As to disasters you are asking a different question, but one which I also have answered before. We live in a cursed and fallen world because of Adam's rebellion against God. See http://creation.com/church-leaders-and-natural-disasters</p>
