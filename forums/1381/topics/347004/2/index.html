              <p>What about the rest of the feasts which Yahweh commanded us to
              keep in no uncertain terms. First deal with that then we can talk
              about the other stuff. How come we don't keep the feasts that
              Yahweh commanded us to keep and yet want to make so important the
              man made feasts? Where is the focus on Yeshua? He was never in
              easter. Yeshua was never ressurected during easter.. he was during
              passover. Easter and passover are two different things altogether.
              Did Yeshua observe easter? I don't think so.</p>

              <p>Did Jesus ever tell us it's wrong to commemorate his ressurrection?  No. </p>
              <p>Did we not focus on Him?  Yes. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like I say before, on Easter day, I will go to church remembering Jesus only.  I am not concerned if 2000 years ago, Easter Sunday was for something else.  I only care today it is for Christian.  I am not concerned whether it was once upon a time linked to paganism, cuz my faith and my God is greater than these paganism and old religion that had died out. This once upon a time pagan festival has been replaced by Christian's biggest feast and celebration -- Celebration for Jesus' ressurrection.</p>
              <p>Easter Sunday was, in the ancient time, for what celebration or what purpose, I don't care.  Cuz it's not going to make me a better person nor draw me away from my God.</p>
              <p>If I am so conscious about the pagan connotation around the pagan Easter Sunday, I am as good as telling you, the whole world and God that my faith in God is so hopelessly small. </p>

              <p>Hence, on the coming Easter Sunday, do you want to go to Church to praise God and celebrate our Saviour's ressurrection; or do you want to stay at home and remember it as a pagan holiday?  You decide.</p>

              <p>Well said and fully agrees with you. Let's focus on our own preparation of Easter than waste time discussing if that is pagan or not....it is really waste of time.</p>
              <p>For those who doubt Easter is about Jesus, attend every Friday's Station Of The Cross prayer starting next Friday (27 Feb).....and remember how Jesus suffered and die to save us.</p>

              <p>easter is about ishtar, eoster, tammuz, nimrod...</p>
              <p>Passover is about Yeshua who is our sacrificial lamb for us.</p>
              <p>Please make this distinction.</p>
              <p>It boils down to this, in Leviticus 23:5, we are commanded to observe Yahweh's passover. Throughout all our generations. No where is it stated that we have to observe easter.</p>
              <p>Easter today still stands for what it did 2000 years ago. It was about
              the mystery religion started by semiramis... and it remains so today.
              The fact that the christian church has absorbed it into the fold still

              <p>The term Easter is usually used in the English-speaking
              countries. In the Eastern church, the term 'Pascha' is used
              instead. It basically is 'Pesach' latinized.</p>

How come we don't keep the feasts that Yahweh commanded us to keep and yet want to make so important the man made feasts? Where is the focus on Yeshua? He was never in easter. Yeshua was never ressurected during easter.. he was during passover. Easter and passover are two different things altogether. Did Yeshua observe easter? I don't think so.</p>

              <p>Christians believe that both the old and the new testaments as set-out in the Christian bible are the inspired word of God.</p>
              <p>The old testament Law as given to Moses is not binding on Christians. It was only ever binding on those to whom it was delievered to, ie: the Jews. That is why Christians do not need to be circumcised (as set-out clearly in the new testatment), offer sacrifices at the Jewish temple, celebrate Jewish feasts like the Passover, abide by various dietary restrictions and follow all the other dictates of the old testament Law.</p>
              <p>Christians belief that God came into this world, through the person of Jesus Christ as a fulfillment of the old Law (ie: to reveal the full intention of God, the divine legislator of the Law), to redeem mankind from sin and death with his suffering, death and resurrection.</p>
              <p>Christians believe that Jesus Christ is our salvation. He was crucified on the day of preparation (Friday) for the Sabbath (Saturday). And on the first day of the week (Sunday), Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to Jesus' tomb and found that Jesus had risen from the dead as told to us in Matthew's gospel (Matt. 28). Christ's resurrection on Sunday is the apex of his salvific work and that is what Christians celebrate on Easter Sunday every year. I don't see anything pagan about it. What else, if not Jesus Christ, do Christians focus on during Easter ?</p>

The same Torah and standard of judgement will apply to both you and the foreigner living with you.</p>
              <p>These "Jewish" feasts that you claim... read again Leviticus 23:1-2</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NKJV-3404" class="versenum">1</sup> And the Yahweh spoke to Moshe, saying, <sup id="en-NKJV-3405" class="versenum">2</sup> “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘The feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim <em>to be</em> holy convocations, these <em>are</em> My feasts.</p>

              <p>Easter.. do a quick google search on the origins of easter.. .read for yourself and understand truth.</p>
              <p>Have you ever stopped to consider that the church teaches half truths and a whole lot of lies? Come back to the word, read it, study it for yourself and see.</p>
              <p>Maybe the church is Mr SA tan's way of luring a whole bunch of people away from the truth of Yahweh.

              <p>easter does not commemorate the ressurection of Yeshua. The time of Passover does. The timing is not correct even.</p>
              <p>you have to go back to the original intent of the celebration of easter, just because it is clothed in a different light still does not make it right. Is a wolf in sheeps clothing a wolf still or a sheep? you then have to go back to the origins as to why the celebration of easter was even brought into the church... do some historical research.</p>
              <p>the point to be made here is man does not dictate to Yahweh how we should worship Him rather we should be led by Him as to how He wants us to worship Him.</p>
              <p>Does the church give the right guidance? So the church knows better than Yahweh Himself what He wants? Certain things are very clear in the bible. You do not need to be a scholar to understand the meaning and the intent.</p>
              <p>Why do you blindly trust the church of ancient time? this has long since been destroyed by the romans. The church today is nothing like what it was like during the time of the talmidim of Yeshua. The church that you are referring to is the whole cause of the problem today.</p>

                                NO you got it wrong. Paul wrote that we should not condemn others who because of their faith believe that eating certain food is forbidden. It's in the bible.

              <p><br> Even if the church lied, those who are lied to and bought into it are innocent.</p>
              <p>Second Christ didn't put so much respect into superficial spirituality. Christ worked on sabbath and even said that God the father is always working.
                                            
                                            You know being a follower of God means experiencing God first hand. So one may be knowledgeable in the scriptures but does that give any good? No. The pharisees in Jesus time proved that ones may be knowledgeable in the scriptures and observing the physical rituals there were but their faith in God was SUPERFICIAL.</p>
              <p>So before condemning other churches it is best for us to reflect inside. We are all at fault at certain point in time in certain issue. We are all sinners. Saved only by the grace of Christ our savior.</p>
              <p>And yes Christ to us is the holy son of God who is exalted in heaven and who is glorified and who basks in the overwhelming light of glory. Christ is no mere man to us.We believe in this and some of us are witness to this.</p>
              <p>It's best not to judge things to the extreme because our judgment is flawed thus when taken to the extreme, flawed extremely. Remember that God is all knowing and take rest in that no matter what because He is a Holy God. Who are we to condemn those who are not our own servant . Or do you trust that you are a better judge than God? Let it be pal let it be.</p>
              <p>Look at the holy spirit it works just as much in the Roman Catholic church as it does in other churches. Don't deem the whole basket rotten just because some of the apples are. And I strongly believe that we are not saved by the truth of our doctrines but by the truth of our heart in Christ.</p>

              <p>You know we should ask ourselves WHAT IS TIME.</p>

              <p>Say that you are at your 50th birthday today. Does it mean that if you went back at the exact minutes of your then birth time ,exactly 50 years back you would find yourself being born? NO. You might even be off by weeks or even more.</p>

              <p>easter does not commemorate the ressurection of Yeshua. The time of Passover does. The timing is not correct even.</p>
              <p>you have to go back to the original intent of the celebration of easter, just because it is clothed in a different light still does not make it right. Is a wolf in sheeps clothing a wolf still or a sheep? you then have to go back to the origins as to why the celebration of easter was even brought into the church... do some historical research.</p>
              <p>the point to be made here is man does not dictate to Yahweh how we should worship Him rather we should be led by Him as to how He wants us to worship Him.</p>
              <p>Does the church give the right guidance? So the church knows better than Yahweh Himself what He wants? Certain things are very clear in the bible. You do not need to be a scholar to understand the meaning and the intent.</p>
              <p>Why do you blindly trust the church of ancient time? this has long since been destroyed by the romans. The church today is nothing like what it was like during the time of the talmidim of Yeshua. The church that you are referring to is the whole cause of the problem today.</p>

              <p>I thought this article is quite enlightening regarding the claim of Easter being a pagan holiday - <a href="http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1999/9903chap.asp">http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1999/9903chap.asp</a></p>
              <p>I think we all need to keep things in perspective, and to remember that the vast majority of churches have celebrated Christ's resurrection on Easter Sunday for many many centuries already. Suddenly, it is now pagan? Out of curiosity, would it be better if 'xyz day' is now set aside on another day to celebrate the Lord's resurrection? My point here is that it is the purpose of the day that is important, not the actual history of the date itself. We celebrate Easter to remember the greatest self-sacrificial act of love that enables us to live in the hope of seeing His face one day. </p>
              <p>How are we 'led by Him' to decide how to worship? Do we know better than the church on the 'right' way to worship Him? Even many things that are 'very clear in the bible' cannot be agreed on by different individuals. Mr S A Tan himself quoted scriptures to tempt Jesus! And you will be surprised as to how the church of today so closely resembles the church that the early Christians belonged to. </p>
