            <div class='col-md body'>To the TS and stupidissmart:<br><br>My understanding of how the universe cannot exist by itself:<br><br>1) Everything which has a beginning has a cause (hence Christians assert that God is the uncaused cause because of Genesis 1:1 - In the beginning, God...) e.g. to say before we had a beginning, God was already there.<br><br>2) Universe has a beginning (Big Bang or whatever)<br><br>3) Therefore the universe has a cause.<br><br>I'm not intentionally trying to force God into the picture, but even if Big Bang did happen, where did that come from?<br><br>EinsteinÂ’s general relativity, which has much experimental support, shows that time is linked to matter and space. So time itself would have begun along with matter and space.<br><br>Since God, by definition, is the creator of the whole universe, he is the creator of time. Therefore He is not limited by the time dimension He created, so has no beginning in timeÂ—God is Â‘the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternityÂ’ (Is. 57:15). Therefore He doesnÂ’t have a cause.<br><br>My faith cannot be man's interpretation and creativity because the very ideas it expounds are counter intuitive. Among the many others which i will not expound further are THe Beatitudes, some thing i believe if you are a serious investigator would have surely known about.<br><br>Another thing is (we've to include the authority of the bible here; something which i will discuss later) it would have been easier to say that Jesus resurrected in the spirit and not in the body. It would have been easier for the supposed person (s) manufacturing Christianity to say that Jesus rose in the spirit, rather than to say Jesus rose bodily. And guess what, people touched him and felt him and saw his nail marks. So there, the claims of Jesus' resurrection.<br><br>So, very briefly, i don't believe that man are stupid to create this kind of story which would be so hard to convince.<br><br>Abt the other claims of other religions, we would have to analyse and deconstruct carefully, and i dont thk i can answer to the best of them. But what i know from the Protestant Christian pt of view, i can share with you. Indulge me here, but i suspect Buddhism isnt really religion about deities and gods, rather more of a philosophy. Buddha certainly didnt claim to be the supreme god.<br><br>The reasoned Christian faith doesnt boastfully claim (do i sound like im boasting?), but truth, by definition, is non contradictory. E.g. something cant be both purple and white at the same time.<br><br>Evolution. U make a very bold stand that there is "NO evidence" against evolution... care to back up your claim?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   The burden of proof is also upon u since u jus made this claim, since this is also something that "be seen or observed from a general point of view".<br><br>And while ur at it, i shall state mine.<br><br>1) If everything evolved from something, what was the first thing? And who put it there?<br><br>2) Evolution works on an assumption of millions of years for its hypothesis to work. Without going into much details, isnt carbon dating faulty in itself? And makes lots of assumptions?<br><br>My point is i dont think evolution has tons of evidence to suggest it's true and that it is irrefutable. And of course, science, u say, has not reached maturity, yet u claim to believe something that is not conclusive, isnt that a faith then? Piltdown Hoax, as i raised, was an example that science is just that, unable to define truth and at the very very best, uncertain.<br><br>Ptolemy, this guy who lived in 2nd century and very much a scientist, said the planets revolved around the earth. It took mankind at least 11 centuries to refute that, when Copernicus and Gailileo came along. Yes, science really hasnt reached maturity.<br><br>stupidissmart, i think compared to Christianity, the atheistic system IS out of the ordinary. Not until Darwin and Huxley came along, did people formally refute the existence of God. Not until the Bastille came down, was the roots of atheism formalized. So compared to the study about the existence of GOd, atheism is the new kid on the block.<br><br></div>

It is through, not because of, science that the monitor works and like I said, you are once again trying to seperate God from Science which you can't do.<br><br>Science is the study of pretty much the world around us and the entire universe, etc. God is part of that universe and God is part of the world around us from what Christians believe and if God is real, which I believe he is, and if humans are smart enough, we'll one day be able to somehow prove the existence of God.</div>
