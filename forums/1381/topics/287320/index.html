U assume everything to have a reason for existence (why must everything have a reason for existence ?) but do not give such a criteria for god. Just put it tis way, if u can believe god do not need to be created or need a reason to exist, why don't u just bring tis down one level to the universe, and tat it do not need to be created or a reason or it to exist.

Tis is because claims is cheap.<br><br>I can claim tat there r invisible unicorn on the planet. Can u prove me otherwise ? Nope. Then it is true ? Can u prove Star war to be false, tat is some galaxy far far away got a Luke Skywalker ? U can't too. So Star War is a true story ? Can u prove Ju On never exist ? Tat is some ghost tat kill all the people who knew of its existence ? U can't too.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br><br>God is the uncaused being. Genesis (in the bible) puts it, "In the beginning, God..."<br>Perhaps the question to ask for us believers is "beginning of what?" If God is uncaused, does he have a beginning?

            <div class='col-md body'>Good points. Lemme try to answer them to the best of my knowledge.<br><br>The atheist as well as the believer are both making a claim from their respective stance, hence both have the burden of proof upon themselves, not just the believer. The believer says that God exists, the atheist says that he does not. Both are effectively making a claim.<br><br>I cannot disprove the existence of an invisible unicorn (or etc) in your mind, but bear in mind that there are people who have illusions of such and more, and we normally put them in asylums.<br><br>Of course the fact that MASSES of people believe in a religion doesnt make it more justified than that of the other viewpoint, but pls bear in mind that Science is also flawed in this aspect.<br><br>Science hasnt disproved the existence of star wars, or Ju On, or Luke Skywalker or whatsoever, neither does the Word of God, and i only dare say it remains inconclusive, bordering on unbelief for me. But let us bring the argument back to what we DO perceive and can know about. That of God, Science and creation.<br><br>Have you ever seen evolution happening? Or is it deduced? Have you ever seen the Big Bang or is it just the result of immense calculation or computer modeling? My point is that science itself cannot adequately explain or conclusively affirm a certain fact. What is scientifically proven one day, can be disproved the very next, and we've seen many examples of that. In my memory, the Piltdown Hoax is one.<br><br>Bertrand Russell once asked if he meets God after death, what would he say? He replied smugly, "Not enough evidence, God. Not enough evidence." Of course, he should have gotten his answer by now.<br><br>I cannot give you all the evidence in the world, even i am still looking for them. But i remain open and i review literature from both sides of the story, and i invite you to do the same.<br><br>It is true that there are many religions in the world, due to man's wilful interpretations and creativity? But as far as i know, only ONE has said that He is God, and He is the only way to God and eternal life. That of Jesus Christ. No other major religion has made that claim.<br><br>But if you want more evidences and argument about Christianity, we can talk until the cows come home. But in the meantime, if you're open, you can read from Lee Strobel (The Case for Faith, and his other stuff), Ravi Zacharias (The real face of atheism) , Allister MacGrath (The Twilight of atheism)<br><br>THese are Christian authors, from the other perspective you can read into Richard Dawkins (The God delusion: for the response to this: pls refer to Alvin Plantinga's response - http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2007/002/1.21.html) , Bertrand Russell.<br><br>B4 u say im skewed in my reading, i admit it is. Cos i'm a believer after all, but if you can recommend me some stuff from ur perspective, great.<br><br>About the reason for existence part, i'm not really understanding u.  Say i push all the qns up one level then. So the universe came to exist by itself? But God is still another level higher. Which definition is greater? The universe or God? I did give a criteria for His existence, which was Himself. The uncaused cause.<br><br>And why doesnt everything have a reason for existence? Everything serves a purpose right? Can you say that something is just there without reason? Like what?<br><br>While we're on this topic, can i ask you in your atheistic beliefs, how does the concept of morality come about? How do we determine whats right or wrong?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS, you're asking if god exists or has a beginning (stg like that). I assume u mean the God of Protestant Christians, of which i count myself as. Trinitarian, omniscient, omnipotent, and can only be known thru Jesus Christ. Not thru ourselves, or can be "found" everywhere - that would be new ageism and animism.<br><br>I'm not a religious scholar or theology student, but these are just somethings that interest me and have made me evaluate my faith. I believe that Christianity as a belief system can withstand the most intellectually rigorous examination. Of course, i'm just an acolyte in this area, and i dare not say i know much. But if you put God in the centre of everything, i believe it will be a good fit.<br><br>God cannot be created nor destroyed. Then we might as well worship the one who created God, and find another name for it. But your point being? As i've said, God is uncaused. He is sufficient in and of Himself.<br><br></div>

It is not something tat can be seen or observed from a general point of view. <strong>It is something out of the ordinary</strong>. U cannot say tat non believer also made a claim in tis case. It is because they did not assert a fact which is not observed, unlike the christian. Just remember the unicorn example. I claim something out of the ordinary and have to prove it. The others r not claiming anything which is out of the norm.<br><br><blockquote>I cannot disprove the existence of an invisible unicorn (or etc) in your mind, but bear in mind that there are people who have illusions of such and more, and we normally put them in asylums. </blockquote>To be frank a lot of people who claim they see god or god talking to them r in asylums too<br><br><blockquote>Have you ever seen evolution happening?

It leaves tons of evidences tat points to it being true. Not only tat NO evidence ever point evolution to be wrong. Big bang is also believed to be true because there r many evidences tat points to its existence. It is not as virgourous as evolution though and it can be proven to be wrong, or in another form.<br><br>U can say tat science has proven one day being proven to be wrong the next but take note most of them have not reached maturity as well as scientific fact tat has not been conclusive. The more established scientific theories and laws which had undergone many scrutinies over time r seldom shown to be wrong.<br><br>The piltdown hoax is proven to be wrong by science itself because it is naturally able to weed out lies and hoax. If someone sometime add a line into the bible on its own, can it be detected ? Nope. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>It is true that there are many religions in the world, due to man's wilful interpretations and creativity?

According to icemoon islam claim jesus is just a prophet. Since it made such a claim then it is true ? Buddhist also claims deities and god belong to just a realm, and it is not the highest realm.

No god is needed then and there is no level higher.<br><br>If u wanna give a criteria for god, I can also give a criteria for universe which is the "uncaused cause". If u believe everything have to be "caused", then tat everything have to include god too. If u believe tat something can be "uncaused" then tat thing can very well be the universe.<br><br>Then everything remains unanswered. Wat is the difference when u say "god is the uncaused cause" from saying "god way is higher than men and we do not knew"</div>
