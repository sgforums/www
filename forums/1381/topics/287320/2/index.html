Let's say I take a pregnant monkey, wait for it to give birth and then kill the mother and put the babies in a room which is similar to its natural habitat.<br><br>So the monkeys start to form a community and grow up, all of which have no idea of the existence of anything outside the room. But then they start to find that the trees and plantlife planted in the room have traces that they weren't there to begin with i.e. the gardening tools. So the monkeys (pretty smart monkeys I guess) conclude that their universe (the room) was created by the synergy and coming-together of gardening tools.<br><br>All evidence supports their theory because it is true that I did use the gardening tools to create their universe but they still have no way to prove my existence. So technically, because I created their universe I am their 'god'. Some monkeys start to believe in a creator (me) even though they have no evidence of my existence and there's no way they'll find evidence of me because I'm not part of their universe (their room).<br><br>Although they might advance in technology by creating crude tools they will never be smart enough to comprehend my existence because they're monkeys.<br><br>See a similarity? When you say where the Big Bang came from I could just ask where did that come from and it'll keep repeating until you get to the last thing which is the thing that has always been there and has no beginning. That entity is God. And perhaps God created the chain of events called the Big Bang, maybe he didn't, who's to say?<br><br>Science doesn't go against religion, it merely proves how the world works. If we were smart enough we'd be able to prove the existence of a God with science somehow but the thing is, we aren't. We're like the monkeys. Us trying to comprehend the existence of God is like a monkey trying to comprehend how the stock market works. We don't have the intellectual capacity to do so.</div>

How did the concept of zero meaning nothingness come about? You could have as many circular arguments as you want, but you still can't truly explain how nothingness came about. We therefore say zero is an axiom.<br><br>Similarly, God to the Christians is an axiom. There is no real need to explain why He came about, neither is there a pressing concern to describe how He came about. He just is, like nothing is nothing. Besides, asking the question "Who created God?" is irrelevant, because it implies a sense of time; that something had to come before God. That argument in itself is flawed, because if time had not been created then, how can something be said to be before God and create Him? We're talking about the beginning of time, remember?</div>

I, for one, prefer a more logical approach in dealing with the creations of God (read: NOT God; to me He is an axiom). Taking Genesis literally is rather silly. I find that the seven days in Genesis were more of seven epochs. Evolution is also a valid theory. What's to say that God did not create proto-animals in Genesis and then through the Laws of the Universe set down by Him, evolution occurred over the years? You have to realize that in trusting that those scientific theories are accurate, it does not mean I have to discard my faith.  To quote Palmer Joss from Carl Sagan's novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Contact</span>, "...it makes God very big." Similarly, I am in greater awe of the creations of God through the revelation of these things.</div>
