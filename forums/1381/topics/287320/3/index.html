            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>It's not about choosing sides. I, for one, prefer a more logical approach in dealing with the creations of God (read: NOT God; to me He is an axiom). Taking Genesis literally is rather silly. I find that the seven days in Genesis were more of seven epochs. Evolution is also a valid theory. What's to say that God did not create proto-animals in Genesis and then through the Laws of the Universe set down by Him, evolution occurred over the years? You have to realize that in trusting that those scientific theories are accurate, it does not mean I have to discard my faith. To quote Palmer Joss from Carl Sagan's novel, Contact, "...it makes God very big." Similarly, I am in greater awe of the creations of God through the revelation of these things.</blockquote><blockquote>example is the death of Judas<br><br>some authors wrote he hang himself , then he fell<br><br>and his head hit onto a rock and thus up the lorry<br><br>or intestine split out and died<br><br>etc </blockquote>Then doesn't tat give the idea there is something wrong with the bible because wat is says isn't true and even contradictory ?</div>

It's not the concept of God or deities - those helped establish society by allowing people to have a common identity (I could be mistaken, but please neglect to argue on that point, we don't need to get irrelevant). Rather, it's the concept of "We-are-the-people-who-can-speak-to-the-Higher-Being-and-thus-you-must-follow-us-and-obey-us" concept that has led to what we tend to see of religion today. It's not the religion that has the problem, it's the people who have the problem.<br><br>Besides, it's your opinion.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jondizzle foshizzle:</div><div class="quote_body">Ah but why must u seperate science from religion? Let's say I take a pregnant monkey, wait for it to give birth and then kill the mother and put the babies in a room which is similar to its natural habitat.<br><br>So the monkeys start to form a community and grow up, all of which have no idea of the existence of anything outside the room. But then they start to find that the trees and plantlife planted in the room have traces that they weren't there to begin with i.e. the gardening tools. So the monkeys (pretty smart monkeys I guess) conclude that their universe (the room) was created by the synergy and coming-together of gardening tools.<br><br>All evidence supports their theory because it is true that I did use the gardening tools to create their universe but they still have no way to prove my existence. So technically, because I created their universe I am their 'god'. Some monkeys start to believe in a creator (me) even though they have no evidence of my existence and there's no way they'll find evidence of me because I'm not part of their universe (their room).<br><br>Although they might advance in technology by creating crude tools they will never be smart enough to comprehend my existence because they're monkeys.<br><br>See a similarity? When you say where the Big Bang came from I could just ask where did that come from and it'll keep repeating until you get to the last thing which is the thing that has always been there and has no beginning. That entity is God. And perhaps God created the chain of events called the Big Bang, maybe he didn't, who's to say?<br><br>Science doesn't go against religion, it merely proves how the world works. If we were smart enough we'd be able to prove the existence of a God with science somehow but the thing is, we aren't. We're like the monkeys. Us trying to comprehend the existence of God is like a monkey trying to comprehend how the stock market works. We don't have the intellectual capacity to do so.</div></blockquote>I like your post.<br><br>If you find that nobody is quoting your post it means that they dont disagree with what you say. which is good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
