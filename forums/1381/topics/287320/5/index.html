            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>My understanding of how the universe cannot exist by itself: </blockquote>Lets put the story in tis perspective.<br><br>The objective of the "universe" exercise is because no one really know wat started everything in the first place. Even if I can show big bang is true, and tat some other event caused the big bang, u will still keep asking wat create tat other event and so on and so forth it never end. In the end, we have to come out with the idea tat something is created out of nothing.<br><br>And wat does the christian do. They did not provide any answer how the universe is created or the mystery how everything started off. They just made a claim tat there is some being called god and it do not need to be created. It simply just avoid the question altogether by making an unsupported claim exploiting the word "definition" or "axiom" (which equal to assumption).<br><br>And claims r very cheap. I can also claim event (notbeing) Bangondadabo happened and tat event, by my definition, create the universe and is an uncaused cause. Tis argument carries as much water as the god argument and the only thing I do is just anyhow define another thing and give it a characteristic tat it do not need to be created and other hocus pocus. It is just naming and defining an imaginary unproven thing<br><br>In other words, tat does not answer the original question how the universe is created or how everything is created. It just name tat unknown event as "God" then totally ignore tat question and play with words<br><br><blockquote>My faith cannot be man's interpretation and creativity because the very ideas it expounds are counter intuitive. Among the many others which i will not expound further are THe Beatitudes, some thing i believe if you are a serious investigator would have surely known about.<br><br>Another thing is (we've to include the authority of the bible here; something which i will discuss later) it would have been easier to say that Jesus resurrected in the spirit and not in the body. It would have been easier for the supposed person (s) manufacturing Christianity to say that Jesus rose in the spirit, rather than to say Jesus rose bodily. And guess what, people touched him and felt him and saw his nail marks. So there, the claims of Jesus' resurrection. </blockquote>If I am not wrong, u read all of them from the bible isn't it ? The whole question is why do u believe the bible is right, and showing evidence from the bible is not convincing. If god wanna make it easier, christ just need to carry on living till now and I am sure everyone will believe in him. Why kill him and make everything so secretive tat no one really know wat christ even look like.<br><br><blockquote>So, very briefly, i don't believe that man are stupid to create this kind of story which would be so hard to convince. </blockquote>I heard of more stupid things like UFO and throwing aliens into volcanoes and their anguish spirit go to humans making them unhappy and frustrated which require some expensive holy items to expel them. Last time I heard they got a large following<br><br><blockquote>Evolution. U make a very bold stand that there is "NO evidence" against evolution... care to back up your claim?  The burden of proof is also upon u since u jus made this claim, since this is also something that "be seen or observed from a general point of view". </blockquote>My god, u don't believe in evolution ? Even the pope believe in evolution and u don't ?<br><br>I can name a lot of things tat show evolution. Nylon eating bugs (nylon is man made), changes observed in domestic animals (they can not survive in the wild), new found strains of virus tat r more drug resistant (discovered in recent times only), changes in banana (banana originate from one source and require men to make it continue its species), observed fosils (gradual changes over time from ape to men)<br><br>I offer a challenge for u. Find me a website from a reputable scientific organisation tat reject evolution and support intelligent design. I offer tis challenge to many in the past and no one ever show me any before. I can show u many website if u like. Trust me, I have debated in tis topic for donkeys years and donkey times<br><br><blockquote>1) If everything evolved from something, what was the first thing? And who put it there? </blockquote>The scientific answer is some simple cell organism. No one put it there, it just occurs. We have very limited knowledge on it but those r safe assumption from evidence. Wat do u suggest ? Got evidence ?<br><br><blockquote>2) Evolution works on an assumption of millions of years for its hypothesis to work. Without going into much details, isnt carbon dating faulty in itself? And makes lots of assumptions? </blockquote>Carbon dating is found to be highly accurate and is still the method to date items. Furthermore, it do not need carbon dating to prove life begin long time ago. Tree rings (1 ring = 1 year ) have shown to prove life starts off much earlier than 6000 years. U got problem with tree ring ?<br><br><blockquote>My point is i dont think evolution has tons of evidence to suggest it's true and that it is irrefutable. And of course, science, u say, has not reached maturity, yet u claim to believe something that is not conclusive, isnt that a faith then? Piltdown Hoax, as i raised, was an example that science is just that, unable to define truth and at the very very best, uncertain. </blockquote>U r very deluded. I think of all the people here I can say tat. Evolution had reached maturity and evolution is considered a fact. If evolution is wrong, then the whole field of biology is wrong<br><br>Piltdown hoax is simply hoax made by malicious people but it is found to be wrong and corrected by scientific organisation. Same as the korean scientist tat fake scientific result. However for facts like evolution where it face scrutiny from many people, especially christians, and still hold, then it is a matured fact.<br><br><blockquote>Ptolemy, this guy who lived in 2nd century and very much a scientist, said the planets revolved around the earth. It took mankind at least 11 centuries to refute that, when Copernicus and Gailileo came along. Yes, science really hasnt reached maturity. </blockquote>He, like aristotle, r not scientist in the sense of the word because they do not use the scientific method.<br><br><blockquote>stupidissmart, i think compared to Christianity, the atheistic system IS out of the ordinary. Not until Darwin and Huxley came along, did people formally refute the existence of God. Not until the Bastille came down, was the roots of atheism formalized. So compared to the study about the existence of GOd, atheism is the new kid on the block. </blockquote>Com'on, if u think history is everything, then zorastrians or other form of idol worshipping r right. In fact, hinduism, buddhism or judaism have a much longer history than christianity. And during tat time, there r already people who do not believe in it and they r atheist in a sense. In fact, when a belief start, atheist is already present since there r people who refute tat belief. It is as old as mankind civilisation.<br><br>Who is the real new kid of the block ? Christianity ba. It is probably the youngest official religion (if u seperate catholic with christianity)</div>

Up until now, i've waited for u to show me some of ur evidence to back up ur argument, but all i've heard is just ur viewpoint, backed up by nothing but urself.<br><br>Firstly, im curious about ur background as to how much you know about Protestant Christianity before you even slug it.<br><br>True, Protestants didnt come about until 1500s (official?) but we still hold to the authority of the Jewish Torah (i.e. Judaism) AKA first 5 books of bible, including Genesis. How the Church developed since the first century, i'll leave u to read it for urself if ur genuinely interested. But in that sense, Protestant Christianity can share its common history with Judaism (limited) and so, its beliefs are just as old as Judaism's.<br><br>Which incidentally, if u logically deduce, we believe in Genesis, i.e. to ask should that make us the oldest religion then? Notice i used the word "formalized" to describe atheism? I refer u to the easily accessible wikipedia (for lack of better resources to show u over the net)  to define this word: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism<br><br>[url]<br>Notice the line "first attested in about 1571" and subsequently, "Atheism was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the monotheistic Judeo-Christian God."<br><br>The concept of atheism has existed for a long time. But i brought up the topic of its formalization to argue against u saying that the existence of God is out of the ordinary. In actual fact, people have always believed in God for the past 10 over centuries (the intellectual atmosphere at that time plus it was usually the priests and monks who were the learned persons) until people came along to refute His existence.<br><br>So again, who's the new kid on the block?<br><br>Ptolemy:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .. So i supposed there was no real scientist until 1833? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist<br>Read up on him first k and see if he's "scientific" enough for ur taste: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy<br><br>Evolution ... ahh can never run away from it. I dont think by evolution alone being wrong, it can overturn a whole field of biology. It's really not so dichotomous. My point in bringing up the Piltdown hoax, if u read carefully, is to bring up the fact that science really isnt so mature as u "claim".<br><br>Carbon dating ... accurate? I dont think so.... http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab/does-c14-disprove-the-bible<br>And dont fault me for using this site... read on first..<br><br>Tree rings... nope .. dont work for me.. sounds like circular argument... then how are u certain that tree rings are accurate without a fault? http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/FAQ22.html<br><br>Simple cell ...

I've made known to them but they keep either pestering me to join if not trying to show me that I'm so going to regret by not choosing jesus. -.- they certainly have no respect for other religions and other people outside their circle of religion.<br><br>My only wish is that the church do something about what I've encountered with christians. If they can't change these christians attitude, at least stop producing more of such christians. I don't expect immediate effect, at least show me they are doing something about it? the mega churches to me, its more of business than religion.</div>

When u return at the end of the day, Glass B now has water in it an Glass A is empty. You could assume that sm1 took the water from Glass A and put it into Glass B.<br><br>That, how ever doesnt fully explain the situation because u notice that Glass B has 4 ounces of water in it, whereas Glass A had only 2 ounces in it when u left in the morning.<br><br>U are confronted with a problem that at best has only a partial explanation. Whether the water from A was poured into B is debatable. But what is beyond debate is that all of the water in B could not have come from A. The additional 2 ounces had to come from somewhere else.<br><br>God has put enough into the world to make faith in him a most reasonable thing. and he has left enough out to make it impossible to live by sheer reason or observation alone. Science may be able to explain the 2 ounces in B. It cannot explain the 4 ounces in it. </blockquote>First, in the real world it is obvious tat someone had done something to the glasses. If u want to illustrate tat there r many unknowns in the world, u r right.<br><br>However just because there r many unknowns doesn't mean u can add in any stories u like and throw all the unknowns into tis story and claim it answer everything when in reality it doesn't answer any.

I have already stated tat established science is seldom shown to be proven wrong, especially in recent times. Furthermore, I have already mentioned the burden of proving god lies on the believer. Tis is because u r making an extraordinary claim and u have to back it up with evidence. Otherwise it is just fiction.

How about christianity ? They backtrack often as well. They start inquisition and backtrack, they start crusades then backtrack, they claim sun revolves around earth and backtrack, they even say earth is flat before and then backtrack, they support slavery before and then backtrack, they support Hitler before and then backtrack. If science is uncertain of itself, religion don't know anything for sure.</div>
