            <div class='col-md body'>Having come from a mega church myself, I had also been drawn into all the activities and meetings. Initiallly, it felt as if it was the right thing to do, especially when the church leaders are preaching about honoring God 100% with our time &amp; moneyÂ… their favorite line of teaching goes something like this: if you honor God first (with your time, money, etc.), God will also honor you back by multiplying your time, money, etcÂ…<br><br>I now realise that that is a really dangerous teaching, cos it misleads people, esp. youngsters, to think that they are doing the right thing by sacrificing all their time and energy to be involved in church-related activities all the time! Some youths were overheard talking about skipping school to attend the churchÂ’s mega youth conference this year (2007)! That is so unwise!<br><br>There is a time &amp; season for everything. When you are a student, your first duty is to honor God by doing well in your studies. As a child of your parents, your duty is also to honor God by honoring your parents, i.e. you need to spend more quality time with them and take care of them. Do the right things first. That is wisdom and common sense. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

While religion has never been separated from violence and vice versa, whether it is advocated explicity is another issue altogether. History is on my side if I were to say that Buddhism has not gone to war with another per se. I am not saying Buddhists are all holy as much as Christians are not all holy or for that matter Muslims. Unlike you I am inclined to believe that no right-path religion advocates violence the way you put it. There will always be deviants who use religion for their own purposes.

While I sympathise with her feelings of 'losing' her loved ones, I find some of the assumptions and generalisations she made unfair. <span style="color: red;">Firstly, while mega churches in Singapore are active in sharing their faith with the public, they do not target impressionable teenage schoolchildren. </span>As with any religion, it is natural that as Christians we desire to share the joy of our faith with our friends and loved ones.<br><br>We are fortunate to live in a multiracial country where people are free to practise any religion. <span style="color: red;">As religious tolerance is a value we guard strongly, it is saddening that Dr Lee should imply that the indiscretions of her children can be attributed directly to negative influence by the church. </span><br><br>While church activities do take up time, as a cell-group leader I can vouch that never has the church sought to sow discord in families or influence teenagers to rebel against their parents.<br><br>Like any other religion which seeks to inculcate good values and strong family ties, the Bible teaches Christians to honour and love their parents in obedience.<br><br>Some young Christians may get carried away by overzealousness, and churches need to step in to correct them. However, it is unfair to blame our family troubles solely on churches.<br><br>While speaking in general about the Christian faith to clarify certain misconceptions, I acknowledge that there will inevitably be deviants who may preach fanaticism.<br><br>I beseech Dr Lee to clarify matters with her children's church pastor.<br><br>Teo Choon Liang </blockquote>I have problems with the statements in red.<br><br>1. What does he mean by "not targeting impressionable teenage schoolchildren"?<br><br>2. I realize many of the pro-Christian letters in the forum tend to talk about the obvious; they just defend the church and the leaders but seldom go into the problem. At most they will blame the problem on some deviants who preach fanaticism.<br><br>It is inaccurate to paint the troublemakers as fanatic deviants because such a description, no doubt, conjures up an image of terrorists from another [peaceful] religion. However while we can name a few fanatic deviants from the group of terrorists, we are hard-pressed to name any deviant from the Christian faith.<br><br>It is amazing the author can bring up religious tolerance, when Christians are mostly the ones who are tearing up the fabric of religious tolerance locally.</div>

Personal experience cannot form the basis of jumping to such a general conclusion.<br><br>One mega-church, City Harvest Church (which I do not attend), emphasises academic excellence by putting the academic results of its student members on their website and recommending a minimum number of hours to study each day.<br><br>A quick glance shows that the church members' results are regularly on par with, or above, the national average.<br><br>The changes in behaviour that Dr Lee complains about correlate more to adolescence and puberty than religion.<br><br>There is a natural tendency for all teenagers find their own identity and gain independence. They also need to find acceptance within their own peer groups. The question then is, which type of peer group is best?<br><br>I have heard a parent relating how his son became a gangster and how he regretted not allowing him to go to church, given how differently he probably would have turned out.<br><br>There have been many cases of delinquent and rebellious children who have been changed by an atmosphere of love and acceptance in a church.<br><br>I personally benefited by having peers and mentors in church who set an example of leadership and excellence in love and life.<br><br>I wonder how much more rebellious I would have become if I had not become a Christian.<br><br>I learned to be patient, self-controlled, more loving and even to memorise and think more logically using Bible study methods.<br><br>What I suggest to Dr Lee is to recognise that children do grow up and need to find their own wings, and <span style="color: red;">speak to the pastoral staff of the church if you have any concerns</span>.<br><br><span style="color: red;">It should be noted that in the Bible, the fifth Commandment is 'Honour your father and mother'. </span><br>Nicodemus Chan </blockquote>This letter is better, probably because the author does not attend one of the mega churches, whereas the author of the previous letter attends one of the mega churches. Conclusion - maybe people from one of the mega churches tend to write lousy, unconvincing letters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>However, some questions (parts in red).<br><br>1. Is it easy to speak to the pastoral staff of the church? I mean is there such an avenue that is made known to the public?<br><br>2. Every Christian likes to quote the fifth commandment, but seldom do they discuss the real problem and highlight the real fact - God is to be placed before your family. How are believers to handle such a conflict?</div>

However my gut feel is that the responsibility of every individual's action will be - passed to the INDIVIDUAL. Hence the conclusion for such meeting will be - each teenager is to be accountable to his own time and involvement. If they over commit it's their own fault.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">2.

While I attempt to facilitate my boys into the church activities, I also emphasize that the family is where the core structure is.</div>
