This is especially so as these are 'rich' churches, judging by their well-equipped premises and set-up. These circumstances bring to light another concern. Some of these 'mega churches' have relentless recruitment activities in many schools and junior colleges.<br><br>My friends and I have loved ones whose lives and attitude have changed after they joined these churches. They lose interest in schoolwork to the point of academic failure. Family time is curtailed drastically, and they stop attending family functions. Parental objections are ignored, family squabbles ensue and family harmony is disrupted. It's heartbreaking. It is like we have lost our children.<br><br>I write this not to impugn any religion, but to warn against the abuse of religion. Having had such traumatic experiences, I cannot remain silent. I hope this letter will serve as a warning to parents regarding such youth activities that may destroy their personal lives and family harmony.<br><br>Dr Lee Bee Wah</blockquote></div>

Church do not necessarily equal to God. Church programs are inherently still programs and these kids MUST realise that.<br><br>Such churches need to realise that some of their attempts to glorify God is in reality, tearing the fabric of family unity. In their zeal to serve God, many times they actually alienate themselves to those who they are trying to reach.<br><br>btw, ice, you beat me to this post.... read it in the papers today.</div>

Then again, the writer is saying that the church is the cause or at least the trigger to the breakdown.<br><br>We must also remember that youths are at the age of exploration and testing boundaries. They have tremendous amounts of energy that needs to be guided. I think the church can be a positive guide to them during this time.<br><br>Unfortunately, some youths use church activities as an excuse to do things they like as opposed to activities such as studying. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I am sure your church also have a lot of activities, the schools that your boys are attending also have lots of activities... how are your boys able to balance between their various commiments/activities (church or school or social) and their studies?
