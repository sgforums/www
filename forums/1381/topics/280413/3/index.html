"Bar" is "son" in Aramaic, which used to be the vernacular of the Jewish people. "Mitzvah" is "commandment" in both Hebrew and Aramaic. "Bat" is daughter in Hebrew and Aramaic. (The Ashkenazic pronunciation is "bas"). Technically, the term refers to the child who is coming of age, and it is strictly correct to refer to someone as "becoming a bar (or bat) mitzvah." However, the term is more commonly used to refer to the <strong>coming of age ceremony</strong> itself, and you are more likely to hear that someone is "having a bar mitzvah."<br><br>Under Jewish Law, children are not obligated to observe the commandments, although they are encouraged to do so as much as possible to learn the obligations they will have as adults. <strong>At the age of 13 (12 for girls), children become obligated to observe the commandments.</strong> The bar mitzvah ceremony formally marks the assumption of that obligation, along with the corresponding right to take part in leading religious services, to count in a minyan (the minimum number of people needed to perform certain parts of religious services), to form binding contracts, to testify before religious courts and to marry. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tend to tell my friends (those looking into Christianity or those who are more neutral): "God is not the god of the Church; God is the god of His people." It's funny how some churches "transcend" their role as the Body of Christ to become the Mouth of Christ and spread their interpretations of the gospel, which might have far-reaching implications that might hurt their own Christian brothers and sisters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My experience as a young person growing up in the Church several years ago was far more positive than negative. To set the context, I am a member of a medium sized Church that, while relatively "rich", cannot be considered a "mega Church".<br><br>There is clearly a fundamental disconnect between the parent who presumably is non-Christian, and the young person who is. My view is that there is really very little that one can do to truely reconcile the two without the young person compromising on his/her Faith. This is probably something that a non-Christian will struggle to comprehend, let alone accept.<br><br>You can talk about wanting to honour your parents, but to me (and I am by no means a theologian) your primary parent is God. Your Father in Heaven. The one thing that came to me when the discussion moved on to this point of parents versus Faith (for want of a better description) was the following passage from the Book of Matthew:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Cost of Following Jesus </span><br><br>Matthew 8<br><br>18When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.<br><br>19Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."<br><br>20Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."<br><br>21Another disciple said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."<br><br>22But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."<br><br>I must stress that I am not a theologian so my interpretation of this is base at best, but to me, that is the very essence of Faith. That you would be willing to turn your back on the things of the world to follow the Kingdom of God. But I would encourage you to read the full scripture to take the meaning in its total context (quite easy to google it, but make sure it's a reputable site!).<br><br>I had many friends at Church (when we were younger) who had major difficulties with their families over their decision to become Christians. Some had their relationships with their parents break down to the point of getting thrown out of the house. But very often, what I noticed was that they had issues with their families even before becoming a Christian. I speak generally of course as there were always exceptions. But this is my anecdotal experience. Coming to Church was perhaps the trigger point. In Church, one would learn about the trials and tribulations of Job, and about how the enemy would try to put obstacles in your path when you choose to follow Jesus. Which is perhaps why, to many young minds, the objections of a parent could be seen as a trial of one's (perhaps new found) Faith.<br><br>I try not to judge but it's easy to see where both sides are coming from.<br><br>While my extended family is by and large from a staunchly Christian tradition, my mother was not. In fact, she was dead set against it, and was perhaps especially angry when my grandfather (her dad) converted on his deathbed. This is perhaps not an unusual experience here in Singapore and if one was objective, I could see the reasons for her anger. What came next was that me, her only child, went to Church and became a Christian. This was something that I had wanted to do for a long time, but did not do till I was 17 because I knew how she would feel. Was she upset? That goes without saying. But I am fortunate in having a supportive family. Sadly perhaps, there is no real happy ending. My mother later passed away and to this day, I remain unsure where her convictions laid even though she came to accept the path I had chosen.<br><br>I am now a parent myself to two young children. I will try to bring them up the best way I know how. I know that in time, they will make their own decisions that may not dovetail with my hopes and expectations for them. This would of course include matters of Faith. The only thing I can hope and pray for, is that the path they choose is the one that God has planned for them.<br><br>I am by no means a good Christian and I have as many flaws as the next person, probably more. But in my heart of hearts, I know to whom I belong. I know what my Faith tells me, and I know how this journey will end.<br><br></div>
