Dr Lee Bee Wah brought up a very real problem. Are you trying to say that the problem does not exist? Are you saying that it was a fiction of her imagination?<br><br>If we are living in a Christian country, there would not be this problem. Even if the parents are not practicing Christians, they would not stop their children from becoming one.<br><br>As it is, Christianity is trying to make itself "exclusive"; and that is very clear from one of the ten commandments, the first if I am not wrong.<br><br>Are you denying that there is a conflict and a problem? Are you saying that nobody can give their opinions on this matter unless they are directly involved? Why???!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>you still don't get my point:<br><br>my point is this.<br><br>the doctor has the right to be pissed and making noise at the church, because her life was affected.<br><br>i have the right to be pissed and making noise at the church, because my family life was also affected<br><br>you're just making noise, because its "fun" (lack of a better word). you're not really enraged at the church, you're just picking bones. if you have a genuine reason to pick at the church, i wouldn't be angry. but you don't. your life go on as per normal regardless of the church action. so why are you making so much noise?<br><br>its like, you're just some bystander watching an old lady get robbed, and you go "ya lor, what an arse the robber is, evil bugger etc etc".<br></div>
