              <p><br>Actually, religion/faith topics have always been a hot topic for arguments that usually end no where.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as my friend always tells me, pray and have an open mind. If you hear God calling to you, just follow. (but not blindly)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As to the heated arguements, I believe that there are many views and all are entitled to their views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An open mind is vital if we seek to understand each other. I believe that there is much misunderstanding in these arguements. Who are we to comment who is right or wrong? Are we God that we should judge? Right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a christian and a devoted one, but I am not afraid of listening to other's opinions on their beliefs. Not because I want to challenge their doctrine/belief, rather I want to know who they are.</p>

              <p>Often what is lacking is a good leader. Since you have a good cause in mind, why not you join a church for the cause that you fight for? Then you can be the LIGHT for all cancer patients?</p>

              <p>Atheists - there are some very nice intelligent atheists who enters and have fruitful discussion. these too, we treat with respect even if we disagree with each other.</p>
              <p>Trolls - this is NOT respected here or any other forums.... no use discussing anything with these people.</p>
              <p>You are probably of the opinion that as Christians we ought to be kind and lovey-dovey all the time. Unfortunately, I do not take this stand because while it work for most, trolls do not react the way you want them to react.... and yes, we do get lots of trolls here.</p>

              <p>I think that everyone has to rights to believe in any religions. And im certainly alright with christians, but not the ones that are obssesive.</p>
              <p>You dont see priest who are people of religions forcing people do their religious sites do you? You dont see priest who are people of religions condemning other people's religion do you? And certainly, you dont see priest who are people of religions ill treating people of other religions do you?</p>

              <p>yoz chibet..recently i just discuss the very same issue with a muslim fren..in tat garden, God charged adam with naming the creatures ya? so a dodo able to do that b4 his head burst? so kinda obvious adam and eve are already pretty smart.</p>
              <p>and the reason why adam and eve are not wearing clothes..Must God spoon feed us with everything?? they had the brains, they chose not to use it to weave clothes.. what to do ya? one reason my that fren gave as a joke will surely offend all christians here..so i have to censor it..pm me if u wanna know..</p>
