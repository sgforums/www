              <p>Anyway I still owe the catholics here, the reasons why i'm so adversely affected by them.</p>
              <p>Firstly, regarding my family's salvation, I explained it before, but i don't know if anyone read it, or swept it under their carpet or whatever.</p>
              <p>My aunt's a devout catholic, but for so many years in her life, she didn't share anything about the good news to us, for reasons i don't know la. Maybe she thought that we somehow will believe in Jesus without hearing about Him before. She never once told me about Jesus, she never once shared testimonies about how good God is etc.</p>
              <p>And once after my family received salvation, then she appeared with her uppity friends who started going about "they're the oldest, thus they're the best" speech. I was so infurated, really inside my heart, i really wanted to drive them out of my house, they didn't do anything for my family, now they want us to be on the catholic side?</p>
              <p>And if it's not because of protestant christians, my family would remain unsaved. The girl who passed away so unfortunately a few days ago, would be unsaved.</p>
              <p>Another thing is that almost everytime, catholics always say something flakey to me.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>My aunt said that guan yin, i was a buddhist before that, is actually a saint. (because when i became a christian, i refused to worship idols, and my aunt tried to make it sound like it's ok)<br></li>
              <li>a priest told me that satan would be forgiven of his sins, if only he would humble himself and repent</li>
              <li>once attending a catholic meeting, I was still searching for a church, my aunt took me there, the speaker was talking about fasting on bread and water, and was addressing the issue about whether can drink ribena or milo or not, the speaker said that why don't you ask Saint (sombody) at the back of the church, can or not?</li>
              <li>And in the same meeting, the speaker was talking about this brown string with 2 pieces of plastic, i've forgotten the name for it, was saying that this priest in the past received a vision, where somebody gave him a brown cloak or cloth or something, and said that anyone who wore this, will receive unlimited grace and can escape either purgatory or smth (this was really very long ago, i can't really remember) and added that non believers can wear it also.</li>
              <li>Also, in the same meeting, the speaker said that anything you want, you can pray to Saint Joseph, he everything "pao ka liao".</li>
              <li>Also in the same meeting, the speaker was talking about marraige or something, and she said that mother mary is the best matchmaker there is.</li>
              <li>And this is the most recent, a friend of mine, was telling me about this really great bible study thing she attends at a catholic church. and she told me the priest made such a funny joke "it's ok to have murderous thoughts of your boss in your head, so long as you don't bring a knife to office the next day and kill him"</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Flakey?</p>

              <p>oh, also, not to mention nearly 90% of my catholic friends don't live pious lives. their family are so liberal with vulgarities, on one hand they build huge altars in their homes, and every new year eve, they throw huge parties, smoke, gamble, "fuck here" "fuck there". when we're around to play bridge. Like it's a cool thing to say like that.</p>
              <p>And my catholic friend's always sleeping around, and telling us his conquests etc.</p>
              <p>another catholic friend of sorts, dresses very liberally, and her mum calls her possessed by demons, always tell others how demonic her daughter is, pour holy water on her etc. so she now hates her mum.</p>
              <p>so why should i take anything catholics say seriously, if this is what i see?</p>

              <p>Your apologises is not needed because I was never angry in the
              first place. I told you why you should not attached conditions to
              faith if that's what you believed. It's ok.</p>
              <p>Once you attached conditions that good faith leads to good
              works, you indirectly supporting what I said because James said
              faith without work is dead.</p>
              <p>You said that faith that do not lead to good works is not good
              faith and these people will not be saved.</p>
              <p>You support the last judgement story that christians can end up
              in goats. If one lost his faith after baptism, he is a christian.
              By baptisim, he is saved and cannot be unsaved liao...</p>
              <p>see the problem.....it's not that you are wrong to disagree with
              me - Chin Eng disagreed, But because you are not clear where you
              stand.....</p>

              <p>in my opinion, i think the weakness in the older catholic structure (this is not a critique, but my personal observation) is that the church focuses much on pulpit ministry, ie attending mass etc etc. In the past I have never heard of catholic Bible studies, or cell groups. Perhaps it may be because the church have never encourage the individual to read the Bible for themselves, or to study into the concept of discipleship.</p>
              <p>Hence the resulting congregation are people who will piously go to service, but are still entrenched with many of their earthly habits.</p>
              <p>I do not deny that dumb2's examples strike a chord in my heart. Perhaps it may be changing with folks like mrlim.</p>
              <p>However to balance it up, I have heard many dubious and ridiculous sermons from protestant pastors myself.</p>
              <p>This is the other extreme of the balance where a church focus very very much of the spiritual aspect of Christian living to a point where the church raises pantang Christians, cannot watch this show, cannot eat this food, cannot listen to this music - all because they are afraid of offending God.</p>
              <p>dumb2, all I can say is, don't judge the individuals by your past experiences.</p>

              <p>either that or the catholics will ask her for councilling.</p>
              <p>which gives me a question. what happens if a catholic and a protestant marry. i heard that they can only marry if they promise to raise the kid in the catholic faith, or it won't be recognised by the catholic church.</p>
              <p>and there's a friend in my church who is dating a catholic guy. and both of them are going to anglican side. is he gonna get excommunicated? and what does that mean?</p>

              <p>How about both of you believe in the original Abrahamic faith - Judaism. See problem solved. Miracle do happen, you know.  There are many good things in the original faith.</p>
              <p>1. You don't need to convert, to become a "Jew".  You can remain gentile.</p>
              <p>2. You are not obligated to follow the 613 laws.  You only need to observe the 7 laws of Noah. Please read acts chapter 15 of the NT.</p>
              <p>3. No need to tithe 10 % of Income. In the first place it is against the Torah for the church to collect 10% of your income.  You see, the NT is silent on this 10% thingy.</p>

              <p>The Jews did not kill Jesus. He was killed by the Romans.  However, even if it was the Roman who physically killed Jesus, we still say GOD did because everything in heaven or under the heaven cannot happen without GOD's permission.  Even Satan need to seek permission from GOD.  Please read JOB.</p>
              <p>Ah, the famous 2 laws of Christ.  How many do you think this 2 laws will expand into?  If I am not mistaken, how about the command to spread the gospel etc.  How about this teaching of Jesus:</p>
              <p><span id="en-NASB-23252" class="sup">17</span>"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NASB-23253" class="sup">18</span>"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NASB-23254" class="sup">19</span>"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NASB-23255" class="sup">20</span>"For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. NASB</p>

This people do not have the sophistry of the internet nor have they the benefit of a higher education. All they have is probably a torn down bible and a simple promise of salvation.

              <p>n my opinion, i think the weakness in the older catholic
                      structure (this is not a critique, but my personal observation) is
                      that the church focuses much on pulpit ministry, ie attending mass
                      etc etc. In the past I have never heard of catholic Bible studies,
                      or cell groups. Perhaps it may be because the church have never
                      encourage the individual to read the Bible for themselves, or to
                      study into the concept of discipleship.</p>
              <p>Hence the resulting congregation are people who will piously go
                      to service, but are still entrenched with many of their
                      earthly habits.</p>
              <p>I do not deny that dumb2's examples strike a chord in my heart.
                      Perhaps it may be changing with folks like mrlim.</p>
              <p>However to balance it up, I have heard many dubious and
                      ridiculous sermons from protestant pastors myself.</p>
              <p>This is the other extreme of the balance where a church focus
                      very very much of the spiritual aspect of Christian living to a
                      point where the church raises pantang Christians, cannot watch this
                      show, cannot eat this food, cannot listen to this music - all
                      because they are afraid of offending God.</p>
              <p>dumb2, all I can say is, don't judge the individuals by your
                      past experiences.</p>
              <p>some Catholics I know personally are the nicest people I have
                      come across,</p>
              <p>some protestants I know are the biggest s-holes that I seen.</p>

              <p>I share your opinion on what you tell dumbdumb....</p>
              <p>As for the Catholic Church, the long history means many screw up before etc...it's a fact.</p>
              <p>I do not know why but most protestant seems to think that the Catholic Church do not encourage reading of the bible......maybe because Catholic do not use bible verses in our daily talks as much as the protestant.</p>
              <p>But if you look at the Catholic Mass, you will notice that we have 3 bible readings...so it is not true that they disocourage reading the bible...in fact they are encouraging.</p>
              <p>Earthly habits? I don't understand on this....Traditions? I also don't care much. All I know is that all prayers and things we do at Mass are all in the bible as per teachings of Jesus and all Catholics churches does the same.</p>

              <p>About the thief? Simply that unless you are judgemental, this example is not suitable in our discussions. Unless you proved that he never do good deeds before lor...can you?</p>
              <p>Did he stand up for Jesus when the other thief mock him? Is that not a good deed to stand up for justice?</p>
              <p>You said he has nothing to show but all the bad things you listed but  that's what you think......Can eveything be decided based on what you think alone?</p>
              <p>How about what I think? Want to talk about the sinful woman or not? OR the sower ?</p>
              <p>Still don't get it? Brother huo liao lah.....already dating Catholic girl already....learn to respect others... Girls you can accept - guys you hate ?</p>
              <p>Before you jump - look first..... If you are serious in going to the
              RCIA, your opinion will change because what you say is what you
              think......it may not represent the truth.</p>
              <p>You aunty is your aunty...I don't want to comment because I do not know what is going on. Your experience may be true to you but it may also not be true because you already showed that you are bias.....everything is based on you think......but I do not know details and therefore don't want to comments.</p>
              <p>I have never heard any Catholic priest or speakers telling anyone to "pray to Saint Joseph, he everything "pao ka
                                      liao". Every Catholic knows that every Saints have their own respective area of expertise...</p>
              <p>By the way, when we say pray here, we do not mean pray to them like they are God. They are NOT God. It is just to ask them to pray with us and for us. Just like if you ask a friend to pray for you......aiyah....forget you don't believe in prayers one....still haven't reply me about prayer leh... NO.....don't want liao......otherwise new subject to argue.</p>
              <p>But like I says, no hard feeling because what you think of me or Catholics make do difference in my life.</p>

              <p>either that or the catholics will ask her for councilling.</p>
              <p>which gives me a question. what happens if a catholic and a
              protestant marry. i heard that they can only marry if they promise
              to raise the kid in the catholic faith, or it won't be recognised
              by the catholic church.</p>
              <p>and there's a friend in my church who is dating a catholic guy.
              and both of them are going to anglican side. is he gonna get
              excommunicated? and what does that mean?</p>

              <p>you better check if protestant can marry catholics first before you worry about the catholic church.</p>
              <p>my friend (protestant) want to marry a catholic (20 years ago) and his pastor say NO! anyway, he is happy married with the catholic but he is still a protestant but everyweek, go with the whole family to a catholic church.</p>
              <p>he never accept anything catholic before...now, after 20 years of going to catholic church, he knows many things he thought before was bias and untrue....I.E. the info that his church members gave him was incorrect.</p>
              <p>so check the protestant stand.....</p>

              <p>I mean, if my millions erroneously? believe in salvation by faith and work, are they going to get saved? This is for dumbdumb to answer.</p>
              <p>From the ordo salutis (ahem), the answer to your question is, only God knows who is saved and who is not.</p>
