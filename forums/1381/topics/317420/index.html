              <p>I don't see why you should be staying away from your non-christian friends, especially if they are not leading you astray or leading you down a path of wrong doing.</p>
              <p>Moreover, you can actually share the gospel with them when the time comes.</p>
              <p>Personally I feel there is nothing wrong in making friends with anyone in itself. Did your church members ever explain why? Or what is the rationale behind only socialising with friends from your own church?</p>
              <p>My past two churches never encouraged something like this.</p>

              <p>I think being dedicated it's good, the impression you give me is that it's to the point of overdoing it. As a christian you also need to understand what is going on with the world as well. How else are you going to talk to younger christians next time and help guide them along the challenges they face in the world?</p>

              <p>My christian friends and I have never had an issue with listening to non-christian songs. We even exchange CDs to listen or go music shops together. The occasional clubbing/pubbing is ok too.</p>
              <p>What matters is you don't get caught up with these things.</p>

              <p>All these things seem very planned and deliberate, even the way they try to restrict your habits seems very taught. Which worries me actually. I personally feel that some personal issues or data should be shared and not so much 'collected' so systematically.</p>
              <p>Once again, I won't go so far as to say say you've joined a cult, but perhaps you need to pray and think whether this is the direction and path you want to take a christian. To be a christian doesn't mean you must be in the same church your whole life, but what are these practices doing for you as a christian and does it help you to grow?</p>
              <p>I believe any choice you make, you need to feel comfortable doing it. If it is not something you want to do, the very least I hope you feel that is what the holy spirit wants you to do.</p>
              <p>Pray about it.</p>

              <p>1. If all your friends are Christians, how are you going to witness to non-Christians?</p>
              <p>2. If all your conversations are about on Christian topics, how are you going to learn?</p>
              <p>3. Christian songs are NOT for enjoyment or entertainment, they are meant for worship. There is nothing wrong in listening to the radio or non-Christian music.</p>
              <p>4. God will work out his plan for you WITH you, not through some other people.</p>
              <p>What church is this? Be very cautious about these people, there are many people with weird ideas about Christianity.</p>

              <p>the christiandom as we know it now is no longer like what it was meant to be during the 1st century. "devotees" tend to be very passionate and over zealous. sad to say, many christians only use passion and not rationale in their faith. while your church asks u to saty within the congregation, its becuz they do not want you to stray from the faith. your church obviously are doing pretty much the wrong things that are not taught in the bible.major flaw is that they said God( yodh heh wah heh) has told them he has planned out your life. why doesnt God tell you about the plan since its your life???and the bible explicitly states that to believe in luck and destiny is to turn away from him(not him as in them{3 in 1 coffe mix,eh i meant holy trinity})</p>
              <p>the only person who knew how his life would be is christ.no not because hes God(anyone care to show me which verse said Jesus is God?) but he was willing to do God's word. so regarding your church...most likely its just the same as most churches..wanting 10% of your income.</p>

              <p>I really am not trying to defame any church else I would have put in the name of the church.</p>
              <p>I put the word "Christian" in quotes is because my gut feeling tells me that what I had experience is somehow not really correct.</p>
              <p> I am born to a buddhist/taoist family and I chose to become a Christian because I do not believe that praying to a dead human would work as at the end of the day, they were still human.</p>
              <p>I believe that somewhere, there must be a being more powerful than mere humans so I decided to believe in GOD. Getting into heaven is good too.</p>
              <p>To clarify further</p>
              <p><strong>1 - telling me to only make friends with other christians of my church and to stay away from my non christian friends</strong></p>
              <p>trying to get my non christians friends to come to the church is ok but if my non christian friend is non-responsive then the church people encourage me to stay away from these non-responsive people. their reason being i might be influence by them</p>
              <p>I am constantly asked to ditch my non christian girlfriend and encourage to find a girl from the church</p>
              <p>What i find a bit extreme is that the church encourage me to stay away from my christian friends from other churches - ther reason being different churches concentrate on different parts of the bible - methodist/evangelistic</p>
              <p><strong>2 - all conversations with this bunch of people involves chrisianity and nothing else. I mean its normal to talk about christianity within a christian group but to have months and months of conversations only about christianity/church activity is not normal. Some were my coursemates and they never spoke to me about anything else except christianity/church matters - even when we were at school</strong></p>
              <p>Seriously, 90% of all conversations with this bunch of people involve christianity. No matter what topics i try to engage them in conversation (movies, recent events, politics), the conversations always end up involving Jesus and God.</p>
              <p>example:</p>
              <p>me: hey you heard about the increase in GST?</p>
              <p>christian friend: yes, everything is becoming more and more expensive. We need to put our lives in GOD's hands and in his infinite wisdom and power, he will guide us through this difficult time.</p>
              <p>me : ??? ............ yeah ........GOD is great isnt he. Hey anyone heard that new madonna/britney spears song</p>
              <p>christian friend: Why do you listen to world songs? Hillsongs came out with a new album recently. You should go buy it and listen to that instead</p>
              <p>me: ??? ...........yeah ok. I like hillsongs too.</p>
              <p>christian friend: now let us pray together to ask Jesus to guide us in everthing we do in our lives.</p>
              <p><strong>4 - they keep asking me to do 'surveys' and collect alot of my personal data then one day they told me that GOD had told them his plan for me and proceed to tell me of their/"HIS" plan for my life. they actually plan out my whole life???</strong> </p>
              <p>I assure that this is totally true. they not only survey church members, they also survey visitors to the church and even people on the streets. Evangelistic events are conducted like MLM recruitment drives.</p>

              <p><br>i strongly do not believe that by going into christianity means auto go to heaven! we must earn it! if we keep doing harm to others and cause great damage, then we can still go heaven? Like the case of Anthony who met his wife in church, years later hire a teenager to kill her. then he still can go heaven?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>every one of us is responsible for the actions and decisions we make in life. even if you do not have a religion, and you do good deeds and be kind to all, you will go to hell??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i find it amusing when my friend told me if i do not go into christianity i will go direct to hell. i find it really hard to believe.</p>

              <p>Christianity was and still is great but Christians were great but now....must admit most Christians are only Christian in name.....no more/much less charisma. It's an old faith with the flock dying slowly losing its charisma and spirit. It's a religion when once dominant was widely misused and abused both by its lost clergymen and aristocracies.</p>
              <p>Look at the history of Crusade. I read about it. So many false claimed apparitions and many false prophets. Many people abused religion as an excuse to do as their wish. God damn that kind of people who mislead and thus disappointed others which are innocent.</p>

              <p>tts good. in the end, just go back to the Word of God. as you grow in love, you will know where you should be. =)</p>
              <p>christianity isn't about doing - that's one of the flaws i noticed in hope of god. they're very focused on works. remember that you're covered in God's love and His grace. even if you don't do anything, it wouldn't change the love God has for you. once you are able to fully rest and trust unyieldingly on that love, you will automatically do the works that God has planned for you.</p>
              <p>nobody should force you to do anything before you are ready to do it. God loves a cheerful giver. if you can't give cheerfully, it's pointless and hypocritical already. (whether it's tithing, offering or time or service)</p>
              <p>and it's not true that you cannot have non-believer friends. Jesus was always around sinners. He's called the friend of sinners. But Jesus never forgotten about His heritage. He stood by His principles even being with sinners. He will have good clean fun with them, but when they are doing wrong things, He stood unwaivering on His principles. You're the salt and light, so remember to stand firm on your godly principles.</p>
              <p>and it's again not true that christians must only talk about things of christianity. it just happens that, christians who really really love God, just talks about christianity. How you lead your life.. is really just a reflection on how you love God.</p>
              <p>i think it's a mistake that hope of god focuses on work first, before the heart of the work. let me illustrate an example - <strong>a christian who loves God, will goto church, but a christian who goes to church may not love God.</strong></p>
              <p>as for songs. i mentioned it somewhere before. nothing wrong with listening secular songs. there's no condemnation in christ, ever. but again, it boils down to this principle - <strong>a christian who loves God, will goto church, but a christian who goes to church may not love God.</strong></p>
              <p>i prefer to listen to christian music, because it gives me peace and joy. and the world's already so screwed up. full of hate, frustration etc. i don't think i need to listen to more music about unrequited love, getting dumped, sadness sorrow, and dispair. again, it's a personal thing.</p>
              <p>God's plan for you. an interesting point. i always believe that God will not ask you to do something which you really have no desire to do so, or you will hate doing. i notice in hope of god, they like to tell their followers that God's plan is for them to do this or that, and usually coincidently, there is a need in the church. for example - there's a need for more ushers in church, so they tell you that God's plan is for you to be an usher etc.</p>
              <p>i'm not saying that God don't reveal His plan through people. I definitely do think that it's possible, because it happened to me regarding the salvation of my family. the prophecy came to pass, so i definitely believe that God do speak to us through people too. but one of the ways to know if you're actually doing God's will is that as you serve, you will be cheerful, you will desire to serve in a particular field. as you serve, you find a sense of purpose, and even though it may be hard, you don't find it burdensome. that's one of the signs you're at the right place doing the right thing. again, this comes only when you have fully dwelled in God's love, and you serve from that love. no point rushing into ministry or something without being stable in that love first. you'll just burn out and fall away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and lastly, i don't think hope of god is a cult - but they definitely are zealots. they're more like an army camp than a family. if you doubt your place in this church, you can try visiting other churches. i'm not encouraging you to church hop, it's true that church hopping isn't beneficial. but if you're not growing anyway, i think you should try other denomination. for me i'm not really suited for churches like city harvest etc. i grow better in a family church, where relationships are strong and everyone is really like one big family.</p>
              <p>so i believe God led me and my family to my current church - even though hope of god for a period of time persistantly say that i'm walking away from His plan etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh, the biggest bullshit that hope of god dishes out regularly is their "bgr is a sin" teaching. of course they don't say it literally, but that's what they usually enforce.</p>
