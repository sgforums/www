              <p>Why apply what He says about seeds he sown? Where did He says so in this parable? He clearly says what he did and it is clear. The conditions to belong to sheeps or goats is clearly stated there. Don't get confused by adding on and twisting it out of context. This parable is telling us something.....every parable that Jesus told is teaching us something. Why avoid it? If deeds is meaningless why do you think Jesus bother to mention it? I am not even saying that I am right but I think we should pause to think and reflect why Jesus said what He did.....at least to search and find which is the purpose of discussion right?</p>
              <p>I quote you : "can i safely
                  say that non believers are actually classified as sheep? seems safe
                  to say so."</p>
              <p>So you confirmed that you believed that non-believers are actually classified as sheeps and thus will be saved right? Or am I wrong again ? Or are you confused with sheeps and goats?</p>
              <p>I think non-believers can get into the sheep group if what they do (deeds) are in line with what Jesus said (without even knowing this parable) and even if they do not know or accept Jesus now. WHY?</p>
              <p>Regardless of faith, when we die, we go see the same God (If you are a christian, you believe that there is only ONE God right?). Can you imagine a person on his last day refusing to accept God when he see him in person? If he does acknowledge God then and accept Him, plus the good deeds he has done (while alive) without even knowing that these are what Jesus taught his disciple to do, do you think he will be saved??</p>
              <p>Was he saved by deeds alone ? NO</p>
              <p>Was he saved by faith alone ? NO</p>
              <p>He was saved by his deeds and last minute acceptance of Jesus (faith) right?</p>
              <p>If he still refuse to accept God upon seeing Him, then, good luck to him.</p>
              <p>Likewise, if a christian think that by faith alone he is saved, then deeds got do lor, don't have also no problem because saved liao. I think there will be trouble.</p>
              <p>Hope this make sense enough for us to re-think.</p>

              <p>and of course. Unless you wish to contest that catholics are
              deeply involved in evangelism. then why in my entire life,
              catholics have always been admitting that they don't do evangelism,
              they believe religion is a personal thing. why it is always the
              christians who reach out to me and my family, while the catholic
              church stay silent.</p>
              <p>And for my friend who passed away. if it was a catholic who was
              sitting beside her that day, would my friend pass away as a

              <p> </p>
              <p>from the start, that's all you can say about the catholic
              church. that you're the greatest in number, the authentic goods,
              the real true undiluted real deal. i've heard it all, usually
              AFTER, christians did the sowing.</p>

              <p>First of all, I think you should be respectful to your friend who passed away. If you do read The Last Judgement parable as above in proper context, you may be more comforted by it. Where you friend goes is beyond our control. It is between her and God. What we can do is to pray for her and help her beg for God's mercy (since you said she haven't baptised yet) and accept her into Heaven. What else can you do? I already answered your questions. Don't drag her in here.</p>
              <p><strong>Secondly, I never say anything about "authentic gods" or "undiluted read deal" -<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> you did.</span></strong></p>
              <p>What I stated are facts backed historically that Catholic Churches are the longest surviving Church and adte back to Jesus's time. We are still thriving worldwide and that's also a fact. I brought this up because you says we don't reach out to non-believers and not for any other purposes.</p>
              <p>Can that happen if there is nothing done by Catholics to evangelise? Last Easter alone, we have more than 1000 baptism in Singapore alone (not counting those baptised at other times during the year) and that include some Protestant.</p>
              <p>The problem again is what and how you evangelise. Mega Churches also evangelise but so many people complaint. Why?</p>
              <p>We have seen enough of christians out there telling people that only our God is real and their is not real God (worst - Satan) and they worship idol will go to hell etc..etc... Is that evangelisation? Or is that anti0Christ by driving would be believers away?</p>

              <p><br>well, if you really want a comment.... and on this issue, there are the other verses regarding salvation without works that you <strong>did not comment on.</strong></p>
              <p>....again the context is important. note the metaphorical use of<strong> SHEEP</strong> and <strong>GOAT</strong>.</p>
              <p>Sheep has always been the image of the Christian and Jesus is the shepherd (and not the goat herder)....</p>
              <p>That being the case, the context of this passage is that it is addressed to two groups of people the Christian and the non-Christian.</p>
              <p>The explanation of this passage is simply, for the things that we do unknowingly, Jesus knows. When we are doing good we are doing it unconsciously. Therefore as Christians our good works can be invisible even to us. It has nothing to do with salvation whatsoever.</p>

              <p>the sower sow good seeds, and later at night, the enemy sown his bad seeds. and when the sower's farmhands saw that the bad seeds and good seeds were growing together, and asked the sower if they should remove the bad seeds. the sower said it was alright, let them both grow together, and at the end, he will destroy the bad seeds.</p>
              <p>in the other parable, Jesus said that he will gather all the people of all nations together, then seperate them as sheep and goat. and the sheep would be those who believed in him, and thus producing good works, from faith.</p>
              <p>as for the goats would be non believer, people who attend church, but aren't real believers, after all, you can tell from their fruits. and real believers will always produce good works, because it's a natural process.</p>

              <p> based on standard Bible-speak.... the term sheep is exclusively on Christians. No "goats" can get into the sheep-pen (so to say). The Matthew passage is part of a series of Parables, and for any competent Bible reader, parables are imagery type stories. There are ascribe roles to the different characters in the parables, for example the Bridegroom is always Christ and the bride the church. Hence the sheep are the Christians and the goats are non-Christians. The passage addresses the issue of doing good naturally and unknowningly. It does not mention SALVATION or FAITH specifically. Any additional meaning derived are solely at the discretion of a misguided reader.</p>
              <p>when a person dies. the chance dies. whatever he sees on the other side is like "Deal or No Deal" and you choose to deal, if your suit case is $1, too bad so sad.</p>

              <p><br> well, if you really want a comment.... and on this issue, there are
              the other verses regarding salvation without works that you
              <strong>did not comment on.</strong></p>
              <p>....again the context is important. note the metaphorical use of
              <strong>SHEEP</strong> and <strong>GOAT</strong>.</p>
              <p>Sheep has always been the image of the Christian and Jesus is
              the shepherd (and not the goat herder)....</p>
              <p>That being the case, the context of this passage is that it is
              addressed to two groups of people the Christian and the
              non-Christian.</p>
              <p>The explanation of this passage is simply, for the things that
              we do unknowingly, Jesus knows. When we are doing good we are doing
              it unconsciously. Therefore as Christians our good works can be
              invisible even to us. It has nothing to do with salvation
              whatsoever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That's another way to look at this - I agree.</p>
              <p>But how come the requirement to be sheeps are all related to deeds done while goat for deeds undone? By that, are we trying to say that good deeds can only come from christians and all other faith never do anything good?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you take a re-look at my earlier answer as I edited it slightly mom ago. It just happen that it will also fit into your second part on knowingly or unknowingly.</p>
              <p>If deeds has nothing to do with salvation, why did Jesus send only sheeps to heaven? Since deeds has nothing to do with salvation, goat also can go what?</p>
              <p>Don't you think we need to ponder on this?</p>
              <p>I did not avoid accepting those verses that says faith alone. But I did mention what then is faith?  And I point to James who says faith without deeds is dead. Did Paul and James contradict? I think that's what we need to look at.</p>
              <p>For me, I think they complement each other. Both are teaching and preaching what Jesus taught to his disciples. So, I went back to the 4 Gospels and I am convinced by scriptures that salvation is by faith but faith without deeds is dead (and this parable we are talking about is a clear indication by Jesus to us). Therefore, I find that salvation by faith and deeds makes more sense to me.</p>
              <p>This of course is my personal choice and you do not need to agree. But I think there are grounds for us to ponder right?</p>

              <p>Do you need to feel guilty that you did not reach out to each and everyone? I don't think so because it is impossible.</p>
              <p>You keep saying that Catholic do not reach out but then how come we still survive and having baptsim year after year? Where did they come from? Reject of your preaching?</p>
              <p>I think Malcom tried to explained before. The Catholic Churches pray every week for the sick and for those who departed. Not only when someone dear pass away. The prayers are meant for everybody. And in stituation like yours, you don't even feel like saying a prayer for your friend? If you think she is in heaven, why not also say a prayer of thanks to our Lord? Pls do not think I am implying that you friend is not in heaven - I don't as I have already explained.</p>
              <p>If someone can benefit from the Gospel, why don't they benefit it when they are alive? That's a good question but we always have to know that not everyone will be converted and that's a fact. There is so only so much that we can do and we do our best.</p>
              <p>Isn't our God great, loving and unforgiving that even non-believers now can stand a chance to go to heaven?</p>
              <p>Being christian is an honour and we should live our life as much as possible they way Jesus wants us to. That is to love our God with everything and also to love our neighbour. The last judgement parable is also to re-inforce the love our neighbour part.</p>
              <p>Is that so difficult a task that we cannot do? Why wait when all of us can start take the first step.</p>

              <p><br> The context of Matt 7 - Matthew 7 is a series of extremely short
              messages - almost like a one liner -that started with Matthew
              5.</p>
              <p>The portion where Verse 21 is has got to do with false prophets,
              therefore the context of the verse is about the people at that time
              prophesizing in Jesus' name, and when read, it has to be read
              together with verses 22 and 23:</p>
              <p><em> <span>21</span>"Not everyone who says to me,
              'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who
              does the will of my Father who is in heaven. <span>22</span>Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we
              not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and
              perform many miracles?' <span>23</span>Then I will tell
              them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you
              evildoers!'</em></p>
              <p>If one is tempted to link this verse to normal folks, then I
              think we are in deep trouble because, the people mentioned inthis
              verses "prophesy in" Jesus name, and in Jesus' name "drive out
              demons and perform many miracles". None of us come close to that,
              and yet these folks are told that Jesus "never knew" them.</p>
              <p>The chapters from 5 onwards carry a huge amount of analogies,
              one of which is:</p>
              <p><em><span>29</span>If your right eye causes you to sin,
              gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one
              part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
              <span>30</span>And if your right hand causes you to sin,
              cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part
              of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.</em></p>
              <p>So do we take this literally? Obviously not!</p>
              <p>so mrlim... is your salvation assured? based on your definition,
              none of our salvation is assured, because it all hinges in the good
              works that we've done, and who's to say it's enough?</p>
              <p>or how about, I've spent the last month doing good work, and
              today I sinned, shortly later I die.... do I have salvation?</p>
              <p>to paraphrase dumb2.... this kind of salvation plan - quite
              cocked up.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What Jesus means by "Many" in Mat 7:22 is us... the believers who know Him, who tell people about Him. It is us who believe in His name. It cannot be the unbelievers, why would the unbelievers do all those things in Jesus name, but yet Jesus called them evildoers, why? Because only he who <strong>does</strong> the will of my Father who is in Heaven will enter the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
              <p>And for Matt 5:29-30, unfortunatelly, Jesus means it literally. I can back it up, but it is a Catholic thing, if you don't open your mind, you won't believe it.</p>

              <p>ah no, i meant goat. sorry.</p>
              <p>and i compare the 2 parables together, because both of them are
              talking about the end times.</p>
              <p>the sower sow good seeds, and later at night, the enemy sown his
              bad seeds. and when the sower's farmhands saw that the bad seeds
              and good seeds were growing together, and asked the sower if they
              should remove the bad seeds. the sower said it was alright, let
              them both grow together, and at the end, he will destroy the bad
              seeds.</p>
              <p>in the other parable, Jesus said that he will gather all the
              people of all nations together, then seperate them as sheep and
              goat. and the sheep would be those who believed in him, and thus
              producing good works, from faith.</p>
              <p>as for the goats would be non believer, people who attend
              church, but aren't real believers, after all, you can tell from
              their fruits. and real believers will always produce good works,

              <p> I did not avoid accepting those verses that says faith alone. But I did mention what then is faith?  And I point to James who says faith without deeds is dead. Did Paul and James contradict? I think that's what we need to look at.</p>
              <p>For me, I think they complement each other. Both are teaching and preaching what Jesus taught to his disciples. So, I went back to the 4 Gospels and I am convinced by scriptures that salvation is by faith but faith without deeds is dead (and this parable we are talking about is a clear indication by Jesus to us). Therefore, I find that salvation by faith and deeds makes more sense to me.</p>
