              <p>they pray, that they will be saved. if they preached, after they pray about it and God used them, they would have answered their own prayers. so what? christians only preach but don't pray for the unsaved's salvation?</p>
              <p>is it impossible to do both? or is it some special God's command that catholics pray, but christians do?</p>

              <p>It is not about you. It is about God and God only. Please lah, to say a slave to sin can earn his own freedom is a joke.

              <blockquote>
              <p> For example, the reformed position has faith as an effect of election rather than a cause of it (as the Arminians have it). Thus, there is a sense in which a person is saved in order to have faith. Where, then, should blame be laid if a person does not believe? The Arminian position has the believer responsible for whether or not God saves them, and thus a person must persevere to the end before they can be assured of salvation. What does this say about a believer's security? These and many other questions are dependant upon the "ordo salutis" for their answers, and it is thus important that a believer understands from which perspective those answers are given.</p>

              <p>You might have started on the wrong footing. So you basically dug your own grave, with those verses.</p>
              <p>See how theology is studied. You have various topics, and verses are used to support the point made. You don't parade a verse, then say the verse means this and this. Rather a group of verses are paraded to support your stand.</p>

              <p>I find it weird many Christians are not proud of their own denominational tradition. Those megachurch don't say lah, what tradition do they have?</p>
              <p>One baptist told me in EH last time, they emphasize a lot on studying the word of God. And he is very proud of that.</p>
              <p>When I read about the Wesley brothers, I was like wow. One can preach, the other can compose. Today, if you open your hymnal, you find hymns composed by Charles Wesley. Aren't you proud of that? Just like I think hokkiens should be proud of hokkien hay mee, teochew for their porridge.</p>
              <p>No lah, not higher education. It is enlightening for me to [try to] understand the various theologies.</p>
              <p>Don't say all the studying no use one ok. Try following the Reformed argument for their ordo salutis, you'd be impressed. I can tell you honestly I am. I'm impressed not because they managed to come out with theories like monergism, but with their staunch belief in the sovereignty of God.</p>
              <p>So God is very much sovereign. He determines who are saved, who are not by the elects. In fact, according to the covenant of redemption:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The covenant of redemption is the eternal agreement within the Godhead in which the Father appointed the Son Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit to redeem the elect from the guilt and power of sin. God appointed Christ to live a life of perfect obedience to the law and to die a penal, substitutionary, sacrificial death as the covenantal representative for all who trust in him.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So Christ died for his sheeps or the goats or all animals? I think you guys were talking about sheeps and goats. Perhaps if you understand the Arminian or Reformed perspective, things will be clearer.</p>

              <p>my stand is that salvation is by faith and faith alone. and that faith, will produce good works (because the heart will always be in the right place) in it's own course.</p>
              <p>good works, driven by love. and not because it's an obligation for salvation (since i don't worry about it) but EVERYTHING was shot down and condecended on because i didn't type in bible verses for it. (ah~~ catholic!)</p>

              <p>i was taught that salvation can be denied. say a christian meets an asshole online, and stumbled by his condecending ways, decides to become an athiest. he denied salvation and lost his faith in the exisntance of God and the goodness of salvation. Then he'd be as good as the unsaved. that explains why they have altar calls for backsliders along with non believers.</p>
              <p>but the point wasn't about perseverance. the point was at the point of believing. do you need good works as part of salvation.</p>
              <p>if you do, then the thief wouldn't be in paradise, the sinful woman wouldn't be told that it was her faith which saved her, a dying man at his death bed, believed at the last second, wouldn't make it either. unless you say God is a wishy-washy God who gives different conditions to different people at different circumstances regarding salvation</p>

              <p>and if it is a gift. it's not by any credit from us, or from our works, or anything which is from us. which kind of makes the point.</p>
              <p>i am thinking in a hashing algorithm process. Sincere faith which leads to salvation will be proven by works and fruits.</p>
              <p>but works may not reflect a sincere faith.</p>
              <p>nvm, it all don't matter anymore. tired alr. everytime i ask questions, a certain someone either redirects it to another point, conveniently forgetting what i said, or disregards it totally and disappears</p>
