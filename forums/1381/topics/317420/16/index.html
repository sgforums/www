              <p>hi dumb dumb,</p>
              <p>Much as we want to evangelise with the protestant, however the  catholic approach is  slightly different from that of teh protestant. To a catholic, religion is a persoanl thing btw him and God.. We encourage our non catholic friends to attend mass, novena etc.. with the intention to experience. not necessary to convert. We rather  let him feel whther he like it or not and whther he would want to coming to mass nxt time.. If he does not like, we have to let him go.. dun force.. maybe he's not ready yet..</p>
              <p>But from experience with my non catholic friend, they like to knowmore abt th faith after attending the novena or mass for a few times. They feel peace and someone is caring for them.. maybe Mother Mary, jesus or the saints. The Novena church is one great example. Most of the converts came to know Jesus after their prayers have been answered. The greatest experience to convert is to receive the eucharist or holy communion. While watching their catholic friends or relatives lining up to receive holy communion during mass,  they know that deep inside their heart the intense desire to receive. They are convinced that receiving Jesus in the form of host is the greatest miracle that will transformed their lives. But because they are not baptized yet, they can only do a spiritual communion. So most of them can't wait to be baptised, but they have to do the RCIA first.</p>
              <p>Honestly, as a frequent communicant of the holy communion.. every experience is different. There is certain amt of joy and happiness to receive Jesus who is God into yr lives. No amt of materia things cannot be bettter that that. Its is a transformed of yr live beyond anything else.</p>
              <p>cheers!!</p>

As christians you should save the people, isnt what the aim of this, that lead many of you preaching?</p>
              <p>Plus if you succeed, which i think you will, you will confirm appear on the straits times or even CNN, i am sure you would have spread the love of god to the others?</p>
              <p>actions speaks louder than words, and i am willing to sacifice my humble self to prove that christ exists..... this is your calling, i am willing to sacifice myself.</p>

              <p>OH yeah, god said that everyone is worth saving and worth preaching too, preach me please, i went for nazareth church at west coast area, and several others, so i do know a few things about them, how do you find loopholes, if you dun even know anything????? i think to date i went to several churches with some of my christian friends who attempted to preach and convert me......</p>
              <p>Ok there are the stats, i have received a total of 8 people trying to convert me, i managed to deconvert three of them after their attempts to convert me, ok i went to their churches and asked some very contradicting questions to their pastors, which a majority of 90% of the questions, they cannot answer or tried to avoid.</p>
              <p>I can't help it, but using logic on these people will have serious effects on them, if you asked the right things, AND using the things that they have said, on themselves...... contradict them, then they short circuit loh</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>with sufficient time, its actually easier to decovert them, rather than be converted, you just need to know the right things to say, when you meet them personally, find out the ROOT of his belief and find out the supporting structure of his root, use them to debunk itself, and you will have succeeded,</p>
              <p>But for some hardcore cases, after you debunk after he nothing to say, a good number will say: i feel god, i have a relationship with god etc etc the usual stuff...... this is the most entertaining part, esp you see the face when they say that</p>
              <p>but worry not, i observed some of them, their mouth say so, but after the treatment, their church going rate decline like hell.....</p>
