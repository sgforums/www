              <p>Anyway bottomline is. If what you say is true (and please,
              enough with the "it doesn't matter what we both think" statement. I
              already elaborated with bible verses above), and that good works is
              a precondition for salvation, the whole world can just go to hell
              right now. Because everyday you're going to do something wrong,
              everyday you're going to forget to pay penance for some minor sins
              which slipped your mind, everyday you're going to piss someone off,
              or be pissed at someone. You'll be too busy trying to pull your
              butt out of the fryer to be effective in being fruitful.</p>
              <p>But if what I say is true, and supported by the Word and proven
              by my family's life, that good works is the result of salvation,
              then. Well, then nothing actually, except maybe Jesus can now
              effectively use you, since you're now more focused in the family
              business of leading the lost home, instead of saving yourself.</p>
              <p><br> So maybe, just maybe, it's you who need to reconsider your
              position. Keep an open mind? I mean, yeah, I'm young, I'm immature,
              what do I know right? compared with the towering wisdom of the
              catholic chruch. Maybe Jesus do actually use the fools to shame the
              wise, the weak to shame the strong?</p>

              <p>Good for you and your family.....what about the rest who also felt the same like you but belongs to other denominations?</p>
              <p>Go and checck it out to confirm for yourself - as the majority of christians worldwide is still Catholics and most of them felt the same way too...</p>
              <p>If going by what you says, who cares about works? Save means saved liao...once saved always saved.....no conditions attached. Otherwise, Jesus would have died for nothing.....(you need me to help give you bible quotes to support or youtube video?) Enjoy life brother, no need to sacrifice for God lah...waste time, pray for what ? Already go heaven - confirmed liao.</p>
              <p>If you want to tell me, but it's not like that because....you are automatically attaching conditions to your belief making it INVALID! Saved means saved liao and that's God's promise and supported by the bible (perhaps not)...........</p>
              <p>If so, why got The Last Judgement huh ? Should be no judgement liao mah...someone forget to delete this from the bible lah....</p>

              <p>hmm, can explain why u disagree? and if you agree with the 2nd, then it would make sense.</p>
              <p>because catholics believe that works is part of salvation. but who knows the reason why they do good works? can good work done with the wrong intention be any good?</p>
              <p>my stand is that salvation is by faith and faith alone. and that faith, will produce good works (because the heart will always be in the right place) in it's own course.</p>
              <p>good works, driven by love. and not because it's an obligation for salvation (since i don't worry about it) but EVERYTHING was shot down and condecended on because i didn't type in bible verses for it. (ah~~ catholic!)</p>

              <p>Christians who love God may not go to church for various reasons. I mean, your statement very strong leh. You say they WILL go to church if they love God.</p>
              <p>I'm referring more to Protestant churches. You can skip one or two months of church, no problem. But Catholic church works differently. When you attend Catholic church, your mentality must change. You go there not primarily to worship God and partake the once in a while "bread and wine". You go there to get nourished by the Mass. You go there to receive the blood and body of Christ. Note it is blood and body, no longer bread and wine.</p>
              <p>You are spot on, dumbdumb, regarding good works. I quote you the WCF:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>1. Good works are only such as God hath commanded in his holy Word, and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of blind zeal, or upon any pretense of good intention.</p>
              <p>2. These good works, done in obedience to God's commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith: and by them believers manifest their thankfulness, strengthen their assurance, edify their brethren, adorn the profession of the gospel, stop the mouths of the adversaries, and glorify God, whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto, that, having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>However, you may have misunderstood the Catholic folks. I believe they are referring to 2.</p>

              <p>i was taught that salvation can be denied. say a christian meets an asshole online, and stumbled by his condecending ways, decides to become an athiest. he denied salvation and lost his faith in the exisntance of God and the goodness of salvation. Then he'd be as good as the unsaved. that explains why they have altar calls for backsliders along with non believers.</p>
              <p>but the point wasn't about perseverance. the point was at the point of believing. do you need good works as part of salvation.</p>

              <p>I prefer the Reformed way of looking at such issue.</p>
              <p>To use the analogy, if God purchases your salvation with the blood of Christ, can you fall away? What God wants, God will get because He is God. The blood of Christ is shed for the precious few, not all mankind. The shepherd bleeds for his sheep, not all animals.</p>
              <p>The "trick" here is <strong>always look from God's perspective</strong>. If we analyze the issue from our perspective, it gets confusing because our life has ups and downs. So one moment you are saved, the next moment you turned atheist?</p>
              <p>At the point of believing, what do you believe in? Why is there an issue about good works then?</p>

              <p>then do they love God? That's my point, if you are a christian, and you don't have a problem with just attending service once on christmas and easter, and skipping the rest, i think it's a good time to ask yourself how real is salvation to you, and do you love God, because he certainly did alot of you.</p>
              <p>but on the other hand. you can goto church, just for the sake of being there. Love need not exist in your heart to be in church, just like love was not in my heart when i was a buddhist going to a temple.</p>
              <p>That's why again, a christian who loves God, will goto church (without being told etc), and if he can't, his heart is longing to goto church. But a christian who goes to church, may not love God.</p>

              <p>no problem. oh just something.</p>
              <p>it's not that i misunderstood about the condom thing, but wikipedia says that roman catholics only endorse natural family planning. and it's a mortal sin to use contraceptives. And apparently, if it isn't important enough for the great number of catholics to rewrite it, how can I be expected to act differently about it?</p>
              <p>and with regards to penance. Sorry, no bible quotes on it, so yeah, again, it's your stuff, not mine. Point is, if you're going to jibe at others, and then say that it's God's view that matters, not ours. Then it's interesting to know that it's not how you think about the jibe that matters, or whether mine matters, but God isn't it. And since you have penance for such stuff, and a very harsh punishment if something goes unconfessed (something the catholic endorses, so i wouldn't know about it, or need to for that matter)</p>

              <p>I agree with you. But for the sake of discussion, can we leave out megachurches? In their case, size really doesn't mean anything.

              <p>My impression is those Protestants who parade bible verses do more harm than good usually. You see, your "discussion partner" can always use it against you. And you sink deeper into the morass. Well grounded Christians complement their sound theology with scriptural support. So they talk theology, not half baked ideas. I'm not criticising those without theological background and calling their personal conviction half baked ideas. Rather it is the mentality. When you pad your half baked ideas with bible verse, you are making a statement - the bible agrees with me! Not saying those half baked ideas are lies or heresy, however.</p>
              <p>I find it weird why some Christians see theology as not very helpful in their Christian life and as a result not inclined to make an effort to study it. It is amusing because in our society, we usually study for our livelihood. Why people study MBA or CFA? For fun? Now you have something that is surely of interest to you as a Christian, yet you brush it aside.</p>
              <p>Ok, we shall leave megachurch out. :P</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Perhaps, christians can also learn from the sages. To quote from the Mishnah. Qiddushin. 4.14.</p>
              <p>K.  Abba Gurion of Sidon says in the name of Abba Gurya, " A man should not teach his son to be an ass driver, a camel driver, a baber, a sailor, a heardsman, or a shopkeeper. For their trade is a trade of thives."</p>
              <p>L.  R. Judah says in his name, "Most ass drivers are evil, most camel drivers are decent, most sailors are saintly, the best among physicians is going to Gehenna, and the best of butchers is a partner of Amalek."</p>
              <p>M.  R. Nehorai says, " I should lay aside every trade in the world and teach my son only Torah.</p>
              <p>N.  "For a man eats its fruits in this world, and the principal  remains for the world to come.</p>
              <p>O.  "But other trade are not that way.</p>
              <p>P.  "When a man gets sick or old or has pains and cannot do his job, lo, he dies of starvation.</p>
              <p>Q.  "But with Torah it is not that way.</p>
              <p>R.  "But it keeps him from all evil when he is young, and it gives him a future and a hope when he is old.</p>
              <p>S.  "Concerning his youth, what does it say? They who wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength.  And concerning his old age what does it say?  They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.</p>
              <p>T.  "And so it says with regards to the patriarch Abraham, may he rest in peace, And Abraham was old and well along in years, and the LORD blessed Abraham in all things.</p>
              <p>U.  "We find that the patriarch Abraham kept the entire Torah even before it was revealed, since it says, Since Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandment, my statues, and my laws."   The Mishnah a new translation by Jacob Neusner, Yale University Press. pp498-499. </p>
              <p>Yes, everybody should concentrate on discovering what GOD say in the bible (Torah) and try their best to to it. If this is achieved there will be Shalom.  Perhaps, dumbdumb! would also like to re examine his present church doctrines.</p>

              <p> For me, therein lies the
              problem that in trying to advance her ecumenical agenda, the Roman
              Catholic Church has opened its arms so wide to embrace everyone
              that it might end up strangling itself.</p>
              <p>SO, not here to add fire to ur discussion (debate?), but if u
              could point me somewhere.</p>

              <p>The only agenda that the Catholic Church has is that it try to save all people, nothing else. Yes, the Church opens its arms so wide to embrace everyone, but it doesn't compromise on the faith, doctrines.</p>
              <p>What happened is Catholic Church has tried very hard to embrace Protestans, with Vatican II, but there is no result so far, instead its loosing its traditional members like SSPX and other traditionals. If I am not wrong, in Vatican II, Protestant leaders are invited as an observer, and the current Pope in the council, was dressed informally, which I believe he is trying to make Catholic look less threatening.</p>
              <p>And now it is trying to embrace back the traditionals.</p>

              <p>no problem. oh just something.</p>
              <p>it's not that i misunderstood about the condom thing, but
                      wikipedia says that roman catholics only endorse natural family
                      planning. and it's a mortal sin to use contraceptives. And
                      apparently, if it isn't important enough for the great number of
                      catholics to rewrite it, how can I be expected to act differently
                      about it?</p>
              <p>and with regards to penance. Sorry, no bible quotes on it, so
                      yeah, again, it's your stuff, not mine. Point is, if you're going
                      to jibe at others, and then say that it's God's view that matters,
                      not ours. Then it's interesting to know that it's not how you think
                      about the jibe that matters, or whether mine matters, but God isn't
                      it. And since you have penance for such stuff, and a very harsh
                      punishment if something goes unconfessed (something the catholic
                      endorses, so i wouldn't know about it, or need to for that

              <p>and look at what you post in the next post? =) how? if you were in my shoes?</p>
              <p>and i did try to bow out. i said that if you didn't understand. i can't explain any better than it. and if you didn't say anything, or said something pacifying, i wouldn't have said anything else. but the moment you tried to make it look like i didn't know what i was talking about and was trying to smoke through. of course i got pissed. if you were in my shoes, you'd be too.</p>
              <p>lol, you can deny it, i wouldn't know. but God knows right? After all, as M&amp;P says, only He can judge righteously. Maybe to you, it was something minor which I blew out of proportion and took it personally. But does God see it as something minor? And what if God sees it as an offence, but you didn't, thus not paying penance for it. How does God settle that account?</p>
              <p>Also, you keep pushing me to listen to Icemoon. If i am not mistaken, he's not a christian nor a catholic, so you want me to listen to him? He says the bible teaches kids the wrong way of escaping from a snake. Am i suppose to take spiritual guidance from his words? I don't even know when to take him seriously!</p>
              <p>and also after all the round and about, i still haven't really gotten my answer. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does what i say about salvation makes sense</span> (please and oh, please, don't tell me that what i say don't matter, yada yada..). - That salvation is by faith only, and with good faith, comes love, which is one of the fruits of the holy spirit developed, and with love, comes good work, which reflects the faith of the person.</p>
              <p>which in another words, i translate to layman term -<strong> a christian who loves God, goes to church, but a christian who goes to church, may not love God</strong> (which you said is irrelevant because it's not supported by the bible, and i've pasted relevent quotes already)</p>
              <p>if not, please tell me, which part of that sentence about salvation don't fit in the bible.</p>

              <p>Did you try to engage in a discussion? I don't think so - did I attack you as a person or because you are not Catholic? NO.</p>

              <p>I quote <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>your thief story:</strong></span></p>
              <p>"and another thing. the thief who got pked beside Jesus. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He
                                      didn't have any works to show for it, except a life of sin -
                                      stealing, killing, destroying. </strong></span>All he had was the mustard seed of
                                      faith mustered in him, when he saw the sign "King of the Jews", and
                                      that same small faith drove him to ask Jesus if He loved him enough
                                      to remember him.</p>
              <div id="post-body-8104163" class="body">
              <p>And Jesus did. No works, no baptism, no nothing. Except faith.

              <p>and that's very comforting, but sure, if you want to make life

              <p>So why did Jesus forgive him? There was 2 crminals with Jesus, 1 on the right and the other on the left. Even the one being crucified with Jesus mocked at him.....but only 1 did. The other one (you are talking about) said :</p>
              <p><strong>"Have you no fear of God at all?"........<span style="text-decoration: underline;">we are paying for what we did</span>........But this man has done nothing wrong" </strong>LK 23:39-43</p>

              </div>
              <p>I quote <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>your sinful woman story</strong></span> :</p>
              <p>"Out of nowhere, a sinful woman
                                      appeared, most probably a prostitute, and peered into the crowd,
                                      trying to spot Jesus. The bible says that she learned that Jesus
                                      would be having dinner at this religious leader's house. How did
                                      she hear it? I don't know, most probably she heard Jesus preaching
                                      and overheard the pharisee inviting Jesus. She was definitely not
                                      invited. <strong>But what drove her to Jesus' house</strong>? She's a prostitute,
                                      and she knows that everyone knows that she's a prostitute. If I am
                                      a prostitute, I would definitely not go to a place filled with holy
                                      people. But why did she do that? <strong>Did she hear Jesus preach in the
                                      streets?</strong> Was the message a message of fear and condemnation, that
                                      if she didn't follow His way, she was doomed to the pits of hell?
                                      or did she hear the <strong>message of love and acceptance</strong>?</p>
              <p>I'm sure it's because <strong>she heard the message of love and
                                      acceptance from Jesus.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Because it's evident from her actions</strong></span>. She
                                      brought along with her a jar of really expensive perfume, probably
                                      her only jar, which costed her everything, and showered Jesus with
                                      love. Using her tears to wet his feet, and her hair to dry them.
                                      And annointed His feet with the perfume."</p>

              <p>Did we make life difficult for Catholics, perhaps, but Jesus said, we should carry our cross and follow him.....a bit of pain here and there ok one....you relax but we treasure the sacrifice that Jesus did for us. (Don't say you never said those things huh....)</p>

                      in my shoes?</p>
              <p>and i did try to bow out. i said that if you didn't understand.
                      i can't explain any better than it. and if you didn't say anything,
                      or said something pacifying, i wouldn't have said anything else.
                      but the moment you tried to make it look like i didn't know what i
                      was talking about and was trying to smoke through. of course i got
                      pissed. if you were in my shoes, you'd be too.</p>
              <p>lol, you can deny it, i wouldn't know. but God knows right?
                      After all, as M&amp;P says, only He can judge righteously. Maybe to
                      you, it was something minor which I blew out of proportion and took
                      it personally. But does God see it as something minor? And what if
                      God sees it as an offence, but you didn't, thus not paying penance
                      for it. How does God settle that account?</p>
              <p>Also, you keep pushing me to listen to Icemoon. If i am not
                      mistaken, he's not a christian nor a catholic, so you want me to
                      listen to him? He says the bible teaches kids the wrong way of
                      escaping from a snake. Am i suppose to take spiritual guidance from
                      his words? I don't even know when to take him seriously!</p>
              <p>and also after all the round and about, i still haven't really
                      gotten my answer. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does
                      what i say about salvation makes sense</span> (please and oh,

                      which is one of the fruits of the holy spirit developed, and with
                      love, comes good work, which reflects the faith of the person.</p>
              <p>which in another words, i translate to layman term - <strong>a

                      to church, may not love God</strong> (which you said is irrelevant

              <p>it's not that i misunderstood about the condom thing, but
              wikipedia says that roman catholics only endorse natural family

              <p>and with regards to penance. Sorry, no bible quotes on it, so
              yeah, again, it's your stuff, not mine. Point is, if you're going
              to jibe at others, and then say that it's God's view that matters,
              not ours. Then it's interesting to know that it's not how you think
              about the jibe that matters, or whether mine matters, but God isn't
              it. And since you have penance for such stuff, and a very harsh
              punishment if something goes unconfessed (something the catholic
              endorses, so i wouldn't know about it, or need to for that

              <p>sure it is easy to say when the number of internet users in Singapore is so high. there is no need to further prove it because we are not conversing via the internet. my point is: all our postulations.... how has that got to do with that poor family that my church is ministering to, at nearby Batam, or the farmer who attends the church that my own pastor has helped built at Fujian. This people do not have the sophistry of the internet nor have they the benefit of a higher education. All they have is probably a torn down bible and a simple promise of salvation. If this promise of salvation is wrong, according to all your internet research, does that mean that these illiterate never received their salvation?</p>

              <p>.... and may I add one line....: while good works are important to the life of a Christian, it has nothing to do with receiving salvation.</p>
              <p>.... sorry, I am now riding on you.... i sure hope mrlim doesn't mind  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>.... to those who disagree with me... or dumb2.... it is actually quite alright with me because I really do not see the need to prove anything one way or another. You will demand scripture and I will provide it, and you will provide your own counter scripture, and I will counter again..... æ²¡å®Œæ²¡äº†! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>then do they love God? That's my point, if you are a christian,
              and you don't have a problem with just attending service once on
              christmas and easter, and skipping the rest, i think it's a good
              time to ask yourself how real is salvation to you, and do you love
              God, because he certainly did alot of you.</p>
              <p>but on the other hand. you can goto church, just for the sake of
              being there. Love need not exist in your heart to be in church,
              just like love was not in my heart when i was a buddhist going to a
              temple.</p>
              <p>That's why again, a christian who loves God, will goto church
              (without being told etc), and if he can't, his heart is longing to
              goto church. But a christian who goes to church, may not love
              God.</p>
              <p>I really don't think I need to elaborate until so detailed
              right?</p>

              <p>The whole thing about the Last Judgement is to tell you that Jesus separate people into sheeps and goats based on if they have shown love to their neighbour.</p>
              <p>If they did (like the sheeps), they have shown love to God. If they don't (like the goats), they did not show love to God.</p>
              <p>So, why we says deeds is important? Because Jesus said so (at least in our teachings) and we need to follow......</p>
              <p>Is it about missions, evangelising etc.....? NO (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but not that those are not important</strong></span>) but the primary focus is to teach Christians to love not just one another, but everybody regardless of faith. Not go out theer telling people they are going to hell and you are there to save them.....it's good intention but may not be approiate approach. That's all.</p>
              <p>Extend your friendship in sincerity and with love, you gain friends....friends who trust you and see how a sincere and loving person you are more likely to be converted because they see "Jesus" in you.....</p>
              <p>If you have love for your neighbour, your approach will be that of love and your evangelisation and any other missions will be easier...why we stress a lot of prayers ? To ask God to help us to forgive others and give us strength to love (Go say the Lord's Prayer - something you forget to dispute on). Does not sound right?</p>
              <p>Having said that, are all Catholics saints? NO, we never said so as we are all humans and sinners and we will not be perfect. Just like someone said, theer will always be black sheeps. Are they saved, leave that to God....</p>
              <p>Hating, getting angry and anyhow whack is exactly the opposite....</p>
              <p>Forget about going and not going to Church etc...as your mentor told you - focus on loving God. How, did He not show you in the last judgement?</p>
              <p>I am not even asking you to accept this...if you think it make sense, maybe you can dicsuss with someone you trust from your Church. If you gain something out of this, you don't have to thanks me - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>thanks God.</strong></span></p>
              <p>If you think what I said are all rubbish....it's ok but don't curse Catholic or God, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>curse me alone.</strong></span></p>
              <p>So, do you think we love God ? Do we have to said it to you ? I think actions speaks louder than words. Go examine what the Catholic faith are doing ..... I postedd something like that before.</p>
              <p>Yes, everytime I says GOD BLESS YOU, I mean it.</p>

              <p>and isn't what all christians go through with the sinner's
              prayer?</p>
              <p>knowing that we've led a life of sin, then confessing out sins,
              and acknowledging that salvation comes from Christ alone, and
              receiving that gift of grace?</p>
              <p>is there any works involved at that point of believing and
              putting his faith in Christ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Because you keep telling me that good
              works is a precondition for salvation</span>.</p>
              <p>because, unless i'm mistaken again, you're saying that the good
              works he did here and there was part of the reason why he got
              saved?</p>
              <p>but the thief realised that he led a life of sin, heck, if you
              broke one commandment, you broke em all, so it didn't really matter
              actually, since he's a thief, and he realised that the wages of sin
              is death, he is indeed paying for what he has done, but he also
              realised that the gift of God is eternal life, and he acknowledged
              that, and asked Jesus to remember him. That's what i see from this
              passage.</p>
              <p>The other thief didn't place his faith in Jesus, that's what
              condemned him, isn't it? It wasn't his lack of good works, or
              anything else. Because, the only difference between the 2 thieves,
              is that one believed and received, the other rejected. (parable of
              the sower again)</p>
              <p>and it wasn't because of what she did which saved her. what she
              did was apart from her salvation. she did it simply because she
              loves God, it contributed nothing, nothing whatsoever to her
              salvation status. In another words, she did it, after she was
              saved. not before her salvation status. As Jesus said, it was her
              faith which saved her.</p>

              only want to know one thing.. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does what i say about salvation makes
              sense</span>  - <strong>That salvation is by faith only, and

              you.</p>

              <p>Your apologises is not needed because I was never angry in the first place. I told you why you should not attached conditions to faith if that's what you believed. It's ok.</p>
              <p>Once you attached conditions that good faith leads to good works, you indirectly supporting what I said because James said faith without work is dead.</p>
              <p>You said that faith that do not lead to good works is not good faith and these people will not be saved.</p>
              <p>You support the last judgement story that christians can end up in goats. If one lost his faith after baptism, he is a christian. By baptisim, he is saved and cannot be unsaved liao...</p>
              <p>see the problem.....it's not that you are wrong to disagree with me - Chin Eng disagreed, But because you are not clear where you stand.....</p>
              <p>That's what I am trying to make you think.....you can ask Chin Eng to help you out and sort it out.</p>
              <p>I was once swayed by once saved always saved...I did my own searching and I trust the Catholic version because it make miore sense to me. It's personal choice.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p> sorry, Chin, but i differ here. I still feel critical about catholics, especially since they're so uppity, in the end, it always comes down to "We're the oldest, so we're the correct-est"</p>

              <p>at the end of the day, we are always critical about someone and something. I am personally quite critical about the megachurches. but in internet forums, it is quite difficult to rein in the emotions, so in my opinion, when two parties argue and use verses to do that, i think we are being disrespectul to the Bible (unless you have a sure win verse).</p>
              <p>many churches, even protestant ones, also have the uppity attitude.... yup, I don't like that either, but we ought to distance the individuals with the official "vision statement"</p>
              <p>... but it's just my two cents worth.</p>
