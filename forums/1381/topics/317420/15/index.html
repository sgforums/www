              <p>huh stubborn about what? yeah, i said something in a wrong way there.</p>
              <p>i wanted to answer, if Jesus didn't jump off the cliff to prove a point, why should i? but pointless la, that's why i kept quiet.</p>
              <p>what i meant to say was. people usually only turn to God in their times of need, and since whoever that person is, is obviously not in need, and thus is able to bad mouth about God's existance and grace and stuff.</p>
              <p>just like my dad. totally critical about christianity until he was in need and had no choice but to turn to the Healer.</p>
              <p>he was badmouthing about christians brainwash others, the tithing thing is a scam, going to church is a waste of time, and wanted to meet the pastor to see if he's scamming me.</p>

              <p>huh stubborn about what? yeah, i said something in a wrong way
              there.</p>
              <p>i wanted to answer, if Jesus didn't jump off the cliff to prove
              a point, why should i? but pointless la, that's why i kept
              quiet.</p>
              <p>what i meant to say was. people usually only turn to God in
              their times of need, and since whoever that person is, is obviously
              not in need, and thus is able to bad mouth about God's existance
              and grace and stuff.</p>
              <p>just like my dad. totally critical about christianity until he
              was in need and had no choice but to turn to the Healer.</p>
              <p>he was badmouthing about christians brainwash others, the
              tithing thing is a scam, going to church is a waste of time, and
              wanted to meet the pastor to see if he's scamming me.</p>
              <p>now he's a changed man =)</p>

              <p>I do love protestants as my mother and brother are protestants.
                  I also have many good friends, relatives and business associate who
                  are protestants.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, dumbdumb is serious in his reflection and don't screw
                  up the image of christians faith again.</p>
              <p>Hope he is keeping quiet because he realised that he could be at
                  fault sometimes too.</p>
              <p>He can be anti-catholic for all he wants but he need to learn
                  that he should not be creating unhappiness by trying to make a
                  mockery out of everything Catholic when he knows nothing about
                  it.</p>
              <p>I don't need apology from him as this is a free for all forum. I
                  do hope to see him being more mature and responsible for what he
                  said.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Chin Eng, thanks for trying to settle this argument.</p>
