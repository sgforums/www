              <p>You have to be sinless and blameless 24/7 otherwise when you die, you will not go to heaven because the sins that you have will will prevent you from entering heaven. Of course Catholics have the middle ground of purgatory, which protestants do not accept.</p>

              <p>You are right, there is nothing to discuss since the goal posts keep shifting causing running around in circles.</p>
              <p>I said it is clear because Jesus spelt out how he classify the groups into sheeps and goats. Based on their deeds and it is there.</p>
              <p>You dispute that by saying christians auto sheep and goats are non-christians. Then you says this parable is to show christians who do good deed unknowingly....could be but....</p>
              <p>If goats are non-christians, why do they bother to ask Jesus why they are in the group of goats? Obviously, there are christians who end up there and wonder why......perhaps not....</p>
              <p>If you insist that goats are non-christians, does that means Jesus is saying that non-christians cannot do good deed? And only Christians can do good deeds but perhaps unknowingly? Do you believe that? You did not explain......</p>
              <p>Therefore, I said your explanation do not gel with the entire parable.  The other half need to be explained.</p>
              <p>Is this a teaching by Jesus ?</p>
              <p>Is Jesus not reaching out to everybody regardless of their race or social status? Is he converting them by doing deeds? Healing them, forgiving them for their sins, giving them a second chance in life (sign of love) ?</p>
              <p>Is it so difficult to read and accept what Jesus said? Is this parable not about Jesus teaching us to love our neigbhours?</p>
              <p>Then now salvation also need to be debated and going to heaven becomes a by-product. Will not go on debating....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You said we need to be sinless and blameless 24/7 before we die in order to go heaven. Then who can go ? We are all sinners - don't agree again? Or do you subscribe to once saved always saved?</p>
              <p>Purgatory has nothing to do in this dicussion. I said earlier, confessions is what we are looking at.</p>
              <p>A short note for dumbdumb, Catholic Churches believes in living a Christian life (in our tecahings means - love your God and love your neighbour) first. Only then you can talk about evangelisation by showing people that Jesus has made a difference in your life by making you a better person. This is also reason why the Catholic faith are running non-profit nursing homes, hospices, orphanges etc....Rather than going on the streets to talk and talk.....</p>
              <p>Look at the other thread "No offence to christians" and you will see what I mean when I says <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>some christians</strong></span> are doing more harm than good with their evangelisation.</p>
              <p>Not that we are right, but our approach is different - that's all.</p>

              <p>Do you need to feel guilty that you did not reach out to each
                          and everyone? I don't think so because it is impossible.</p>
              <p>You keep saying that Catholic do not reach out but then how come
                          we still survive and having baptsim year after year? Where did they
                          come from? Reject of your preaching?</p>
              <p>I think Malcom tried to explained before. The Catholic Churches
                          pray every week for the sick and for those who departed. Not only
                          when someone dear pass away. The prayers are meant for everybody.
                          And in stituation like yours, you don't even feel like saying a
                          prayer for your friend? If you think she is in heaven, why not also
                          say a prayer of thanks to our Lord? Pls do not think I am implying
                          that you friend is not in heaven - I don't as I have already
                          explained.</p>
              <p>If someone can benefit from the Gospel, why don't they benefit
                          it when they are alive? That's a good question but we always have
                          to know that not everyone will be converted and that's a fact.
                          There is so only so much that we can do and we do our best.</p>
              <p>Isn't our God great, loving and unforgiving that even
                          non-believers now can stand a chance to go to heaven?</p>
              <p>Being christian is an honour and we should live our life as much
                          as possible they way Jesus wants us to. That is to love our God
                          with everything and also to love our neighbour. The last judgement
                          parable is also to re-inforce the love our neighbour part.</p>
              <p>Is that so difficult a task that we cannot do? Why wait when all
                          of us can start take the first step.</p>

              <p>Of course, your burning house analogy is weak. In real life, the kids will be desperate to escape. BUT note what Paul said about the unsaved - it is in their nature to reject the gospel.</p>

              <p>dumbdumb, so far you have not been able to proof anything you said from a biblical point of view.</p>
              <p>You asked for quotes that support my view and I gave to you - you have no reply. Instead, you came up with other quotes which you did not says for what?</p>
              <p>Then, you bring in your dead friend, uncles and personal opinions which does nothing for the discussion.</p>
              <p>You depended on Chin Eng to help you and ride on his comments when you clearly do not even know that his stand is different from yours!</p>
              <p>You are confused over the quotes we are talking about and you start acussing people of branding you when there was none. You start calling people names and cursing with no reason except from those you make up.</p>
              <p>You think that only you are saved because you have faith?</p>
              <p>Did you wonder why Jesus said not all who call Him Lord with go to heaven but those who do the will of His father? It was quoted before and are you confused.</p>
              <p>You want sower parable?  Go read MT13:18-23 and 47:50</p>
              <p>Verse 20-21 says : "The one who received it on patches of rock is the man who hears the word and welcomes it at once with joy.But he has no root in him, he does not last, let some trial come, or some persecution on account of the word, and he falls away at once"</p>
              <p>What do you think of the above? A person who has faith in the begining but fade away. Still saved? For Chin Eng yes, for you? Do you need to consult Chin Eng first?</p>
              <p>Then are all Christians auto saved? For Chin Eng - Yes, for you? Wait for Chin Eng to response first and add on his comments?</p>
              <p>You think you are the one superhero that is saving the world with your evangelisation? I have given you enough facts but you respond with nothing......except more accussation and smears.</p>
              <p>What has the burning house got to do with this discussion? Do you know how many non-christians died in the recent Sichuan earthquake and the Mnymar cyclone??</p>
              <p>At least we pray for them sincerely and ask God for mercy for these unfortunate victims.</p>
              <p>Where are you? Wasting your time acussing people instead of spreading the good news there? Those non-christians are all going to hell? You know for sure? And what are you doing about it? Talk is cheap! Count how many lives you did not save..........</p>
              <p>Unless you wake up and grow up, there is nothing to discuss with you.</p>
              <p>P.S. don't bring in anymore innocent dead friends and realtives of yours to this discussions.....let them rest in peace! thanks.</p>

              <p>You think that only you are saved because you have faith?</p>
              <p>Did you wonder why Jesus said not all who call Him Lord with go

              <p>You want sower parable?  Go read MT13:18-23 and 47:50</p>
              <p>Verse 20-21 says : "The one who received it on patches of rock
                  is the man who hears the word and welcomes it at once with joy.But

              <p>i did reply to your bible quotes. and i did supply bible quotes to support what i've said. but apparently just as the jews were blind to Jesus's truth, so are you. i've pasted and REpasted what i've said for your convenience. Grow some eyes.</p>
              <p>you haven't answered me, did the thief who died beside Jesus, did he have any works to show for his salvation?</p>
              <p>Did you even read what I said about luke? because apparently you didn't acknowledge what I said either, but you kept saying my quote isn't supported by the bible.</p>
              <p>LOL, prayer for the dead.. i said it once, and i'll say it again, you guys build better tombs than houses for the living. have the thought of sharing the gospel even occurred to you in your entire catholic life?</p>
              <p>have you shared your faith with Jesus to others who never heard before? Have you been to a mission trip before? If prayer for the dead wasn't part of the church schedule, you wouldn't even be participating in it! and as for begging God for mercy for their souls. Apparently, you don't read enough. Those who has the Son, has life, and those who don't, doesn't. Honestly, I don't pray for the dead, Those who died with the Son in their lives, are already receiving the greatest blessing ever, and nothing I can pray for can add to that. Unless you're saying thanksgiving. And as for those who died without Christ, I only feel regret.</p>
              <p>I don't try to give excuses for myself by "offering some prayers" hoping God will change His mind about holiness.</p>
              <p>The only way to the Father is through the Son. Can God change what He decrees? Even with all His compassion, He has to uphold His holiness.</p>
              <p>Also, Jesus didn't tell you to pray for the dead, He told you to make disciples of all nations. And what have YOU done for the latter?</p>
              <p>And as for the parable of the sower - I once experienced this part in my life, And I left the church for awhile, before coming back. Have you? What you know are just theory, while i've tasted every bit, that's why what I said don't make sense to you. You're so sheltered in the fact that the catholic church is the "one true church", you're so oblivious to so many things.</p>
              <p>Your family probably are catholics as well, do you ever feel the anxiety of knowing that your family could die unsaved? did you ever have to face percercution from your family, driven out from your house because you became a believer? did you have to face cold stares and words of anger everytime you try to share the good news?</p>
              <p>If your family aren't believers, then what are you going to do about it? wait until there is an opportunity to pray for their dead souls, hoping God will spare them?</p>
              <p>You're just somebody who knows what the word teaches, but does not what the word demands. You have knowledge, but I have works. Works not because I'm afraid I'll lose my salvation, though. That's the whole point.</p>
              <p>You want my stand? My stand is that salvation comes from faith and faith alone. Because in the end, that's what the word demands, that we do the Father's will, which is to look to the Son, and believe. And we shall have eternal life.</p>
              <p>Go pray for the dead souls.. seems like a great idea compared to preaching the Word. No stress, no pressure, no frustration, no anxiety, and more importantly, no great personal sacrifice. Great for laid back people like me. =)</p>
