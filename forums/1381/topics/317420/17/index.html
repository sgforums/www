              <p>as stated by some, cancer patients, plus people who are sick through other illnesses and people with various social disorder are being help. there are various religious organisation already doing it.</p>
              <p>Helping Hands and Fei Yue Community are some of them, and if you actually read the newspaper, you will come across various individual Christians and organisations that does lots of good work for the sick and the needy.... but of course, YOU can choose to ignore these.... it's up to up and it does not bug me a single bit.... as I'd said, you're just ranting... like a spoilt kid.</p>

              Christians have done, apparently it is still insufficient to
              you.... but in the first place why are we accountable to you?</p>
              <p>fact is, Christians and folks of various relgions have done a

              <p>aiyo, you have been killed by your own words again, since you said that atheism is a subset AND the cancer society is a secular organisation, then obviously, atheism fractions would exist within this organistaion right? since they are not mutually exclusive, i am a member of the cancer society FYI. yeah........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for the accountable part, yes you are not accountable to me for any good work and charity that you should do, but are you accountable to god? to preach and spread the love? you are isnt that? and my proposal is nicely in line, i thought of this for you le :)</p>

              <p>actually, on questions not answered, you have a some too... I have asked polite before, name one openly Atheistic organsation doing good work.</p>
              <p>I have another.... how so has atheism "DONE MORE"?</p>
              <p>The Cancer Society thing? The website is still down. Sure you can belong to one, but find me ONE clause in their vision statement that states that they are ATHEISTIC and maybe you have a case. I would think the cancer society will be deeply offended if you want to label them as atheistic. You know, once their website is up again, I will write them a note and ask them officially, if they are atheistic. That will settle the score, wouldn't you say. If, however, you have another link to the Cancer Society of Singapore, please be so kind as to share it with me so that I can find out by either writing in or calling them.</p>
              <p>So far, you've done nothing but rant and kpkb. You have not provided anything even remotely substantial to support your arguments except making dubious claims without evidence...</p>
              <p>There are many atheists who have issues with religious organisations. Many of these are extremely intelligent individuals whom I enjoy discussion with....</p>
              <p>Most certainly, you are not one of them.</p>

              <p>he is unable to quote any atheistic charitable organisation, and there are many good religion based charitable organisation all over Singapore catering to different groups, yet he says that atheists do more good work....</p>
              <p>and he gets into the murky definition of atheists being a subset of secularism, therefore the conclusion is secular organisations are atheistic....</p>
