              <p>hmm. i can't say that salvation is a lifelong process. but i say that, being made holy is a life long process.</p>
              <p>we are saved, definitely, but the process of refining our characters to be more like Jesus, is a life long process. we are always going to stumble at one point or another, and each experience makes us stronger, each time we are delivered from our troubles, from our fears, from our struggles, we grow a little bigger, our faith grow a little stronger, our willingness to obey without resisting grows softer.</p>

              <p><br>yup, so there will be those who might wish to split hair on how long the "salvation" process is.</p>
              <p>the ordo salutis thing is a little over my head.</p>
              <p>the thing about such teaching is: how does it benefit the new illiterate believer in some backroads in some Shanxi province in China..... or the old auntie at the market?</p>
              <p>we can sit around and postulate all we want because many of us are learned.... is the message of God so complex and profound that there is so many theories behind it? and that because we cannot understand the complexity, our salvation is now worthless?</p>
              <p>I received Christ because I believed in Him.<br>Through His grace, I try to do my best.<br>Sometimes it doesn't work out that way.<br>Sometimes I mess up real bad.</p>
              <p>If I die today, do I still have my salvation?<br>Or do I deserve to lose my salvation just because I did not have one more day to make it right?</p>

              <p>is there a difference between "salvation" and "faith"?</p>
              <p>to my totally unlearned mind:</p>
              <p>Salvation - a specific point in time that one receives Jesus as
                  Lord and saviour.</p>
              <p>Faith - a mindset of belief based on the Bible to
                  enable one to carry on living the way one is suppose to live in
                  congruent to scriptural teachings. <em>(definitions my own, so if I
                  am wrong, don't call me a heretic)</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, can one have faith without works - I don't think so....</p>
              <p>But can one have salvation without works - Yes, because
                  salvation is unconditional with the exception of one's desire to be
                  saved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... i am not even sure if i am even following the trend of

              <p>Exactly, Jesus know that it is impossible for us all to be holy all the time, that is why we have confession (sacrament of reconciliation), and weekly sacrifice (the Mass). And of course on our part we have to feel sorry for our sins and show the act of contrition.</p>

              <p>...so if it impossible to be holy all the time, the point in time for our demise has to be measured correctly, otherwise when we are stuck between sins and kenna langar by car and die, too bad, so sad.</p>
              <p>...obviously because of your interpretation of scripture through the Catholic, you'd use this verse to support purgatory.... but please quote a verse in the Bible that talks about major and minor sins.</p>

              <p>Relack lah, dumbdumb and malcom.</p>
              <p>dumbdumb, you have to understand that both sides can learn from one another.</p>
              <p>Caring about God is not limited to preaching, or Catholics would have failed miserably. After so many years, not a single Catholic stop me to talk about the four spiritual laws. Or talk about Christ to me. I never receive any tract from them. Wah leow.</p>
              <p>But, note, Catholics are the only Christian denomination making a public stand for pro-life. Perhaps there are Methodists and Anglicans doing similar work, but just not as passionate like the Catholics. You know what Protestants are passionate about? 6 Days Creation! Anti Evolution! So they have this annual creation seminar held at St. Andrews Cathedral New Sanctuary. And many other smaller events, organized by certain denominations like the BPs.</p>
              <p>Seriously .. for what? I rather they save their energy and saliva for more worthy causes like the Catholics.</p>
              <p>So they cherish the sanctity of life. The sanctity of human marriage. They cherish what God holds dear.</p>
              <p>They cherish tradition. While Protestant Christians are aligning more and more to secular forms of worship, Catholics are going back to their roots. The current Pope, he says the Latin Mass is ok.</p>
              <p>It is hard to stop 'changes' creeping in. Many Protestants do not agree with the megachurches' way of worship. BUT you add one guitar today. Tomorrow you play it louder. Unknowingly.</p>
              <p>This, if you agree with me, shouldn't be the way. You should be worshipping God. Non believers should THINK you are worshipping God. Those who can't see you, but hear your worship, should THINK you are worshipping God. If they THINK you are holding a concert or practising for the next Sg idol, then your worship is screwed up. You may disagree. But note the Bible says Christians should be the light and salt of the Earth.</p>
              <p>If non believers see your worship and think of you as a tang kee, tell me, how is your evangelism going to succeed?</p>
              <p>A hundred may respond to the altar call. But a thousand may have seen the NPNT peektures of christians in a trance (taken in CHC?) and think, what the heck is that?</p>

              <p>malcom, you, and your brethrens, doom people to hell, by not preaching the Word, then come around telling them that they are doomed because they didn't live their christian lives, your way. if people are doomed to hell, it would be your fault, because salvation comes from faith, and faith comes from hearing the Word. And the people who should preach it, didn't.</p>
              <p>they were doomed because of ignorance, and you hastened the journey.</p>

              <p>Relack lah, dumbdumb and malcom.</p>
              <p>dumbdumb, you have to understand that both sides can learn from
                      one another.</p>
              <p>Caring about God is not limited to preaching, or Catholics would
                      have failed miserably. After so many years, not a single Catholic
                      stop me to talk about the four spiritual laws. Or talk about Christ
                      to me. I never receive any tract from them. Wah leow.</p>
              <p>But, note, Catholics are the only Christian denomination making
                      a public stand for pro-life. Perhaps there are Methodists and
                      Anglicans doing similar work, but just not as passionate like the
                      Catholics. You know what Protestants are passionate about? 6 Days
                      Creation! Anti Evolution! So they have this annual creation seminar
                      held at St. Andrews Cathedral New Sanctuary. And many other smaller
                      events, organized by certain denominations like the BPs.</p>
              <p>Seriously .. for what? I rather they save their energy and
                      saliva for more worthy causes like the Catholics.</p>
              <p>So they cherish the sanctity of life. The sanctity of human
                      marriage. They cherish what God holds dear.</p>
              <p>They cherish tradition. While Protestant Christians are aligning
                      more and more to secular forms of worship, Catholics are going back
                      to their roots. The current Pope, he says the Latin Mass is ok.</p>
              <p>It is hard to stop 'changes' creeping in. Many Protestants do
                      not agree with the megachurches' way of worship. BUT you add one
                      guitar today. Tomorrow you play it louder. Unknowingly.</p>
              <p>This, if you agree with me, shouldn't be the way. You should be
                      worshipping God. Non believers should THINK you are worshipping
                      God. Those who can't see you, but hear your worship, should THINK
                      you are worshipping God. If they THINK you are holding a concert or
                      practising for the next Sg idol, then your worship is screwed up.
                      You may disagree. But note the Bible says Christians should be the
                      light and salt of the Earth.</p>
              <p>If non believers see your worship and think of you as a tang
                      kee, tell me, how is your evangelism going to succeed?</p>
              <p>A hundred may respond to the altar call. But a thousand may have
                      seen the NPNT peektures of christians in a trance (taken in CHC?)
                      and think, what the heck is that?</p>

              <p>he annoys me.</p>
              <p>lol i'm not totally comfortable with chc's style either. but i'll just quote my dad's experience.</p>
              <p>before knowing Christ - he thinks all christians are out to brainwash me.</p>
              <p>after knowing Christ - he's singing a different tune, and is now "brainwashing" people.</p>
              <p>point is.. non christians are forever going to say stuff. until they know the truth for themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and as for being pro-life. nothing wrong with that really. but why can't you be pro-life, and preach the Word too? my church preach against smoking, to divorce, to abortion, to homosexuality, but their number one concern will ALWAYS be the non-believers and their salvation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EXACTLY! see, malcom? right from icemoon's mouth himself.</p>

              <p>in the end, non-believers are on a one way flight to the land of barbecue, because they didn't know. but catholics, they stamped the passport for them. clap clap, well done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh, even better yet! after someone dies, THEN they do something by offering something weak like prayers for the dead. it really sounds like a weak way of comforting your conscience THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT, WHILE THEY WERE ALIVE?</p>
