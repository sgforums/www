              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Ok, I got your point....but all those activities are not "works"
              per se....I had never been pressured to do any of this.....and my
              Church always ask for volunteers - never pressuring anyone, asking
              for tel no, follow up etc.....NEVER.</p>
              <p>I don't hint that works are needed for salvation - the bible
              says so as you can read.</p>
              <p>What do we believe about in Jesus and God? By faith, we believe
              and faith is dead without deeds and it is clear in the bible.</p>
              <p>What is the significance of our batipsm and Jesus's
              ressurection?</p>
              <p>I think we need to be careful as there are many Christians out
              there who think that they are saved as I explained before. No works
              is needed.....all sins forgiven (past, present and future), already
              righteous in front of God etc....sure go Heaven liao. No matter
              what.</p>
              <p>Is that a fact? You read the bible and you know it is not true.
              Even if you disagree, you go find out why it seems like they
              contradict with those teaching. To me, there is no contradiction at
              all.</p>
              <p>Jesus is teaching us to love God and our neigbhour - a
              commandment that all must follow if you believe in Him.</p>
              <p>If one have faith and call himself a Christian but go and tell
              friends of another faith that they are worshiping Satan and will go
              to Hell.....I don't see how they can convert. I certainly don't see
              how they please God. Will they go to Heaven because they have
              faith?</p>
              <p>Real evanglisation is about living a Christ-like life and
              following His teachings as closely as possible. To love each other
              as how He loved us. If people around us find that we have become "a
              better person" after embracing God, they will wonder and sharing
              our faith then will be more beneficial. Isn't this having faith +
              deeds?</p>
              <p>A friend told me - only 1 person read the bible, 99 others read
              the Christians.</p>
              <p>Sadly, it is true that many non-believers dislike Christians (I
              was one before) not because of Christianity, but because of
              behaviour of Christians (influenced by questionable doctroines)</p>

              <p>LOL, this is going to be a really long post. but i most probably won't post here again until after my exams.</p>
              <p>Regarding MT 5:13-16 - A little article that you may find interesting:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em><em>Luke 14:34-35 AMP</em><span>  </span><em>Salt is good [an
              excellent thing], but if salt has lost its strength and has become
              saltless (insipid, flat), how shall its saltness be restored?</em><span>  </span><em>(35)</em><span>  </span><em>It
              is fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap; men throw it away.
              He who has ears to hear, let him listen and consider and comprehend by
              hearing!</em></em></strong></p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em>The Living Bible gives a modern slant to Jesus’<span> warning:</span></em></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em><span>“What good is salt that has lost its saltiness? Flavorless salt is fit for nothing - </span>not even for fertilizer. It is worthless and must be thrown out. Listen well if you would understand my meaning.<span>”</span></em></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em>It may sound unusual to read of salt losing its
              saltiness, yet salt has different grades of quality and purity. Even
              today, only the highest grade of salt reaches the dining table. Most
              poorer grades of salt are used in industrial processes. </em></strong></p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em>In ancient times, salt was rarely pure. During
              Biblical times, most salt in Israel came from the Dead Sea and was
              often mixed with impurities, making the salt less salty. There were
              also conditions in which salt could be leached out or made less
              effective, through exposure to water, air, excessive sunlight or even
              other chemicals. The Victor Bible Background Commentary informs us:</em></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em><span>“In </span><span>Israel</span><span> salt was mined from a great ledge of rock salt lying near the </span><span>Dead Sea</span> and evaporated from that Sea’<span>s waters. The rock salt deteriorated in </span>high temperatures, and moisture could leach the salt from the rock. Thus this important product could lose its saltiness - <span>and become absolutely worthless.“</span></em></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em>In a similar vein, “<span>flakes of salt form on the rock shores of the </span><span>Dead Sea</span><span> at night. </span>In
              the morning the sun rises. Under its heat the salt loses is saltiness.
              It blends with the shore and loses its distinctiveness.”</em></strong></p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em>To illustrate this leaching process, Marvin Vincent quotes the following story:</em></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em><span>“A merchant of </span><span>Sidon</span><span>, having farmed of the government t</span>he revenue from the importation of salt, brought over a great quantity from the marshes of Cyprus - <span>enough, in fact, to supply the whole province for many years. This </span>he
              had transferred to the mountains, to cheat the government out of some
              small percentage of duty. Sixty-five houses were rented and filled with
              salt. Such houses have merely earthen floors, and the salt next the
              ground was in a few years entirely spoiled. [L]arge quantities of it
              [were] literally thrown into the road to be trodden under foot of men
              and beasts. It was ‘<span>good for </span>nothing.”</em></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><em>Salt can lose its saltiness if it is
              adulterated with inferior substances. In the same way, your
              distinctiveness as a follower of Jesus can be watered down if you mix a
              biblical lifestyle with the world’<span>s life</span>style.</em></strong></p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">We are indeed called to be salt and light of this world, but this doesn't have anything to do with salvation. It is the result of salvation, it is the result of experiecing the love of God and thus we are able to do good works - driven by love and purpose. it doesn't say that if we're not the salt and light of this world, we lose our salvation. But it is right, that we become useless, if we lose that light or salitiness. Having seen people who got seduced by the material world, they forget that they're only in this world temperorily, and they got sucked into it.</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">Regarding Matthew 7:21-27</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">Correct, not everyone who calls him Lord, will enter heaven. But do you know what the will of the Father is? the only time this phrase is explicitly explained is this:</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;chapter=6&amp;verse=40&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse">John 6:40</a></strong><br> For my </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Father's </strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will </span>is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I </strong><strong>will raise him up at the last day."</strong></p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">Not everyone who calls Jesus, "Lord", or attends church, attends cell group or sing christian songs, attends planetshakers concerts and yes, <strong>even doing christian work like evangelism etc</strong>, will be allowed into heaven. The only way into heaven is through Jesus, through looking to the Son and believing in Him. That's the only condition, that's the only salvation plan. The only name given unto men which we must be saved.</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">Regarding JAS
              2:14-20:</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">Like I said before, works are not part of salvation. But works reflect the faith in the believer. A Christian who loves god, will do good works, but a person who does good work, may not love God, or may not even be a christian.</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">Once I attended FCBC, and I heard the speaker (it should be that pastor lawrance) gave a short testimony. once he joined this christian organization, and he fooled the people into thinking he's a christian (he got say why, but I forgot). He does evangelism, prays, attends bible studies etc. And he actually rose among their ranks, and became the head. What a surprise for everyone when one day, during an evangelism rally, he walked up to receive the Lord.</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">And I have a personal friend, when I was in Hope of God (and that's why that church is horrendous, they are so desperate for leaders that they'll let anyone to be leader) with him, he actually became a cell leader without actually believing in Christ. I mean, he confessed to me later that, he believe the existance, but he don't.. <strong>believe</strong> believe, you know? Sure you can cast out demons in Jesus' name, but you may not be a believer. You may do good works, but what drives the good works? Unless it is the love for God, which is born by the faith in Christ's FINISHED work, that drives the good works, then it is right. You won't lose your salvation if you choose not to rise as a cell leader etc. That's christ's finished work. But when you have really received and gain confidence in that finished work, good works will automatically come out of you, <strong>which is the faith, accompanied by action. </strong>What are the signs? I think these could be part of it.</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">When people are talking "christianese", you get excited, you have testimonies to share, you want to give glory to God. When people get on your nerves, and you lose your temper, you consciously remember that Christ asked us to love everyone, and you ask for forgiveness for it, and you try to remember not to do it again, but knowing that you will slowly change for the better in Christ. When there is an opportunity to preach Christ to a searching person, you take it, and when someone receives Christ, you feel so joyful inside.</p>
              <p class="EC_MsoNormal">In the end. I still say this.<strong> A christian who loves God, will go to church, but a christian who goes to church, may not love God.</strong></p>

              to chi bet: 
              
              i sympathise wif ur situation n am sadden tat such churches like urs exist. however, u mentioned tat u have chosen to be stubborn abt 2cor6:14..i am not going to say tat u must die die follow but juz sth u may like to tink abt...
              
              as christians, we r suppose to yield to wad the bible has tot us n not decide using our own pt of view whether we wanna follow or not...when jesus when up to the mountain juz b4 he was crucified to pray, wad did he pray? he told God tat his heart was heavy n tat if it was possible, let tis cup pass him by. he was toking abt his cricifixion. yet jesus continued n said, but its not my will but urs, my Father...
              
              i understand the emotional attachment tat comes wif a r/s n tat its emotionally painful to break up wif someone u love. but when christians preach against being unequally yoked, we r looking into the future...after u r married to her, how r u going to bring up ur children? will she allow u to bring them to church every wk? as a christian, ur duty is to bring up ur children in the ways of the Lord...
              
              tink abt wad i have said...i noe some ppl will flame me for tis but i see a need to let u noe tat as christians, we shld not practise selective obedience(obey onli wadever doesnt hurt us)...God bless...

              <p>hmm. good point. good point.</p>
              <p>of course it would be good.. if she believes along with him. but i think the church is too quick to do the wrong things at the wrong time.</p>
              <p>instead of building the new believer up, you're immediately running his life, tell him what's good and bad for him. pressuring him to make decision even if his heart isn't ready. good intentions (if any) but lousy execution.</p>
              <p>by right, he should be allowed to be convicted by God to do the right thing, and he should do it in obedience, tempered by his own love for God.</p>
              <p>otherwise, he grows frustrated, angry, feeling a great sense of loss, with no compensation etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but almost all the members of Hope of God were all forced to do the same thing, it's only naturally they pass the shit down to new members also. if all you have is a hammer, every problem will look like a nail. that's why the christians there, majority, quote things their leaders quote, but they aren't fully convinced, and those who can't take it, they leave.</p>

              <p>OL, this is going to be a really long post. but i most probably
              won't post here again until after my exams.</p>
              <p>Regarding MT 5:13-16 - A little article that you may find
              interesting:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em><em>Luke 14:34-35 AMP</em><span> </span> <em>Salt is good [an excellent thing], but if salt has lost its
              strength and has become saltless (insipid, flat), how shall its
              saltness be restored?</em><span> </span> <em>(35)</em><span> </span> <em>It is fit neither for the land
              nor for the manure heap; men throw it away. He who has ears to
              hear, let him listen and consider and comprehend by
              hearing!</em></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>The Living Bible gives a modern slant to
              Jesus’ <span>warning:</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>It may sound unusual to read of salt losing
              its saltiness, yet salt has different grades of quality and purity.
              Even today, only the highest grade of salt reaches the dining
              table. Most poorer grades of salt are used in industrial
              processes.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>In ancient times, salt was rarely pure.
              During Biblical times, most salt in Israel came from the Dead Sea
              and was often mixed with impurities, making the salt less salty.
              There were also conditions in which salt could be leached out or
              made less effective, through exposure to water, air, excessive
              sunlight or even other chemicals. The Victor Bible Background
              Commentary informs us:</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>In a similar vein, “<span>flakes of salt
              form on the rock shores of the</span> <span>Dead Sea</span> <span>at night.</span> In the morning the sun rises. Under its heat
              the salt loses is saltiness. It blends with the shore and loses its
              distinctiveness.”</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>To illustrate this leaching process, Marvin
              Vincent quotes the following story:</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>Salt can lose its saltiness if it is
              adulterated with inferior substances. In the same way, your
              distinctiveness as a follower of Jesus can be watered down if you
              mix a biblical lifestyle with the world’<span>s
              life</span>style.</em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are indeed called to be salt and light of this
              world, but this doesn't have anything to do with salvation. It is
              the result of salvation, it is the result of experiecing the love
              of God and thus we are able to do good works - driven by love and
              purpose. it doesn't say that if we're not the salt and light of
              this world, we lose our salvation. But it is right, that we become
              useless, if we lose that light or salitiness. Having seen people
              who got seduced by the material world, they forget that they're
              only in this world temperorily, and they got sucked into it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding Matthew 7:21-27</p>
              <p>Correct, not everyone who calls him Lord, will enter
              heaven. But do you know what the will of the Father is? the only
              time this phrase is explicitly explained is this:</p>
              <p><strong><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;amp;chapter=6&amp;amp;verse=40&amp;amp;version=31&amp;amp;context=verse">John 6:40</a></strong><br> For my</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Father's</strong></span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> is
              that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have
              eternal life, and I</strong> <strong>will raise him up at the last
              day."</strong></p>
              <p>Not everyone who calls Jesus, "Lord", or attends
              church, attends cell group or sing christian songs, attends
              planetshakers concerts and yes, <strong>even doing christian work
              like evangelism etc</strong>, will be allowed into heaven. The only
              way into heaven is through Jesus, through looking to the Son and
              believing in Him. That's the only condition, that's the only
              salvation plan. The only name given unto men which we must be
              saved.</p>
              <p>Regarding JAS 2:14-20:</p>
              <p>Like I said before, works are not part of salvation.
              But works reflect the faith in the believer. A Christian who loves
              god, will do good works, but a person who does good work, may not
              love God, or may not even be a christian.</p>
              <p>Once I attended FCBC, and I heard the speaker (it
              should be that pastor lawrance) gave a short testimony. once he
              joined this christian organization, and he fooled the people into
              thinking he's a christian (he got say why, but I forgot). He does
              evangelism, prays, attends bible studies etc. And he actually rose
              among their ranks, and became the head. What a surprise for
              everyone when one day, during an evangelism rally, he walked up to
              receive the Lord.</p>
              <p>And I have a personal friend, when I was in Hope of God
              (and that's why that church is horrendous, they are so desperate
              for leaders that they'll let anyone to be leader) with him, he
              actually became a cell leader without actually believing in Christ.
              I mean, he confessed to me later that, he believe the existance,
              but he don't.. <strong>believe</strong> believe, you know? Sure you
              can cast out demons in Jesus' name, but you may not be a believer.
              You may do good works, but what drives the good works? Unless it is
              the love for God, which is born by the faith in Christ's FINISHED
              work, that drives the good works, then it is right. You won't lose
              your salvation if you choose not to rise as a cell leader etc.
              That's christ's finished work. But when you have really received
              and gain confidence in that finished work, good works will
              automatically come out of you, <strong>which is the faith,
              accompanied by action.</strong> What are the signs? I think these
              could be part of it.</p>
              <p>When people are talking "christianese", you get
              excited, you have testimonies to share, you want to give glory to
              God. When people get on your nerves, and you lose your temper, you
              consciously remember that Christ asked us to love everyone, and you
              ask for forgiveness for it, and you try to remember not to do it
              again, but knowing that you will slowly change for the better in
              Christ. When there is an opportunity to preach Christ to a
              searching person, you take it, and when someone receives Christ,
              you feel so joyful inside.</p>
              <p>In the end. I still say this. <strong>A christian who
              loves God, will go to church, but a christian who goes to church,
              may not love God.</strong></p>

              <p>I don't see how you have defended what you say from a bible point of view. Your opinion and mine does not matter. God's Word do! and that is all that matter. It is clearly stated in the bible. Unless you can explain otherwise, salvation is by faith alone and faith is dead without deeds.</p>
              <p>JAS 2:14-20 (maybe you read read till verse 26) explained exactly
              above. It would be better if you can read the whole Letter by James and
              also find out possible reasons why he wrote what he did.</p>
              <p><strong>"A christian who
              loves God, will go to church, but a christian who goes to church,
              may not love God." </strong></p>
              <p>What exactly is a christian who does not love God? How do you define one? Why do they go to church if they have no faith? If they go, they must have faith. What kind of faith does such christians have when they do not love God? Will christian who do not love God be saved by God?</p>
              <p>How do you define one who love God and one who don't?</p>
              <p>As you have mentioned, some churches are dubious and their teachings is also dubious....That is why chibet is advised to "shop around" and understand what each church is teaching (and if that make common sense and logical to you) and the "agenda" (of any) of such churches and their leaders.</p>
              <p>While if one wants to live with false hope, it's one choice. I prefer to listen and follow Jesus and I am sure that will never go wrong.</p>

              <p>but just for the sake of argument - the reason why i don't bother explaining the concept of "a christian who loves God will goto church, but a christian who goes to church, may not love God", is because, you can't describe the taste of watermelon to someone who haven't tasted it before.</p>

              <p>what is faith? abraham is called the man of faith. but was he always full of faith? abraham lied, he doubted, he was wishy washy in his faith. if works are to be the basis for salvation, abraham definitely don't cut it.</p>
              <p>but he was called righteous, because he believed that God will provide a substitute, and he believed the lamb which God will provide will cover him and God honoured that one act of faith.</p>

              <p><strong>Question: "Is salvation by faith alone, or by faith plus works?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>This is perhaps the most important question in all of Christian theology. This question is the cause of the Reformation - the split between the Protestant church and Catholic church. This question is a key difference between Biblical Christianity and most of the "Christian" cults. Is salvation by faith alone, or by faith plus works? Am I saved just by believing in Jesus, or do I have to believe in Jesus and do certain things?<br><br>The question of faith alone or faith plus works is made difficult by some hard-to-reconcile Bible passages. Compare Romans 3:28, 5:1 and Galatians 3:24 with James 2:24. Some see a difference between Paul (salvation is by faith alone) and James (salvation is by faith plus works). In reality, Paul and James did not disagree at all. The only point of disagreement some people claim is over the relationship between faith and works. Paul dogmatically says that justification is by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9) while James appears to be saying that justification is by faith plus works. This apparent problem is answered by examining what exactly James is talking about. James is refuting the belief that a person can have faith without producing any good works (James 2:17-18). James is emphasizing the point that genuine faith in Christ will produce a changed life and good works (James 2:20-26). James is not saying that justification is by faith plus works, but rather that a person who is truly justified by faith will have good works in his life. If a person claims to be a believer, but has no good works in his life – then he likely does not have genuine faith in Christ (James 2:14, 17, 20, 26).<br><br>Paul says the same thing in his writings. The good fruit believers should have in their lives is listed in Galatians 5:22-23. Immediately after telling us that we are saved by faith, not works (Ephesians 2:8-9), Paul informs us that we were created to do good works (Ephesians 2:10). Paul expects just as much of a changed life as James does, “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17)! James and Paul do not disagree on their teaching on salvation. They approach the same subject from different perspectives. Paul simply emphasized that justification is by faith alone while James put emphasis on the fact that faith in Christ produces good works.</p>

              <p>hmm. i can't say that salvation is a lifelong process. but i say that, being made holy is a life long process.</p>
              <p>we are saved, definitely, but the process of refining our characters to be more like Jesus, is a life long process. we are always going to stumble at one point or another, and each experience makes us stronger, each time we are delivered from our troubles, from our fears, from our struggles, we grow a little bigger, our faith grow a little stronger, our willingness to obey without resisting grows softer.</p>
              <p>our good works are like filthy rags, before and after believing in the finished work of the cross. God's love and willingness to die for our sins isn't dependant on our good works, that's the big point about christianity. It never was once about us. It was, and NEVER WILL BE about what we have done. since our salvation was never based on our good works to begin with, it will never be the part of the marking scheme of our salvation.</p>
              <p>If I do good works, it will be because I love God, and not because I am afraid I will lose my salvation.</p>

              <p>....now before anyone, unashamely (like me) lift passages from the internet or start to insist that it is clearly stated in the Bible that <em>blah blah blah</em>..</p>
              <p>....let's look at something totally unrelated:</p>
              <p><span id="en-NIV-25159" class="sup">Matt 5:20</span>Looking at his disciples, he said: <br>   "Blessed are you who are <span style="color: #ff0000;">poor</span>, <br>      for yours is the kingdom of God. <br> <span id="en-NIV-25160" class="sup">21</span>Blessed are you who <span style="color: #ff0000;">hunger</span> now, <br>      for you will be satisfied. <br>   Blessed are you who <span style="color: #ff0000;">weep now</span>, <br>      for you will laugh. <br> <span id="en-NIV-25161" class="sup">22</span>Blessed are you when <span style="color: #ff0000;">men hate you</span>, <br>      when they exclude you and insult you <br>      and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does it mean that the reverse is also true:</p>
              <p>Those who are RICH will not inherit the kingdom of God<br>Those are FULL will not be satisfied<br>Those are HAPPY now will be sad<br>and those who are POPULAR and LOVED by many will be rejected by the Son of Man?</p>
              <p>....so that we go all out to be poor, impoverished, sad and a total pain in the butt to others, just so that we are in sync with the Matthew passage???</p>
              <p>...not necessarily so.</p>
              <p>....reading scripture, we need to know the climate, tone, and audience to which the passages are addressed. Knowing some historical background of the audience also helps tremendously.</p>

              <p>Let me a moron in theology try to put some senses of work and faith, And because I'm a moron I hope this gets to the senses of you intelligent people LOL. And no it's not sarcasm.</p>
              <p>As far as I understand no one could work his way up to heaven no matter what he did. Yes no matter what he has done. In short nothing nothing of the man itself renders him worthy to be given eternal life. Nothing. Even if you save the whole world population and do that thrice, spending every minutes for the benefit of other people. For nothing absolutely <strong>nothing compares to everlasting life</strong>. A thousand year life as the supreme ruler or King of the entire earth realm doesn't even compare to everlasting life which is the very best of life, the very crown of life.</p>
              <p>On the contrary people who have faith or proclaim that they have faith could not also be given eternal life if their deeds do not proclaim their faith. If one proclaims that he is a believer in Christ yet he still commits grave sins continually he is teasing/mocking God. You think anyone could fool or tease God? His acts proclaim that he is not a believer and what is words when confronted with deeds? So your faith should transcend/be reflected into/upon your actions. For faith is a lie without deeds.</p>

              <p>You do good works 'cos you love God and you love your neighbors.</p>
              <p>This principle is enshrined in the 10 commandments. Even Jews who don't have concept of salvation also know that.</p>
              <p>That's why Jesus said everything summarised into love God and love neighbors. This is a Torah principle.</p>
