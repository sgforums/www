              <p>You are certainly entitled to your views about the Catholic church and its teachings and I respect that. My readings and learning have so far led me to conclude that the teachings of the Catholic church are scripturally sound in every way. Of course there would be doctrinal development in the teachings (as I would expect there to be over 2000 years) which might make them appear 'different' but they neither contradict the bible nor what the early church taught.</p>
              <p>But the point remains that God would not just give us the bible without establishing a consistent Authority on earth to interpret and teach it. Having each Christian read and interpret the bible for himself just would not work. One can dispute of course whether the Catholic Church is that Authority; but if I look at history and the teachings of each denomination that has broken away, my bets would be on the Catholic Church being that Authority.   </p>

              <p>very sound view indeed..if we were to really discuss this in greater detail.im afraid we can only do so privately as i do not wanna be arrested by isd or get flamed as blasphemous..i jus posted some scriptures in the thread title morality,maybe u would wanna take a look on what jesus said pertaining to God n their positions and then enlighten me if biblical truth clash with churches teachings,no matter which church we are talking about. =)</p>
