              <p>If by 'versions' you mean  'Douay-Rheims version', 'King James Version' etc, these are bible <em><span style="color: #000000;">translations</span></em>. We have to remember that the bible authors wrote in Hebrew and Greek, not English. We need English translations if we are to be able to read and comprehend the bible. The internet has lots of extra info on the origins of these translations if you're interested.</p>
              <p>Some translations try to be more precise by being literal and preserving subtle cues in the text but these often end up being harder to read because of differences in grammar etc between Hebrew/Greek and English. But less literal translations that make it easier for the English reader risk losing precision and the introduction of the doctrinal views of the translator. Bottomline is that there is no perfect translation. Different translations exist for both Catholic as well as Protestant bibles.</p>
              <p>So what's the difference between a Catholic bible and a Protestant one ? The Protestant bible has seven fewer books (and missing portions from two other books) than the Catholic bible. So what happened ?</p>
              <p>The bible is actually a collection of books which includes biographies, poems, letters etc. Around the 4th century AD, the Church formalised the collection of writings that were to be included in the bible (and therefore declared to be the inspired word of God) and those that were not. This gave birth to the Catholic bible that we know of today which consists of 73 books. Christendom considered this to be <em>the</em> bible for over a thousand years. It was only in the 16th century that a monk - Martin Luther, came along and threw out 7 books (and parts of two other books) from the bible when he broke away from the Catholic Church during the so called Reformation. This 'reduced' bible is now what Protestants use. Why did Martin Luther throw out those books ? The answer would differ depending on whom you ask but I can't help but think that a strong motivation was for doctrinal reasons - he did not agree with some of the stuff in those books.</p>

              threw out 7 books (and parts of two other books) from the bible
              when he broke away from the Catholic Church during the so called
              Reformation. This 'reduced' bible is now what Protestants
              use."</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"the Church formalised the
              collection of writings that were to be included in the bible (and
              therefore declared to be the inspired word of God) and those that
              were not. This gave birth to the Catholic bible that we know of
              today which consists of 73 books."</span></p>

              <p>You are right to be concerned about receiving the word of God from flawed human beings. God knows this as well and he is no fool. That is why he sent the Holy Spirit to the apostles and their successors in the Church, to ensure that what they teach is the infallible truth, however sinful they might be as human beings. How do we know this ? The bible tells us the following:</p>
              <p>Jesus told the apostles that "<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whoever listens to you listens to me. Whoever rejects you rejects me</span></em>" (Luke 10:16). He told Peter that "I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven</span></em>." (Mathew 16:19). Jesus also exhorted the apostles to "make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am with you always, until the end of the age</span></em>." (Mathew 28:19).</p>
              <p>These are all very strong statements made by Jesus which would make God a fool if he allows the apostles and the Church to teach error.</p>

              <p>the ceasation of God talking to ppl directly was also explained in the bible.a book of over 40 writers spanning so many centuries yet does not contradict does has points that ppl can believe in..also the counsel given in there beats self help books in the market that expires every few years..</p>

              <p>You are right to be concerned about receiving the word of
              God from flawed human beings. God knows this as well and he is
              no fool. That is why he sent the Holy Spirit to the apostles and
              their successors in the Church, to ensure that what they teach is
              the infallible truth, however sinful they might be as human beings.
              How do we know this ? The bible tells us the following:</p>
              <p>Jesus told the apostles that "<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whoever listens to you listens to me.
              Whoever rejects you rejects me</span></em>" (Luke 10:16). He told
              Peter that "I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.
              <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whatever you bind on
              earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth
              shall be loosed in heaven</span></em>." (Mathew 16:19). Jesus also
              exhorted the apostles to "make disciples of all nations, baptizing
              them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
              Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And
              behold, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am with you
              always, until the end of the age</span></em>." (Mathew 28:19).</p>
              <p>These are all very strong statements made by Jesus which would
              make God a fool if he allows the apostles and the Church to teach
              error.</p>

              <p>That's because God's assurances of infallible teaching of faith and morals was only given to the one church that he established (not church<em>es</em>), the one church that would today be about 2,000 years old. The assurances would not apply to all the other 'churches' that have broken away from this one church over doctrinal issues because God does not contradict himself on doctrinal truths. </p>
              <p>I believe the bible to be true but God would be most unwise to give mankind the bible without an authority to interpret and teach it. Otherwise, confusion and anarchy over true teachings would result and we already see this in the contradictory teachings of the many protestant denominations out there which have mushroomed over the last 500 years. You need an authority, which is found in the one church that he established, the church that is the "pillar and foundation of truth" as described by St Paul (1 Tim 3:15).</p>

              <p>You've already started out with the presupposition that the Bible is nothing but a human text and that there has been little to no divine inspiration. Nothing we say will be able to make much of an impression.</p>
