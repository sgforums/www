But really did see Him very clearly.<br><br>If you read the scriptures Moses said something about God's face being radiant when blessing the Israelis after freeing them from captivity.<br><br>Yes I definitely saw a Jew, that is Jesus. I asked specifically for Jesus because I wanted to know how Jesus really looks like. I could give you the detail before I asked to see Jesus' face. I still remember it quite a bit.<br><br>I'm testifying that my story is true but whether you would believe it as true is up to individual's choice. Like I said some if not many people are cynical about God. God is not  for everyone I guess. You have to be called and chosen in order to have some faith.<br><br>Edit<br>I have a neighbor which on occasions are allowed to see the glory of Jesus Christ the Lord in the eucharist host the moment the host is being blessed by the pastor. The host would radiate intense white light. The host would shine like a little sun. She would not see this every time she attended the mass but she did see the radiant host a couple of times. Sometimes it's not just her but confirmed with other people who saw exactly the same.</div>

In both cases however the original limb was still there but weak looking and awfully small in proportion compared to a normal person.<br><br>One a lady from Middle east("The torn veil" the story of sister Gulshan Esther) was healed from a bedridden condition. One of her disable arm grew. The legs were able to carry the weight of her own body. That happened after a full 3 years of praying. She was a Moslem. She took a great deal of risk and endured a great deal of hardship and persecution even from her own family when she converted to Christian.  The second book I forgot what was the title...<br><br>Yes there are a full range of spectrum of what can be considered a miracle. From the petty ones which could easily be mistaken with a paranormal phenomenons though it occurs to ordinary people and could not be summoned at will to the most hard to believe 'are you insane' miracles like dividing the red sea which is chronicled in the scriptures.<br><br>Then again miracles should not be talked about. It should be experienced. Whether one would see a miracle in his life would depend on the attitude he chose to take towards God and his fellow humans and on the circumstances that would require God's intervention. Mind you that a lot of times God performs miracles for you through other people.<br><br>It could be in a form of help which seemed just like a lucky coincidence or it could be more mystical in the form of prophecy(it's not your ordinary seer prediction<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) or something else. So the miracles may not come through you but may come from other people surrounding you but those are intended for you. Edit: It may even not come from people surrounding you but from people you knew nothing about from places far away.<br><br>I too have some doubts(still do, a little, because I never saw something like that) on my neighbor who testified that she sometimes see the host radiating intensely when the pastor held the host high and blessed it. But I know her well enough to be sure that she's not the kind of person that would make lies. I haven't seen any radiating host myself but I believe her story because I personally know what kind of person she is.<br><br>Merry Christmas everyone.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Miracles&amp;Prophecies:</div><div class="quote_body">I've read two testament book on which a limb is healed. In both cases however the original limb was still there but weak looking and awfully small in proportion compared to a normal person.<br><br>One a lady from Middle east("The torn veil" the story of sister Gulshan Esther) was healed from a bedridden condition. One of her disable arm grew. The legs were able to carry the weight of her own body. That happened after a full 3 years of praying. She was a Moslem. She took a great deal of risk and endured a great deal of hardship and persecution even from her own family when she converted to Christian.  The second book I forgot what was the title...<br><br>Yes there are a full range of spectrum of what can be considered a miracle. From the petty ones which could easily be mistaken with a paranormal phenomenons though it occurs to ordinary people and could not be summoned at will to the most hard to believe 'are you insane' miracles like dividing the red sea which is chronicled in the scriptures.<br><br>Then again miracles should not be talked about. It should be experienced. Whether one would see a miracle in his life would depend on the attitude he chose to take towards God and his fellow humans and on the circumstances that would require God's intervention. Mind you that a lot of times God performs miracles for you through other people.<br><br>It could be in a form of help which seemed just like a lucky coincidence or it could be more mystical in the form of prophecy(it's not your ordinary seer prediction<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) or something else. So the miracles may not come through you but may come from other people surrounding you but those are intended for you. Edit: It may even not come from people surrounding you but from people you knew nothing about from places far away.<br><br>I too have some doubts(still do, a little, because I never saw something like that) on my neighbor who testified that she sometimes see the host radiating intensely when the pastor held the host high and blessed it. But I know her well enough to be sure that she's not the kind of person that would make lies. I haven't seen any radiating host myself but I believe her story because I personally know what kind of person she is.<br><br>Merry Christmas everyone.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>When I talk about miracles, I mean "a striking interposition of divine intervention by a god in the universe by which the ordinary course and operation of Nature is overruled, suspended, or modified."<br><br>So I do not consider anything that could be a lucky coincidence, or something that is unlikely to occur to be a miracle.<br><br>I don't consider an unexpected promotion a miracle. Nor winning the lottery. Nor having someone coming up to me to tell me about Christ just when I happen to be contemplating suicide.<br><br>To me a miracle is something extraordinary with no natural explanation. And not something that we don't understand how it could have happened. Something that we understand could not have happened which serves as evidence that some supernatural being intervened.<br><br>The flesh on a shriveled leg can grow. Cancer can go into spontaneous remission. Some people with HIV never develop full blown AIDS.<br><br>If a leg is amputated at a joint, it's impossible for the leg to regrow. There's nothing there. The leg is gone. There are no cells. Nothing. If a leg were to be restored, that would be a true miracle.<br><br>Another example of a true miracles would probably have been the three hours of global darkness upon the death of Christ.<br><br>"It was about the sixth hour,<br>and there was darkness over all the earth<br>until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened."<br>(Luke 24:44,45)<br><br>For darkness to cover all the earth, that would probably have been a miracle. As far as we know, there's no event that could have caused that. Having said that though, even if we found evidence for a global period of darkness, we would need to look for some natural explanations first. In any case, there's no evidence that this occurred.<br><br>Finally, personal testimony is extremely unreliable as evidence. I fully agree and accept that what you experienced was very real to you. I also agree and accept that you and the other person you spoke of have no reason to lie. But people in every religion have their religious experiences that validate their beliefs.<br><br>You asked for a sign and you received it. And you received a sign that was exactly what you expected. That in itself should make you wonder.</div>
