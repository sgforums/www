However I have further subsequent miracles which confirmed what I saw was Jesus.....even my Mom saw a divine apparition but these apparitions were about 12 years ago. Mine was even further back in time.<br><br>Satan may pose as the angel of light but I saw God not an angel of light....but anyway I also have other petty miracles ones that could easily be thought of as paranormal phenomenon. I approach these with caution. As long as it doesn't contradicts my faith in God.<br><br>One that really irks me is that today's movies depicts Satan as the ultimate being while God being a very very passive entity. SATAN DOESN'T EVEN RULE IN HELL. HELL DOESN'T BELONG TO SATAN NOR IT IS THE PLACE WHERE SATAN REIGNS. HELL IS ABOVE ALL THE PLACE GOD CREATED TO TORTURE SATAN AND HIS ANGELS IN THE END OF TIME. SATAN NEVER HAVE AUTHORITY HE ONLY HAS INFLUENCE EVEN ON EARTH. That's why nobody calls SATAN as king or Lord. The beast has no authority only influence.<br><br>Having authority means having the power to make things the way you want it to be no matter what. That's why God is called the Lord the King of kings. POWER=AUTHORITY<br><br>Satan may be strong but he has no power nor authority only influence to those willing to be fooled.<br><br>Edit: Of course men could always try to resist God God has given us free will but just to give you an idea: If you were resisting God by trying to move forward, your own body and legs would turn right and started walking to the right if God were to intervene. I know it's just an idea I use to give you a view of what authority means. In short your mind may resist God but even your own body cannot. That's why there is no parallel dimensions. Everything is the way God let it be. I know I can't prove my blabbering on the nonexistent of parallel dimensions but I've experienced that God has more control over my own physical body than I do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  and that the future is as sure as the past.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I believe there is no definite explaination of the term miracle in the christian life. The kind of miracle that happen to everyone is different. For example, a person is facing the death punishment tomorrow and his punishment were overturn at the point of the gallows. A last stage cancer patient was heal of the cancer when someone lay his/her hands on the person. We will never know when a miracle can happen and the interpretation of a miracle varies from person. I love the description that by waking up every morning is a miracle by itself. Miracle happens to the believers and non-believer</p></div>

              <p>I believe there is no definite explaination of the term miracle
                  in the christian life. The kind of miracle that happen to everyone
                  is different. For example, a person is facing the death punishment
                  tomorrow and his punishment were overturn at the point of the
                  gallows. A last stage cancer patient was heal of the cancer when
                  someone lay his/her hands on the person. We will never know when a
                  miracle can happen and the interpretation of a miracle varies from
                  person. I love the description that by waking up every morning is a
                  miracle by itself. Miracle happens to the believers and
                  non-believer</p>

              <p>yep. but it's only a miracle to those who recognise it and accept it as what it is.</p>
              <p>the rest call it "a lucky break", "coincidence", "sheer luck", "miscalculation of probability" (which reminds me.. i've got an assignment due tomorrow).</p>
              <p>i definitely believe in God and miracles. because my family witnessed 2. my dad and my aunt.</p>

              To just repeat something I've previously mentioned in this thread.
              
              What is a miracle to you?
              
              To some, a person turning over a new leaf is a miracle. A student may consider passing his exams a miracle.
              
              Basically, there are those who do not require something like water being turned into wine or resurrection of the dead for an incident to be called a miracle.

              <p>Many things today still cannot be explained....scientists have no answer yet to many things.... There is no one proven and accepted explanation to the begining of earth....or you and me (for example).</p>
              <p>It is easy to say that everything we cannot explained is the work of God but that is not convincing at all. But what if human cannot find the answers after thousand of years ? Yes, continue to serach for the answer!</p>
              <p>But what if the answer could have already been found? Such as in the Bible? Such as there is a real existance of God?</p>
              <p>My friend, if you beleived in God and follow his teaching, you will know that Jesus says that there is no bigger commandment than to love your neighbour - he says go and love each other like how I loved you.</p>
              <p>The Christian faith is about faith, hope and love not about miracle and seeing any visison etc.... though I do not dispute that such things can and do happen.</p>
              <p>If are interested to find out possible reasons of some unexplained happenings around you, why not look at possibility of God's existance with an open mind?</p>
              <p>You might just find the answer there.....if not, it's ok. You don't have to believe in God just because another person do.</p>
              <p>If you explore and seek God with an open mind, He will touch you in some ways and you will find some answers to the unexplained.</p>
              <p>If He does, it's a miracle isn't it?</p>
              <p>It is not possible to force someone to believe in God. If you do, pray for those who don't. Do not impose on them your belief.</p>
              <p>If you don't, try to have an open mind (that it might exist) and don't just shut the door. Certainly, respect those who do and not ridcule...</p>
              <p>Yes, miracle do and will happen. Yes, I do believe in God and I can proved his existance as much as you can prove that he does not exist.</p>

              <p><br>claims of such miracles are aplenty.... documenting them and having them independently assessed is another matter.</p>
              <p>if there are indeed so many of such miracles around, it would have done the church good if such testimonies are made very very public.</p>
              <p>a man born blind suddenly receiving sight, a crippled man suddenly stands up to walk... isn't it wonderful if the world can see it.... yet such claims are usually inside the enclosed walls of the church with little or no authentication.</p>
              <p>..... so how many blind men have you know receiving sight???</p>
