            <div class='col-md body'>I'd like to share this beautiful story with everyone... hope it's encouraging to some!<br><br>=======================================================<br><br>THE BLESSING OF THORNS<br><br>Sandra felt as low as the heels of her shoes as she pushed against a<br>November gust and the florist shop door. Her life had been easy, like a<br>spring breeze. Then in the fourth month of her second pregnancy, a<br>minor<br>automobile accident stole her ease.<br><br>During this Thanksgiving week she would have delivered a son. She<br>grieved<br>over her loss. As if that weren't enough, her husband's company<br>threatened a<br>transfer. Then her sister, whose annual holiday visit she coveted,<br>called<br>saying she could not come.<br><br>What's worse, Sandra's friend infuriated her by suggesting her grief<br>was<br>a<br>God-given path to maturity that would allow her to empathize with<br>others<br>who<br>suffer. "She has no idea what I'm feeling," thought Sandra with a<br>shudder.<br><br>"Thanksgiving? Thankful for what?" she wondered aloud. For a careless<br>driver<br>whose truck was hardly scratched when he rear-ended her? For an airbag<br>that<br>saved her life but took that of her child?<br><br>"Good afternoon, can I help you?" The shop clerk's approach startled<br>her.<br><br>"I...I need an arrangement," stammered Sandra, "for Thanksgiving?"<br><br>"Do you want beautiful but ordinary, or would you like to challenge the<br>day<br>with a customer favorite I call the Thanksgiving Special?" asked the<br>shop<br>clerk. "I'm convinced that flowers tell stories," she continued. "Are<br>you<br>looking for something that conveys gratitude this Thanksgiving?<br><br>"Not exactly!" Sandra blurted out. "In the last five months, everything<br>that<br>could go wrong has gone wrong. " Sandra regretted her outburst, and was<br>surprised when the shop clerk said, "I have the perfect arrangement for<br>you."<br><br>Then the door's small bell rang, and the shop clerk said, "Hi<br>Barbara...let<br>me get your order." She politely excused herself and walked toward a<br>small<br>workroom, then quickly reappeared, carrying an arrangement of greenery,<br>bows, and long-stemmed thorny roses.<br><br>Except the ends of the rose stems were neatly snipped...there were no<br>flowers.<br><br>"Want this in a box?" asked the clerk.<br><br>Sandra watched for the customer's response. Was this a joke? Who would<br>want<br>rose stems with no flowers!?! She waited for laughter, but neither<br>woman<br>laughed.<br><br>"Yes, please." Barbara replied with an appreciative smile.<br><br>"You'd think after three years of getting the special, I wouldn't be so<br>moved by its significance, but I can feel it right here, all over<br>again,"<br>she said as she gently tapped her chest.<br><br>"Uh," stammered Sandra, "that lady just left with, uh... she just left<br>with<br>no flowers!"<br><br>"Right...I cut off the flowers. That's the Special... I call it the<br>Thanksgiving Thorns Bouquet.<br><br>"Oh, come on, you can't tell me someone is willing to pay for that?"<br>exclaimed Sandra.<br><br>"Barbara came into the shop three years ago feeling very much like you<br>feel<br>today," explained the clerk. "She thought she had very little to be<br>thankful<br>for. She had lost her father to cancer, the family business was<br>failing,<br>her<br>son was into drugs, and she was facing major surgery."<br><br>"That same year I had lost my husband, "continued the clerk," and for<br>the<br>first time in my life, I had to spend the holidays alone. I had no<br>children,<br>no husband, no family nearby, and too great a debt to allow any travel.<br><br>"So what did you do?" asked Sandra. "I learned to be thankful for<br>thorns,"<br>answered the clerk quietly. "I've always thanked God for good things in<br>life<br>and never thought to ask Him why those good things happened to me, but<br>when<br>bad stuff hit, did I ever ask! It took time for me to learn that dark<br>times<br>are important. I always enjoyed the 'flowers' of life, but it took<br>thorns to<br>show me the beauty of God's comfort. You know, the Bible says that God<br>comforts us when we're afflicted, and from His consolation we learn to<br>comfort others."<br><br>Sandra sucked in her breath as she thought about the very thing her<br>friend<br>had tried to tell her. "I guess the truth is I don't want comfort. I've<br>lost<br>a baby and I'm angry with God."<br><br>Just then someone else walked in the shop.<br><br>"Hey, Phil!" shouted the clerk to the balding, rotund man.<br><br>"My wife sent me in to get our usual Thanksgiving arrangement... twelve<br>thorny, long-stemmed stems!" laughed Phil as the clerk handed him a<br>tissue-wrapped arrangement from the refrigerator.<br><br>"Those are for your wife?" asked Sandra incredulously. "Do you mind me<br>asking why she wants something that looks like that?<br><br>"No...I'm glad you asked," Phil replied. "Four years ago my wife and I<br>nearly divorced. After forty years, we were in a real mess, but with<br>the<br>Lord's grace and guidance, we slogged through problem after problem. He<br>rescued our marriage. Jenny here (the clerk) told me she kept a vase of<br>rose<br>stems to remind her of what she learned from "thorny" times, and that<br>was<br>good enough for me. I took home some of those stems. My wife and I<br>decided<br>to label each one for a specific "problem" and give thanks to Him for<br>what<br>that problem taught us."<br><br>As Phil paid the clerk, he said to Sandra, "I highly recommend the<br>Special!"<br><br>"I don't know if I can be thankful for the thorns in my life." Sandra<br>said<br>to the clerk. "It's all too... fresh."<br><br>"Well," the clerk replied carefully, "my experience has shown me that<br>thorns<br>make roses more precious. We treasure God's providential care more<br>during<br>trouble than at any other time. Remember, it was a crown of thorns that<br>Jesus wore so we might know His love. Don't resent the thorns."<br><br>Tears rolled down Sandra's cheeks. For the first time since the<br>accident,<br>she loosened her grip on resentment. "I'll take those twelve<br>long-stemmed<br>thorns, please," she managed to choke out.<br><br>"I hoped you would," said the clerk gently. "I'll have them ready in a<br>minute."<br><br>"Thank you. What do I owe you?" asked Sandra.<br><br>"Nothing." said the clerk. "Nothing but a promise to allow God to heal<br>your<br>heart. The first year's arrangement is always on me." The clerk smiled<br>and<br>handed a card to Sandra. "I'll attach this card to your arrangement,<br>but<br>maybe you'd like to read it first."<br><br>It read: "Dear God, I have never thanked you for my thorns. I have<br>thanked<br>you a thousand times for my roses, but never once for my thorns. Teach<br>me<br>the glory of the cross I bear; teach me the value of my thorns. Show me<br>that<br>I have climbed closer to you along the path of pain. Show me that,<br>through<br>my tears, the colors of your rainbow look much more brilliant."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when we go through thorns, we thank god. when we go through a bed of roses, we continue with thanksgiving. where's the logic behind it?<br>why not God thanking us for enduring through rough patches. it shld not be the other way round rite?<br><br>is god true? how do you know he's true? i mean, you haven't gone up to heaven. izzt a false sense of security you christians have? cos it's been so ingrained in your mind that god is true, he is true? for all you know, faith may be psychological.<br><br>i have seen so many christians, they go through worse times than non-christians, and many of these troubles are not self-inflicted. they are just there bound to fall on any on us, and it happened to fall on them. doesn't god love them? why does he allow them to go through such trials? i mean, whats the point of becoming a christian in this case. it would seem like we have all become christians just to suffer. yes, sometimes we emerge as better men. however, wounds heal but scars remain. for many of the jews, the scars of the holocaust are still etched in many of their minds, its impossible for them to forget the horrors of genocide. how do you reconcile that with a loving god? aren't jews supposed to be god's select few, beloved and chosen? yet, half of these jewish children go to bed without supper once a week, as proven by studies?<br><br>can any one answer without any eschewing of any theological principles? these have got be so confused.</div>
