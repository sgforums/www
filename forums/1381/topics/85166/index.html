            <div class='col-md body'>Cell group is a gathering for a small group of christians to meet and have a small worshipping session and to talk about any problems u may encounter. It's much easier to know each other more in a smaller group then in the church. Church worshipping is when all get together and sing praise to the Lord.It'll be hard to interact with everyone there. I'm in a cell group too..and indeed,joined as a stranger to knowing a group of frens..feel the warmness of it.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> <span style="color: blue;"></span></div>

No doubt, prayers help but a lot also depend on the persons involved to solve the problems. You do not have a lack of faith, I think u just want to solve your problems badly. Even if the problems cannot be solved immediately, I think a listening ear will make u feel much better. In this case, why dun u seek advice from your best friend? It would be best if he is a fellow christian, but even if he is not, I am sure he would be able to give u some good advice.  Everybody needs a listening ear sometimes. My best friend, not a christian though, always give me the best advice to my problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cell groups are basically following the example of church in the Book of Acts. The early christians gather not in mega buildings to worship God but in homes.<br>They sing, they pray, they broke bread and fellowship with one another in the Lord. It serves to build closer and stronger relationship between believers because it is impossible to know everyone at a deeper level on sunday services.<br><br>It is in such small groups where ppl will be willing to share their personal struggles and problems, thanksgiving and prayer requests. To love one another and serve one another.<br><br>I understand ur problem...but do try to bring up to ur members and perhaps make this time of cell a time of fellowship and not another debate sessions...however, discussions and debate abt things u dun understand will help u learn more...just dun take it too seriously when someone say ur idea is not totally right. yeah......like in all relationships...Christianity is a RELATIONSHIP and in all we do...we promote this kinship among us in the common identity as God's children. There are times when we feel that this irelationship is gettin strained and so on....do bring it up in a gentle manner and work to solve it. do not keep to urself and make a mess out of it. ppl do not know wat pleases u and wat dont. ya....be urself..relax and enjoy the fellowship with God and His chosen people.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi GreenGoblin,<br><br>I am 27 this year, been a christian for 10 years, been a student leader in a school christian community, a worship leader in church and the youth ministry. And guess what? I am NOT in a cell group.  All my youths and the youth pastor are in a cell group but I am not and sometimes people wonder.<br><br>You are right to wonder about all these things but before anything, I would like to urge you not to become disillusioned or angry or disappointed by such feelings.<br><br>Firstly, CELL GROUPS are pretty much a CHOICE thingy.  NO ONE can say that if you do not go to a CELL GROUP, you are a bad christian.  Neither can anyone tell you that CELL GROUP is the BEST WAY for a christian to grow closer to GOD and to your fellow christian brothers and sisters.<br><br>Secondly, you are right when you say that CELL GROUPS are not necessary to talk abt God's words or knowing each other but CELL GROUP is just a name, but you can call it any other name but it actually just a structured format of fulfilling the purpose of 'gathering together and encouraging one another'. Therefore, CELL GROUPS are not necessary BUT the gathering and encouraging of each other is IMPORTANT.<br><br>Therefore, WHY DID I NOT JOIN A CELL GROUP?<br><br>I would like to say beforehand that CELL GROUPS are good but not NECESSARY.  And I would say it is pretty a personal choice thingy.<br><br>For me, the decision to not join a CELL GROUP is this: friends and priority.<br><br>I was in a cell group and going to church every saturday and then to church service every sunday.  I remember maling a list of priorities in my life and it goes in the order of importance : GOD, FAMILY, CHURCH/MINISTRY, FRIENDS.<br><br>THe GOD AND FAMILY was OKAY but UNFORTUNATELY, my committment to the church and ministries are so much that it come to a point of time whereI did not even see my friends, non christian ones, for months.  I begin to wonder that if I put friends as a priority, I have to spend time with them, even if they are not the top priority!  Thus I eventually decided that i would join in youth activities on certain saturdays (to still join the fellowship) and give some saturdays to join my outside friends (to still be there for them).  And the only way for me to be on such flexibility is to NOT join a cell group.  i am a firm believer that if I say I wanna be a light and the salt to your frens, you have to be there for them not just talk only.<br><br>Why I am sharing with you is because I do not want you to become frustrated over this issue.  There is no compulsion in God's kingdom. We are a body but yet we are pretty individual.<br><br>Pray to God.  You must remember the importance of gathering togather and encouraging one another and I dun mean by just go to church to say hello how are you, that kinda of thing but i mean quality time together.  So I can be frank with you, if you are able to see yourself spending quality time with your fellow brothers and sisters WIHTOUT being in a CELL GROUP, like I did, then I would say that if its your choice not to be in a cell group, by all means do so but explain to your leaders your reasons.<br></div>

If we only hang our with non christians frens, there would problems too.   Living a christian is not hard, it is impossible.  It is only with the HOLY SPIRT can we live a life thats pleasing to God.  of cos, we fall. But as in any races, the issue is not in falling but in getting up again. God is not concern how fast we finish the race but whether we finish the race at all.<br><br>Coming to the love issue, the question to you is that, do you think others know how to love? I know whats love is becos I experience God's love and I allow myself to become a channel of God's love.  i love becos i remind myself of God's sacrifice for me. I love becos I remembered that i am loved by many despite my flaws.  I love becos He first love me.<br><br>My brother, get back to the root of it all. Jesus is calling us, to the love of the Father.  Jesus is calling us, to love one another. Remember the first day when you commit your life to God and your love for Him. Remember you first love for Him. And you will learn to love again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everything in Christianity is not compulsory...if someone tells u its compulsory to attend some service or give money. MY ADVICE IS TO LEAVE THE CHURCH.<br><br>i am very frank and firm on this stand not because i'm a heretic in the making.<br><br>Christianity is a RELATIONSHIP...with your God. This relationship is reconciled by our Lord Jesus Christ. And every detail of things we do is to enhance, nurture and stregthens this relationship. To know God more deeply day by day, and live a life that is suitable as a child of God.<br><br>Sunday worship services, prayer, reading of the Bible, Baptism, Holy Communion,cell groups, seminars and etc......<br><br>ALL of them are optional. Because the Bible never says when u fail to do these..to hell you go.<br><br>But when a Christian does these things, he or she desire to get closer to God through these areas. Not that attendance of one service will gain you some merits...sorry...wrong church. But in all of these, people want to know more about God and be equipped to serve Him better.<br><br>If you feel that you are capable and not need these helps, Praise God that He has blessed you with such gifts. If not, why not be part of these and make the best out of each time? there is no compulsion, you dun have to pack your 7 day week with church stuffs...i personally do not encourage such a lifestyle. allocate time for family, friends or simply rest and slack for one day....yeah...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gasband:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi GreenGoblin,<br><br>I am 27 this year, been a christian for 10 years, been a student leader in a school christian community, a worship leader in church and the youth ministry. And guess what? I am NOT in a cell group.  All my youths and the youth pastor are in a cell group but I am not and sometimes people wonder.<br>.... blah blah blah....<br></div></blockquote>I echo this sentiment as well as most others after this. Cell groups serve the purpose of attempting to gel people together in a theoritical homogeneous environment to encourage better worship and fellowship. It does not always happen this way. One must not be pressured to join a CG in an attempt to fit in.<br>Also note that if any church leader or pastor insist that CGs are Biblical is probably being too liberal in their interpretation of Acts.<br>My church had attempted to instill a CG church but ended up with the term "a church with Cell Groups". The reason is plan and simple a CG church does not always work and any church should not just emulate another church just because it seemed successful in the other church. There are various underlying problems that the leaders in these CG churches that they do not wish to recognise or address. I have many friends who shared about the pressure of CGs and how futile attempting such meetings can get.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me,<br><br>a cell group should consist of Christians with a common goal and purpose. They meet regularly to fellowship, enourage one another in life, to challenge one another to love God more and to study the Bible (learn how to apply in daily life).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, CELL GROUPS are pretty much a CHOICE thingy. NO ONE can say that if you do not go to a CELL GROUP, you are a bad christian. Neither can anyone tell you that CELL GROUP is the BEST WAY for a christian to grow closer to GOD and to your fellow christian brothers and sisters<br><br>gasband,sorry but from what i know and learn there is no such thing as a good or bad christian..no christian is good or bad...they have thier own sets of gifts lor...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cell groups from my pov is the basic building block in a church because it would be hard to interact with one another in a church as there are far too many members so you can't really interact with everyone of them..<br>cell group gives you that particular chance,and cell group also enhances the bonding ties/fellowship with fellow church mates or to new members/new comers to the church as it is less threatening to them..sharing in a cell group is more efficient as members tend to be more open in smaller groups and smaller group is less threatening as some members might wanna share things that they dun want too many people to know..<br>cell group also allows for easier study of the bible as it is in a smaller group and any questions can be raise and answer on the spot..it also allows leaders to see who has the potential to come out and lead as members are assign different roles from time to time.</div>
