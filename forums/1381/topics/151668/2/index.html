Those which strongly believe in 'tongues' as a doctrine in Christian living are Charismatics.</blockquote>Can someone please explain what's pentacostal and charismatic?<br><br><blockquote>Singing and Praise and Worship Songs - Not all churches practice the same expression of hymns and verbal worship onto God.<br>No, it does not restricted/limited to only pentacostal churches. </blockquote>I discovered that some churches sing old traditional hymns (e.g. Wesley Methodist Church) unlike CHC which sings rather modern pop-like praise and worship songs. Personally I feel holier when singing the traditional hymns than the praise and worship songs, which make me feel like I'm attending a concert rather than a church service. Guess that's why I don't really feel holy at CHC unlike at Wesley Methodist Church. But the sermons at CHC are more lively and interesting.<br><br><blockquote>About tithing - i suggest that you read up more on Charity, offering, tithing? If church made it compulsory, and believers follow without the condition of the heart to give onto God.  They are missing the whole point of pleasing God and Christian walk completely. And unfortunately, it becomes a ritual and religion. But for the sake of answering your question. Yes, some sick churches do ask for commitment of 1/10 of payroll from believer.<br></blockquote>I've always thought that tithing meant making an offering in the bag that is passed around during church service. But compulsory tithing is now auto-deducted from bank account through GIRO. And the churches which make tithing of 1/10 the salary, are usually the rich ones.<br><br><blockquote>Those churches which have Cell Group/care group/fellowship are considered cell church. It depends on the function of the church. </blockquote>Are you saying that not all churches are cell churches?<br><br><blockquote>I presume you're a christian? Not all churches practise Cell Group foundation. Every House are specially created by God. </blockquote>Yes, I'm a newly converted Christian with lots of questions. Still unfamiliar and in some cases, uncomfortable with the practise of being a Christian.<br><br><blockquote>Regarding those Christian who went to CG and not church regularly, you may wish to ask yourself, what is Church to you?</blockquote>What I meant is, I have friends who go to church regularly but do not attend CG. To me, church service is definitely more important than CG but I have been told that it's important to develop fellowship with fellow Christians.<br><br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cell group is more like a time for u to fellowship. look at it this way, in church when the sermon is being prepared, the pastor have to keep in mind that he is abt to bring for the word of God to 5-yr christians 10-yr christian 2-month christian. therefore, usually the message is rather general. but in a cell group, your leader can address the msg to the cell group's needs.  the idea of cell groups originated from korea from the biggest church in Asia, it has 1M members in total. the church size is so big that each member can only go for service 3 times per month. therefore cell groups were being set up. perhaps another reason for cell groups is that, wad if, one day the govt bans christianity and decide to close down all churches? where do all the christians go? thats why we have cell groups at home cuz at home we are free to do wad we wan isnt it.?</div>

If we didn't bring up this topic in our casual talk, I also didn't know.<br><br>If last time got ppl explain properly to them what is Charismatic or tongue speaking, they would understand and today maybe Christian already. .<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">Is tithing mentioned in the NT?</div></blockquote>From gotquestions.com:<br><br>Answer:  Tithing is an issue that many Christians struggle with. In many churches tithing is over-emphasized. At the same time, many Christians refuse to submit to the Biblical exhortation in regards to making offerings to the Lord. Tithing / giving is intended to be a joy, a blessing. Sadly, that is rarely the case in the church today.<br><br>Tithing is an Old Testament concept. The tithe was a requirement of the law in which all Israelites were give 10% of everything they earned and grew to the Tabernacle / Temple (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:26; Deuteronomy 14:24; 2 Chronicles 31:5). Some understand the Old Testament tithe as a method of taxation to provide for the needs of the priests and Levites of the sacrificial system. The New Testament nowhere commands, or even recommends that Christians submit to a legalistic tithe system. Paul states that believers should set aside a portion of their income in order to support the church (1 Corinthians 16:1-2).<br><br>The New Testament nowhere assigns a certain percentage of income to set aside, but only says it is to be Â“in keeping with his incomeÂ” (1 Corinthians 16:2). The Christian church has essentially taken the 10% figure from the Old Testament tithe and applied it as a Â“recommended minimumÂ” for Christians in their giving. However, Christians should not feel obligated to always tithe. They should give as they are able, Â“in keeping with his income.Â” Sometimes that means giving more than a tithe, sometime that may mean giving less than a tithe. It all depends on the ability of the Christian and the needs of the church. Each and every Christian should diligently pray and seek GodÂ’s wisdom as to whether to participate in tithing and/or for how much he or she should give (James 1:5). Â“Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giverÂ” (2 Corinthians 9:7).<br></div>

Personally I feel holier when singing the traditional hymns than the praise and worship songs, which make me feel like I'm attending a concert rather than a church service. Guess that's why I don't really feel holy at CHC unlike at Wesley Methodist Church. But the sermons at CHC are more lively and interesting.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">As a new believer. You may feel alot of things.<br>I hope you'll get pass this phrase and learn to rely on the true spirit which will guide you in your walk.<br><br>Some people like Old traditional hymnal kind of worship<br>Some prefer modern worship.<br>It doesn't matter much as long as the heart condition is right.</span><br><br><blockquote>About tithing - i suggest that you read up more on Charity, offering, tithing? If church made it compulsory, and believers follow without the condition of the heart to give onto God.  They are missing the whole point of pleasing God and Christian walk completely. And unfortunately, it becomes a ritual and religion. But for the sake of answering your question. Yes, some sick churches do ask for commitment of 1/10 of payroll from believer.<br></blockquote>I've always thought that tithing meant making an offering in the bag that is passed around during church service. But compulsory tithing is now auto-deducted from bank account through GIRO. And the churches which make tithing of 1/10 the salary, are usually the rich ones.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">the bag you see which was passed around the congregation is a gift of tangibles onto God.<br>Worship - intangible<br>Offering - tangible<br><br>I think i've said before.<br>If you really love God and want to give Him something to bless Him.<br>A 10cent which comes from your heart is enough to please God.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> tithing is a monthly offering. 10% what you have will be given to Him.<br>God only asked for 10%.

Not all churches practise Cell Group foundation. Every House are specially created by God. </blockquote>Yes, I'm a newly converted Christian with lots of questions. Still unfamiliar and in some cases, uncomfortable with the practise of being a Christian.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">My advice to you is stay strong in your relationship with the Holy Spirit. Take heart, take faith.<br>Only trust your relationship.  </span><br><br><blockquote>Regarding those Christian who went to CG and not church regularly, you may wish to ask yourself, what is Church to you?</blockquote>What I meant is, I have friends who go to church regularly but do not attend CG. To me, church service is definitely more important than CG but I have been told that it's important to develop fellowship with fellow Christians.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I have to agree that CG is more important.<br>The house of God is equally important.<br>But ultimately you must know who and what is the most important.<br></span><br></strong><br></div>
