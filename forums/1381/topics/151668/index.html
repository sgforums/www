However, the nature of tzedakah is very different from the idea of charity. The word "charity" suggests benevolence and generosity, a magnanimous act by the wealthy and powerful for the benefit of the poor and needy. The word "tzedakah" is derived from the Hebrew root Tzade-Dalet-Qof, meaning righteousness, justice or fairness. In Judaism, giving to the poor is not viewed as a generous, magnanimous act; it is simply an act of justice and righteousness, the performance of a duty, giving the poor their due. </strong><br><br>From <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/tzedakah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/tzedakah.htm</a><br><br>So the Jewish "tithing" is much holier and goes much deeper than the Christian one. Everyone complains about the Christian one - that the pastor pockets the money, $$ used to build titanium building etc. And non Christians just cannot understand why tithing is an act of obedience to God. Wah leow .. obey God so that pple can build titanium buildings?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But if you read the url above you realize the Jewish "tithing" is an act of social support. And you don't only give to the Jews, for whether Jews or gentiles, we are still children of God.<br><br>"Where there is no bread, there can be no Torah. Where there is no Torah, there will be no bread" (Pirket Avot 3:17).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Those which strongly believe in 'tongues' as a doctrine in Christian living are Charismatics.<br><br>Singing and Praise and Worship Songs - Not all churches practice the same expression of hymns and verbal worship onto God.<br>No, it does not restricted/limited to only pentacostal churches.<br><br>About tithing - i suggest that you read up more on Charity, offering, tithing?<br>If church made it compulsory, and believers follow without the condition of the heart to give onto God.<br>They are missing the whole point of pleasing God and Christian walk completely. And unfortunately, it becomes a ritual and religion.<br><br>But for the sake of answering your question. Yes, some sick churches do ask for commitment of 1/10 of payroll from believer.<br><br>Those churches which have Cell Group/care group/fellowship are considered cell church. It depends on the function of the church.<br>I presume you're a christian?<br>Not all churches practise Cell Group foundation.

Not all churches lah.<br><br>Dunno abt other churches, but Catholic Church dun.<br><br>They just pass around the bags during Mass and it's up to the parishioners whether to put in money or not.  Sometimes I choose not to put in if I see that the parish is full of rich ppl (eg.  Holy Family Church where Minister George Yeo and many rich Eurasians &amp; Peranakan attend.  Also OLPS in Siglap which is surrounded by nothing but landed properties where most of the parishioners stay.)  These rich ppl often give big donation one.  Sometimes during Mass, I can see some aunties dropping $50 notes into the bag.  So in this case, I dun give.  Keep my money for ppl who need more.<br><br>The poorer churches like Queen of Peace and St Stephen, I will sure give one.<br>Collection for the <span style="font-style: italic;">St Vincent de Paul for the Poor Society</span>, I will also give one, regardless of where I attend Mass.<br><br>Those that force ppl to donate, better stay away.  If they force further, go ahead and ask them why they need so much money.  If they give crap answers like "Oh, being a newly established church, we need to build a new church building"  Then tell them to use the existing church buildings even if they may be of other denominations.  Tell them money is not to be wasted like that.  Need so many buildings for what?<br><br>I dun like to sound so harsh or sarcastic.  But I am surrounded by ppl who got brainwashed into contributing dunno 10 or 20 percent of their salary every month.  And because all these are young ppl who just came out of school, they have very low pay.  Hence, after that donation, they are left with just enough for their daily expenses.  When their parents need money, they explain that they have no money for the parents cuz part of it goes to the church.<br><br>When I was a teenager, I was very involved in the Presbyterian Church (which I still very much love).  I seldom donated anything to them cuz I was just a student (no money one!) and they never forced me also.  But my family would haunt me to get out of that they didn't mind if I didn't go back to the Catholic.  Every month my mom would update me on some sad stories of her friend or our relatives about their children refusing to give parents money after converting.<br><br>Eventually she got convinced that the Presbyterians are not as bad as she thought.  The pastor even lent me money to pay for my poly school fee and refused to let me pay him back (very nice hor ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )   So I very paiseh, instead of paying him back, I use that money and donate to the church.<br><br></div>

But something that you all have not covered is:<br>- praying in tongues<br>- singing praise and worship songs<br><br>I realise that not all churches do the above. Are these limited to pentacostal churches?<br><br>And about tithing - is it true that only some churches practise <span style="text-decoration: underline;">compulsory</span> tithing?

Seems like not all Christians I know attends cell group though they may go to church regularly every Sunday.</div></blockquote>yes you are correct. Not all churches encourage or force people to tithe. What those churches do is that, they put a wooden box with some envelopes at an inconspicuous corner of the church. Anybody who wishes to donate or tithe do so at their own discretion. The church pastors neither encourage nor force the people to tithe.<br><br>As for speaking in tounges....Im not sure about it. My friend from CHC is able to do it...but Im sure that every church might have a different view on the subject of speaking in tounges.<br><br></div>

However, it is not a must. But you can still do so if you wish to.</div>
