The sense of warning and restraint that the Spirit gives comes to us in the most amazingly gentle ways. And if you are not sensitive enough to detect His voice, you will quench it, and your spiritual life will be impaired. This sense of restraint will always come as a "still small voice" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Kings+19:12" rel="nofollow">1 Kings 19:12</a> ), so faint that no one except a saint of God will notice it.<br><br>Beware if in sharing your personal testimony you continually have to look back, saying, "Once, a number of years ago, I was saved." If you have put your "hand to the plow" and are walking in the light, there is no "looking back"Â—the past is instilled into the present wonder of fellowship and oneness with God ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+9:62" rel="nofollow">Luke 9:62</a> ; also see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+John+1:6-7" rel="nofollow">1 John 1:6-7</a> ). If you get out of the light, you become a sentimental Christian, and live only on your memories, and your testimony will have a hard metallic ring to it. Beware of trying to cover up your present refusal to "walk in the light" by recalling your past experiences when you did "walk in the light" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+John+1:7" rel="nofollow">1 John 1:7</a> ). When-ever the Spirit gives you that sense of restraint, call a halt and make things right, or else you will go on quenching and grieving Him without even knowing it.<br><br>Suppose God brings you to a crisis and you almost endure it, but not completely. He will engineer the crisis again, but this time some of the intensity will be lost. You will have less discernment and more humiliation at having disobeyed. If you continue to grieve His Spirit, there will come a time when that crisis cannot be repeated, because you have totally quenched Him. But if you will go on through the crisis, your life will become a hymn of praise to God. Never become attached to anything that continues to hurt God. For you to be free of it, God must be allowed to hurt whatever it may be.<br><br>=======<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">Looks like all these stuff were extracted from Oswald Chambers.<br>If not....some other materials.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">   </div></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">My Utmost for His Highest</span><br>a discipline for my mornin' devotional each working day, had that title in my siggy but changed it some while back.<br>No prize for your observation tho  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If our experience of being set apart from sin and being made holy through the process of sanctification is still very shallow, we tend to mistake the reality of God for something else. And when the Spirit of God gives us a sense of warning or restraint, we are apt to say mistakenly, "Oh, that must be from the devil."<br><br>"Do not quench the Spirit" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Thessalonians+5:19" rel="nofollow">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a> ), and do not despise Him when He says to you, in effect, "DonÂ’t be blind on this point anymoreÂ—you are not as far along spiritually as you thought you were. Until now I have not been able to reveal this to you, but IÂ’m revealing it to you right now." When the Lord disciplines you like that, let Him have His way with you. Allow Him to put you into a right-standing relationship before God.<br><br>". . . nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him." We begin to pout, become irritated with God, and then say, "Oh well, I canÂ’t help it. I prayed and things didnÂ’t turn out right anyway. So IÂ’m simply going to give up on everything." Just think what would happen if we acted like this in any other area of our lives!<br><br>Am I fully prepared to allow God to grip me by His power and do a work in me that is truly worthy of Himself? Sanctification is not my idea of what I want God to do for meÂ—sanctification is GodÂ’s idea of what He wants to do for me. But He has to get me into the state of mind and spirit where I will allow Him to sanctify me completely, whatever the cost (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Thessalonians+5:23-24" rel="nofollow">1 Thessalonians 5:23-24</a> ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Evidence of the New Birth</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You must be born again Â—John 3:7 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The answer to NicodemusÂ’ question, "How can a man be born when he is old?" is: Only when he is willing to die to everything in his life, including his rights, his virtues, and his religion, and becomes willing to receive into himself a new life that he has never before experienced ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+3:4" rel="nofollow">John 3:4</a> ). This new life exhibits itself in our conscious repentance and through our unconscious holiness.<br><br>"But as many as received Him . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:12" rel="nofollow">John 1:12</a> ). Is my knowledge of Jesus the result of my own internal spiritual perception, or is it only what I have learned through listening to others? Is there something in my life that unites me with the Lord Jesus as my personal Savior? My spiritual history must have as its underlying foundation a personal knowledge of Jesus Christ. To be born again means that I see Jesus.<br><br>". . . unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3). Am I seeking only for the evidence of GodÂ’s kingdom, or am I actually recognizing His absolute sovereign control? The new birth gives me a new power of vision by which I begin to discern GodÂ’s control. His sovereignty was there all the time, but with God being true to His nature, I could not see it until I received His very nature myself.<br><br>"Whoever has been born of God does not sin . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+John+3:9" rel="nofollow">1 John 3:9</a> ). Am I seeking to stop sinning or have I actually stopped? To be born of God means that I have His supernatural power to stop sinning. The Bible never asks, "Should a Christian sin?" The Bible emphatically states that a Christian must not sin. The work of the new birth is being effective in us when we do not commit sin. It is not merely that we have the power not to sin, but that we have actually stopped sinning. Yet <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+John+3:9" rel="nofollow">1 John 3:9</a> does not mean that we cannot sinÂ—it simply means that if we will obey the life of God in us, that we do not have to sin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Have You Ever Been Speechless with Sorrow? </strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich Â—Luke 18:23 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The rich young ruler went away from Jesus speechless with sorrow, having nothing to say in response to JesusÂ’ words. He had no doubt about what Jesus had said or what it meant, and it produced in him a sorrow with no words with which to respond. Have you ever been there? Has GodÂ’s Word ever come to you, pointing out an area of your life, requiring you to yield it to Him? Maybe He has pointed out certain personal qualities, desires, and interests, or possibly relationships of your heart and mind. If so, then you have often been speechless with sorrow. The Lord will not go after you, and He will not plead with you. But every time He meets you at the place where He has pointed, He will simply repeat His words, saying, "If you really mean what you say, these are the conditions."<br><br>"Sell all that you have . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+18:22" rel="nofollow">Luke 18:22</a> ). In other words, rid yourself before God of everything that might be considered a possession until you are a mere conscious human being standing before Him, and then give God that. That is where the battle is truly foughtÂ—in the realm of your will before God. Are you more devoted to your idea of what Jesus wants than to Jesus Himself? If so, you are likely to hear one of His harsh and unyielding statements that will produce sorrow in you. What Jesus says is difficultÂ—it is only easy when it is heard by those who have His nature in them. Beware of allowing anything to soften the hard words of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I can be so rich in my own poverty, or in the awareness of the fact that I am nobody, that I will never be a disciple of Jesus. Or I can be so rich in the awareness that I am somebody that I will never be a disciple. Am I willing to be destitute and poor even in my sense of awareness of my destitution and poverty? If not, that is why I become discouraged. Discouragement is disillusioned self-love, and self-love may be love for my devotion to JesusÂ—not love for Jesus Himself.</div>

Â—Matthew 11:28</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>God intends for us to live a well-rounded life in Christ Jesus, but there are times when that life is attacked from the outside. Then we tend to fall back into self-examination, a habit that we thought was gone. Self-awareness is the first thing that will upset the completeness of our life in God, and self-awareness continually produces a sense of struggling and turmoil in our lives. Self-awareness is not sin, and it can be produced by nervous emotions or by suddenly being dropped into a totally new set of circumstances. Yet it is never GodÂ’s will that we should be anything less than absolutely complete in Him. Anything that disturbs our rest in Him must be rectified at once, and it is not rectified by being ignored but only by coming to Jesus Christ. If we will come to Him, asking Him to produce Christ-awareness in us, He will always do it, until we fully learn to abide in Him.<br><br>Never allow anything that divides or destroys the oneness of your life with Christ to remain in your life without facing it. Beware of allowing the influence of your friends or your circumstances to divide your life. This only serves to sap your strength and slow your spiritual growth. Beware of anything that can split your oneness with Him, causing you to see yourself as separate from Him. Nothing is as important as staying right spiritually. And the only solution is a very simple oneÂ—"Come to Me . . . ." The intellectual, moral, and spiritual depth of our reality as a person is tested and measured by these words. Yet in every detail of our lives where we are found not to be real, we would rather dispute the findings than come to Jesus.</div>

Never allow anything to remain in your life that is causing the unrest. Think of every detail of your life that is causing the disintegration as something to fight against, not as something you should allow to remain. Ask the Lord to put awareness of Himself in you, and your self-awareness will disappear. Then He will be your all in all. Beware of allowing your self-awareness to continue, because slowly but surely it will awaken self-pity, and self-pity is satanic. DonÂ’t allow yourself to say, "Well, they have just misunderstood me, and this is something over which they should be apologizing to me; IÂ’m sure I must have this cleared up with them already." Learn to leave others alone regarding this. Simply ask the Lord to give you Christ-awareness, and He will steady you until your completeness in Him is absolute.<br><br>A complete life is the life of a child. When I am fully conscious of my awareness of Christ, there is something wrong. It is the sick person who really knows what health is. A child of God is not aware of the will of God because he is the will of God. When we have deviated even slightly from the will of God, we begin to ask, "Lord, what is your will?" A child of God never prays to be made aware of the fact that God answers prayer, because he is so restfully certain that God always answers prayer.<br><br>If we try to overcome our self-awareness through any of our own commonsense methods, we will only serve to strengthen our self-awareness tremendously. Jesus says, "Come to Me . . . and I will give you rest," that is, Christ-awareness will take the place of self-awareness. Wherever Jesus comes He establishes restÂ—the rest of the completion of activity in our lives that is never aware of itself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Ministry of the Unnoticed</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Blessed are the poor in spirit . . .  Â—Matthew 5:3</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The New Testament notices things that do not seem worthy of notice by our standards. "Blessed are the poor in spirit . . . ." This literally means, "Blessed are the paupers." Paupers are remarkably commonplace! The preaching of today tends to point out a personÂ’s strength of will or the beauty of his characterÂ—things that are easily noticed. The statement we so often hear, "Make a decision for Jesus Christ," places the emphasis on something our Lord never trusted. He never asks us to decide for Him, but to yield to HimÂ—something very different. At the foundation of Jesus ChristÂ’s kingdom is the genuine loveliness of those who are commonplace. I am truly blessed in my poverty. If I have no strength of will and a nature without worth or excellence, then Jesus says to me, "Blessed are you, because it is through your poverty that you can enter My kingdom." I cannot enter His kingdom by virtue of my goodnessÂ—I can only enter it as an absolute pauper.<br><br>The true character of the loveliness that speaks for God is always unnoticed by the one possessing that quality. Conscious influence is prideful and unchristian. If I wonder if I am being of any use to God, I instantly lose the beauty and the freshness of the touch of the Lord. "He who believes in Me . . . out of his heart will flow rivers of living water" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+7:38" rel="nofollow">John 7:38</a> ). And if I examine the outflow, I lose the touch of the Lord.<br><br>Who are the people who have influenced us most? Certainly not the ones who thought they did, but those who did not have even the slightest idea that they were influencing us. In the Christian life, godly influence is never conscious of itself. If we are conscious of our influence, it ceases to have the genuine loveliness which is characteristic of the touch of Jesus. We always know when Jesus is at work because He produces in the commonplace something that is inspiring.</div>

When He comes to me, am I prepared for Him to drag every wrong thing I have ever done into the light? That is exactly where He comes. Wherever I know I am unclean is where He will put His feet and stand, and wherever I think I am clean is where He will remove His feet and walk away.<br><br>Repentance does not cause a sense of sinÂ—it causes a sense of inexpressible unworthiness.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sacrifice and Friendship</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I have called you friends . . . Â—John 15:15 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We will never know the joy of self-sacrifice until we surrender in every detail of our lives. Yet self-surrender is the most difficult thing for us to do. We make it conditional by saying, "IÂ’ll surrender if . . . !" Or we approach it by saying, "I suppose I have to devote my life to God." We will never find the joy of self-sacrifice in either of these ways.<br><br>But as soon as we do totally surrender, abandoning ourselves to Jesus, the Holy Spirit gives us a taste of His joy. The ultimate goal of self-sacrifice is to lay down our lives for our Friend (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+15:13-14" rel="nofollow">John 15:13-14</a> ). When the Holy Spirit comes into our lives, our greatest desire is to lay down our lives for Jesus. Yet the thought of self-sacrifice never even crosses our minds, because sacrifice is the Holy SpiritÂ’s ultimate expression of love.<br><br>Our Lord is our example of a life of self-sacrifice, and He perfectly exemplified Psalm 40:8, "I delight to do Your will, O my God . . . ." He endured tremendous personal sacrifice, yet with overflowing joy. Have I ever yielded myself in absolute submission to Jesus Christ? If He is not the One to whom I am looking for direction and guidance, then there is no benefit in my sacrifice. But when my sacrifice is made with my eyes focused on Him, slowly but surely His molding influence becomes evident in my life (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+12:1-2" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 12:1-2</a> ).<br><br>Beware of letting your natural desires hinder your walk in love before God. One of the cruelest ways to kill natural love is through the rejection that results from having built the love on natural desires. But the one true desire of a saint is the Lord Jesus. Love for God is not something sentimental or emotionalÂ—for a saint to love as God loves is the most practical thing imaginable.<br><br>"I have called you friends. . . ." Our friendship with Jesus is based on the new life He created in us, which has no resemblance or attraction to our old life but only to the life of God. It is a life that is completely humble, pure, and devoted to God.</div>

Â—John 14:27</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>There are times in our lives when our peace is based simply on our own ignorance. But when we are awakened to the realities of life, true inner peace is impossible unless it is received from Jesus. When our Lord speaks peace, He creates peace, because the words that He speaks are always "spirit, and they are life" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+6:63" rel="nofollow">John 6:63</a> ). Have I ever received what Jesus speaks? ". . . <span style="font-style: italic;">My peace I give to you</span> . . ."Â—a peace that comes from looking into His face and fully understanding and receiving His quiet contentment.<br><br>Are you severely troubled right now? Are you afraid and confused by the waves and the turbulence God sovereignly allows to enter your life? Have you left no stone of your faith unturned, yet still not found any well of peace, joy, or comfort? Does your life seem completely barren to you? Then look up and receive the quiet contentment of the Lord Jesus. Reflecting His peace is proof that you are right with God, because you are exhibiting the freedom to turn your mind to Him. If you are not right with God, you can never turn your mind anywhere but on yourself. Allowing anything to hide the face of Jesus Christ from you either causes you to become troubled or gives you a false sense of security.<br><br>With regard to the problem that is pressing in on you right now, are you "looking unto Jesus" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+12:2" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 12:2</a> ) and receiving peace from Him? If so, He will be a gracious blessing of peace exhibited in and through you. But if you only try to worry your way out of the problem, you destroy His effectiveness in you, and you deserve whatever you get. We become troubled because we have not been taking Him into account. When a person confers with Jesus Christ, the confusion stops, because there is no confusion in Him. Lay everything out before Him, and when you are faced with difficulty, bereavement, and sorrow, listen to Him say, "Let not your heart be troubled . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+14:27" rel="nofollow">John 14:27</a> ).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Living Your Theology</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you . . .  Â—John 12:35</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Beware of not acting upon what you see in your moments on the mountaintop with God. If you do not obey the light, it will turn into darkness. "If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+6:23" rel="nofollow">Matthew 6:23</a> ). The moment you forsake the matter of sanctification or neglect anything else on which God has given you His light, your spiritual life begins to disintegrate within you. Continually bring the truth out into your real life, working it out into every area, or else even the light that you possess will itself prove to be a curse.<br><br>The most difficult person to deal with is the one who has the prideful self-satisfaction of a past experience, but is not working that experience out in his everyday life. If you say you are sanctified, show it. The experience must be so genuine that it shows in your life. Beware of any belief that makes you self-indulgent or self-gratifying; that belief came from the pit of hell itself, regardless of how beautiful it may sound.<br><br>Your theology must work itself out, exhibiting itself in your most common everyday relationships. Our Lord said, ". . . unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+5:20" rel="nofollow">Matthew 5:20</a> ). In other words, you must be more moral than the most moral person you know. You may know all about the doctrine of sanctification, but are you working it out in the everyday issues of your life? Every detail of your life, whether physical, moral, or spiritual, is to be judged and measured by the standard of the atonement by the Cross of Christ.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Purpose of Prayer</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">. . . one of His disciples said to Him, Â’Lord, teach us to pray . . .Â’ Â—Luke 11:1 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Prayer is not a normal part of the life of the natural man. We hear it said that a personÂ’s life will suffer if he doesnÂ’t pray, but I question that. What will suffer is the life of the Son of God in him, which is nourished not by food, but by prayer. When a person is born again from above, the life of the Son of God is born in him, and he can either starve or nourish that life. Prayer is the way that the life of God in us is nourished. Our common ideas regarding prayer are not found in the New Testament. We look upon prayer simply as a means of getting things for ourselves, but the biblical purpose of prayer is that we may get to know God Himself.<br><br>"Ask, and you will receive . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+16:24" rel="nofollow">John 16:24</a> ). We complain before God, and sometimes we are apologetic or indifferent to Him, but we actually ask Him for very few things. Yet a child exhibits a magnificent boldness to ask! Our Lord said, ". . . unless you . . . become as little children . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+18:3" rel="nofollow">Matthew 18:3</a> ). Ask and God will do. Give Jesus Christ the opportunity and the room to work. The problem is that no one will ever do this until he is at his witsÂ’ end. When a person is at his witsÂ’ end, it no longer seems to be a cowardly thing to pray; in fact, it is the only way he can get in touch with the truth and the reality of God Himself. Be yourself before God and present Him with your problemsÂ—the very things that have brought you to your witsÂ’ end. But as long as you think you are self-sufficient, you do not need to ask God for anything.<br><br>To say that "prayer changes things" is not as close to the truth as saying, "Prayer changes me and then I change things." God has established things so that prayer, on the basis of redemption, changes the way a person looks at things. Prayer is not a matter of changing things externally, but one of working miracles in a personÂ’s inner nature.</div>

But common sense is not faith, and faith is not common sense. In fact, they are as different as the natural life and the spiritual. Can you trust Jesus Christ where your common sense cannot trust Him? Can you venture out with courage on the words of Jesus Christ, while the realities of your commonsense life continue to shout, "ItÂ’s all a lie"? When you are on the mountaintop, itÂ’s easy to say, "Oh yes, I believe God can do it," but you have to come down from the mountain to the demon-possessed valley and face the realities that scoff at your Mount-of-Transfiguration belief (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+9:28-42" rel="nofollow">Luke 9:28-42</a> ). Every time my theology becomes clear to my own mind, I encounter something that contradicts it. As soon as I say, "I believe Â’God shall supply all [my] need,Â’ " the testing of my faith begins ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Philippians+4:19" rel="nofollow">Philippians 4:19</a> ). When my strength runs dry and my vision is blinded, will I endure this trial of my faith victoriously or will I turn back in defeat?<br><br>Faith must be tested, because it can only become your intimate possession through conflict. What is challenging your faith right now? The test will either prove your faith right, or it will kill it. Jesus said, "Blessed is he who is not offended because of Me" <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+11:6" rel="nofollow">Matthew 11:6</a> ). The ultimate thing is confidence in Jesus. "We have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+3:14" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 3:14</a> ). Believe steadfastly on Him and everything that challenges you will strengthen your faith. There is continual testing in the life of faith up to the point of our physical death, which is the last great test. Faith is absolute trust in GodÂ—trust that could never imagine that He would forsake us (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+13:5-6" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 13:5-6</a> ).</div>

We are not destined to happiness, nor to health, but to holiness. Today we have far too many desires and interests, and our lives are being consumed and wasted by them. Many of them may be right, noble, and good, and may later be fulfilled, but in the meantime God must cause their importance to us to decrease. The only thing that truly matters is whether a person will accept the God who will make him holy. At all costs, a person must have the right relationship with God.<br><br>Do I believe I need to be holy? Do I believe that God can come into me and make me holy? If through your preaching you convince me that I am unholy, I then resent your preaching. The preaching of the gospel awakens an intense resentment because it is designed to reveal my unholiness, but it also awakens an intense yearning and desire within me. God has only one intended destiny for mankindÂ—holiness. His only goal is to produce saints. God is not some eternal blessing-machine for people to use, and He did not come to save us out of pityÂ—He came to save us because He created us to be holy. Atonement through the Cross of Christ means that God can put me back into perfect oneness with Himself through the death of Jesus Christ, without a trace of anything coming between us any longer.<br><br>Never tolerate, because of sympathy for yourself or for others, any practice that is not in keeping with a holy God. Holiness means absolute purity of your walk before God, the words coming from your mouth, and every thought in your mindÂ—placing every detail of your life under the scrutiny of God Himself. Holiness is not simply what God gives me, but what God has given me that is being exhibited in my life.</div>

Â—John 7:38</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Jesus did not say, "He who believes in Me will realize all the blessings of the fullness of God," but, in essence, "He who believes in Me will have everything he receives escape out of him." Our LordÂ’s teaching was always <span style="font-style: italic;">anti-self</span>-realization. His purpose is not the development of a personÂ—His purpose is to make a person exactly like Himself, and the Son of God is characterized by self-expenditure. If we believe in Jesus, it is not what we gain but what He pours through us that really counts. GodÂ’s purpose is not simply to make us beautiful, plump grapes, but to make us grapes so that He may squeeze the sweetness out of us. Our spiritual life cannot be measured by success as the world measures it, but only by what God pours through usÂ—and we cannot measure that at all.<br><br>When Mary of Bethany "broke the flask . . . of very costly oil . . . and poured it on [JesusÂ’] head," it was an act for which no one else saw any special occasion; in fact, ". . . there were some who . . . said, Â’Why was this fragrant oil wasted?Â’ " ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Mark+14:3-4" rel="nofollow">Mark 14:3-4</a> ). But Jesus commended Mary for her extravagant act of devotion, and said, ". . . wherever this gospel is preached . . . what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Mark+14:9" rel="nofollow">Mark 14:9</a> ). Our Lord is filled with overflowing joy whenever He sees any of us doing what Mary didÂ—not being bound by a particular set of rules, but being totally surrendered to Him. God poured out the life of His Son "that the world through Him might be saved" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+3:17" rel="nofollow">John 3:17</a> ). Are we prepared to pour out our lives for Him?<br><br>"He who believes in Me . . . out of his heart will flow rivers of living water"Â—and hundreds of other lives will be continually refreshed. Now is the time for us to break "the flask" of our lives, to stop seeking our own satisfaction, and to pour out our lives before Him. Our Lord is asking who of us will do it for Him?</div>

Have you taken whatever it may be, even at the risk of damaging your own soul, simply to satisfy yourself? If you have, then you cannot pour it out "to the Lord." You can never set apart for God something that you desire for yourself to achieve your own satisfaction. If you try to satisfy yourself with a blessing from God, it will corrupt you. You must sacrifice it, pouring it out to GodÂ—something that your common sense says is an absurd waste.<br><br>How can I pour out "to the Lord" natural love and spiritual blessings? There is only one wayÂ—I must make a determination in my mind to do so. There are certain things other people do that could never be received by someone who does not know God, because it is humanly impossible to repay them. As soon as I realize that something is too wonderful for me, that I am not worthy to receive it, and that it is not meant for a human being at all, I must pour it out "to the Lord." Then these very things that have come to me will be poured out as "rivers of living water" all around me ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+7:38" rel="nofollow">John 7:38</a> ). And until I pour these things out to God, they actually endanger those I love, as well as myself, because they will be turned into lust. Yes, we can be lustful in things that are not sordid and vile. Even love must be transformed by being poured out "to the Lord."<br><br>If you have become bitter and sour, it is because when God gave you a blessing you hoarded it. Yet if you had poured it out to Him, you would have been the sweetest person on earth. If you are always keeping blessings to yourself and never learning to pour out anything "to the Lord," other people will never have their vision of God expanded through you.<br></div>

There are things in human nature, such as prejudices, that the saint can only destroy through sheer neglect. But there are other things that have to be destroyed through violence, that is, through GodÂ’s divine strength imparted by His Spirit. There are some things over which we are not to fight, but only to "stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Exodus+14:13" rel="nofollow">Exodus 14:13</a> ). But every theory or thought that raises itself up as a fortified barrier "against the knowledge of God" is to be determinedly demolished by drawing on GodÂ’s power, not through human effort or by compromise (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2+Corinthians+10:4" rel="nofollow">2 Corinthians 10:4</a> ).<br><br>It is only when God has transformed our nature and we have entered into the experience of sanctification that the fight begins. The warfare is not against sin; we can never fight against sinÂ—Jesus Christ conquered that in His redemption of us. The conflict is waged over turning our natural life into a spiritual life. This is never done easily, nor does God intend that it be so. It is accomplished only through a series of moral choices. God does not make us holy in the sense that He makes our character holy. He makes us holy in the sense that He has made us innocent before Him. And then we have to turn that innocence into holy character through the moral choices we make. These choices are continually opposed and hostile to the things of our natural life which have become so deeply entrenchedÂ—the very things that raise themselves up as fortified barriers "against the knowledge of God." We can either turn back, making ourselves of no value to the kingdom of God, or we can determinedly demolish these things, allowing Jesus to bring another son to glory (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+2:10" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 2:10</a> ).<br></div>

Do you find yourself saying, "If God calls me to battle, of course I will rise to the occasion"? Yet you wonÂ’t rise to the occasion unless you have done so on GodÂ’s training ground. If you are not doing the task that is closest to you now, which God has engineered into your life, when the crisis comes, instead of being fit for battle, you will be revealed as being unfit. Crises always reveal a personÂ’s true character.<br><br>A private relationship of worshiping God is the greatest essential element of spiritual fitness. The time will come, as Nathanael experienced in this passage, that a private "fig-tree" life will no longer be possible. Everything will be out in the open, and you will find yourself to be of no value there if you have not been worshiping in everyday occasions in your own home. If your worship is right in your private relationship with God, then when He sets you free, you will be ready. It is in the unseen life, which only God saw, that you have become perfectly fit. And when the strain of the crisis comes, you can be relied upon by God.<br><br>Are you saying, "But I canÂ’t be expected to live a sanctified life in my present circumstances; I have no time for prayer or Bible study right now; besides, my opportunity for battle hasnÂ’t come yet, but when it does, of course I will be ready"? No, you will not. If you have not been worshiping in everyday occasions, when you get involved in GodÂ’s work, you will not only be useless yourself but also a hindrance to those around you.<br><br>GodÂ’s training ground, where the missionary weapons are found, is the hidden, personal, worshiping life of the saint.</div>

The very character we exhibit in our present surroundings is an indication of what we will be like in other surroundings.<br><br>The things Jesus did were the most menial of everyday tasks, and this is an indication that it takes all of GodÂ’s power in me to accomplish even the most common tasks in His way. Can I use a towel as He did? Towels, dishes, sandals, and all the other ordinary things in our lives reveal what we are made of more quickly than anything else. It takes God Almighty Incarnate in us to do the most menial duty as it ought to be done.<br><br>Jesus said, "I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you" (13:15). Notice the kind of people that God brings around you, and you will be humiliated once you realize that this is actually His way of revealing to you the kind of person you have been to Him. Now He says we should exhibit to those around us exactly what He has exhibited to us.<br><br>Do you find yourself responding by saying, "Oh, I will do all that once IÂ’m out on the mission field"? Talking in this way is like trying to produce the weapons of war while in the trenches of the battlefield--you will be killed while trying to do it.<br><br>We have to go the "second mile" with God (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+5:41" rel="nofollow">Matthew 5:41</a> ). Yet some of us become worn out in the first ten steps. Then we say, "Well, IÂ’ll just wait until I get closer to the next big crisis in my life." But if we do not steadily minister in everyday opportunities, we will do nothing when the crisis comes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Going Through Spiritual Confusion</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Jesus answered and said, Â’You do not know what you askÂ’ Â—Matthew 20:22</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>There are times in your spiritual life when there is confusion, and the way out of it is not simply to say that you should not be confused. It is not a matter of right and wrong, but a matter of God taking you through a way that you temporarily do not understand. And it is only by going through the spiritual confusion that you will come to the understanding of what God wants for you.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Shrouding of His Friendship</span> (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+11:5-8" rel="nofollow">Luke 11:5-8</a> ).<br>Jesus gave the illustration here of a man who appears not to care for his friend. He was saying, in effect, that is how the heavenly Father will appear to you at times. You will think that He is an unkind friend, but remember?He is not. The time will come when everything will be explained. There seems to be a cloud on the friendship of the heart, and often even love itself has to wait in pain and tears for the blessing of fuller fellowship and oneness. When God appears to be completely shrouded, will you hang on with confidence in Him?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Shadow on His Fatherhood</span> (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+11:11-13" rel="nofollow">Luke 11:11-13</a> ).<br>Jesus said that there are times when your Father will appear as if He were an unnatural father?as if He were callous and indifferentÂ— but remember, He is not. "Everyone who asks receives . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+11:10" rel="nofollow">Luke 11:10</a> ). If all you see is a shadow on the face of the Father right now, hang on to the fact that He will ultimately give you clear understanding and will fully justify Himself in everything that He has allowed into your life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Strangeness of His Faithfulness</span> (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+18:1-8" rel="nofollow">Luke 18:1-8</a> ).<br>"When the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+18:8" rel="nofollow">Luke 18:8</a> ). Will He find the kind of faith that counts on Him in spite of the confusion? Stand firm in faith, believing that what Jesus said is true, although in the meantime you do not understand what God is doing. He has bigger issues at stake than the particular things you are asking of Him right now.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What To Renounce</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We have renounced the hidden things of shame . . . Â—2 Corinthians 4:2</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Have you "renounced the hidden things of shame" in your lifeÂ—the things that your sense of honor or pride will not allow to come into the light? You can easily hide them. Is there a thought in your heart about anyone that you would not like to be brought into the light? Then renounce it as soon as it comes to mindÂ—renounce everything in its entirety until there is no hidden dishonesty or craftiness about you at all. Envy, jealousy, and strife donÂ’t necessarily arise from your old nature of sin, but from the flesh which was used for these kinds of things in the past (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+6:19" rel="nofollow">Romans 6:19</a> and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Peter+4:1-3" rel="nofollow">1 Peter 4:1-3</a> ). You must maintain continual watchfulness so that nothing arises in your life that would cause you shame.<br><br>". . . not walking in craftiness. . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2+Corinthians+4:2" rel="nofollow">2 Corinthians 4:2</a> ). This means not resorting to something simply to make your own point. This is a terrible trap. You know that God will allow you to work in only one wayÂ—the way of truth. Then be careful never to catch people through the other wayÂ—the way of deceit. If you act deceitfully, GodÂ’s blight and ruin will be upon you. What may be craftiness for you, may not be for othersÂ—God has called you to a higher standard. Never dull your sense of being your utmost for His highestÂ—your best for His glory. For you, doing certain things would mean craftiness coming into your life for a purpose other than what is the highest and best, and it would dull the motivation that God has given you. Many people have turned back because they are afraid to look at things from GodÂ’s perspective. The greatest spiritual crisis comes when a person has to move a little farther on in his faith than the beliefs he has already accepted.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Is There Good in Temptation?</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man . . . Â—1 Corinthians 10:13</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The word temptation has come to mean something bad to us today, but we tend to use the word in the wrong way. Temptation itself is not sin; it is something we are bound to face simply by virtue of being human. Not to be tempted would mean that we were already so shameful that we would be beneath contempt. Yet many of us suffer from temptations we should never have to suffer, simply because we have refused to allow God to lift us to a higher level where we would face temptations of another kind.<br><br>A personÂ’s inner nature, what he possesses in the inner, spiritual part of his being, determines what he is tempted by on the outside. The temptation fits the true nature of the person being tempted and reveals the possibilities of his nature. Every person actually determines or sets the level of his own temptation, because temptation will come to him in accordance with the level of his controlling, inner nature.<br><br>Temptation comes to me, suggesting a possible shortcut to the realization of my highest goalÂ—it does not direct me toward what I understand to be evil, but toward what I understand to be good. Temptation is something that confuses me for a while, and I donÂ’t know whether something is right or wrong. When I yield to it, I have made lust a god, and the temptation itself becomes the proof that it was only my own fear that prevented me from falling into the sin earlier.<br><br>Temptation is not something we can escape; in fact, it is essential to the well-rounded life of a person. Beware of thinking that you are tempted as no one else--what you go through is the common inheritance of the human race, not something that no one has ever before endured. God does not save us from temptations--He sustains us in the midst of them (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+2:18" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 2:18</a> and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+4:15-16" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 4:15-16</a> ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>His Temptation and Ours</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin Â—Hebrews 4:15</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Until we are born again, the only kind of temptation we understand is the kind mentioned in James 1:14, "Each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed." But through regeneration we are lifted into another realm where there are other temptations to face, namely, the kind of temptations our Lord faced. The temptations of Jesus had no appeal to us as unbelievers because they were not at home in our human nature. Our LordÂ’s temptations and ours are in different realms until we are born again and become His brothers. The temptations of Jesus are not those of a mere man, but the temptations of God as Man. Through regeneration, the Son of God is formed in us (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Galatians+4:19" rel="nofollow">Galatians 4:19</a> ), and in our physical life He has the same setting that He had on earth. Satan does not tempt us just to make us do wrong thingsÂ—he tempts us to make us lose what God has put into us through regeneration, namely, the possibility of being of value to God. He does not come to us on the premise of tempting us to sin, but on the premise of shifting our point of view, and only the Spirit of God can detect this as a temptation of the devil.<br><br>Temptation means a test of the possessions held within the inner, spiritual part of our being by a power outside us and foreign to us. This makes the temptation of our Lord explainable. After JesusÂ’ baptism, having accepted His mission of being the One "who takes away the sin of the world" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:29" rel="nofollow">John 1:29</a> ) He "was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+4:1" rel="nofollow">Matthew 4:1</a> ) and into the testing devices of the devil. Yet He did not become weary or exhausted. He went through the temptation "without sin," and He retained all the possessions of His spiritual nature completely intact.</div>
