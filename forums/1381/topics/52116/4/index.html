Â—Galatians 2:20 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>These words mean the breaking and collapse of my independence brought about by my own hands, and the surrendering of my life to the supremacy of the Lord Jesus. No one can do this for me, I must do it myself. God may bring me up to this point three hundred and sixty-five times a year, but He cannot push me through it. It means breaking the hard outer layer of my individual independence from God, and the liberating of myself and my nature into oneness with Him; not following my own ideas, but choosing absolute loyalty to Jesus. Once I am at that point, there is no possibility of misunderstanding. Very few of us know anything about loyalty to Christ or understand what He meant when He said, ". . . for My sake" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+5:11" rel="nofollow">Matthew 5:11</a> ). That is what makes a strong saint.<br><br>Has that breaking of my independence come? All the rest is religious fraud. The one point to decide isÂ—will I give up? Will I surrender to Jesus Christ, placing no conditions whatsoever as to how the brokenness will come? I must be broken from my own understanding of myself. When I reach that point, immediately the reality of the supernatural identification with Jesus Christ takes place. And the witness of the Spirit of God is unmistakableÂ— "I have been crucified with Christ . . . ."<br><br>The passion of Christianity comes from deliberately signing away my own rights and becoming a bondservant of Jesus Christ. Until I do that, I will not begin to be a saint.<br><br>One student a year who hears GodÂ’s call would be sufficient for God to have called the Bible Training College into existence. This college has no value as an organization, not even academically. Its sole value for existence is for God to help Himself to lives. Will we allow Him to help Himself to us, or are we more concerned with our own ideas of what we are going to be?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Authority of Truth</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Draw near to God and He will draw near to you Â—James 4:8</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It is essential that you give people the opportunity to act on the truth of God. The responsibility must be left with the individualÂ—you cannot act for him. It must be his own deliberate act, but the evangelical message should always lead him to action. Refusing to act leaves a person paralyzed, exactly where he was previously. But once he acts, he is never the same. It is the apparent folly of the truth that stands in the way of hundreds who have been convicted by the Spirit of God. Once I press myself into action, I immediately begin to live. Anything less is merely existing. The moments I truly live are the moments when I act with my entire will.<br><br>When a truth of God is brought home to your soul, never allow it to pass without acting on it internally in your will, not necessarily externally in your physical life. Record it with ink and with bloodÂ—work it into your life. The weakest saint who transacts business with Jesus Christ is liberated the second he acts and GodÂ’s almighty power is available on his behalf. We come up to the truth of God, confess we are wrong, but go back again. Then we approach it again and turn back, until we finally learn we have no business going back. When we are confronted with such a word of truth from our redeeming Lord, we must move directly to transact business with Him. "Come to Me . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+11:28" rel="nofollow">Matthew 11:28</a> ). His word come means "to act." Yet the last thing we want to do is come. But everyone who does come knows that, at that very moment, the supernatural power of the life of God invades him. The dominating power of the world, the flesh, and the devil is now paralyzed; not by your act, but because your act has joined you to God and tapped you in to His redemptive power.</div>

Â—1 Peter 4:13 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>If you are going to be used by God, He will take you through a number of experiences that are not meant for you personally at all. They are designed to make you useful in His hands, and to enable you to understand what takes place in the lives of others. Because of this process, you will never be surprised by what comes your way. You say, "Oh, I canÂ’t deal with that person." Why canÂ’t you? God gave you sufficient opportunities to learn from Him about that problem; but you turned away, not heeding the lesson, because it seemed foolish to spend your time that way.<br><br>The sufferings of Christ were not those of ordinary people. He suffered "according to the will of God" ( <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost-devo/display.php?vid=466&amp;verse=1%20Peter+4:19" rel="nofollow">1 Peter 4:19</a> ), having a different point of view of suffering from ours. It is only through our relationship with Jesus Christ that we can understand what God is after in His dealings with us. When it comes to suffering, it is part of our Christian culture to want to know GodÂ’s purpose beforehand. In the history of the Christian church, the tendency has been to avoid being identified with the sufferings of Jesus Christ. People have sought to carry out GodÂ’s orders through a shortcut of their own. GodÂ’s way is always the way of sufferingÂ—the way of the "long road home."<br><br>Are we partakers of ChristÂ’s sufferings? Are we prepared for God to stamp out our personal ambitions? Are we prepared for God to destroy our individual decisions by supernaturally transforming them? It will mean not knowing why God is taking us that way, because knowing would make us spiritually proud. We never realize at the time what God is putting us throughÂ—we go through it more or less without understanding. Then suddenly we come to a place of enlightenment, and realizeÂ—"God has strengthened me and I didnÂ’t even know it!"</div>

Â—John 11:26</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Martha believed in the power available to Jesus Christ; she believed that if He had been there He could have healed her brother; she also believed that Jesus had a special intimacy with God, and that whatever He asked of God, God would do. ButÂ—she needed a closer personal intimacy with Jesus. MarthaÂ’s theology had its fulfillment in the future. But Jesus continued to attract and draw her in until her belief became an intimate possession. It then slowly emerged into a personal inheritanceÂ—"Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+11:27" rel="nofollow">John 11:27</a> ).<br><br>Is the Lord dealing with you in the same way? Is Jesus teaching you to have a personal intimacy with Himself? Allow Him to drive His question home to youÂ—"Do you believe this?" Are you facing an area of doubt in your life? Have you come, like Martha, to a crossroads of overwhelming circumstances where your theology is about to become a very personal belief? This happens only when a personal problem brings the awareness of our personal need.<br><br>To believe is to commit. In the area of intellectual learning I commit myself mentally, and reject anything not related to that belief. In the realm of personal belief I commit myself morally to my convictions and refuse to compromise. But in intimate personal belief I commit myself spiritually to Jesus Christ and make a determination to be dominated by Him alone.<br><br>Then, when I stand face to face with Jesus Christ and He says to me, "Do you believe this?" I find that faith is as natural as breathing. And I am staggered when I think how foolish I have been in not trusting Him earlier</div>

Â—Romans 8:28 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The circumstances of a saintÂ’s life are ordained of God. In the life of a saint there is no such thing as chance. God by His providence brings you into circumstances that you canÂ’t understand at all, but the Spirit of God understands. God brings you to places, among people, and into certain conditions to accomplish a definite purpose through the intercession of the Spirit in you. Never put yourself in front of your circumstances and say, "IÂ’m going to be my own providence here; I will watch this closely, or protect myself from that." All your circumstances are in the hand of God, and therefore you donÂ’t ever have to think they are unnatural or unique. Your part in intercessory prayer is not to agonize over how to intercede, but to use the everyday circumstances and people God puts around you by His providence to bring them before His throne, and to allow the Spirit in you the opportunity to intercede for them. In this way God is going to touch the whole world with His saints.<br><br>Am I making the Holy SpiritÂ’s work difficult by being vague and unsure, or by trying to do His work for Him? I must do the human side of intercessionÂ—utilizing the circumstances in which I find myself and the people who surround me. I must keep my conscious life as a sacred place for the Holy Spirit. Then as I lift different ones to God through prayer, the Holy Spirit intercedes for them.<br><br>Your intercessions can never be mine, and my intercessions can never be yours, ". . . but the Spirit Himself makes intercession" in each of our lives ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+8:26" rel="nofollow">Romans 8:26</a> ). And without that intercession, the lives of others would be left in poverty and in ruin.</div>

It is incredible how we debate! We know something is right, but we try to find excuses for not doing it immediately. If we are to climb to the height God reveals, it can never be done laterÂ—it must be done now. And the sacrifice must be worked through our will before we actually perform it.<br><br>"So Abraham rose early in the morning . . . and went to the place of which God had told him" ( <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost-devo/display.php?vid=271&amp;verse=Genesis+22:2" rel="nofollow">Genesis 22:3</a> ). Oh, the wonderful simplicity of Abraham! When God spoke, he did not "confer with flesh and blood" ( <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost-devo/display.php?vid=86&amp;verse=Galatians+1:16" rel="nofollow">Galatians 1:16</a> ). Beware when you want to "confer with flesh and blood" or even your own thoughts, insights, or understandingsÂ—anything that is not based on your personal relationship with God. These are all things that compete with and hinder obedience to God.<br><br>Abraham did not choose what the sacrifice would be. Always guard against self-chosen service for God. Self-sacrifice may be a disease that impairs your service. If God has made your cup sweet, drink it with grace; or even if He has made it bitter, drink it in communion with Him. If the providential will of God means a hard and difficult time for you, go through it. But never decide the place of your own martyrdom, as if to say, "I will only go to there, but no farther." God chose the test for Abraham, and Abraham neither delayed nor protested, but steadily obeyed. If you are not living in touch with God, it is easy to blame Him or pass judgment on Him. You must go through the trial before you have any right to pronounce a verdict, because by going through the trial you learn to know God better. God is working in us to reach His highest goals until His purpose and our purpose become one.</div>

Â—John 16:8 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Very few of us know anything about conviction of sin. We know the experience of being disturbed because we have done wrong things. But conviction of sin by the Holy Spirit blots out every relationship on earth and makes us aware of only oneÂ—"Against You, You only, have I sinned . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Psalm+51:4" rel="nofollow">Psalm 51:4</a> ). When a person is convicted of sin in this way, he knows with every bit of his conscience that God would not dare to forgive him. If God did forgive him, then this person would have a stronger sense of justice than God. God does forgive, but it cost the breaking of His heart with grief in the death of Christ to enable Him to do so. The great miracle of the grace of God is that He forgives sin, and it is the death of Jesus Christ alone that enables the divine nature to forgive and to remain true to itself in doing so. It is shallow nonsense to say that God forgives us because He is love. Once we have been convicted of sin, we will never say this again. The love of God means CalvaryÂ—nothing less! The love of God is spelled out on the Cross and nowhere else. The only basis for which God can forgive me is the Cross of Christ. It is there that His conscience is satisfied.<br><br>Forgiveness doesnÂ’t merely mean that I am saved from hell and have been made ready for heaven (no one would accept forgiveness on that level). Forgiveness means that I am forgiven into a newly created relationship which identifies me with God in Christ. The miracle of redemption is that God turns me, the unholy one, into the standard of Himself, the Holy One. He does this by putting into me a new nature, the nature of Jesus Christ.</div>

Â—Ephesians 1:7</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Beware of the pleasant view of the fatherhood of God: God is so kind and loving that of course He will forgive us. That thought, based solely on emotion, cannot be found anywhere in the New Testament. The only basis on which God can forgive us is the tremendous tragedy of the Cross of Christ. To base our forgiveness on any other ground is unconscious blasphemy. The only ground on which God can forgive our sin and reinstate us to His favor is through the Cross of Christ. There is no other way! Forgiveness, which is so easy for us to accept, cost the agony at Calvary. We should never take the forgiveness of sin, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and our sanctification in simple faith, and then forget the enormous cost to God that made all of this ours.<br><br>Forgiveness is the divine miracle of grace. The cost to God was the Cross of Christ. To forgive sin, while remaining a holy God, this price had to be paid. Never accept a view of the fatherhood of God if it blots out the atonement. The revealed truth of God is that without the atonement He cannot forgiveÂ—He would contradict His nature if He did. The only way we can be forgiven is by being brought back to God through the atonement of the Cross. GodÂ’s forgiveness is possible only in the supernatural realm.<br><br>Compared with the miracle of the forgiveness of sin, the experience of sanctification is small. Sanctification is simply the wonderful expression or evidence of the forgiveness of sins in a human life. But the thing that awakens the deepest fountain of gratitude in a human being is that God has forgiven his sin. Paul never got away from this. Once you realize all that it cost God to forgive you, you will be held as in a vise, constrained by the love of God.</div>

Â—Romans 3:24 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The gospel of the grace of God awakens an intense longing in human souls and an equally intense resentment, because the truth that it reveals is not palatable or easy to swallow. There is a certain pride in people that causes them to give and give, but to come and accept a gift is another thing. I will give my life to martyrdom; I will dedicate my life to serviceÂ—I will do anything. But do not humiliate me to the level of the most hell-deserving sinner and tell me that all I have to do is accept the gift of salvation through Jesus Christ.<br><br>We have to realize that we cannot earn or win anything from God through our own efforts. We must either receive it as a gift or do without it. The greatest spiritual blessing we receive is when we come to the knowledge that we are destitute. Until we get there, our Lord is powerless. He can do nothing for us as long as we think we are sufficient in and of ourselves. We must enter into His kingdom through the door of destitution. As long as we are "rich," particularly in the area of pride or independence, God can do nothing for us. It is only when we get hungry spiritually that we receive the Holy Spirit. The gift of the essential nature of God is placed and made effective in us by the Holy Spirit. He imparts to us the quickening life of Jesus, making us truly alive. He takes that which was "beyond" us and places it "within" us. And immediately, once "the beyond" has come "within," it rises up to "the above," and we are lifted into the kingdom where Jesus lives and reigns (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+3:5" rel="nofollow">John 3:5</a> ).<br></div>

If it was GodÂ’s will to bruise His own Son ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Isaiah+53:10" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 53:10</a> ), why shouldnÂ’t He bruise you? What shines forth and reveals God in your life is not your relative consistency to an idea of what a saint should be, but your genuine, living relationship with Jesus Christ, and your unrestrained devotion to Him whether you are well or sick.<br><br>Christian perfection is not, and never can be, human perfection. Christian perfection is the perfection of a relationship with God that shows itself to be true even amid the seemingly unimportant aspects of human life. When you obey the call of Jesus Christ, the first thing that hits you is the pointlessness of the things you have to do. The next thought that strikes you is that other people seem to be living perfectly consistent lives. Such lives may leave you with the idea that God is unnecessaryÂ—that through your own human effort and devotion you can attain GodÂ’s standard for your life. In a fallen world this can never be done. I am called to live in such a perfect relationship with God that my life produces a yearning for God in the lives of others, not admiration for myself. Thoughts about myself hinder my usefulness to God. GodÂ’s purpose is not to perfect me to make me a trophy in His showcase; He is getting me to the place where He can use me. Let Him do what He wants.</div>

Let not your heart be troubled . . .<br>Â— <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost-devo/display.php?vid=501&amp;verse=John+14:27" rel="nofollow">John 14:27</a> </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Whenever we experience something difficult in our personal life, we are tempted to blame God. But we are the ones in the wrong, not God. Blaming God is evidence that we are refusing to let go of some disobedience somewhere in our lives. But as soon as we let go, everything becomes as clear as daylight to us. As long as we try to serve two masters, ourselves and God, there will be difficulties combined with doubt and confusion. Our attitude must be one of complete reliance on God. Once we get to that point, there is nothing easier than living the life of a saint. We encounter difficulties when we try to usurp the authority of the Holy Spirit for our own purposes.<br><br>GodÂ’s mark of approval, whenever you obey Him, is peace. He sends an immeasurable, deep peace; not a natural peace, "as the world gives," but the peace of Jesus. Whenever peace does not come, wait until it does, or seek to find out why it is not coming. If you are acting on your own impulse, or out of a sense of the heroic, to be seen by others, the peace of Jesus will not exhibit itself. This shows no unity with God or confidence in Him. The spirit of simplicity, clarity, and unity is born through the Holy Spirit, not through your decisions. God counters our self-willed decisions with an appeal for simplicity and unity.<br><br>My questions arise whenever I cease to obey. When I do obey God, problems come, not between me and God, but as a means to keep my mind examining with amazement the revealed truth of God. But any problem that comes between God and myself is the result of disobedience. Any problem that comes while I obey God (and there will be many), increases my overjoyed delight, because I know that my Father knows and cares, and I can watch and anticipate how He will unravel my problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Through JesusÂ’ Eyes<br><br>In John GrishamÂ’s popular novel A Painted House, he detailed the lives of three groups of people who were despised by many: Mexicans, backwoods hill people, and those who leased land to grow cotton. Prejudice and hatred ran high. Violence erupted. Terrible things were seen and done. Yet Grisham showed as well the kindness and integrity the people of each group were capable of.<br><br>Jesus has given us an enormous responsibility as Â“ministers of reconciliationÂ” (2 Corinthians 5:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. It is both awesome and serious because of its great privilege: God has entrusted us with the task of coming alongside lost people and telling them that they can be made right with God. We can whisper to their hearts that God loves themÂ—enough to send His Son to die for them.<br><br>For us to achieve this task of ministry we must look at everyone through the eyes of Jesus. We must see people as He did. When He looked at the often-married woman of Samaria, He saw her as a person who needed the unfailing love of God. We must see them not only as they are, but as they could be. When Jesus looked at the cheating Zacchaeus, He saw him as someone whose heart would be transformed by the love of God. When He looked at the adulterous woman dragged before Him, He saw a self-despising, desperate person who needed the deliverance and respect that only God can give.<br><br>We canÂ’t be ambassadors of GodÂ’s reconciliation if we paste labels on the foreheads of those who need Him. Followers of Jesus are people who look past the appearance and the history to see a person God loves, a person for whom Jesus died, a person He can transform, a person who can one day share heaven with us.<br><br>We can do that only when we look at people through the eyes of Jesus.

Even though your mind and soul may be thrilled by it, if you donÂ’t "walk in the light" of it you will sink to a level of bondage never envisioned by our Lord. Mentally disobeying the "heavenly vision" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Acts+26:19" rel="nofollow">Acts 26:19</a> ) will make you a slave to ideas and views that are completely foreign to Jesus Christ. DonÂ’t look at someone else and say, "Well, if he can have those views and prosper, why canÂ’t I?" You have to "walk in the light" of the vision that has been given to you. DonÂ’t compare yourself with others or judge themÂ—that is between God and them. When you find that one of your favorite and strongly held views clashes with the "heavenly vision," do not begin to debate it. If you do, a sense of property and personal right will emerge in youÂ— things on which Jesus placed no value. He was against these things as being the root of everything foreign to HimselfÂ—". . . for oneÂ’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+12:15" rel="nofollow">Luke 12:15</a> ). If we donÂ’t see and understand this, it is because we are ignoring the underlying principles of our LordÂ’s teaching.<br><br>Our tendency is to lie back and bask in the memory of the wonderful experience we had when God revealed His will to us. But if a New Testament standard is revealed to us by the light of God, and we donÂ’t try to measure up, or even feel inclined to do so, then we begin to backslide. It means your conscience does not respond to the truth. You can never be the same after the unveiling of a truth. That moment marks you as one who either continues on with even more devotion as a disciple of Jesus Christ, or as one who turns to go back as a deserter.</div>

Yet the last person we get intimate with is Jesus. Before Pentecost the disciples knew Jesus as the One who gave them power to conquer demons and to bring about a revival (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+10:18-20" rel="nofollow">Luke 10:18-20</a> ). It was a wonderful intimacy, but there was a much closer intimacy to come: ". . . I have called you friends . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+15:15" rel="nofollow">John 15:15</a> ). True friendship is rare on earth. It means identifying with someone in thought, heart, and spirit. The whole experience of life is designed to enable us to enter into this closest relationship with Jesus Christ. We receive His blessings and know His Word, but do we really know Him?<br><br>Jesus said, "It is to your advantage that I go away . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+16:7" rel="nofollow">John 16:7</a> ). He left that relationship to lead them even closer. It is a joy to Jesus when a disciple takes time to walk more intimately with Him. The bearing of fruit is always shown in Scripture to be the visible result of an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+15:1-4" rel="nofollow">John 15:1-4</a> ).<br><br>Once we get intimate with Jesus we are never lonely and we never lack for understanding or compassion. We can continually pour out our hearts to Him without being perceived as overly emotional or pitiful. The Christian who is truly intimate with Jesus will never draw attention to himself but will only show the evidence of a life where Jesus is completely in control. This is the outcome of allowing Jesus to satisfy every area of life to its depth. The picture resulting from such a life is that of the strong, calm balance that our Lord gives to those who are intimate with Him.</div>

What God wants is the sacrifice through death which enables us to do what Jesus did, that is, sacrifice our lives. NotÂ—"Lord, I am ready to go with You . . . to death" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+22:33" rel="nofollow">Luke 22:33 </a>). ButÂ—"I am willing to be identified with Your death so that I may sacrifice my life to God."<br><br>We seem to think that God wants us to give up things! God purified Abraham from this error, and the same process is at work in our lives. God never tells us to give up things just for the sake of giving them up, but He tells us to give them up for the sake of the only thing worth having, namely, life with Himself. It is a matter of loosening the bands that hold back our lives. Those bands are loosened immediately by identification with the death of Jesus. Then we enter into a relationship with God whereby we may sacrifice our lives to Him.<br><br>It is of no value to God to give Him your life for death. He wants you to be a "living sacrifice"Â—to let Him have all your strengths that have been saved and sanctified through Jesus (<a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost-devo/display.php?vid=27&amp;verse=Romans+12:1" rel="nofollow">Romans 12:1</a>).

The sense of having done something irreversible tends to make us despair. We say, "Well, itÂ’s all over and ruined now; whatÂ’s the point in trying anymore." If we think this kind of despair is an exception, we are mistaken. It is a very ordinary human experience. Whenever we realize we have not taken advantage of a magnificent opportunity, we are apt to sink into despair. But Jesus comes and lovingly says to us, in essence, "Sleep on now. That opportunity is lost forever and you canÂ’t change that. But get up, and letÂ’s go on to the next thing." In other words, let the past sleep, but let it sleep in the sweet embrace of Christ, and let us go on into the invincible future with Him.<br><br>There will be experiences like this in each of our lives. We will have times of despair caused by real events in our lives, and we will be unable to lift ourselves out of them. The disciples, in this instance, had done a downright unthinkable thingÂ—they had gone to sleep instead of watching with Jesus. But our Lord came to them taking the spiritual initiative against their despair and said, in effect, "Get up, and do the next thing." If we are inspired by God, what is the next thing? It is to trust Him absolutely and to pray on the basis of His redemption.<br><br>Never let the sense of past failure defeat your next step.</div>

There is no point in waiting for God to help usÂ—He will not. But once we arise, immediately we find He is there. Whenever God gives us His inspiration, suddenly taking the initiative becomes a moral issueÂ—a matter of obedience. Then we must act to be obedient and not continue to lie down doing nothing. If we will arise and shine, drudgery will be divinely transformed.<br><br>Drudgery is one of the finest tests to determine the genuineness of our character. Drudgery is work that is far removed from anything we think of as ideal work. It is the utterly hard, menial, tiresome, and dirty work. And when we experience it, our spirituality is instantly tested and we will know whether or not we are spiritually genuine. Read John 13. In this chapter, we see the Incarnate God performing the greatest example of drudgeryÂ—washing fishermenÂ’s feet. He then says to them, "If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one anotherÂ’s feet" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+13:14" rel="nofollow">John 13:14</a> ). The inspiration of God is required if drudgery is to shine with the light of God upon it. In some cases the way a person does a task makes that work sanctified and holy forever. It may be a very common everyday task, but after we have seen it done, it becomes different. When the Lord does something through us, He always transforms it. Our Lord takes our human flesh and transforms it, and now every believerÂ’s body has become "the temple of the Holy Spirit"</div>

In this passage, after having said these wonderful things to His disciples, we might have expected our Lord to tell them to go away and meditate over them all. But Jesus never allowed idle daydreaming. When our purpose is to seek God and to discover His will for us, daydreaming is right and acceptable. But when our inclination is to spend time daydreaming over what we have already been told to do, it is unacceptable and GodÂ’s blessing is never on it. God will take the initiative against this kind of daydreaming by prodding us to action. His instructions to us will be along the lines of this: "DonÂ’t sit or stand there, just go!"<br><br>If we are quietly waiting before God after He has said to us, "Come aside by yourselves . . ." then that is meditation before Him to seek His will ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Mark+6:31" rel="nofollow">Mark 6:31</a> ). Beware, however, of giving in to mere daydreaming once God has spoken. Allow Him to be the source of all your dreams, joys, and delights, and be careful to go and obey what He has said. If you are in love with someone, you donÂ’t sit and daydream about that person all the timeÂ—you go and do something for him. That is what Jesus Christ expects us to do. Daydreaming after God has spoken is an indication that we do not trust Him.</div>

If we have the idea that love is characterized as cautious, wise, sensible, shrewd, and never taken to extremes, we have missed the true meaning. This may describe affection and it may bring us a warm feeling, but it is not a true and accurate description of love.<br><br>Have you ever been driven to do something for God not because you felt that it was useful or your duty to do so, or that there was anything in it for you, but simply because you love Him? Have you ever realized that you can give things to God that are of value to Him? Or are you just sitting around daydreaming about the greatness of His redemption, while neglecting all the things you could be doing for Him? IÂ’m not referring to works which could be regarded as divine and miraculous, but ordinary, simple human thingsÂ— things which would be evidence to God that you are totally surrendered to Him. Have you ever created what Mary of Bethany created in the heart of the Lord Jesus? "She has done a good work for Me."<br><br>There are times when it seems as if God watches to see if we will give Him even small gifts of surrender, just to show how genuine our love is for Him. To be surrendered to God is of more value than our personal holiness. Concern over our personal holiness causes us to focus our eyes on ourselves, and we become overly concerned about the way we walk and talk and look, out of fear of offending God. ". . . but perfect love casts out fear . . ." once we are surrendered to God ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+John+4:18" rel="nofollow">1 John 4:18</a> ). We should quit asking ourselves, "Am I of any use?" and accept the truth that we really are not of much use to Him. The issue is never of being of use, but of being of value to God Himself. Once we are totally surrendered to God, He will work through us all the time.</div>

It is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen. Perseverance means more than just hanging on, which may be only exposing our fear of letting go and falling. Perseverance is our supreme effort of refusing to believe that our hero is going to be conquered. Our greatest fear is not that we will be damned, but that somehow Jesus Christ will be defeated. Also, our fear is that the very things our Lord stood forÂ—love, justice, forgiveness, and kindness among menÂ—will not win out in the end and will represent an unattainable goal for us. Then there is the call to spiritual perseverance. A call not to hang on and do nothing, but to work deliberately, knowing with certainty that God will never be defeated.<br><br>If our hopes seem to be experiencing disappointment right now, it simply means that they are being purified. Every hope or dream of the human mind will be fulfilled if it is noble and of God. But one of the greatest stresses in life is the stress of waiting for God.

We somehow have the idea that a person called to the ministry is called to be different and above other people. But according to Jesus Christ, he is called to be a "doormat" for othersÂ— called to be their spiritual leader, but never their superior. Paul said, "I know how to be abased . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Philippians+4:12" rel="nofollow">Philippians 4:12</a> ). PaulÂ’s idea of service was to pour his life out to the last drop for others. And whether he received praise or blame made no difference. As long as there was one human being who did not know Jesus, Paul felt a debt of service to that person until he did come to know Him. But the chief motivation behind PaulÂ’s service was not love for others but love for his Lord. If our devotion is to the cause of humanity, we will be quickly defeated and broken-hearted, since we will often be confronted with a great deal of ingratitude from other people. But if we are motivated by our love for God, no amount of ingratitude will be able to hinder us from serving one another.<br><br>PaulÂ’s understanding of how Christ had dealt with him is the secret behind his determination to serve others. "I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Timothy+1:13" rel="nofollow">1 Timothy 1:13</a> ). In other words, no matter how badly others may have treated Paul, they could never have treated him with the same degree of spite and hatred with which he had treated Jesus Christ. Once we realize that Jesus has served us even to the depths of our meagerness, our selfishness, and our sin, nothing we encounter from others will be able to exhaust our determination to serve others for His sake.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Delight of Sacrifice</strong><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls . . .<br>Â—2 Corinthians 12:15</span><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>Once "the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit," we deliberately begin to identify ourselves with Jesus ChristÂ’s interests and purposes in othersÂ’ lives ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+5:5" rel="nofollow">Romans 5:5</a> ). And Jesus has an interest in every individual person. We have no right in Christian service to be guided by our own interests and desires. In fact, this is one of the greatest tests of our relationship with Jesus Christ. The delight of sacrifice is that I lay down my life for my Friend, Jesus (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+15:13" rel="nofollow">John 15:13</a> ). I donÂ’t throw my life away, but I willingly and deliberately lay it down for Him and His interests in other people. And I do this for no cause or purpose of my own. Paul spent his life for only one purposeÂ—that he might win people to Jesus Christ. Paul always attracted people to his Lord, but never to himself. He said, "I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Corinthians+9:22" rel="nofollow">1 Corinthians 9:22</a> ).<br><br>When someone thinks that to develop a holy life he must always be alone with God, he is no longer of any use to others. This is like putting himself on a pedestal and isolating himself from the rest of society. Paul was a holy person, but wherever he went Jesus Christ was always allowed to help Himself to his life. Many of us are interested only in our own goals, and Jesus cannot help Himself to our lives. But if we are totally surrendered to Him, we have no goals of our own to serve. Paul said that he knew how to be a "doormat" without resenting it, because the motivation of his life was devotion to Jesus. We tend to be devoted, not to Jesus Christ, but to the things which allow us more spiritual freedom than total surrender to Him would allow. Freedom was not PaulÂ’s motive at all. In fact, he stated, "I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+9:3" rel="nofollow">Romans 9:3</a> ). Had Paul lost his ability to reason? Not at all! For someone who is in love, this is not an overstatement. And Paul was in love with Jesus Christ.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Destitution of Service</strong><br><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">. . . though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved<br>Â—2 Corinthians 12:15</span><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>Natural human love expects something in return. But Paul is saying, "It doesnÂ’t really matter to me whether you love me or not. I am willing to be completely destitute anyway; willing to be poverty-stricken, not just for your sakes, but also that I may be able to get you to God." "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2+Corinthians+8:9" rel="nofollow">2 Corinthians 8:9</a> ). And PaulÂ’s idea of service was the same as our LordÂ’s. He did not care how high the cost was to himselfÂ—he would gladly pay it. It was a joyful thing to Paul.<br><br>The institutional churchÂ’s idea of a servant of God is not at all like Jesus ChristÂ’s idea. His idea is that we serve Him by being the servants of others. Jesus Christ actually "out-socialized" the socialists. He said that in His kingdom the greatest one would be the servant of all (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+23:11" rel="nofollow">Matthew 23:11</a> ). The real test of a saint is not oneÂ’s willingness to preach the gospel, but oneÂ’s willingness to do something like washing the disciplesÂ’ feetÂ—that is, being willing to do those things that seem unimportant in human estimation but count as everything to God. It was PaulÂ’s delight to spend his life for GodÂ’s interests in other people, and he did not care what it cost. But before we will serve, we stop to ponder our personal and financial concernsÂ—"What if God wants me to go over there? And what about my salary? What is the climate like there? Who will take care of me? A person must consider all these things." All that is an indication that we have reservations about serving God. But the apostle Paul had no conditions or reservations. Paul focused his life on Jesus ChristÂ’s idea of a New Testament saint; that is, not one who merely proclaims the gospel, but one who becomes broken bread and poured-out wine in the hands of Jesus Christ for the sake of others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Have You Felt the Pain Inflicted by the Lord?</strong><br><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">He said to him the third time, Â’. . . do you love Me?Â’<br>Â—John 21:17</span><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>Have you ever felt the pain, inflicted by the Lord, at the very center of your being, deep down in the most sensitive area of your life? The devil never inflicts pain there, and neither can sin nor human emotions. Nothing can cut through to that part of our being but the Word of God. "Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, Â’Do you love Me?Â’ " Yet he was awakened to the fact that at the center of his personal life he was devoted to Jesus. And then he began to see what JesusÂ’ patient questioning meant. There was not the slightest bit of doubt left in PeterÂ’s mind; he could never be deceived again. And there was no need for an impassioned response; no need for immediate action or an emotional display. It was a revelation to him to realize how much he did love the Lord, and with amazement he simply said, "Lord, You know all things . . . ." Peter began to see how very much he did love Jesus, and there was no need to say, "Look at this or that as proof of my love." Peter was beginning to discover within himself just how much he really did love the Lord. He discovered that his eyes were so fixed on Jesus Christ that he saw no one else in heaven above or on the earth below. But he did not know it until the probing, hurting questions of the Lord were asked. The LordÂ’s questions always reveal the true me to myself.<br><br>Oh, the wonder of the patient directness and skill of Jesus Christ with Peter! Our Lord never asks questions until the perfect time. Rarely, but probably once in each of our lives, He will back us into a corner where He will hurt us with His piercing questions. Then we will realize that we do love Him far more deeply than our words can ever say.</div>
