            <div class='col-md body'><strong>His Commission to Us</strong><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Feed My sheep<br>Â—John 21:17</span><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This is love in the making. The love of God is not createdÂ—it is His nature. When we receive the life of Christ through the Holy Spirit, He unites us with God so that His love is demonstrated in us. The goal of the indwelling Holy Spirit is not just to unite us with God, but to do it in such a way that we will be one with the Father in exactly the same way Jesus was. And what kind of oneness did Jesus Christ have with the Father? He had such a oneness with the Father that He was obedient when His Father sent Him down here to be poured out for us. And He says to us, "As the Father has sent Me, I also send you" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+20:21" rel="nofollow">John 20:21</a> ).<br><br>Peter now realizes that he does love Him, due to the revelation that came with the LordÂ’s piercing question. The LordÂ’s next point isÂ—"Pour yourself out. DonÂ’t testify about how much you love Me and donÂ’t talk about the wonderful revelation you have had, just Â’Feed My sheep.Â’ " Jesus has some extraordinarily peculiar sheep: some that are unkempt and dirty, some that are awkward or pushy, and some that have gone astray! But it is impossible to exhaust GodÂ’s love, and it is impossible to exhaust my love if it flows from the Spirit of God within me. The love of God pays no attention to my prejudices caused by my natural individuality. If I love my Lord, I have no business being guided by natural emotionsÂ—I have to feed His sheep. We will not be delivered or released from His commission to us. Beware of counterfeiting the love of God by following your own natural human emotions, sympathies, or understandings. That will only serve to revile and abuse the true love of God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Is This True of Me?</strong><br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">None of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself . . .<br>Â—Acts 20:24</span><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It is easier to serve or work for God without a vision and without a call, because then you are not bothered by what He requires. Common sense, covered with a layer of Christian emotion, becomes your guide. You may be more prosperous and successful from the worldÂ’s perspective, and will have more leisure time, if you never acknowledge the call of God. But once you receive a commission from Jesus Christ, the memory of what God asks of you will always be there to prod you on to do His will. You will no longer be able to work for Him on the basis of common sense.<br><br>What do I count in my life as "dear to myself"? If I have not been seized by Jesus Christ and have not surrendered myself to Him, I will consider the time I decide to give God and my own ideas of service as dear. I will also consider my own life as "dear to myself." But Paul said he considered his life dear so that he might fulfill the ministry he had received, and he refused to use his energy on anything else. This verse shows an almost noble annoyance by Paul at being asked to consider himself. He was absolutely indifferent to any consideration other than that of fulfilling the ministry he had received. Our ordinary and reasonable service to God may actually compete against our total surrender to Him. Our reasonable work is based on the following argument which we say to ourselves, "Remember how useful you are here, and think how much value you would be in that particular type of work." That attitude chooses our own judgment, instead of Jesus Christ, to be our guide as to where we should go and where we could be used the most. Never consider whether or not you are of useÂ—but always consider that "you are not your own" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Corinthians+6:19" rel="nofollow">1 Corinthians 6:19</a> ). You are His.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Source of Abundant Joy</strong><br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us<br>Â—Romans 8:37</span><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Paul was speaking here of the things that might seem likely to separate a saint from the love of God. But the remarkable thing is that nothing can come between the love of God and a saint. The things Paul mentioned in this passage can and do disrupt the close fellowship of our soul with God and separate our natural life from Him. But none of them is able to come between the love of God and the soul of a saint on the spiritual level. The underlying foundation of the Christian faith is the undeserved, limitless miracle of the love of God that was exhibited on the Cross of Calvary; a love that is not earned and can never be. Paul said this is the reason that "in all these things we are more than conquerors." We are super-victors with a joy that comes from experiencing the very things which look as if they are going to overwhelm us.<br><br>Huge waves that would frighten an ordinary swimmer produce a tremendous thrill for the surfer who has ridden them. LetÂ’s apply that to our own circumstances. The things we try to avoid and fight againstÂ—tribulation, suffering, and persecutionÂ—are the very things that produce abundant joy in us. "We are more than conquerors through Him" "in all these things"; not in spite of them, but in the midst of them. A saint doesnÂ’t know the joy of the Lord in spite of tribulation, but because of it. Paul said, "I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+8:39" rel="nofollow">2 Corinthians 7:4</a> ).<br><br>The undiminished radiance, which is the result of abundant joy, is not built on anything passing, but on the love of God that nothing can change. And the experiences of life, whether they are everyday events or terrifying ones, are powerless to "separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+8:39" rel="nofollow">Romans 8:39</a> ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Surrendered Life</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">I have been crucified with Christ . . .<br>Â—Galatians 2:20</span><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br>To become one with Jesus Christ, a person must be willing not only to give up sin, but also to surrender his whole way of looking at things. Being born again by the Spirit of God means that we must first be willing to let go before we can grasp something else. The first thing we must surrender is all of our pretense or deceit. What our Lord wants us to present to Him is not our goodness, honesty, or our efforts to do better, but real solid sin. Actually, that is all He can take from us. And what He gives us in exchange for our sin is real solid righteousness. But we must surrender all pretense that we are anything, and give up all our claims of even being worthy of GodÂ’s consideration.<br><br>Once we have done that, the Spirit of God will show us what we need to surrender next. Along each step of this process, we will have to give up our claims to our rights to ourselves. Are we willing to surrender our grasp on all that we possess, our desires, and everything else in our lives? Are we ready to be identified with the death of Jesus Christ?<br><br>We will suffer a sharp painful disillusionment before we fully surrender. When people really see themselves as the Lord sees them, it is not the terribly offensive sins of the flesh that shock them, but the awful nature of the pride of their own hearts opposing Jesus Christ. When they see themselves in the light of the Lord, the shame, horror, and desperate conviction hit home for them.<br><br>If you are faced with the question of whether or not to surrender, make a determination to go on through the crisis, surrendering all that you have and all that you are to Him. And God will then equip you to do all that He requires of you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Turning Back or Walking with Jesus?</strong><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Do you also want to go away?<br>Â—John 6:67</span><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>What a penetrating question! Our LordÂ’s words often hit home for us when He speaks in the simplest way. In spite of the fact that we know who Jesus is, He asks, "Do you also want to go away?" We must continually maintain an adventurous attitude toward Him, despite any potential personal risk.<br><br>"From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+6:66" rel="nofollow">John 6:66</a> ). They turned back from walking with Jesus; not into sin, but away from Him. Many people today are pouring their lives out and working for Jesus Christ, but are not really walking with Him. One thing God constantly requires of us is a oneness with Jesus Christ. After being set apart through sanctification, we should discipline our lives spiritually to maintain this intimate oneness. When God gives you a clear determination of His will for you, all your striving to maintain that relationship by some particular method is completely unnecessary. All that is required is to live a natural life of absolute dependence on Jesus Christ. Never try to live your life with God in any other way than His way. And His way means absolute devotion to Him. Showing no concern for the uncertainties that lie ahead is the secret of walking with Jesus.<br><br>Peter saw in Jesus only someone who could minister salvation to him and to the world. But our Lord wants us to be fellow laborers with Him.<br><br>In <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+6:70" rel="nofollow">John 6:70</a> Jesus lovingly reminded Peter that he was chosen to go with Him. And each of us must answer this question for ourselves and no one else: "Do you also want to go away?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Being an Example of His Message</strong><br><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Preach the word!<br>Â—2 Timothy 4:2</span><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>We are not saved only to be instruments for God, but to be His sons and daughters. He does not turn us into spiritual agents but into spiritual messengers, and the message must be a part of us. The Son of God was His own messageÂ—"The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+6:63" rel="nofollow">John 6:63</a> ). As His disciples, our lives must be a holy example of the reality of our message. Even the natural heart of the unsaved will serve if called upon to do so, but it takes a heart broken by conviction of sin, baptized by the Holy Spirit, and crushed into submission to GodÂ’s purpose to make a personÂ’s life a holy example of GodÂ’s message.<br><br>There is a difference between giving a testimony and preaching. A preacher is someone who has received the call of God and is determined to use all his energy to proclaim GodÂ’s truth. God takes us beyond our own aspirations and ideas for our lives, and molds and shapes us for His purpose, just as He worked in the disciplesÂ’ lives after Pentecost. The purpose of Pentecost was not to teach the disciples something, but to make them the incarnation of what they preached so that they would literally become GodÂ’s message in the flesh. ". . . you shall be witnesses to Me . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Acts+1:8" rel="nofollow">Acts 1:8</a> ).<br><br>Allow God to have complete liberty in your life when you speak. Before GodÂ’s message can liberate other people, His liberation must first be real in you. Gather your material carefully, and then allow God to "set your words on fire" for His glory.</div>

We lose the vision because of our own lack of spiritual growth. If we do not apply our beliefs about God to the issues of everyday life, the vision God has given us will never be fulfilled. The only way to be obedient to "the heavenly vision" is to give our utmost for His highestÂ—our best for His glory. This can be accomplished only when we make a determination to continually remember GodÂ’s vision. But the acid test is obedience to the vision in the details of our everyday lifeÂ—sixty seconds out of every minute, and sixty minutes out of every hour, not just during times of personal prayer or public meetings.<br><br>"Though it tarries, wait for it . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Habakkuk+2:3" rel="nofollow">Habakkuk 2:3</a> ). We cannot bring the vision to fulfillment through our own efforts, but must live under its inspiration until it fulfills itself. We try to be so practical that we forget the vision. At the very beginning we saw the vision but did not wait for it. We rushed off to do our practical work, and once the vision was fulfilled we could no longer even see it. Waiting for a vision that "tarries" is the true test of our faithfulness to God. It is at the risk of our own soulÂ’s welfare that we get caught up in practical busy-work, only to miss the fulfillment of the vision.<br><br>Watch for the storms of God. The only way God plants His saints is through the whirlwind of His storms. Will you be proven to be an empty pod with no seed inside? That will depend on whether or not you are actually living in the light of the vision you have seen. Let God send you out through His storm, and donÂ’t go until He does. If you select your own spot to be planted, you will prove yourself to be an unproductive, empty pod. However, if you allow God to plant you, you will "bear much fruit" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+15:8" rel="nofollow">John 15:8</a> ).<br><br>It is essential that we live and "walk in the light" of GodÂ’s vision for us ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+John+1:7" rel="nofollow">1 John 1:7</a> ).</div>

It requires a conscious decision and effort to keep our primary goal constantly in front of us. It means holding ourselves to the highest priority year in and year out; not making our first priority to win souls, or to establish churches, or to have revivals, but seeking only "to be well pleasing to Him." It is not a lack of spiritual experience that leads to failure, but a lack of working to keep our eyes focused and on the right goal. At least once a week examine yourself before God to see if your life is measuring up to the standard He has for you. Paul was like a musician who gives no thought to audience approval, if he can only catch a look of approval from his Conductor.<br><br>Any goal we have that diverts us even to the slightest degree from the central goal of being "approved to God" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2+Timothy+2:15" rel="nofollow">2 Timothy 2:15</a> ) may result in our rejection from further service for Him. When you discern where the goal leads, you will understand why it is so necessary to keep "looking unto Jesus" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+12:2" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 12:2</a> ). Paul spoke of the importance of controlling his own body so that it would not take him in the wrong direction. He said, "I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest . . . I myself should become disqualified" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Corinthians+9:27" rel="nofollow">1 Corinthians 9:27</a> ).<br><br>I must learn to relate everything to the primary goal, maintaining it without interruption. My worth to God publicly is measured by what I really am in my private life. Is my primary goal in life to please Him and to be acceptable to Him, or is it something less, no matter how lofty it may sound?</div>

He did not say, "I have made a determination to imitate Jesus Christ," or, "I will really make an effort to follow Him"-but-"I have been identified with Him in His death."

Suddenly Jesus appears to us, fires are set ablaze, and we are given wonderful visions; but then we must learn to maintain the secret of the burning heartÂ—a heart that can go through anything. It is the simple, dreary day, with its commonplace duties and people, that smothers the burning heartÂ—unless we have learned the secret of abiding in Jesus.<br><br>Much of the distress we experience as Christians comes not as the result of sin, but because we are ignorant of the laws of our own nature. For instance, the only test we should use to determine whether or not to allow a particular emotion to run its course in our lives is to examine what the final outcome of that emotion will be. Think it through to its logical conclusion, and if the outcome is something that God would condemn, put a stop to it immediately. But if it is an emotion that has been kindled by the Spirit of God and you donÂ’t allow it to have its way in your life, it will cause a reaction on a lower level than God intended. That is the way unrealistic and overly emotional people are made. And the higher the emotion, the deeper the level of corruption, if it is not exercised on its intended level. If the Spirit of God has stirred you, make as many of your decisions as possible irrevocable, and let the consequences be what they will. We cannot stay forever on the "mount of transfiguration," basking in the light of our mountaintop experience (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Mark+9:1-9" rel="nofollow">Mark 9:1-9</a> ). But we must obey the light we received there; we must put it into action. When God gives us a vision, we must transact business with Him at that point, no matter what the cost.<br><br>We cannot kindle when we will The fire which in the heart resides, The spirit bloweth and is still, In mystery our soul abides; But tasks in hours of insight willed Can be through hours of gloom fulfilled.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Am I Carnally Minded?</strong><br><br>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal . . . ?<br>Â—1 Corinthians 3:3</span><br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>The natural man, or unbeliever, knows nothing about carnality. The desires of the flesh warring against the Spirit, and the Spirit warring against the flesh, which began at rebirth, are what produce carnality and the awareness of it. But Paul said, "Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Galatians+5:16" rel="nofollow">Galatians 5:16</a> ). In other words, carnality will disappear.<br><br>Are you quarrelsome and easily upset over small things? Do you think that no one who is a Christian is ever like that? Paul said they are, and he connected these attitudes with carnality. Is there a truth in the Bible that instantly awakens a spirit of malice or resentment in you? If so, that is proof that you are still carnal. If the process of sanctification is continuing in your life, there will be no trace of that kind of spirit remaining.<br><br>If the Spirit of God detects anything in you that is wrong, He doesnÂ’t ask you to make it right; He only asks you to accept the light of truth, and then He will make it right. A child of the light will confess sin instantly and stand completely open before God. But a child of the darkness will say, "Oh, I can explain that." When the light shines and the Spirit brings conviction of sin, be a child of the light. Confess your wrongdoing, and God will deal with it. If, however, you try to vindicate yourself, you prove yourself to be a child of the darkness.<br><br>What is the proof that carnality has gone? Never deceive yourself; when carnality is gone you will know it-it is the most real thing you can imagine. And God will see to it that you have a number of opportunities to prove to yourself the miracle of His grace. The proof is in a very practical test. You will find yourself saying, "If this had happened before, I would have had the spirit of resentment!" And you will never cease to be the most amazed person on earth at what God has done for you on the inside.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Maintaining the Proper Relationship</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">. . . the friend of the bridegroom . . .<br>Â—John 3:29</span><br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Goodness and purity should never be traits that draw attention to themselves, but should simply be magnets that draw people to Jesus Christ. If my holiness is not drawing others to Him, it is not the right kind of holiness; it is only an influence which awakens undue emotions and evil desires in people and diverts them from heading in the right direction. A person who is a beautiful saint can be a hindrance in leading people to the Lord by presenting only what Christ has done for him, instead of presenting Jesus Christ Himself. Others will be left with this thoughtÂ—"What a fine person that man is!" That is not being a true "friend of the bridegroom"Â—I am increasing all the time; He is not.<br><br>To maintain this friendship and faithfulness to the Bridegroom, we have to be more careful to have the moral and vital relationship to Him above everything else, including obedience. Sometimes there is nothing to obey and our only task is to maintain a vital connection with Jesus Christ, seeing that nothing interferes with it. Only occasionally is it a matter of obedience. At those times when a crisis arises, we have to find out what GodÂ’s will is. Yet most of our life is not spent in trying to be consciously obedient, but in maintaining this relationshipÂ—being the "friend of the bridegroom." Christian work can actually be a means of diverting a personÂ’s focus away from Jesus Christ. Instead of being friends "of the bridegroom," we may become amateur providences of God to someone else, working against Him while we use His weapons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why We Lack Understanding</strong><br><br>---------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man had risen from the dead<br>Â—Mark 9:9</span><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>As the disciples were commanded, you should also say nothing until the Son of Man has risen in you?until the life of the risen Christ so dominates you that you truly understand what He taught while here on earth. When you grow and develop the right condition inwardly, the words Jesus spoke become so clear that you are amazed you did not grasp them before. In fact, you were not able to understand them before because you had not yet developed the proper spiritual condition to deal with them.<br><br>Our Lord doesnÂ’t hide these things from us, but we are not prepared to receive them until we are in the right condition in our spiritual life. Jesus said, "I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+16:12" rel="nofollow">John 16:12 </a>). We must have a oneness with His risen life before we are prepared to bear any particular truth from Him. Do we really know anything about the indwelling of the risen life of Jesus? The evidence that we do is that His Word is becoming understandable to us. God cannot reveal anything to us if we donÂ’t have His Spirit. And our own unyielding and headstrong opinions will effectively prevent God from revealing anything to us. But our insensible thinking will end immediately once His resurrection life has its way with us.<br><br>". . . tell no one . . . ." But so many people do tell what they saw on the Mount of Transfiguration?their mountaintop experience. They have seen a vision and they testify to it, but there is no connection between what they say and how they live. Their lives donÂ’t add up because the Son of Man has not yet risen in them. How long will it be before His resurrection life is formed and evident in you and in me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HE COULD HAVE, BUT DIDN'T ----<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>Jesus. Lips cracked and mouth of cotton. Throat so dry he couldn't swallow, and voice so hoarse he could scarcely speak. He is thirsty. To find the last time moisture touched these lips you need to rewind a dozen hours to the meal in the upper room. Since tasting that cup of wine, Jesus has been beaten, spat upon, bruised, and cut. He has been a cross-carrier and sin-bearer, and no liquid has salved his throat. He is thirsty.<br><br>Why doesn't he do something about it? Couldn't he? Did he not cause jugs of water to be jugs of wine? Did he not make a wall out of the Jordan River and two walls out of the Red Sea? Didn't he, with one word, banish the rain and calm the waves? Doesn't Scripture say that he "turned the desert into pools" (Ps. 107:35 NIV) and "the hard rock into springs" (Ps. 114:8 NIV)?<br><br>Did God not say, "I will pour water on him who is thirsty" (Isa. 44:3 NKJV)?<br><br>If so, why does Jesus endure thirst?<br><br>While we are asking this question, add a few more. Why did he grow weary in Samaria (John 4:6), disturbed in Nazareth (Mark 6:6), and angry in the Temple (John 2:15)? Why was he sleepy in the boat on the Sea of Galilee (Mark 4:3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, sad at the tomb of Lazarus (John 11:35), and hungry in the wilderness (Matt. 4:2)?<br><br>Why? And why did he grow thirsty on the cross?<br><br>He didn't have to suffer thirst. At least, not to the level he did. Six hours earlier he'd been offered drink, but he refused it.<br><br>They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. (Mark 15:22-24 NIV)<br><br>Before the nail was pounded, a drink was offered. Mark says the wine was mixed with myrrh. Matthew described it as wine mixed with gall. Both myrrh and gall contain sedative properties that numb the senses. But Jesus refused them. He refused to be stupefied by the drugs, opting instead to feel the full force of his suffering.<br><br>Why? Why did he endure all these feelings? Because he knew you would feel them too.<br>He knew you would be weary, disturbed, and angry. He knew you'd be sleepy, grief-stricken, and hungry. He knew you'd face pain. If not the pain of the body, the pain of the soul ... pain too sharp for any drug. He knew you'd face thirst. If not a thirst for water, at least a thirst for truth, and the truth we glean from the image of a thirsty Christ is--he understands.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Inner Invincibility </strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me . . .  Â—Matthew 11:29 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Whom the Lord loves He chastens . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+12:6" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 12:6</a> ). How petty our complaining is! Our Lord begins to bring us to the point where we can have fellowship with Him, only to hear us moan and groan, saying, "Oh Lord, just let me be like other people!" Jesus is asking us to get beside Him and take one end of the yoke, so that we can pull together. ThatÂ’s why Jesus says to us, "My yoke is easy and My burden is light" ( Matthew 11:30 ). Are you closely identified with the Lord Jesus like that? If so, you will thank God when you feel the pressure of His hand upon you.<br><br>". . . to those who have no might He increases strength" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Isaiah+40:29" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 40:29</a> ). God comes and takes us out of our emotionalism, and then our complaining turns into a hymn of praise. The only way to know the strength of God is to take the yoke of Jesus upon us and to learn from Him.<br><br>". . . the joy of the Lord is your strength" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Nehemiah+8:10" rel="nofollow">Nehemiah 8:10</a> ). Where do the saints get their joy? If we did not know some Christians well, we might think from just observing them that they have no burdens at all to bear. But we must lift the veil from our eyes. The fact that the peace, light, and joy of God is in them is proof that a burden is there as well. The burden that God places on us squeezes the grapes in our lives and produces the wine, but most of us see only the wine and not the burden. No power on earth or in hell can conquer the Spirit of God living within the human spirit; it creates an inner invincibility.<br><br>If your life is producing only a whine, instead of the wine, then ruthlessly kick it out. It is definitely a crime for a Christian to be weak in GodÂ’s strength.</div>
