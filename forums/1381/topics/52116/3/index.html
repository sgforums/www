Many of us turn back from going on with Jesus from the very moment we have an experience of what He can do. Watch when God changes your circumstances to see whether you are going on with Jesus, or siding with the world, the flesh, and the devil. We wear His name, but are we going on with Him? "From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+6:66" rel="nofollow">John 6:66</a> ).<br><br>The temptations of Jesus continued throughout His earthly life, and they will continue throughout the life of the Son of God in us. Are we going on with Jesus in the life we are living right now?<br><br>We have the idea that we ought to shield ourselves from some of the things God brings around us. May it never be! It is God who engineers our circumstances, and whatever they may be we must see that we face them while continually abiding with Him in His temptations. They are His temptations, not temptations to us, but temptations to the life of the Son of God in us. Jesus ChristÂ’s honor is at stake in our bodily lives. Are we remaining faithful to the Son of God in everything that attacks His life in us?<br><br>Are you going on with Jesus? The way goes through Gethsemane, through the city gate, and on "outside the camp" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+13:13" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 13:13</a> ). The way is lonely and goes on until there is no longer even a trace of a footprint to followÂ—but only the voice saying, "Follow Me" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+4:19" rel="nofollow">Matthew 4:19</a> )</div>

Â’ Â—Luke 18:31</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In our natural life our ambitions change as we grow, but in the Christian life the goal is given at the very beginning, and the beginning and the end are exactly the same, namely, our Lord Himself. We start with Christ and we end with Him?". . . till we all come . . . to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Ephesians+4:13" rel="nofollow">Ephesians 4:13</a> ), not simply to our own idea of what the Christian life should be. The goal of the missionary is to do GodÂ’s will, not to be useful or to win the lost. A missionary is useful and he <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> win the lost, but that is not his goal. His goal is to do the will of his Lord.<br><br>In our LordÂ’s life, Jerusalem was the place where He reached the culmination of His FatherÂ’s will upon the cross, and unless we go there with Jesus we will have no friendship or fellowship with Him. Nothing ever diverted our Lord on His way to Jerusalem. He never hurried through certain villages where He was persecuted, or lingered in others where He was blessed. Neither gratitude nor ingratitude turned our Lord even the slightest degree away from His purpose to go "up to Jerusalem."<br><br>"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+10:24" rel="nofollow">Matthew 10:24</a> ). In other words, the same things that happened to our Lord will happen to us on our way to our "Jerusalem." There will be works of God exhibited through us, people will get blessed, and one or two will show gratitude while the rest will show total ingratitude, but nothing must divert us from going "up to [our] Jerusalem."<br><br>". . . there they crucified Him . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+23:33" rel="nofollow">Luke 23:33</a> ). That is what happened when our Lord reached Jerusalem, and that event is the doorway to our salvation. The saints, however, do not end in crucifixion; by the LordÂ’s grace they end in glory. In the meantime our watchword should be summed up by each of us saying, "I too go Â’up to Jerusalem.Â’ "</div>

First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift Â—Matthew 5:23-24 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It is easy for us to imagine that we will suddenly come to a point in our lives where we are fully prepared, but preparation is not suddenly accomplished. In fact, it is a process that must be steadily maintained. It is dangerous to become settled and complacent in our present level of experience. The Christian life requires preparation and more preparation.<br><br>The sense of sacrifice in the Christian life is readily appealing to a new Christian. From a human standpoint, the one thing that attracts us to Jesus Christ is our sense of the heroic, and a close examination of us by our LordÂ’s words suddenly puts this tide of enthusiasm to the test. ". . . go your way. First be reconciled to your brother. . . ." The "go" of preparation is to allow the Word of God to examine you closely. Your sense of heroic sacrifice is not good enough. The thing the Holy Spirit will detect in you is your nature that can never work in His service. And no one but God can detect that nature in you. Do you have anything to hide from God? If you do, then let God search you with His light. If there is sin in your life, donÂ’t just admit itÂ—confess it. Are you willing to obey your Lord and Master, whatever the humiliation to your right to yourself may be?<br><br>Never disregard a conviction that the Holy Spirit brings to you. If it is important enough for the Spirit of God to bring it to your mind, it is the very thing He is detecting in you. You were looking for some big thing to give up, while God is telling you of some tiny thing that must go. But behind that tiny thing lies the stronghold of obstinacy, and you say, "I will not give up my right to myself"Â—the very thing that God intends you to give up if you are to be a disciple of Jesus Christ.</div>

Â—1 Corinthians 9:16</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We are inclined to forget the deeply spiritual and supernatural touch of God. If you are able to tell exactly where you were when you received the call of God and can explain all about it, I question whether you have truly been called. The call of God does not come like that; it is much more supernatural. The realization of the call in a personÂ’s life may come like a clap of thunder or it may dawn gradually. But however quickly or slowly this awareness comes, it is always accompanied with an undercurrent of the supernaturalÂ—something that is inexpressible and produces a "glow." At any moment the sudden awareness of this incalculable, supernatural, surprising call that has taken hold of your life may break throughÂ—"I chose you . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+15:16" rel="nofollow">John 15:16</a> ). The call of God has nothing to do with salvation and sanctification. You are not called to preach the gospel because you are sanctified; the call to preach the gospel is infinitely different. Paul describes it as a compulsion that was placed upon him.<br><br>If you have ignored, and thereby removed, the great supernatural call of God in your life, take a review of your circumstances. See where you have put your own ideas of service or your particular abilities ahead of the call of God. Paul said, ". . . woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!" He had become aware of the call of God, and his compulsion to "preach the gospel" was so strong that nothing else was any longer even a competitor for his strength.<br><br>If a man or woman is called of God, it doesnÂ’t matter how difficult the circumstances may be. God orchestrates every force at work for His purpose in the end. If you will agree with GodÂ’s purpose, He will bring not only your conscious level but also all the deeper levels of your life, which you yourself cannot reach, into perfect harmony.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Assigning of the Call</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of His body, which is the church . . .  Â—Colossians 1:24 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We take our own spiritual consecration and try to make it into a call of God, but when we get right with Him He brushes all this aside. Then He gives us a tremendous, riveting pain to fasten our attention on something that we never even dreamed could be His call for us. And for one radiant, flashing moment we see His purpose, and we say, "Here am I! Send me" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Isaiah+6:8" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 6:8</a> ).<br><br>This call has nothing to do with personal sanctification, but with being made broken bread and poured-out wine. Yet God can never make us into wine if we object to the fingers He chooses to use to crush us. We say, "If God would only use His own fingers, and make me broken bread and poured-out wine in a special way, then I wouldnÂ’t object!" But when He uses someone we dislike, or some set of circumstances to which we said we would never submit, to crush us, then we object. Yet we must never try to choose the place of our own martyrdom. If we are ever going to be made into wine, we will have to be crushedÂ—you cannot drink grapes. Grapes become wine only when they have been squeezed.<br><br>I wonder what finger and thumb God has been using to squeeze you? Have you been as hard as a marble and escaped? If you are not ripe yet, and if God had squeezed you anyway, the wine produced would have been remarkably bitter. To be a holy person means that the elements of our natural life experience the very presence of God as they are providentially broken in His service. We have to be placed into God and brought into agreement with Him before we can be broken bread in His hands. Stay right with God and let Him do as He likes, and you will find that He is producing the kind of bread and wine that will benefit His other children.</div>

Jesus took . . . them up on a high mountain apart by themselves . . .  Â—Mark 9:2</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We have all experienced times of exaltation on the mountain, when we have seen things from GodÂ’s perspective and have wanted to stay there. But God will never allow us to stay there. The true test of our spiritual life is in exhibiting the power to descend from the mountain. If we only have the power to go up, something is wrong. It is a wonderful thing to be on the mountain with God, but a person only gets there so that he may later go down and lift up the demon-possessed people in the valley (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Mark+9:14-18" rel="nofollow">Mark 9:14-18</a> ). We are not made for the mountains, for sunrises, or for the other beautiful attractions in lifeÂ—those are simply intended to be moments of inspiration. We are made for the valley and the ordinary things of life, and that is where we have to prove our stamina and strength. Yet our spiritual selfishness always wants repeated moments on the mountain. We feel that we could talk and live like perfect angels, if we could only stay on the mountaintop. Those times of exaltation are exceptional and they have their meaning in our life with God, but we must beware to prevent our spiritual selfishness from wanting to make them the only time.<br><br>We are inclined to think that everything that happens is to be turned into useful teaching. In actual fact, it is to be turned into something even better than teaching, namely, character. The mountaintop is not meant to teach us anything, it is meant to make us something. There is a terrible trap in always asking, "WhatÂ’s the use of this experience?" We can never measure spiritual matters in that way. The moments on the mountaintop are rare moments, and they are meant for something in GodÂ’s purpose.</div>

The height of the mountaintop is measured by the dismal drudgery of the valley, but it is in the valley that we have to live for the glory of God. We see His glory on the mountain, but we never live for His glory there. It is in the place of humiliation that we find our true worth to GodÂ—that is where our faithfulness is revealed. Most of us can do things if we are always at some heroic level of intensity, simply because of the natural selfishness of our own hearts. But God wants us to be at the drab everyday level, where we live in the valley according to our personal relationship with Him. Peter thought it would be a wonderful thing for them to remain on the mountain, but Jesus Christ took the disciples down from the mountain and into the valley, where the true meaning of the vision was explained (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Mark+9:5-6" rel="nofollow">Mark 9:5-6</a> , <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Mark+14-23" rel="nofollow">Mark 14-23</a> ).<br><br>"If you can do anything . . . ." It takes the valley of humiliation to remove the skepticism from us. Look back at your own experience and you will find that until you learned who Jesus really was, you were a skillful skeptic about His power. When you were on the mountaintop you could believe anything, but what about when you were faced with the facts of the valley? You may be able to give a testimony regarding your sanctification, but what about the thing that is a humiliation to you right now? The last time you were on the mountain with God, you saw that all the power in heaven and on earth belonged to JesusÂ—will you be skeptical now, simply because you are in the valley of humiliation?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Place of Ministry </strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">He said to them, Â’This kind [of unclean spirit] can come out by nothing but prayer and fastingÂ’<br>Â—Mark 9:22</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>His disciples asked Him privately, Â’Why could we not cast it out?Â’ " ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Mark+9:28" rel="nofollow">Mark 9:28</a> ). The answer lies in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. "This kind can come out by nothing but" concentrating on Him, and then doubling and redoubling that concentration on Him. We can remain powerless forever, as the disciples were in this situation, by trying to do GodÂ’s work without concentrating on His power, and by following instead the ideas that we draw from our own nature. We actually slander and dishonor God by our very eagerness to serve Him without knowing Him.<br><br>When you are brought face to face with a difficult situation and nothing happens externally, you can still know that freedom and release will be given because of your continued concentration on Jesus Christ. Your duty in service and ministry is to see that there is nothing between Jesus and yourself. Is there anything between you and Jesus even now? If there is, you must get through it, not by ignoring it as an irritation, or by going up and over it, but by facing it and getting through it into the presence of Jesus Christ. Then that very problem itself, and all that you have been through in connection with it, will glorify Jesus Christ in a way that you will never know until you see Him face to face.<br><br>We must be able to "mount up with wings like eagles" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Isaiah+40:31" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 40:31</a> ), but we must also know how to come down. The power of the saint lies in the coming down and in the living that is done in the valley. Paul said, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Philippians+4:13" rel="nofollow">Philippians 4:13</a> ) and what he was referring to were mostly humiliating things. And yet it is in our power to refuse to be humiliated and to say, "No, thank you, I much prefer to be on the mountaintop with God." Can I face things as they actually are in the light of the reality of Jesus Christ, or do things as they really are destroy my faith in Him, and put me into a panic?</div>

Â—Romans 5:12</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Bible does not say that God punished the human race for one manÂ’s sin, but that the nature of sin, namely, my claim to my right to myself, entered into the human race through one man. But it also says that another Man took upon Himself the sin of the human race and put it awayÂ—an infinitely more profound revelation (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+9:26" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 9:26</a> ). The nature of sin is not immorality and wrongdoing, but the nature of self-realization which leads us to say, "I am my own god." This nature may exhibit itself in proper morality or in improper immorality, but it always has a common basisÂ—my claim to my right to myself. When our Lord faced either people with all the forces of evil in them, or people who were clean-living, moral, and upright, He paid no attention to the moral degradation of one, nor any attention to the moral attainment of the other. He looked at something we do not see, namely, the nature of man (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+2:25" rel="nofollow">John 2:25</a> ).<br><br>Sin is something I am born with and cannot touchÂ—only God touches sin through redemption. It is through the Cross of Christ that God redeemed the entire human race from the possibility of damnation through the heredity of sin. God nowhere holds a person responsible for having the heredity of sin, and does not condemn anyone because of it. Condemnation comes when I realize that Jesus Christ came to deliver me from this heredity of sin, and yet I refuse to let Him do so. From that moment I begin to get the seal of damnation. "This is the condemnation [and the critical moment], that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light . . . " ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+3:19" rel="nofollow">John 3:19</a> ).</div>

Â—Galatians 1:15-16</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>If Jesus Christ is going to regenerate me, what is the problem He faces? It is simply thisÂ—I have a heredity in which I had no say or decision; I am not holy, nor am I likely to be; and if all Jesus Christ can do is tell me that I must be holy, His teaching only causes me to despair. But if Jesus Christ is truly a regenerator, someone who can put His own heredity of holiness into me, then I can begin to see what He means when He says that I have to be holy. Redemption means that Jesus Christ can put into anyone the hereditary nature that was in Himself, and all the standards He gives us are based on that natureÂ—His teaching is meant to be applied to the life which He puts within us. The proper action on my part is simply to agree with GodÂ’s verdict on sin as judged on the Cross of Christ.<br><br>The New Testament teaching about regeneration is that when a person is hit by his own sense of need, God will put the Holy Spirit into his spirit, and his personal spirit will be energized by the Spirit of the Son of GodÂ— ". . . until Christ is formed in you" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Galatians+4:19" rel="nofollow">Galatians 4:19</a> ). The moral miracle of redemption is that God can put a new nature into me through which I can live a totally new life. When I finally reach the edge of my need and know my own limitations, then Jesus says, "Blessed are you . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+5:11" rel="nofollow">Matthew 5:11</a> ). But I must get to that point. God cannot put into me, the responsible moral person that I am, the nature that was in Jesus Christ unless I am aware of my need for it.<br><br>Just as the nature of sin entered into the human race through one man, the Holy Spirit entered into the human race through another Man (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+5:12-19" rel="nofollow">Romans 5:12-19</a> ). And redemption means that I can be delivered from the heredity of sin, and that through Jesus Christ I can receive a pure and spotless heredity, namely, the Holy Spirit.</div>

The Christian faith bases everything on the extreme, self-confident nature of sin. Other faiths deal with sinsÂ—the Bible alone deals with sin. The first thing Jesus Christ confronted in people was the heredity of sin, and it is because we have ignored this in our presentation of the gospel that the message of the gospel has lost its sting and its explosive power.<br><br>The revealed truth of the Bible is not that Jesus Christ took on Himself our fleshly sins, but that He took on Himself the heredity of sin that no man can even touch. God made His own Son "to be sin" that He might make the sinner into a saint. It is revealed throughout the Bible that our Lord took on Himself the sin of the world through identification with us, not through sympathy for us. He deliberately took on His own shoulders, and endured in His own body, the complete, cumulative sin of the human race. "He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us . . ." and by so doing He placed salvation for the entire human race solely on the basis of redemption. Jesus Christ reconciled the human race, putting it back to where God designed it to be. And now anyone can experience that reconciliation, being brought into oneness with God, on the basis of what our Lord has done on the cross.<br><br>A man cannot redeem himselfÂ—redemption is the work of God, and is absolutely finished and complete. And its application to individual people is a matter of their own individual action or response to it. A distinction must always be made between the revealed truth of redemption and the actual conscious experience of salvation in a personÂ’s life.</div>

Â—Matthew 11:28</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>IsnÂ’t it humiliating to be told that we must come to Jesus! Think of the things about which we will not come to Jesus Christ. If you want to know how real you are, test yourself by these wordsÂ—"Come to Me . . . ." In every dimension in which you are not real, you will argue or evade the issue altogether rather than come; you will go through sorrow rather than come; and you will do anything rather than come the last lap of the race of seemingly unspeakable foolishness and say, "Just as I am, I come." As long as you have even the least bit of spiritual disrespect, it will always reveal itself in the fact that you are expecting God to tell you to do something very big, and yet all He is telling you to do is to "Come . . . ."<br><br>"Come to Me . . . ." When you hear those words, you will know that something must happen in you before you can come. The Holy Spirit will show you what you have to do, and it will involve anything that will uproot whatever is preventing you from getting through to Jesus. And you will never get any further until you are willing to do that very thing. The Holy Spirit will search out that one immovable stronghold within you, but He cannot budge it unless you are willing to let Him do so.<br><br>How often have you come to God with your requests and gone away thinking, "IÂ’ve really received what I wanted this time!" And yet you go away with nothing, while all the time God has stood with His hands outstretched not only to take you but also for you to take Him. Just think of the invincible, unconquerable, and untiring patience of Jesus, who lovingly says, "Come to Me . . . ."</div>

That is all the sovereign work of God. Do I have faith in what Jesus Christ has done? He has made the perfect atonement for sin. Am I in the habit of constantly realizing it? The greatest need we have is not to do things, but to believe things. The redemption of Christ is not an experience, it is the great act of God which He has performed through Christ, and I have to build my faith on it. If I construct my faith on my own experience, I produce the most unscriptural kind of lifeÂ—an isolated life, with my eyes focused solely on my own holiness. Beware of that human holiness that is not based on the atonement of the Lord. It has no value for anything except a life of isolationÂ—it is useless to God and a nuisance to man. Measure every kind of experience you have by our Lord Himself. We cannot do anything pleasing to God unless we deliberately build on the foundation of the atonement by the Cross of Christ.<br><br>The atonement of Jesus must be exhibited in practical, unassuming ways in my life. Every time I obey, the absolute deity of God is on my side, so that the grace of God and my natural obedience are in perfect agreement. Obedience means that I have completely placed my trust in the atonement, and my obedience is immediately met by the delight of the supernatural grace of God.<br><br>Beware of the human holiness that denies the reality of the natural lifeÂ—it is a fraud. Continually bring yourself to the trial or test of the atonement and ask, "Where is the discernment of the atonement in this, and in that?"</div>

God does not continue to cleanse us more and more from sinÂ—"But if we walk in the light," we are cleansed "from all sin" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+John+1:7" rel="nofollow">1 John 1:7</a> ). It is a matter of obedience, and once we obey, the relationship is instantly perfected. But if we turn away from obedience for even one second, darkness and death are immediately at work again.<br><br>All of GodÂ’s revealed truths are sealed until they are opened to us through obedience. You will never open them through philosophy or thinking. But once you obey, a flash of light comes immediately. Let GodÂ’s truth work into you by immersing yourself in it, not by worrying into it. The only way you can get to know the truth of God is to stop trying to find out and by being born again. If you obey God in the first thing He shows you, then He instantly opens up the next truth to you. You could read volumes on the work of the Holy Spirit, when five minutes of total, uncompromising obedience would make things as clear as sunlight. DonÂ’t say, "I suppose I will understand these things someday!" You can understand them now. And it is not study that brings understanding to you, but obedience. Even the smallest bit of obedience opens heaven, and the deepest truths of God immediately become yours. Yet God will never reveal more truth about Himself to you, until you have obeyed what you know already. Beware of becoming one of the "wise and prudent."

Â—Genesis 5:24</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The true test of a personÂ’s spiritual life and character is not what he does in the extraordinary moments of life, but what he does during the ordinary times when there is nothing tremendous or exciting happening. A personÂ’s worth is revealed in his attitude toward the ordinary things of life when he is not under the spotlight (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:35-37" rel="nofollow">John 1:35-37</a> and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+3:30" rel="nofollow">John 3:30</a> ). It is painful work to get in step with God and to keep pace with HimÂ—it means getting your second wind spiritually. In learning to walk with God, there is always the difficulty of getting into His stride, but once we have done so, the only characteristic that exhibits itself is the very life of God Himself. The individual person is merged into a personal oneness with God, and GodÂ’s stride and His power alone are exhibited.<br><br>It is difficult to get into stride with God, because as soon as we start walking with Him we find that His pace has surpassed us before we have even taken three steps. He has different ways of doing things, and we have to be trained and disciplined in His ways. It was said of JesusÂ—"He will not fail nor be discouraged . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Isaiah+42:4" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 42:4</a> ) because He never worked from His own individual standpoint, but always worked from the standpoint of His Father. And we must learn to do the same. Spiritual truth is learned through the atmosphere that surrounds us, not through intellectual reasoning. It is GodÂ’s Spirit that changes the atmosphere of our way of looking at things, and then things begin to be possible which before were impossible. Getting into GodÂ’s stride means nothing less than oneness with Him. It takes a long time to get there, but keep at it. DonÂ’t give up because the pain is intense right nowÂ—get on with it, and before long you will find that you have a new vision and a new purpose.<br><br></div>

After he launched his first strike for God and for what was right, God allowed Moses to be driven into empty discouragement, sending him into the desert to feed sheep for forty years. At the end of that time, God appeared to Moses and said to him, " Â’. . . bring My people . . . out of Egypt.Â’ But Moses said to God, Â’Who am I that I should go . . . ?Â’ " ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Exodus+3:10-11" rel="nofollow">Exodus 3:10-11</a> ). In the beginning Moses had realized that he was the one to deliver the people, but he had to be trained and disciplined by God first. He was right in his individual perspective, but he was not the person for the work until he had learned true fellowship and oneness with God.<br><br>We may have the vision of God and a very clear understanding of what God wants, and yet when we start to do it, there comes to us something equivalent to MosesÂ’ forty years in the wilderness. ItÂ’s as if God had ignored the entire thing, and when we are thoroughly discouraged, God comes back and revives His call to us. And then we begin to tremble and say, "Who am I that I should go . . . ?" We must learn that GodÂ’s great stride is summed up in these wordsÂ—"I AM WHO I AM . . . has sent me to you" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Exodus+3:14" rel="nofollow">Exodus 3:14</a> ). We must also learn that our individual effort for God shows nothing but disrespect for HimÂ—our individuality is to be rendered radiant through a personal relationship with God, so that He may be "well pleased" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+3:17" rel="nofollow">Matthew 3:17</a> ). We are focused on the right individual perspective of things; we have the vision and can say, "I know this is what God wants me to do." But we have not yet learned to get into GodÂ’s stride.

We are inclined to look on our Lord as one who assists us in our endeavors for God. Yet our Lord places Himself as the absolute sovereign and supreme Lord over His disciples. He does not say that the lost will never be saved if we donÂ’t goÂ—He simply says, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations . . . ."

To "go" simply means to live. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Acts+1:8" rel="nofollow">Acts 1:8</a> is the description of how to go.

( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Acts+20:24" rel="nofollow">Acts 20:24</a> ). That is how to keep going until we are gone from this life.</div>

Look at any other aspect of ChristÂ’s work, whether it is healing, saving, or sanctifying, and you will see that there is nothing limitless about those. ButÂ—"The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"Â—that is limitless ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:29" rel="nofollow">John 1:29</a> ). The missionaryÂ’s message is the limitless importance of Jesus Christ as the propitiation for our sins, and a missionary is someone who is immersed in the truth of that revelation.<br><br>The real key to the missionaryÂ’s message is the "remissionary" aspect of ChristÂ’s life, not His kindness, His goodness, or even His revealing of the fatherhood of God to us. ". . . repentance and remission of sins should be preached . . . to all nations . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+24:47" rel="nofollow">Luke 24:47</a> ). The greatest message of limitless importance is that "He Himself is the propitiation for our sins . . . ." The missionaryÂ’s message is not nationalistic, favoring nations or individuals; it is "for the whole world." When the Holy Spirit comes into me, He does not consider my partialities or preferences; He simply brings me into oneness with the Lord Jesus.<br><br>A missionary is someone who is bound by marriage to the stated mission and purpose of his Lord and Master. He is not to proclaim his own point of view, but is only to proclaim "the Lamb of God." It is easier to belong to a faction that simply tells what Jesus Christ has done for me, and easier to become a devotee of divine healing, or of a special type of sanctification, or of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But Paul did not say, "Woe is me if I do not preach what Christ has done for me," but, ". . . woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Corinthians+9:16" rel="nofollow">1 Corinthians 9:16</a> ). And this is the gospelÂ—"the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</div>

The key to the missionaryÂ’s difficult task is also not the key of common sense, nor is it the key of medicine, civilization, education, or even evangelization. The key is in following the MasterÂ’s ordersÂ—the key is prayer. "Pray the Lord of the harvest . . . ." In the natural realm, prayer is not practical but absurd. We have to realize that prayer is foolish from the commonsense point of view.<br><br>From Jesus ChristÂ’s perspective, there are no nations, but only the world. How many of us pray without regard to the persons, but with regard to only one PersonÂ—Jesus Christ? He owns the harvest that is produced through distress and through conviction of sin. This is the harvest for which we have to pray that laborers be sent out to reap. We stay busy at work, while people all around us are ripe and ready to be harvested; we do not reap even one of them, but simply waste our LordÂ’s time in over-energized activities and programs. Suppose a crisis were to come into your fatherÂ’s or your brotherÂ’s lifeÂ—are you there as a laborer to reap the harvest for Jesus Christ? Is your response, "Oh, but I have a special work to do!" No Christian has a special work to do. A Christian is called to be Jesus ChristÂ’s own, "a servant [who] is not greater than his master" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+13:16" rel="nofollow">John 13:16</a> ), and someone who does not dictate to Jesus Christ what he intends to do. Our Lord calls us to no special workÂ—He calls us to Himself. "Pray the Lord of the harvest," and He will engineer your circumstances to send you out as His laborer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Method of Missions</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations . . . Â—Matthew 28:19 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Jesus Christ did not say, "Go and save souls" (the salvation of souls is the supernatural work of God), but He said, "Go . . . make disciples of all the nations . . . ." Yet you cannot make disciples unless you are a disciple yourself. When the disciples returned from their first mission, they were filled with joy because even the demons were subject to them. But Jesus said, in effect, "DonÂ’t rejoice in successful serviceÂ—the great secret of joy is that you have the right relationship with Me" (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+10:17-20" rel="nofollow">Luke 10:17-20</a> ). The missionaryÂ’s great essential is remaining true to the call of God, and realizing that his one and only purpose is to disciple men and women to Jesus. Remember that there is a passion for souls that does not come from God, but from our desire to make converts to our point of view.<br><br>The challenge to the missionary does not come from the fact that people are difficult to bring to salvation, that backsliders are difficult to reclaim, or that there is a barrier of callous indifference. No, the challenge comes from the perspective of the missionaryÂ’s own personal relationship with Jesus ChristÂ—"Do you believe that I am able to do this?" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+9:28" rel="nofollow">Matthew 9:28</a> ). Our Lord unwaveringly asks us that question, and it confronts us in every individual situation we encounter. The one great challenge to us isÂ—do I know my risen Lord? Do I know the power of His indwelling Spirit? Am I wise enough in GodÂ’s sight, but foolish enough according to the wisdom of the world, to trust in what Jesus Christ has said? Or am I abandoning the great supernatural position of limitless confidence in Christ Jesus, which is really GodÂ’s only call for a missionary? If I follow any other method, I depart altogether from the methods prescribed by our LordÂ—"All authority has been given to Me . . . . Go therefore . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+28:18-19" rel="nofollow">Matthew 28:18-19</a> ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Justification by Faith</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life Â—Romans 5:10 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I am not saved by believingÂ—I simply realize I am saved by believing. And it is not repentance that saves meÂ—repentance is only the sign that I realize what God has done through Christ Jesus. The danger here is putting the emphasis on the effect, instead of on the cause. Is it my obedience, consecration, and dedication that make me right with God? It is never that! I am made right with God because, prior to all of that, Christ died. When I turn to God and by belief accept what God reveals, the miraculous atonement by the Cross of Christ instantly places me into a right relationship with God. And as a result of the supernatural miracle of GodÂ’s grace I stand justified, not because I am sorry for my sin, or because I have repented, but because of what Jesus has done. The Spirit of God brings justification with a shattering, radiant light, and I know that I am saved, even though I donÂ’t know how it was accomplished.<br><br>The salvation that comes from God is not based on human logic, but on the sacrificial death of Jesus. We can be born again solely because of the atonement of our Lord. Sinful men and women can be changed into new creations, not through their repentance or their belief, but through the wonderful work of God in Christ Jesus which preceded all of our experience (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2+Corinthians+5:17-19" rel="nofollow">2 Corinthians 5:17-19</a> ). The unconquerable safety of justification and sanctification is God Himself. We do not have to accomplish these things ourselvesÂ—they have been accomplished through the atonement of the Cross of Christ. The supernatural becomes natural to us through the miracle of God, and there is the realization of what Jesus Christ has already doneÂ—"It is finished!" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+19:30" rel="nofollow">John 19:30</a> ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Substitution</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him Â—2 Corinthians 5:21 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The modern view of the death of Jesus is that He died for our sins out of sympathy for us. Yet the New Testament view is that He took our sin on Himself not because of sympathy, but because of His identification with us. He was "made . . . to be sin . . . ." Our sins are removed because of the death of Jesus, and the only explanation for His death is His obedience to His Father, not His sympathy for us. We are acceptable to God not because we have obeyed, nor because we have promised to give up things, but because of the death of Christ, and for no other reason. We say that Jesus Christ came to reveal the fatherhood and the lovingkindness of God, but the New Testament says that He came to take "away the sin of the world!" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+1:29" rel="nofollow">John 1:29</a> ). And the revealing of the fatherhood of God is only to those to whom Jesus has been introduced as Savior. In speaking to the world, Jesus Christ never referred to Himself as One who revealed the Father, but He spoke instead of being a stumbling block (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+15:22-24" rel="nofollow">John 15:22-24</a> ). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+14:9" rel="nofollow">John 14:9</a> , where Jesus said, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father," was spoken to His disciples.<br><br>That Christ died for me, and therefore I am completely free from penalty, is never taught in the New Testament. What is taught in the New Testament is that "He died for all" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2+Corinthians+5:15" rel="nofollow">2 Corinthians 5:15</a> )Â—not, "He died my death"Â—and that through identification with His death I can be freed from sin, and have His very righteousness imparted as a gift to me. The substitution which is taught in the New Testament is twofoldÂ— "For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." The teaching is not Christ for me unless I am determined to have Christ formed in me (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Galatians+4:19" rel="nofollow">Galatians 4:19</a> ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Faith</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Without faith it is impossible to please Him . . . Â—Hebrews 11:6</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Faith in active opposition to common sense is mistaken enthusiasm and narrow-mindedness, and common sense in opposition to faith demonstrates a mistaken reliance on reason as the basis for truth. The life of faith brings the two of these into the proper relationship. Common sense and faith are as different from each other as the natural life is from the spiritual, and as impulsiveness is from inspiration. Nothing that Jesus Christ ever said is common sense, but is revelation sense, and is complete, whereas common sense falls short. Yet faith must be tested and tried before it becomes real in your life. "We know that all things work together for good . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+8:28" rel="nofollow">Romans 8:28</a> ) so that no matter what happens, the transforming power of GodÂ’s providence transforms perfect faith into reality. Faith always works in a personal way, because the purpose of God is to see that perfect faith is made real in His children.<br><br>For every detail of common sense in life, there is a truth God has revealed by which we can prove in our practical experience what we believe God to be. Faith is a tremendously active principle that always puts Jesus Christ first. The life of faith says, "Lord, You have said it, it appears to be irrational, but IÂ’m going to step out boldly, trusting in Your Word" (for example, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+6:33" rel="nofollow">Matthew 6:33</a> ). Turning intellectual faith into our personal possession is always a fight, not just sometimes. God brings us into particular circumstances to educate our faith, because the nature of faith is to make the object of our faith very real to us. Until we know Jesus, God is merely a concept, and we canÂ’t have faith in Him. But once we hear Jesus say, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+14:9" rel="nofollow">John 14:9</a> ) we immediately have something that is real, and our faith is limitless. Faith is the entire person in the right relationship with God through the power of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</div>
