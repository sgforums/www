But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also Â— Matthew 5:39 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This verse reveals the humiliation of being a Christian. In the natural realm, if a person does not hit back, it is because he is a coward. But in the spiritual realm, it is the very evidence of the Son of God in him if he does not hit back. When you are insulted, you must not only not resent it, but you must make it an opportunity to exhibit the Son of God in your life. And you cannot imitate the nature of JesusÂ—it is either in you or it is not. A personal insult becomes an opportunity for a saint to reveal the incredible sweetness of the Lord Jesus.<br><br>The teaching of the Sermon on the Mount is not, "Do your duty," but is, in effect, "Do what is not your duty." It is not your duty to go the second mile, or to turn the other cheek, but Jesus said that if we are His disciples, we will always do these things. We will not say, "Oh well, I just canÂ’t do any more, and IÂ’ve been so misrepresented and misunderstood." Every time I insist on having my own rights, I hurt the Son of God, while in fact I can prevent Jesus from being hurt if I will take the blow myself. That is the real meaning of filling "up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ . . ." ( Colossians 1:24 ). A disciple realizes that it is his LordÂ’s honor that is at stake in his life, not his own honor.<br><br>Never look for righteousness in the other person, but never cease to be righteous yourself. We are always looking for justice, yet the essence of the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount isÂ—Never look for justice, but never cease to give it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Concept of Divine Control </strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">. . . how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! Â— Matthew 7:11</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Jesus is laying down the rules of conduct in this passage for those people who have His Spirit. He urges us to keep our minds filled with the concept of GodÂ’s control over everything, which means that a disciple must maintain an attitude of perfect trust and an eagerness to ask and to seek.<br><br>Fill your mind with the thought that God is there. And once your mind is truly filled with that thought, when you experience difficulties it will be as easy as breathing for you to remember, "My heavenly Father knows all about this!" This will be no effort at all, but will be a natural thing for you when difficulties and uncertainties arise. Before you formed this concept of divine control so powerfully in your mind, you used to go from person to person seeking help, but now you go to God about it. Jesus is laying down the rules of conduct for those people who have His Spirit, and it works on the following principle: God is my Father, He loves me, and I will never think of anything that He will forget, so why should I worry?<br><br>Jesus said there are times when God cannot lift the darkness from you, but you should trust Him. At times God will appear like an unkind friend, but He is not; He will appear like an unnatural father, but He is not; He will appear like an unjust judge, but He is not. Keep the thought that the mind of God is behind all things strong and growing. Not even the smallest detail of life happens unless GodÂ’s will is behind it. Therefore, you can rest in perfect confidence in Him. Prayer is not only asking, but is an attitude of the mind which produces the atmosphere in which asking is perfectly natural. "Ask, and it will be given to you . . ." ( Matthew 7:7 ).<br><br>=======<br><br>Like the song in the post above, <span style="font-style: italic;">Turn your eyes upon Jesus</span>, let us remind and encourage one another to focus on our Shepherd, our Deliverer, our Friend who will fails not.<br>Draw faith, He is faithful.</div>

Â— 1 Corinthians 2:4</span><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Paul was a scholar and an orator of the highest degree; he was not speaking here out of a deep sense of humility, but was saying that when he preached the gospel, he would veil the power of God if he impressed people with the excellency of his speech. Belief in Jesus is a miracle produced only by the effectiveness of redemption, not by impressive speech, nor by wooing and persuading, but only by the sheer unaided power of God. The creative power of redemption comes through the preaching of the gospel, but never because of the personality of the preacher.<br><br>Real and effective fasting by a preacher is not fasting from food, but fasting from eloquence, from impressive diction, and from everything else that might hinder the gospel of God being presented. The preacher is there as the representative of GodÂ—". . . as though God were pleading through us . . ." ( 2 Corinthians 5:20 ). He is there to present the gospel of God. If it is only because of my preaching that people desire to be better, they will never get close to Jesus Christ. Anything that flatters me in my preaching of the gospel will result in making me a traitor to Jesus, and I prevent the creative power of His redemption from doing its work.<br><br>"And I, if I am lifted up . . . , will draw all peoples to Myself" ( John 12:32 ).<br><br>=======<br><br>* verse in full from Bible in NIV:<br><br><span class="small">1 Corinthians 2:4 - My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power<br><br>2 Corinthians 5:20 - We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us.

Â— Acts 9:5 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Through the miracle of redemption, Saul of Tarsus was instantly changed from a strong-willed and forceful Pharisee into a humble and devoted bondservant of the Lord Jesus.<br><br>There is nothing miraculous or mysterious about the things we can explain. We control what we are able to explain, consequently it is only natural to seek an explanation for everything. It is not natural to obey, yet it is not necessarily sinful to disobey. There can be no real disobedience, nor any moral virtue in obedience, unless a person recognizes the higher authority of the one giving the orders. If this recognition does not exist, even the one giving the orders may view the other personÂ’s disobedience as freedom. If one rules another by saying, "You must do this," and, "You will do that," he breaks the human spirit, making it unfit for God. A person is simply a slave for obeying, unless behind his obedience is the recognition of a holy God.<br><br>Many people begin coming to God once they stop being religious, because there is only one master of the human heartÂ—Jesus Christ, not religion. But "Woe is me" if after seeing Him I still will not obey ( Isaiah 6:5 , also see Isaiah 6:1 ). Jesus will never insist that I obey, but if I donÂ’t,I have already begun to sign the death certificate of the Son of God in my soul. When I stand face to face with Jesus Christ and say, "I will not obey," He will never insist. But when I do this, I am backing away from the recreating power of His redemption. It makes no difference to GodÂ’s grace what an abomination I am, if I will only come to the light. But "Woe is me" if I refuse the light (see John 3:19-21 ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Doorway to the Kingdom </strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Blessed are the poor in spirit . . .  Â— Matthew 5:3 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Beware of thinking of our Lord as only a teacher. If Jesus Christ is only a teacher, then all He can do is frustrate me by setting a standard before me I cannot attain. What is the point of presenting me with such a lofty ideal if I cannot possibly come close to reaching it? I would be happier if I never knew it. What good is there in telling me to be what I can never beÂ—to be "pure in heart" ( Matthew 5:8 ), to do more than my duty, or to be completely devoted to God? I must know Jesus Christ as my Savior before His teaching has any meaning for me other than that of a lofty ideal which only leads to despair. But when I am born again by the Spirit of God, I know that Jesus Christ did not come only to teachÂ—He came to <span style="font-style: italic;">make me what He teaches I should be</span>. The redemption means that Jesus Christ can place within anyone the same nature that ruled His own life, and all the standards God gives us are based on that nature.<br><br>The teaching of the Sermon on the Mount produces a sense of despair in the natural manÂ—exactly what Jesus means for it to do. As long as we have some self-righteous idea that we can carry out our LordÂ’s teaching, God will allow us to continue until we expose our own ignorance by stumbling over some obstacle in our way. Only then are we willing to come to Him as paupers and receive from Him. "Blessed are the poor in spirit . . . ." This is the first principle in the kingdom of God. The underlying foundation of Jesus ChristÂ’s kingdom is poverty, not possessions; not making decisions for Jesus, but having such a sense of absolute futility that we finally admit, "Lord, I cannot even begin to do it." Then Jesus says, "Blessed are you . . ." ( Matthew 5:11 ). This is the doorway to the kingdom, and yet it takes us so long to believe that we are actually poor! The knowledge of our own poverty is what brings us to the proper place where Jesus Christ accomplishes His work.</div>

Â— 1 Thessalonians 4:3 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>The Death Side.</strong> In sanctification God has to deal with us on the death side as well as on the life side. Sanctification requires our coming to the place of death, but many of us spend so much time there that we become morbid. There is always a tremendous battle before sanctification is realizedÂ—something within us pushing with resentment against the demands of Christ. When the Holy Spirit begins to show us what sanctification means, the struggle starts immediately. Jesus said, "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate . . . his own life . . . he cannot be My disciple" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+14:26" rel="nofollow">Luke 14:26</a> ).<br><br>In the process of sanctification, the Spirit of God will strip me down until there is nothing left but myself, and that is the place of death. Am I willing to be myself and nothing more? Am I willing to have no friends, no father, no brother, and no self-interestÂ—simply to be ready for death? That is the condition required for sanctification. No wonder Jesus said, "I did not come to bring peace but a sword" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+10:34" rel="nofollow">Matthew 10:34</a> ). This is where the battle comes, and where so many of us falter. We refuse to be identified with the death of Jesus Christ on this point. We say, "But this is so strict. Surely He does not require that of me." Our Lord is strict, and He does require that of us.<br><br>Am I willing to reduce myself down to simply "me"? Am I determined enough to strip myself of all that my friends think of me, and all that I think of myself? Am I willing and determined to hand over my simple naked self to God? Once I am, He will immediately sanctify me completely, and my life will be free from being determined and persistent toward anything except God (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Thessalonians+5:23-24" rel="nofollow">1 Thessalonians 5:23-24</a> ).<br><br>When I pray, "Lord, show me what sanctification means for me," He will show me. It means being made one with Jesus. Sanctification is not something Jesus puts in meÂ—it is <span style="font-style: italic;">Himself</span> in me (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+Corinthians+1:30" rel="nofollow">1 Corinthians 1:30</a> ).<br><br>=======<br><br>I had to tri-read this..</div>

Â— 1 Corinthians 1:30 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>The Life Side.</strong> The mystery of sanctification is that the perfect qualities of Jesus Christ are imparted as a gift to me, not gradually, but instantly once I enter by faith into the realization that He "became for [me] . . . sanctification . . . ." Sanctification means nothing less than the holiness of Jesus becoming mine and being exhibited in my life.<br><br>The most wonderful secret of living a holy life does not lie in imitating Jesus, but in letting the perfect qualities of Jesus exhibit themselves in my human flesh. Sanctification is "Christ in you . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Colossians+1:27" rel="nofollow">Colossians 1:27</a> ). It is <span style="font-style: italic;">His</span> wonderful life that is imparted to me in sanctificationÂ— imparted by faith as a sovereign gift of GodÂ’s grace. Am I willing for God to make sanctification as real in me as it is in His Word?<br><br>Sanctification means the impartation of the holy qualities of Jesus Christ to me. It is the gift of His patience, love, holiness, faith, purity, and godliness that is exhibited in and through every sanctified soul. Sanctification is not drawing from Jesus the power to be holyÂ—it is drawing from Jesus the very holiness that was exhibited in Him, and that He now exhibits in me. Sanctification is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">impartation, not an imitation</span>. Imitation is something altogether different. The perfection of everything is in Jesus Christ, and the mystery of sanctification is that all the perfect qualities of Jesus are at my disposal. Consequently, I slowly but surely begin to live a life of inexpressible order, soundness, and holinessÂ—". . . kept by the power of God . . ."

The only thing that exceeds right-doing is right-being. Jesus Christ came to place within anyone who would let Him a new heredity that would have a righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and Pharisees. Jesus is saying, "If you are My disciple, you must be right not only in your actions, but also in your motives, your aspirations, and in the deep recesses of the thoughts of your mind." Your motives must be so pure that God Almighty can see nothing to rebuke. Who can stand in the eternal light of God and have nothing for Him to rebuke? Only the Son of God, and Jesus Christ claims that through His redemption He can place within anyone His own nature and make that person as pure and as simple as a child. The purity that God demands is impossible unless I can be remade within, and that is exactly what Jesus has undertaken to do through His redemption.<br><br>No one can make himself pure by obeying laws. Jesus Christ does not give us rules and regulationsÂ—He gives us His teachings which are truths that can only be interpreted by His nature which He places within us. The great wonder of Jesus ChristÂ’s salvation is that He changes our heredity. He does not change human natureÂ—He changes its source, and thereby its motives as well.<br></div>

His father would occasionally test the dog's obedience. He would place a tempting piece of meat on the floor and give the command, "No!" The dog, who must have had a strong urge to go for the meat, was placed in a most difficult situationÂ—to obey or disobey his master's command.<br><br>Dunkin said, "The dog never looked at the meat. He seemed to feel that if he did, the temptation to disobey would be too great. So he looked steadily at my father's face." Dunkin then made this spiritual application: "There is a lesson for us all. Always look up to the Master's face."<br><br>Yes, that's good advice. God, of course, will not tempt us to do wrong (James 1:13). We do encounter many temptations, though, and if we keep our eyes fixed on the Lord Jesus we will be able to overcome them. When confronted by enticements that could easily overwhelm us, we need to look to Christ and follow His direction. "Seeing" Him and "hearing" Him as He is revealed in the Scriptures will give us the discernment to know what's right, and the desire and strength to obey Him.<br><br>Are you battling temptation? Keep your eyes fixed on the Lord Jesus. He will give you victory.

However, though no longer deceived, our experience of disillusionment may actually leave us cynical and overly critical in our judgment of others. But the disillusionment that comes from God brings us to the point where we see people as they really are, yet without any cynicism or any stinging and bitter criticism. Many of the things in life that inflict the greatest injury, grief, or pain, stem from the fact that we suffer from illusions. We are not true to one another as facts, seeing each other as we really are; we are only true to our misconceived ideas of one another. According to our thinking, everything is either delightful and good, or it is evil, malicious, and cowardly.<br><br>Refusing to be disillusioned is the cause of much of the suffering of human life. And this is how that suffering happensÂ—if we love someone, but do not love God, we demand total perfection and righteousness from that person, and when we do not get it we become cruel and vindictive; yet we are demanding of a human being something which he or she cannot possibly give. There is only one Being who can completely satisfy to the absolute depth of the hurting human heart, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ. Our Lord is so obviously uncompromising with regard to every human relationship because He knows that every relationship that is not based on faithfulness to Himself will end in disaster. Our Lord trusted no one, and never placed His faith in people, yet He was never suspicious or bitter. Our LordÂ’s confidence in God, and in what GodÂ’s grace could do for anyone, was so perfect that He never despaired, never giving up hope for any person. If our trust is placed in human beings, we will end up despairing of everyone.<br></div>

Carelessness is an insult to the Holy Spirit. We should have no carelessness about us either in the way we worship God, or even in the way we eat and drink.<br><br>Not only must our relationship to God be right, but the outward expression of that relationship must also be right. Ultimately, God will allow nothing to escape; every detail of our lives is under His scrutiny. God will bring us back in countless ways to the same point over and over again. And He never tires of bringing us back to that one point until we learn the lesson, because His purpose is to produce the finished product. It may be a problem arising from our impulsive nature, but again and again, with the most persistent patience, God has brought us back to that one particular point. Or the problem may be our idle and wandering thinking, or our independent nature and self-interest. Through this process, God is trying to impress upon us the one thing that is not entirely right in our lives.<br><br>We have been having a wonderful time in our studies over the revealed truth of GodÂ’s redemption, and our hearts are perfect toward Him. And His wonderful work in us makes us know that overall we are right with Him. "Let patience have its perfect work . . . ." The Holy Spirit speaking through James said, "Now let your patience become a finished product." Beware of becoming careless over the small details of life and saying, "Oh, that will have to do for now." Whatever it may be, God will point it out with persistence until we become entirely His.</div>

But it actually means being delivered in adversity, which is something very different. "He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. No evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Psalm+91:1,10" rel="nofollow">Psalm 91:1,10</a> )Â—the place where you are at one with God.<br><br>If you are a child of God, you will certainly encounter adversities, but Jesus says you should not be surprised when they come. "In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." He is saying, "There is nothing for you to fear." The same people who refused to talk about their adversities before they were saved often complain and worry after being born again because they have the wrong idea of what it means to live the life of a saint.<br><br>God does not give us overcoming lifeÂ—He gives us life as we overcome. The strain of life is what builds our strength. If there is no strain, there will be no strength. Are you asking God to give you life, liberty, and joy? He cannot, unless you are willing to accept the strain. And once you face the strain, you will immediately get the strength. Overcome your own timidity and take the first step. Then God will give you nourishmentÂ—"To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Revelation+2:7" rel="nofollow">Revelation 2:7</a> ). If you completely give of yourself physically, you become exhausted. But when you give of yourself spiritually, you get more strength. God never gives us strength for tomorrow, or for the next hour, but only for the strain of the moment. Our temptation is to face adversities from the standpoint of our own common sense. But a saint can "be of good cheer" even when seemingly defeated by adversities, because victory is absurdly impossible to everyone, except God.<br><br>=======<br><br>And when we root ourselves in the firm foundation of Jesus, the storms shall not topple us, instead, we'll be beautifully crafted by the Master's hand.</div>

As he was approaching the conclusion of his studies, his advisor invited him to come into his office and informed him that his dissertation had been rejected.<br><br>My friend's first thought was of thousands of dollars and 5 years of his life taking flight, and his heart sank. But then he thought of the words of the hymn by Rhea Miller: "I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold, I'd rather be His than have riches untold; . . . I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today." And then my friend laughedÂ—for he realized that nothing of eternal value had been lost.<br><br>How we respond to loss is all a matter of perspective. One person is absorbed with the permanent; the other with the passing. One stores up treasure in heaven; the other accumulates it here on earth. One stays with a difficult marriage because heaven is on ahead; another moves out and looks for happiness in another mate. While one believes that happiness is found in being rich and famous, Christ's followers are willing to suffer poverty, hunger, indignity, and shame because of "the glory that will be revealed" (1 Peter 5:1).<br><br>Wouldn't you "rather have Jesus"?

But they understood none of these things . . .  Â— Luke 18:31, 34 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>God called Jesus Christ to what seemed absolute disaster. And Jesus Christ called His disciples to see Him put to death, leading every one of them to the place where their hearts were broken. His life was an absolute failure from every standpoint except GodÂ’s. But what seemed to be failure from manÂ’s standpoint was a triumph from GodÂ’s standpoint, because GodÂ’s purpose is never the same as manÂ’s purpose.<br><br>This bewildering call of God comes into our lives as well. The call of God can never be understood absolutely or explained externally; it is a call that can only be perceived and understood internally by our true inner-nature. The call of God is like the call of the seaÂ—no one hears it except the person who has the nature of the sea in him. What God calls us to cannot be definitely stated, because His call is simply to be His friend to accomplish His own purposes. Our real test is in truly believing that God knows what He desires. The things that happen do not happen by chanceÂ—they happen entirely by the decree of God. God is sovereignly working out His own purposes.<br><br>If we are in fellowship and oneness with God and recognize that He is taking us into His purposes, then we will no longer strive to find out what His purposes are. As we grow in the Christian life, it becomes simpler to us, because we are less inclined to say, "I wonder why God allowed this or that?" And we begin to see that the compelling purpose of God lies behind everything in life, and that God is divinely shaping us into oneness with that purpose. A Christian is someone who trusts in the knowledge and the wisdom of God, not in his own abilities. If we have a purpose of our own, it destroys the simplicity and the calm, relaxed pace which should be characteristic of the children of God.</div>

Â— John 16:26 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We too often think of the Cross of Christ as something we have to get through, yet we get through for the purpose of getting into it. The Cross represents only one thing for usÂ—complete, entire, absolute identification with the Lord Jesus ChristÂ—and there is nothing in which this identification is more real to us than in prayer.<br><br>"Your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+6:8" rel="nofollow">Matthew 6:8</a> ). Then why should we ask? The point of prayer is not to get answers from God, but to have perfect and complete oneness with Him. If we pray only because we want answers, we will become irritated and angry with God. We receive an answer every time we pray, but it does not alwayscome in the way we expect, and our spiritual irritation shows our refusal to identify ourselves truly with our Lord in prayer. We are not here to prove that God answers prayer, but to be living trophies of GodÂ’s grace.<br><br>". . . I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; for the Father Himself loves you . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+16:26-27" rel="nofollow">John 16:26-27</a> ). Have you reached such a level of intimacy with God that the only thing that can account for your prayer life is that it has become one with the prayer life of Jesus Christ? Has our Lord exchanged your life with His vital life? If so, then "in that day" you will be so closely identified with Jesus that there will be no distinction.<br><br>When prayer seems to be unanswered, beware of trying to place the blame on someone else. That is always a trap of Satan. When you seem to have no answer, there is always a reasonÂ—God uses these times to give you deep personal instruction, and it is not for anyone else but you.</div>

Am I continually in touch with the reality of God, or do I pray only when things have gone wrongÂ—when there is some disturbance in my life? I must learn to identify myself closely with my Lord in ways of holy fellowship and oneness that some of us have not yet even begun to learn. ". . . I must be about My FatherÂ’s business"Â—and I must learn to live every moment of my life in my FatherÂ’s house.<br><br>Think about your own circumstances. Are you so closely identified with the LordÂ’s life that you are simply a child of God, continually talking to Him and realizing that everything comes from His hands? Is the eternal Child in you living in His FatherÂ’s house? Is the grace of His ministering life being worked out through you in your home, your business, and in your circle of friends? Have you been wondering why you are going through certain circumstances? In fact, it is not that you have to go through them. It is because of your relationship with the Son of God who comes, through the providential will of His Father, into your life. You must allow Him to have His way with you, staying in perfect oneness with Him.<br><br>The life of your Lord is to become your vital, simple life, and the way He worked and lived among people while here on earth must be the way He works and lives in you.<br><br>=======<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oceanic:</div><div class="quote_body">hi all juz popping to 2 say  Hi!<br>been ages i came in I know but due to my busy life and so tired by e end of the day i could hardly come in n browse thru e thread...<br><br>God bless everyone!<br>and have a nice upcoming wkend <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div></blockquote>Hi ocean, thanks for dropping by, i'll pass this message on to the rest just to make sure they saw your "hi".

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Holy Suffering of the Saint </strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good . . .  Â— 1 Peter 4:19 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Choosing to suffer means that there must be something wrong with you, but choosing GodÂ’s willÂ—even if it means you will sufferÂ—is something very different. No normal, healthy saint ever chooses suffering; he simply chooses GodÂ’s will, just as Jesus did, whether it means suffering or not. And no saint should ever dare to interfere with the lesson of suffering being taught in another saintÂ’s life.<br><br>The saint who satisfies the heart of Jesus will make other saints strong and mature for God. But the people used to strengthen us are never those who sympathize with us; in fact, we are hindered by those who give us their sympathy, because sympathy only serves to weaken us. No one better understands a saint than the saint who is as close and as intimate with Jesus as possible. If we accept the sympathy of another saint, our spontaneous feeling is, "God is dealing too harshly with me and making my life too difficult." That is why Jesus said that self-pity was of the devil (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+16:21-23" rel="nofollow">Matthew 16:21-23</a> ). We must be merciful to GodÂ’s reputation. It is easy for us to tarnish GodÂ’s character because He never argues back; He never tries to defend or vindicate Himself. Beware of thinking that Jesus needed sympathy during His life on earth. He refused the sympathy of people because in His great wisdom He knew that no one on earth understood His purpose (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+16:23" rel="nofollow">Matthew 16:23</a> ). He accepted only the sympathy of His Father and the angels (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+15:10" rel="nofollow">Luke 15:10</a> ).<br><br>Look at GodÂ’s incredible waste of His saints, according to the worldÂ’s judgment. God seems to plant His saints in the most useless places. And then we say, "God intends for me to be here because I am so useful to Him." Yet Jesus never measured His life by how or where He was of the greatest use. God places His saints where they will bring the most glory to Him, and we are totally incapable of judging where that may be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Theology of Resting in God </strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Â— Matthew 8:26 </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>When we are afraid, the least we can do is pray to God. But our Lord has a right to expect that those who name His name have an underlying confidence in Him. God expects His children to be so confident in Him that in any crisis they are the ones who are reliable. Yet our trust is only in God up to a certain point, then we turn back to the elementary panic-stricken prayers of those people who do not even know God. We come to our witsÂ’ end, showing that we donÂ’t have even the slightest amount of confidence in Him or in His sovereign control of the world. To us He seems to be asleep, and we can see nothing but giant, breaking waves on the sea ahead of us.<br><br>". . . O you of little faith!" What a stinging pain must have shot through the disciples as they surely thought to themselves, "We missed the mark again!" And what a sharp pain will go through us when we suddenly realize that we could have produced complete and utter joy in the heart of Jesus by remaining absolutely confident in Him, in spite of what we were facing.<br><br>There are times when there is no storm or crisis in our lives, and we do all that is humanly possible. But it is when a crisis arises that we instantly reveal upon whom we rely. If we have been learning to worship God and to place our trust in Him, the crisis will reveal that we can go to the point of breaking, yet without breaking our confidence in Him.<br><br>We have been talking quite a lot about sanctification, but what will be the result in our lives? It will be expressed in our lives as a peaceful resting in God, which means a total oneness with Him. And this oneness will make us not only blameless in His sight, but also a profound joy to Him.</div>
