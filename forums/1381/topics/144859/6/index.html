Yah, these people are not executed by the government but then you have our regular citizens killing gays stating that it's rightful to do so based on the Bible..<br><br>and singaporemacross also highlighted that there was indeed a teaching within the catholics that encouraged tolerance.. but somehow, most priests do not follow such a teaching..<br><br>as a singaporean, we are usually sheltered from events happening within the middle east.. however, practices happening in US/Europe will affect us in a more direct way..

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I think u get a wrong conclusion. animals don't have a religion doesn't means human must have  In fact animals, who do not eat the fruit of wisdom and is suppose to be the purest state defined by god do not even pray or worship him. sn't tat a sign tat men shouldn't have a religion as well</blockquote><blockquote>aiyoh .. if you want to argue it the religious way .. please go and study the religious text before you shoot!<br><br>It is not about fruit of wisdom, but that animals <strong>lack the conscious or spiri</strong>t put in human by God. God breathed into mankind the neshamat, something not mentioned in the creation of animals.

All the while it boils down to the above statement made by u. U claim tat god breath into mankind neshamat.<br><br>1. U fail to prove tat God do not breath anything to the animals. U can't say tat men were special based on the line tat god breath life into dust because u do not know how god create the other animals. U say men is special, then u have to prove it.<br><br><blockquote>if you want to argue it your way, it is still dumb.<br><br>You know why ..

SO it proves tat u r wrong tat animals can't talk with god. In fact u agree the above in the sentence below<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lets putit tis way then. God is omni potent. Snakes can communicate (with eve) Therefore if god is really all-powerful, he could talk with anything comunicatable.<br><br>I have no dispute with this sentence. But what were we arguing actually? </span><br><br>U claim tat tis snake is unique, however u can't show any evidence tat it is unique, neither can u show tat there r a lot of snakes to begin with. U don't have any claims to show the above wrong. And the rest of the sh!t u write is just avoiding the question and running away from proving your points. If u can't prove it, then obviously u show u r dumb and comment on something which u have lesser knowledge of. So on no grounds can u say tat animals do not have conscious or spirit because they can speak and have conscious. These r the signs tat u insisted to prove tat animals do not have spirit and it was shown tat u r wrong. So in the end u show all your earlier points r full of errors and tat is wat we r trying to prove till now.</div>

If mankind is created in the image of God, then the holy breath part is not essential liao (but still important). This is supporting evidence to show why man behaves differently from animals. So what if mankind is just moulded from clay and so are animals? We don't care about physicial differences.<br><br><strong>Now the issue is on animal.

If mankind and animals were created the same way, then there is no way to achieve the distinction. Note that man and animals are quite similar physically (we are &gt; 90% similar with the chimps). If animals also have the neshamat chayim, then we would all be the same.<br><br>I repeat the bible is still primarily a literature and not presented as a rigorous proof manuscript. As such, the way they present the information should be subjected to literature analysis rather than [strict] logicial analysis. I maintain the holy breath verse is there cos it is to tell us there is a spiritual creation in us as well, compared to the "created from dust" - a physical creation.<br><br><strong>I don't need all snakes to talk to prove my point.
