Sometimes its just hard to reason with Christians on certian issues becuase they would put forward an argument on the sole ground that "because the Bible says so". This is circular logic becuase they treat the bible as axiomatic without proving thus in advance. Using religious convictions to cement one's argument simply does not tally. If it does, people would quote the bible in examination essays. They dont do that, do they? I do respect whatever religion people choose to believe in but it is dangerous to impose their own religious thinking on others.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>29 July 2005 Â· 12:34 AM<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">If Christians do not use the bible to reason with u, then what should they use as a basis for discussion?

But still we shouldn't spread discrimination right? I mean, when SIS says of someone who "doesn't like indians/chinese/whites/blacks" he means those who feel that indians/chinese/whites/blacks are inferior in any way. it applies the same to sexuality, and I must say that there are some of your religion who are less than cordial about their discrimination, and then when confronted about it, claim that I just because I do not agree with said discrimination, I am the actual bigot. It is very disconcerting, especially when said persons are supposedly God's followers.</div>

U r not obliged to like every human but in the event tat he had done nothing wrong, or can do nothing to stop tis, u should treat them all as equal, with the same respect and stop insisting them to follow wat u do.</div>

Then married for what?  There is no purpose for the marriage in the first place.  Ppl get married to have a family together, not just be with the partner every day.  If getting married is just to be with each other, then there is no need to be married in the first place.  There is no reason to.

According to some experts, all men have a spectrum of preference to the same or opposite sex. For homo they have a higher preference to same sex, much like there r some people who r taller or shorter.<br><br>About procreation, is it their burden to procreate ? They choose not to, much like people who r single. If u felt tat procreation is a duty of the people then the church should condemn people from beng single, such as being a priest. Who knows if these priest can get married and have children, he may come out with nobel prize winning children or politican tat solved a conflict or musician tat make brand new music</div>
