            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know why am I still talking about such a stupid topic<br><br><blockquote>Can't you see it? If mankind is created in the image of God, then the holy breath part is not essential liao (but still important). This is supporting evidence to show why man behaves differently from animals. So what if mankind is just moulded from clay and so are animals? We don't care about physicial differences. </blockquote>And the point tat animals remains the state they r created remains the same. God make animals gay. Whether is it different or same the fact still remain tat god made animals gay.<br><br><blockquote>Prove to me god made these animals gay?<br><br>If you see a child with Down's Syndrome, does it mean the symptom existed in Adam or Eve? </blockquote>God created animals. If he doesn't make them gay, who did ? Tis is especially true since god is suppose to hate homosexual acts, christian believe everything has a cause, animals remains the state they r in from the moment they r created.<br><br>A child with down's syndrome may means tat god created some bacteria tat can onyl live by attacking the nerve of men.<br><br><blockquote>They made the wrong statement cos they werent supposed to make those statements. If SIS made a wrong statement in science, ok let's say he keep on making wrong statements in science, do we automatically dismiss his views on religion? ah ha .. </blockquote>They made those statement and frankly most of them r popes or bishop etc. They fact remains tat they made many wrong statements before, officially broadcast it and worse still they r not wrong from their interpretation from the bible. The problem lies with the bible. Is tat wat u wanna conclude ?<br><br><blockquote>Where is the bible wrong with regards to those issues?<br><br>Slavery and prosecuting lefthanders .. what's wrong with them? </blockquote>If u think it is right, then u should start slavery system again and prosecute left handers now<br><br><blockquote>I repeat the bible is still primarily a literature and not presented as a rigorous proof manuscript. As such, the way they present the information should be subjected to literature analysis rather than [strict] logicial analysis. I maintain the holy breath verse is there cos it is to tell us there is a spiritual creation in us as well, compared to the "created from dust" - a physical creation. </blockquote>The bible itself try to play the role of a science textbook by explaining how certain phenomenons come about. But nevertheless, if u wanna compare by "literature", then in it there never states anything about the breath being important. They just casually mention it briefly. U r putting words into tat statement by saying it is very important and tat animals don't have it<br><br><blockquote>Jesus is often compared with Adam. I'm sure you know this is Christian theology. The temptation of Jesus is to show the triumph over the devil, which Adam had failed. </blockquote>Trivial point. This does not means the snake is satan<br><br><blockquote>God never promised you fairness. This is a misconception. If God is considered as "fair", then beautitudes lines like "blessed are the poor .." would not exist</blockquote>Good. tell tat to people who claim he is a just god.</div>

If u believe in evolution u wouldn't believe adam is created from dust  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I say the bible neevr states any changes with animals. They never rebel them they never really change according to wat bible states. So they r really in the original form tat god intended them to be<br><br><blockquote>You are self contradicting.

After that everything is formed from the initial elements (hydrogen?) present. </blockquote>I think u r getting a bit off point. U still can't say tat the breath does not coem to animals and tat the breath is so important. Whether got big bang or no big bang, it seems off point and obviously I don't see any link between big bang and hydrogen with god<br><br><blockquote>Mankind is special. The author told us we are so 'cos we had the holy breath in us. You have to read it from the author/bible's perspective, and not your own theory. The point is we had a spiritual creation (we had something personal from God, so to speak) while animals don't. </blockquote>The point is, as said many times before, u can't say the breath is unique to men only. The bible itself never say it is unique as well. The only conclusion is no conclusion. Reading it from the author perspective I can only see it is mention so breifly it doesn't seems to be important.<br><br><blockquote>Jesus is often labelled as the second Adam, correct me if i'm wrong? The NT likes to parallel events in the OT, to boost their claim that Jesus is the Messiah.<br><br>I suppose most Christians agree that the snake is Satan. </blockquote>So in the end u still can't prove satan is the snake, much like adam isn't jesus. If u say satan is snake then I can use the same reasoning to say adam is jesus.<br><br><blockquote>Bingo .. I was driving at that precisely! Christians always say God is just .. when do you hear them say God is fair? </blockquote>Lets put it tis way. How can an unfair god be just ? If someone is not fair, tat is he side with his friends and family, how can he be just ?<br><br>from oxford dictionary: morally right and fair<br>dictionary .com: Honorable and fair in one's dealings and actions</div>

I think you provide answers which are illogical unacceptable because you seem to be going round the questions and avoiding a stand and you defend it by jumping to a conclusion that any answers are possible.
