Generally, common folks believe that it came with your life (congenital), I believe, to Christians, it's more like misused of freewill to rebel against God (by choice). Regardless, till now, nobody really have the answer to this question.<br><br>This debate is pretty meaningless because two parties are standing on different side, shouting from different angles. What SIS and those who sees in his view, would agree that it is congenital and thus also a natural product of this world - something that God (whether he believes there is such a thing) creates and knows about it - thus NATURAL. 'God' cannot make something that he rejects or not know of because God is perfect.<br><br>What our Christian forumites feels is that homosexuality is unnatural because it is NOT a product made by God - somewhat a decision made by man (sin) to rebel against God. Sins, which are no difference from murder, stealing, etc. God give us the freewill to choose and gays choose the path which would sadden God, therefore, like other sins, there is a need to state a strong stand against walking into such position.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> One speaks about Science and the other... Religion. Obviously there is a conflict.<br><br>Something to share with you people; yunhaier is slightly versed in the Art of Astrology (old wisdom passed from the ancients, which combined Science and Arts into one), AND homosexuality can be seen from a person's astrology birthchart - I have seen before. (For those interested, astrologically speaking, A person Gay often have strong affliction in 5th &amp; 7th house, involving Venus &amp; Uranus. No gay person are born without afflicted Uranus/Venus). Before you go wtf you are talking about... one may probably ask 'then why.'<br><br>Because Christian doesn't believe in Reincarnation - this never applies to them, thus rejected. (FYI, reincarnation and karma together doesn't mean you kill a pig you will be reborn as a pig. It's definitely not - but for this moment, short of explaination, just think reincarnation as a beginning of a new chapter and ending of an old one... and reprinting your entire personality into the new chapter)<br><br><strong>Cruelity in love from past lives </strong>(old chapter) <strong>brought forth the affliction </strong>(into the new chapter) because such qualities/attributes/behavior, ain't evolved spiritually/emotionally/physically. E.g. If you have been possessive in love in that lifetime and NOT evolved, this carries it with you. (You will probably get some drift for the other thingy).<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> What is homosexuality related to?<br><br>Issue of Love, Relationship and Sex. If you think very carefully, this has little to do with anything else.<br><br>If you want to understand homosexuality, you got to know alot about these three disciplines. Like-wise, Science cannot explain Religion, vice vista, because these two thingy doesn't stand on similar grounds, will clash when scientific views go against theology views.<br><br>P.S: The Greek believe that lightning bolts were created when Zeus is angry - that belief cease to exist when Science came into the picture. Maybe when Man understand and grasp full knowledge in the study of love, relationship and sex, the issue of homosexuality will be clear?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Both parents might are straight, but the father carries a gene, which we will call "a" while the mother carries a gene, which we'll call gene "b". The presence of one of those genes in an individual will not result in homosexuality, but when combined during interception of a fetus, the result will be homosexuality. I think that is very strong evidence that homosexuality is intended to be passed on in any natural species, indeed, instead of being weeded out. Besides, I thought that christians do not believe in darwinian evolution?</div>

I would wish that society has never forced him into doing something he wasn't happy doing. IF I was the wife, yes i would be distressed. Because society has pushed me into this tragedy. If society were more open, he would have no problems entering a gay relationship, and I would be able to marry a man who was truely interested in women. Now, instead, I am stuck with someone who I now know was unhappy in having to marry me, but was pressurised to, and who will remain unhappy in this relationship simply because there is no future in it for him, despite us having children. Yes I would be very very distraught. I might decide to even become a gay activist and fight for their equal human rights, showing the world myself and my poor family as an example, an example of how I became, how my husband became, how my children became victims of society!<br><br>I sure would forgive him. He is a victim of society as much as I am.</div>
