            <div class='col-md body'>1. So why r gays wrong when u have committed a sin tat has equally bad influence as being gay<br><br>Who defines sin? Is it a sin to be a Christian/Priest?<br><br>Are the influences equally bad as u think? Which has greater acceptance in society?<br><br>2. Who say being a priest means u r in good hands. If your family is jewish or muslim, they in fact think u r destinied for destruction when u join as a priest for catholic. When u r gay, u have a higher chance of salvation<br><br>ThatÂ’s only when u are assuming the priest comes from another background other than catholic.<br><br>If u are a gay in jewish or muslim family, chances are ur family would think u do not have any chance of salvation as well.<br><br>3. No. I am saying naturally animals don't worship nor believe in existence of god. So if natural is good, then following nature men shouldn't have religion<br><br>Then why dun u join the animals?<br></div>
