Do you see the first couple talking to a platoon of snakes?<br><br><blockquote>And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:<br><br>So u mean god talk to himself ? </blockquote>Was the serpent shown to talk back? From this, can you say the serpent can talk to God?<br><br><blockquote>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<br><br>Doesn't tat show snakes know wat is god too ? So eve talking to thin air again ? </blockquote>Are you saying ALL SERPENTS (and perhaps all animals) know God? Haha ..<br><br>You still have not established your point. You know lah, your evidence not strong enough to convince me. The serpent is a special case. It has a mind of its own. It can tempt Eve. It knows God. No other animals is shown to behave this way. Also, this serpent seems to lord over Eve instead of the other way round (God told the couple to be stewards of the Earth, to lord over the animals).<br><br>But the conclusion from this is absurd. Serpents, and animals, did not eat any fruit of wisdom. If you agree, they did not have a change of state of mind. The only change we seen is snakes are condemned to crawl? So are you saying any snake or any animal now can talk to human and even tempt human? Since you maintain they could talk with God and human back then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Neither of them is any organisation accredited by SEAZA, ARAZPA, WAZA, IUCN or AZA etc etc... We don't read about animals on a radio website or a gay website (one or two of the links are gay website, btw... hmm). Likewise, we do not quote anything about Jesus Christ from The Straits Times newspapers. So if you want to quote, you have to quote from the correct source. Can you?<br><br>The last one is an article on a book whereby the author did say that it is rare for animals to be exclusively homosexual. Note the word : RARE.<br><br>Also I am asking for examples from your knowledge of male species that reject female species, like the human gays.<br><br>As for the NARTH website, which is one of the non relevant website to quote on my questions about animals, I found out something rather interesting and quite appropriate in this discussion: NARTH does not agree that Homosexuality is normal.<br><br>http://www.narth.com/docs/bornthatway.html<br>We would not conclude that homosexuality is a normal variant if we held to this simple definition, offered by a clinician more than fifty years ago: Normality is "that which functions in accordance with its design."<br><br>http://www.narth.com/menus/statement.html<br>What is "Normal"?<br>Fifty years ago, researcher C.D. King offered a very useful definition of "normal." The practical wisdom of that definition is still apparent. Normality, he said, is "that which functions according to its design."<br><br>As clinicians, we have witnessed the intense suffering caused by homosexuality, which many of our members see as a "failure to function according to design." Homosexuality distorts the natural bond of friendship that would naturally unite persons of the same sex. It threatens the continuity of traditional male-female marriage--a bond which is naturally anchored by the complementarity of the sexes, and has long been considered essential for the protection of children.<br><br>In males, homosexuality it is associated with poor relationship with father; difficulty individuating from mother; a sense of masculine deficit; and a persistent belief of having been different from, and misunderstood by, same-sex childhood peers. In adulthood we also see a persistent pattern of maladaptive behaviors and a documented higher level of psychiatric complaints.<br><br>In short, there are two points to note from your findings :<br><br>Animal gays are RARE.<br>Homosexuality is NOT normal.</blockquote>U get the whole idea wrong. U r talking on 2 things. First u r asking me to show u animals r agys. I succeed in showing u tat animals r indeed gays. And up till now u can't really prove them to be wrong and u acknowledge tat there r indeed gay animals. And for some animals, it is indeed true tat they do commit gay action regularly. If u want, show me a website tat states tat giraffe do not perform "necking and mounting". Show me sheeps,vultures penguin etc r not gay. U say tat animals who r gays r rare, <strong>BUT NO MATTER WAT THEY EXISTS</strong>. If they exist and they r perfectly normal, and i have fulfill my task of presenting my point to your reply earlier<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I am happy to see you talking about animals, since I have "worked with" them for some years. So I see more relevance in the discussion for me. Name me a species that I can find whereby the males only want to be males (since you say animals are gays), and reject the female species. I don't see them in the Primates and I don't see them in the Cats. When mating season comes (which is usually after the winter), the male will automatically look for female or vice versa (in some species). I don't see any male animal that, during a mating season, look for another male. Maybe I am less knowledgable than you or maybe you are the animal expert while I am not. Can you enlighten me on that by giving me examples? </span><br><br>homo sexuality is not normal ? U knwo there r a lot of alternative website tat show it is indeed normal. Fact is NOBODY knows for sure. So as said before, shouldn't we give them the benefit of the doubt ?</div>

Also, this serpent seems to lord over Eve instead of the other way round (God told the couple to be stewards of the Earth, to lord over the animals).<br><br>But the conclusion from this is absurd. Serpents, and animals, did not eat any fruit of wisdom. If you agree, they did not have a change of state of mind. The only change we seen is snakes are condemned to crawl? So are you saying any snake or any animal now can talk to human and even tempt human? Since you maintain they could talk with God and human back then</blockquote>Snake is created equally with other animals. THERE R NOTHING IN IT TAT SHOWS SNAKE IS exclusively or specially CREATED LIKE MEN. YET THEY APPEAR TO BE IN A SENESE SMARTER THAN THEM AND KNOW GOD. There r now more evidence tat show u r wrong than u r right. U talk about now, but clearly the snakes have been cursed, they gone through periods like noah, they r cursed by god to have emnity to men and perhaps tat is why men and snake can;t communicate now. If they can unerstand each other, they may not become enemies</div>

Such bodies include:<br><br>American Psychiatric Association (APA)<br>American Academy of Pediatrics<br>American Medical Association<br>American Psychological Association<br>American Counseling Association<br>American Federation of Teachers<br>National Association of School Psychologists<br>National Association of Social Workers<br>National Association of Secondary School Principals<br>National Education Association<br>Royal College of Nursing.<br>On the question of whether therapy can change sexual orientation the APA answers:<br><br>"No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable." [4] (http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html#cantherapychange)<br>Some religious organisations also oppose reparative therapies, including The Interfaith Alliance, New Ways Ministries and People for the American Way.<br><br>In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Counseling Association, American Association of School Administrators, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological Association, American School Health Association, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Social Workers, and National Education Association developed and endorsed a statement reading:<br></div><div class="quote_body">The most important fact about 'reparative therapy,' also sometimes known as 'conversion' therapy, is that it is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major health and mental health professions. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Counseling Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the National Association of Social Workers, together representing more than 477,000 health and mental health professionals, have all taken the position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder and thus there is no need for a 'cure.' ...health and mental health professional organizations do not support efforts to change young people's sexual orientation through 'reparative therapy' and have raised serious concerns about its potential to do harm. </div></blockquote></div>
