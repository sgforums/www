              <p><strong>Baltasar Gracián</strong> is a man of the 17th century, who wrote a good book called <em>"The Oracle, a Manual of the Art of Discretion" </em>or translated liberally and commonly, "<em>The Art of Worldly Wisdom"</em><em>.</em> He's like the <strong>Confucius of Christianity</strong>, <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">. Highly recommended to be in any religious library.</p>
              <p>Examples:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Aphorism #24</p>
              <p>Keep the Imagination under control; sometimes correcting, sometimes assisting it. For it is all-important
              for our happiness, and even sets the reason right. It can tyrannise,
              and is not content with looking on, but influences and even often
              dominates life, causing it to be happy or burdensome according to the
              folly to which it leads. For it makes us either contented or
              discontented with ourselves. Before some it continually holds up the
              penalties of action, and becomes the mortifying lash of these fools. To
              others it promises happiness and adventure with blissful delusion. It
              can do all this unless the most prudent self-control keeps it in
              subjection.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>Aphorism #109</p>
              <p>Be not censorious. There are men of gloomy character who regard everything as faulty, not
              from any evil motive but because it is their nature to. They condemn
              all: these for what they have done, those for what they will do. This
              indicates a nature worse than cruel, vile Indeed. They accuse with such
              exaggeration that they make out of motes beams wherewith to force out
              the eyes. They are always taskmasters who could turn a paradise into a
              prison; if passion intervenes they drive matters to the extreme. A
              noble nature, on the contrary, always knows how to find an excuse for
              failings, if not in the intention, at least from oversight.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>Aphorism #105 Don't be a Bore.<br> <br> The man of one business or of one topic is apt to be heavy. Brevity
              flatters and does better business; it gains by courtesy what it loses
              by curtness. Good things, when short, are twice as good. The
              quintessence of the matter is more effective than a whole farrago of
              details. It is a well-known truth that talkative folk rarely have much
              sense whether in dealing with the matter itself or its formaltreatment.
              There are that serve more for stumbling-stones than centrepieces,
              useless lumber in every one's way. The wise avoid being bores,
              especially to the great, who are fully occupied: it is worse to disturb
              one of them than all the rest. Well said is soon said.</p>
