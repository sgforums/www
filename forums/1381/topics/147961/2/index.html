You have acted as their voices in those threads but you have stopped short of a discussion.  I have not went to other forums and start threads that do not stand well in the forum and just leave it.  It's like going in, spitting, and say goodbye.<br><br>As a mod, I have chosen to delete these threads. Yes I delete threads from time to time.  I feel it's better to have threads deleted than lock them up.  I may have missed threads you think I should delete.  I will get to them.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

How would you like it if we said you were intolerant of our views and had an arrogant attitude? YOU SURE DO!<br><br>What do you know about God? At least the christians here have had first hand experience. You don't want to know about God or Jesus, then don't come here. If you are really seeking, then we will gladly talk to you. Otherwise, don't come here and cause trouble.<br><br>From what I can see in the posts, the topics get recycled every few months... if you all don't believe by now, then why still stay here? You want to change your life? You want to do something other than find fault and be negative all the time, then come here and discuss it... if not, keep your opinions to other parts of sgforums!</div>

The bible says that you are either hot or cold... if you are lukewarm, that is the worst, He will spit you out of His mouth. If you do not have the same amount of passion, then question yourself why some of these so called "zealots" get to you so much! I am full on for God and will not back down from that, the world is so caught up with being politically correct that it has lost the plot! If I call it as it is, then what is it to you? If you cannot handle it, then tough! Go cry elsewhere!<br><br>being a Christian is about being PASSIONATE for GOD! If a catholic believes that Jesus died to save him, then good, if not, then its between him and God, everybody has an opinion, so you are now telling me you have no double standards!? Just read your own posts. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so who made you judge, jury and executioner?</div>
