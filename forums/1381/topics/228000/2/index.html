So he had sex but with the intention of not procretating. He uses contraceptives to prevent that scenario and was struck down. God has never condoned contraceptives and neither did any Christian till 1930s.<br><br>Look at ur Protestant Church Fathers<br><br>The apostolic traditionÂ’s condemnation of contraception is so great that it was followed by Protestants until 1930 and was upheld by all key Protestant Reformers. [b]Martin Luther </strong>said, "[T]he exceedingly foul deed of Onan, the basest of wretches . . . is a most disgraceful sin. It is far more atrocious than incest and adultery. We call it unchastity, yes, a sodomitic sin. For Onan goes in to her; that is, he lies with her and copulates, and when it comes to the point of insemination, spills the semen, lest the woman conceive. Surely at such a time the order of nature established by God in procreation should be followed. Accordingly, it was a most disgraceful crime. . . . Consequently, he deserved to be killed by God. He committed an evil deed. Therefore, God punished him."<br><br><strong>John Calvin </strong>said, "The voluntary spilling of semen outside of intercourse between man and woman is a monstrous thing. Deliberately to withdraw from coitus in order that semen may fall on the ground is doubly monstrous. For this is to extinguish the hope of the race and to kill before he is born the hoped-for offspring."<br><br><strong>John Wesley </strong>warned, "Those sins that dishonor the body are very displeasing to God, and the evidence of vile affections. Observe, the thing which he [Onan] did displeased the LordÂ—and it is to be feared; thousands, especially of single persons, by this very thing, still displease the Lord, and destroy their own souls." (These passages are quoted in Charles D. Provan, The Bible and Birth Control, which contains many quotes by historic Protestant figures who recognize contraceptionÂ’s evils.)<br><br>How has Satan succeeded...Man rationalise sins.</div>

[They were living] at Chezib when she bore him.<br>6Now Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn; her name was Tamar.<br>7And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord slew him.<br>8Then Judah told Onan, Marry your brother's widow; live with her and raise offspring for your brother.<br><br>9<strong><span style="color: red;">But Onan knew that the family would not be his</span></strong>, so when he cohabited with his brother's widow, he prevented conception, <strong><span style="color: red;">lest he should raise up a child for his brother.</span></strong><br><br>10And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore He slew him also.<br><br>This is my take on the scripture without representing any denominations.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> He(Onan) doesn't object intercourse with his brother's wife Tamar,<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> He knows the child will not be his.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> He does not want her to bear a child/he does not want her to bear a child. SO he prevented conception. And that act displeases God.<br><br>Basically, Onan's disobedience was what costed his life.<br>But if you're going to use this passage as the anchor verse for contraception. I have no problem with that. Because there is no way we could side step the issue and deny that the act was why God killed Onan.<br>But was spilling the semens the only reason why Onan was slewed? No.<br>Like i've mentioned earlier, interpretations and emphasis varies.<br><br>Like i've mentioned about this Catholic NS mate.<br>The church says NO to contraception. And the followers/members says NO as well.<br><br>Their actions differs......what gives?<br><br></div>
