            <div class='col-md body'>Biography of Father Malachi Martin<br><br><a href="http://www.biblio.com/authors/701/Malachi_Martin_Biography.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblio.com/authors/701/Malachi_Martin_Biography.html</a><br><br>The Reverend Dr. Father Malachi Brendan Martin (July 23, 1921- July 27, 1999) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>was a Roman Catholic Jesuit priest </strong></span>who became a popular author and speaker upon various fringe topics such as exorcisms, Satanism, Liberation Theology, the Tridentine liturgy, obscure points of Catholic dogma and the geopolitical importance of The Pope, and those who allegedly wished to topple him.<br><br>Martin was born in County Kerry, Ireland and studied at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. There he received doctorates in the Semitic Languages, Archeology and Oriental History. Subsequently, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he studied at Oxford and at Hebrew University in Jerusalem</strong></span>. He was ordained on August 15, 1954. From 1958 to 1964 he served the Holy See at the Vatican in Rome. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Martin was the private secretary of Augustin Cardinal Bea in Rome and lived and worked at the Vatican for many years</strong></span>. In 1964, Pope Paul VI released Father Martin from the vows of poverty and obedience in the Jesuit Order, but confirmed his vow of celibacy.<br><br>Ever since Father Martin's scathing review of his former order The Jesuits: The Society of Jesus and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church ( 1988 ) rumors were spread by members of this order claiming Martin was defrocked and expelled from the Church of Rome. Martin denied this charge until his death in 1999. Father Mitchell Pacwa- chief spokesman at the Catholic run EWTN would regularly hang up on callers who inquired about Martin on his live call in show.<br><br><blockquote>One element of the controversy surrounding Martin is discussed here: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"High Ranking Jesuit Confirms Malachi Martin's Status as Life Long Priest" by William H. Kennedy - April 2004. </strong></span><br><br>In a stunning reversal of past policy <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Father Vincent O'Keefe SJ, former Vicar General of the Society of Jesus and a past President of Fordham University, affirmed that Malachi Martin was in fact granted a dispensation from all his vows in the Jesuit order except for chastity</span>. This <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dispels decades of rumors that Father Martin was defrocked for having had an affair with the wife of a famous journalist. This was the false lie spread by past Jesuits to discredit Father Martin.</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Martin requested and received a special dispensation by Pope Paul VI to remain a Catholic priest and say Mass in private</span>. </blockquote></div>

The rest of it is plain conspiracy theories haha.<br><br>Why dont u quote alberto reviera as well....maybe a jack chick would be lovely haha.<br><br>And for the slightest remote chance that this is actually true, it just goes to prove how much Satan wishes to bring us down. Would Satan wish to destroy a synagogue of Satan or the Church of God? Naturally the Church to weaken God. This attacks, very well prove we are indeed his enemy for we are the Church Christ founded.<br><br>And how can u quote Malachi and believe his conpiracy theories but denounce his dogmatic catholic beliefs as heresy?

Skimbi, I bet ur church feels condoms are alrite....<br><br>Malachi states its the satanist infiltrators who is attacking the Church. Malachi is an ultra-traditionalist who left the Order due to Vatican 2. Have u ever read his works in Tridentine Liturgy? Malachi beleives the post-councilliar Church is under attack by Satan and Vatican 2 weakened it. He doesnt teach nor write that God is against the Church. He clearly states its Satan who is fighting against the Church founded by the Christ and built on Peter the rock.<br><br>If Malachi thought God was attacking the Church, why did he remain in it and kept his priesthood? Why does he continue to champion for teh return of the Tridentine Mass? I can only conclude he feels satanist is attacking the Church for She is thier enemy. God is our side.</div>
