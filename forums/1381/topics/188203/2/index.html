You keep the commandments because you love God or at least you try to. Yeshua did not say not to keep the commandments, show me a verse in the bible which says that we are not to keep the commandments?<br><br>Yeshua himself says that if we want to enter into life, keep the commandments. Even when Yeshua was speaking to the pharisees, He said that they should have kept both the lesser and weightier matters of the law.<br><br>It is even mentioned in revelation that the we keep the commandments and have the testimony of Yeshua.<br><br>But being led by the Holy Spirit, we can reply that in our human strength, we cannot keep the ten commandments, but to the degree by which one would yield to the Gods Holy Spirit, one can and will keep the ten commandments. Christ within us helps us not to kill, steal, lie, commit adultery, covet, dishonor our parents, break GodÂ’s Sabbath, practice idolatry, take GodÂ’s name in vain or have another Â‘godÂ’ before the true God. We may slip in some point occasionally, but we will then repent and confess our sin to God and have His forgiveness (1 John 1:8Â–9). Then we quickly get back on GodÂ’s path and, through His Spirit, grow in grace and knowledge. We are not perfect. But, through Christ living His life within us, we are growing toward perfection and walking in GodÂ’s law as our basic way of life."<br>Near the end of the Apostolic Age, God inspired the Apostle John to describe the true saints of God: "Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city" (Revelation 22:14).</div></blockquote>Hmm .. this is interesting.
