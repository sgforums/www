            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hi there fallin:<br><br>speaking from a Dispensational view:<br><br>Actually Psalms 2 is a Messianic Psalm......it is prophetic. Its ultimate fulfillment will be in  the coming Great Tribulation wherein kings and rulers all over the world would rally against Christ and also after the 1000 year reign of Christ where the final rebellion will occur after Satan has been released from incarceration.<br><br>I say ultimate because like many other prophecies it can have partial fulfillments. In principle this was fulfilled when Herod, Pilate, the Gentiles and the nation of Israel gathered against Christ our Lord.  refer to Acts 4:25-27.<br><br>It will have full fulfillments during the Great Tribulation and after the end of the 1000 years reign of Christ. [Gog and Magog of Revelations 20:7-8]<br><br>During the Great Tribulation the Antichrist together with the subordinate rulers of his will stage a war against our Lord.<br><br>Ps 2:1  Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing?<br><br>2 The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying,<br><br>3 "Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us."<br><br>They will make war against Christ our Lord [Armageddon] but they will not succeed:<br><br>Terrible divine judgments will befall on them:<br><br>Ps 2:4 He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord shall hold them in derision.<br><br>5 Then He shall speak to them in His <strong>wrath</strong>, And <strong>distress them in His deep displeasure:</strong><br><br>If you will read the book of REvelations there you will see God's judgments falling on the nations which will culminate in Armageddon.. there they will taste of God's deep displeasure and wrath.<br><br>They can all unite against Christ but God has determined to install Him as King of the world Christ our Lord will sit on His Millennial throne.<br><br>Ps 2:6 "Yet I have set My King On My holy hill of Zion."<br><br>David [a type or a shadow of Christ] writing prophetically of Christ our Lord<br>prophesied:<br><br>Ps 2:7  "I will declare the decree: The LORD has said to Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.<br><br>8 Ask of Me, and I will give You The nations for Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth for Your possession.<br><br>9 You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.'"<br><br>Christ through David spoke these words.<br><br>1Pe 1:11 searching what, or what manner of time, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the Spirit of Christ who was in them </strong></span>was indicating when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and the glories that would follow</strong></span><br><br></div>

The fig tree is regarded as the symbol of the nation of Israel in the Jewish Scripture.<br><br>The reason for the event is Jesus' pronouncement that the nation of Israel did not recognise the messiah had already come.<br></div>
