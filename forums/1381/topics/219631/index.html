            <div class='col-md body'>Here's what i wrote in this forum in the thread VERSE/S CLOSES TO YOUR HEART<br><br>Ro 4:25 "who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification."<br><br>I was once a very materialistic young man. Money was my god. This continued until i was 18 years old. During this time i was brought under conviction of sin [which i did not know at that time]. I repented of my sins and i became a totally changed man.<br><br>I had this super desire for righteousness. It became my all-consuming passion to be perfectly righteous in the eyes of God. For five years, i worked so hard to be perfectly righteous until i found it an impossibility. I was so depressed that i could never be perfectly righteous. I found myself a helpless sinner in the eyes of God. I cried out to God to please stoop down to my level.<br><br>Until one night as i was reading Romans chapter 3 [ a chapter on righteousness  ], i can somehow sense someone guiding me as i was reading the verses. It's as if I knew what the next verse would say. This continued on until i reached chapter 4 verse 25.<br><br>There my quest for perfect righteousness was ended. It was in Christ Jesus' work on the cross that i became perfectly righteous in the eyes of God [praise God].. there i understood Christ work and it was there i first believed on Christ alone for salvation. I discovered that it was indeed by faith alone.<br><br>Before I was opposed to the doctrine of salvation by faith alone until I saw myself as a helpless and hopeless sinner. that changed everything. I placed my whole weight on what Christ eternally did for me. Ohhh what ecstatic joy i experienced.........peace came into me like a flood. My mind kept on saying on and on: 'I'm a friend of God.............i am a friend of God'<br><br>I stood up and leaped for joy. So much joy and peace as the words: "I am friends with God..............I am friends with God kept on repeating in my mind without me deliberately thinking it.<br><br>Moments later i returned to my reading...............and the next verse said:<br><br>Romans 5:1 "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"<br><br>And a whole round of joy and peace embraced me again............i can sense God smiling at me for the first time in my life.......the joy was so ecstatic.....i felt i was taken to heaven for a nanosecond and back.<br><br>After that by and by other truths of the Word was opened to me. My discoveries of these truths were confirmed as i began reading Christian books on doctrine.<br><br>The words in James really rang a bell in me:<br><br>Jas 2:23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.<br><br>P.S. anyone looking for perfect righteousness?.............it's in Christ my friend.....place your trust in Him.<br><br>He is the Lord our righteousness. Jeremiah 23:6<br><br></div>

Friends brought you to Church? read book yourself? Family? Born in Christian family.....?</div></blockquote>conviction of sin is hard to explain how it happens when it happens. It is the work of the Holy Spirit. It varies in each case.<br><br>for me it came to me gradually over the years. "It is better felt than telt" as they say. I can write a treatise on conviction of sin but it would all still be inadequate. Hard to explain in words.<br><br>when some sinner is under conviction of sin [they feel holy anxiety and sometimes feel miserable] and some experienced Christian comes along and say to them, "I am happy what you are undergoing right now. God is humbling you. Showing you who you really are. If you yield to it, you will understand the work of Christ on the cross. God is making you see  that you   need  the Savior."<br><br>when some soul is undergoing it and some Christian would say that. At first they would wonder. But later when they have trusted in Christ alone for salvation, they understand what the experienced Christian said.<br><br>The now saved convicted sinner reading the Bible can now say [though not all] : "Ah yes......i know what he is talking about. That is true. That is true Paul."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some of it, logic cannot explain. But it is there we experienced it. And it is described on the pages of the Bible. Logic has a limit really. You can't approach it like a philosopher using logic trying to analyze revelation. It is better experienced than described. He may appeaer wise but he does not really now what he is talking about IF HE ONLY KNEW WHAT WE KNOW.<br><br>1Co 1:19 For it is written: Â“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.Â”<br><br>1Co 1:20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?<br><br>1Co 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him,............<br><br>Some Chrisrtian would say: "God's ways are really higher than our ways. His thoughts are higher really than our thoughts."<br><br>Ironside: "ah yes, that is true. that is true.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 - 4.<br><br>I was lost in life. I had no direction and no purpose that time. All my life I go with the flow. Primary to secondary to poly to NS... After that I came to a halt. The flow stopped. I understood that work is next BUT is that it? Is all my 1/4 century of life spent studying just simply for that? What is my purpose in life? What is everybody's purpose in life?<br><br>I did not know and I was isolated. I lost contact with many friends, I shut myself out of the world. I even gave myself a "valid" reason for not working for 1++ years. I was lazy. YES I was lazy but that is just an explaination for others to hear it easy. It wasn't easy for me because I know its more than just being lazy.<br><br>I even shunned away from my close circle of friends. My family were worried, my close friends were worried. I was vexed but I did not know what to do. I called it depression, you can call it depression too.<br><br>It was only when I watched a sci-fi series that I saw "hope" in that show which I decided to face reality and the world again. I started with my close friends. I told my buddy (Who is a Christian years before me) and I could not hold back the pain and lonliness in me. I simply cried.<br><br>Of course he too was shocked to see me cried in front of him, but he asked me, "Since you seem to have no viable way out for ouy. Do you want to trust in Christ?" What else could be more worse than I am in? So I agreed.<br><br>That was the time I acknowledged my sins and repent with my mouth. I became I Christian just like that. The next day I attended sunday service and met new brothers and sisters. I had a NEW life. I even reconciled with my family and regained contact with 1/2 of my friends. I even got more and was blessed with more because of the love and grace of God.<br><br>It was after my 1st genuine prayer of my confession and repentance that I saw my life changed. I am still working towards a more purposeful life and I have found a direction in my life. Its walking alongside Jesus Christ and living a life of a Christian.<br><br>Even though now I still have many things to settle, I am glad and comforted that God has planned a great life of worth for me. I am living it now.<br><br>I hope my experience can help some of you here. Its abit long. For those who wanted to say, "Pls summarise it in 10 words or less", I would request you to summarise your LIFE in 10 words or less FIRST.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Beers!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Even if they are not born into a Christian family, they are bound for heaven.<br><br>according to my personal understanding of it. Others could disagree. The term "christian" was applied only  to those who are consciously  following the Lord Jesus. Who consciously choose to trust Christ as Savior and Lord.<br><br></div>

You get burnt by fire eternally. Too bad you cant 'die' when you are in hell since you are just a soul, therefore, you just have to suffer 10 degree burns forever.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had an uncomfortable childhood. And many of the scoldings and chastising were unreasonable. So in order to make a difference in the family and my life, I chose to believe in Jesus for the right kind of teaching and way of living. So that I can bring the idea of Christianity into my circle of life, to the people around me.<br><br>Cos I feel many are without love. And without love, one can do many negative and stupid things to others. In order to change that, I chose Christianity. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
