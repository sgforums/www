            <div class='col-md body'>My dear brothers and sisters, I must suggest that we do suspend further discussion of this issue for the precise reason that for many pages there has not been the kind of true exchange that one expects of a true intellectual debate.<br><br>One-upmanship is pseudo intellectual, and it is apparent that a lot of the points (by certain parties on certain sides) have been made and held on by grounds other then reason. While none of us can claim to be innocent of such behavior, it is apparent that sometimes people just come here to flip tables, not sit down for a cup of tea.<br><br>This is most unfortunate, because if secularism or atheism ought to be what we are believing in, if it is the right way, then it seems to be producing the kind of human that takes great pride in tearing others down, calling them degrading names, and being self-exalted in superiority. While I do not for a moment think that some (if not many) religious people do not behave this way, I do know that any serious person of faith knows <span style="font-style: italic;">better</span> then to do such a thing. And it is the kind of person that we should not be.<br><br>The question then remains, very well then if religion and faith was nothing more then a money-spinning hoax giving false hope. Okay them we are supposed to believe that we are nothing more then animals who have no more rational basis to believe in our actions and reason any more then that they were compelled by the chemical reactions and whirling of atoms in our brain. Since we can be convinced that this is far more likely, sensible and real.<br><br>So lets throw all ridiculous notions of faith out of the window and embrace Godlessness with open arms. Let us believe that all the good things we see in the world like love, music, children, friends, sunsets are nothing more then claptrap, perceptions of a feeble human intellect trying to define an existence that is ultimately meaningless.<br><br>Let us embrace this new and sensible god, atheism, and believe that we are just very intelligent animals who will have to make our own fate. Since this is such a better alternative that gives us so much more meaning.<br><br>After all, can <span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span> else possibly exist beyond this material universe filled with unintelligent material that somehow got together to form patterns of matter that could perceive the illusion of existence? Don't we all know and claim this for sure (going by the conviction of some statements of confidence in 'evidence)? Are we still not ultimately bankrupt of meaning to begin with. Let us all believe this then, and let us live as humans.<br><br>Haven't we all tried? What really came of it? Has years of casting off faith led to a better, warmer, and more humane world? I do not know. But I wonder how would men behave when they buy the notion that we are all just random assemblies of matter and nothing more then that, an intelligent animal with no meaning or motivation except what the individual deems fit.<br><br>How would we behave?<br><br>What would we do?<br><br>Is it really better then, if I have no rational reason to believe that my reasoning is rational since it is derived from a brain that came about of irrational and random causes. Isn't reason an illusion then? On what grounds do I believe what I believe in when the evidence points that the very reason I use to determine the universe and ontology is nothing more then just another derived part of it itself? Do we have any reason to believe in our reason then?<br><br>Have we really thought hard enough about atheism, or is it just too plain simple? With many statements made by people who don't really know what true science means?<br><br>I leave it to you.</div>
