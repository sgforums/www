But i was wondering how can gay marriages, sex b4 marriage &amp; polygamy make this world a better place to live in? Have you considered the many problems &amp; evil that arise bcos of these practices? Hasnt the world become more chaotic bcos of these things happening?<br><br>Take gay relationships for eg. I dont see the point here. Marriage is to have children to me or else don't get married. Might as well cohabit.<br><br>Sex b4 marriage has ruined many young girls' lives like unwanted pregnancy, abortion, vd etc. Polygamy ruins families. I have heard of many families broken by two or more relationships. It's the children who suffer.</div>

It is actually close mindedness that causes the world to be in a mess today. People are closed to the gospel of Jesus Christ, persecuting Christians &amp; beheading some in certain countries. People don't want to listen to the bible. You call that openmindedness?<br><br>Why Christians are labelled close minded when others are closed to the gospel themselves?</div>
