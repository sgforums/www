Oh yes ! ask my eyes !<br><br>So a whale to you is a whale because it is observable and replicable independently ya ? hrmm....but killer whales are also called by Mikah indian tribes to be sea wolves - how ar ?  which is which ? Believe who ? You are wiser and the indians are delusional ?<br><br>Rather, a whale is known to us as a whale because Man name it to be so. Do you as an infant, shout "whale !" when u see one ? So you know that big thing that swims and sprouts water - as "whale" because your teacher says so or you read it from a book ? Based on your empirical judgement - isnt that as delusional ? How would you know its name is really "whale" ? What are your established principles ?<br><br>Do you simply believe based on what you see ? Is that your established principle ? Seems to me it is.<br><br>Then it is easy. Sign up for a trip to countries / or homes which house people less fortunate with accompanying brothers and sisters in Christ. Witness how they care for the people as their friends and for each other. Witness how they sacrifice their time to care for strangers they do not know.  Have a chat with missionaries, why they rather spend their time in a desolate place singing to a group of children who can only afford 1 meal a day.<br><br>i also sincerely, invite you to have a talk with me over a home cook meal or a cup of coffee.  And when you are more comfortable, chat with some of my pals in a small group setting, attend church together, do ministry together, pray together.  Do the things we do. I can show you who is God.<br><br>Now, you surely can do it right ? -  since that is your established principle for truth even if you do not believe ?<br></div></blockquote>Now I am beginning to understand why even educated people gamble and join religious organisations. I used to think that they don't really suscribe to the nonsense but join for the fun of it or to become respectable members of society or they like some parts of it but not the other nonsense parts....<br><br>Then you make your post and I realise that even educated people can don 't get it!<br><br>I said evidence must conform to established accepted forms and you ask "seeing is believeing issit?"<br><br>I said that the evidence for the existence of whales must be replcable and observable independently and you say the whale must be observable and replicable independently...<br><br>Whether Indians or Chinese if they claim that there is a creature that is such and such and show evidence that can be independently observed or replicated then so what if it is called whale or sea-wolves?<br><br>The problem lies when one side calls it Allah and another side Jehovah and it is suppose to be the same but both sides do not provide the said evidence and yet go to war to claim that each other is right.<br><br>That is what happens when you imagine things and then insist that it must be right without even producing any evidence that is observable and replicable.<br><br>You take going on a trip with Christians as proof that God exists? Do you want me to go on a trip with Buddhists who sacrifice themselves to care for the less fortunate and these same Buddhists insist that there is no God?<br><br>Have a meal with Christians and chit chat and that will prove who God is?<br><br>All that will prove is that I had a meal and a chit chat with people who call themselves Christians....<br><br>You seem like a nice person... naive and happy in your delusions... I feel bad trying to bring you to your senses. Maybe it is better that you continue to live with your beliefs. Do not try to debate with people like me. Just keep your faith and do whatever it is that you do... after all who am I to tell you what is right when you are happily immersed in your own world?<br><br>Yet I fell so bad that you are probably making stupid decisions after stupid decisions based on imagination and delusions... so if you are happy, just continue but if you are not happy, just remember me and try to find out for yourself what constitute "good" and "acceptable" evidence when people come to you and make claims of one kind or another.</div>

Therefore, by extrapolation, people who believe in the supernatural are delusional, because you cannot distinguish one kind of supernatural from another right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually from reading the various posts here, we have substantiated our claims as to why we believe, its just you who does not accept them.</div>

Supernatural can only be experienced. No one can explain why some things happen. Some people conclude that people experiencing the supernatural is psychotic. Others subscribe to the belief that there is a realm beyond what we see.<br><br>From a totally objective standpoint, people believing in religion (read God) believes in the supernatural. Therefore basing on your first statement, the conclusion is people who believe in the supernatural does not equates being delusional, people who believe in God is also not delusional.<br><br>From your reply, it can be concluded that your argument is totally inconsistent. So no need to discuss already lah.... since your entire trend of argument here (as well as in the Buddhist forum) is religion bashing.</div>
