Believe who ? You are wiser and the indians are delusional ?<br><br>Rather, a whale is known to us as a whale because Man name it to be so. Do you as an infant, shout "whale !" when u see one ? So you know that big thing that swims and sprouts water - as "whale" because your teacher says so or you read it from a book ? Based on your empirical judgement - isnt that as delusional ? How would you know its name is really "whale" ? What are your established principles ?<br><br>Do you simply believe based on what you see ? Is that your established principle ? Seems to me it is.<br><br>Then it is easy. Sign up for a trip to countries / or homes which house people less fortunate with accompanying brothers and sisters in Christ. Witness how they care for the people as their friends and for each other. Witness how they sacrifice their time to care for strangers they do not know.  Have a chat with missionaries, why they rather spend their time in a desolate place singing to a group of children who can only afford 1 meal a day.<br><br>i also sincerely, invite you to have a talk with me over a home cook meal or a cup of coffee.  And when you are more comfortable, chat with some of my pals in a small group setting, attend church together, do ministry together, pray together.  Do the things we do. I can show you who is God.<br><br>Now, you surely can do it right ? -  since that is your established principle for truth even if you do not believe ?<br><br></div>
