The early compilers for the new testament did not incorporate the gospels in because they do not have the aptitude to understand what is written in the Gnostic gospels. Ofcourse, we know that leaders of Christianity in that period are exceptionally narrow-minded (Bare in mind the inquisition and the witchcraft percecutions, etc)<br><br>Being shallow (maybe not a good word) or people who do not have high wisdom, they could not fathom that the "Gnostic" gospels are actually philosophical and methophorical. Also, ofcourse, they do not fit well with the easier accepted gospels as they were easier to understand.<br><br>Hmm...i was just thinking, if they had accepted these gospels (Gnostic), then Christianity would have evolves into something like Buddhism or Confuscianism, which are philosophical and ever-lasting. Then there wouldnt be such a "crisis" now for them.<br><br>Sorry, just my 2 cents worth. Dun flame me please.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>One word of concious, everything you see on TV (and on the internet as well as all other medium) must be taken with a pinch of salt.<br>these so call Gnostic gospel are if simply put, came about when someone feels that they have an 'extra special insider' knowledge about the things of the God, and this appeal especially to those who enjoy the so called 'conspiracy theory'.<br>The gospel of Judas is definitely not written by Judas Iscariot, mainly because he is probably dead (committed sucide) before its even penned, and most likely is not even an account from him as well, making this at best a speculation on what had transpired.<br><br>God bless.<br><br>X--------------------------<br>The following is pure speculation on my own on how this gospel came about, I have not done any research on this, do not take any of this too seriously.<br><br>" one day, a group of scholars came together and have a chat, they came to this discussion on the question "I wonder why would a disciple of the Lord, after seeing all the mircales and wonders, decided to betray him?, since the scriptures did not mention any reason for this, perhaps we should play detective and try to understand this Judas Iscariot character by putting ourselves in his shoes"....., hence the birth of the Gospel of Judas."<br></div>

Or that the remaining followers for them, after reading the OT, thinks that it is not exactly correct, and therefore sets about writing the gospels to "right" the wrongs in the OT and NT? </blockquote></div>
