The early compilers for the new testament did not incorporate the gospels in because they do not have the aptitude to understand what is written in the Gnostic gospels. Ofcourse, we know that leaders of Christianity in that period are exceptionally narrow-minded (Bare in mind the inquisition and the witchcraft percecutions, etc)<br><br>Being shallow (maybe not a good word) or people who do not have high wisdom, they could not fathom that the "Gnostic" gospels are actually philosophical and methophorical. Also, ofcourse, they do not fit well with the easier accepted gospels as they were easier to understand.<br><br>Hmm...i was just thinking, if they had accepted these gospels (Gnostic), then Christianity would have evolves into something like Buddhism or Confuscianism, which are philosophical and ever-lasting. Then there wouldnt be such a "crisis" now for them.<br><br>Sorry, just my 2 cents worth.

And human beings do not have perfect knowledge.<br><br>So by eliminating these other gospels, actually makes the bible an incomplete text. And because it contradicts the average knowledge does not mean it is wrong too...bare in mind the inquisition, the earth is flat, witchcraft etc.<br><br>Another 2 cents?</div>
