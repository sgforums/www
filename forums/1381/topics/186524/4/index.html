Anyway, you are assuming that we know the whole truth of something that happened 2000 years ago based simply on a book compiled by people of disputable intentions.</div></blockquote>I am surprised you see my 'whole text of irrelevant content' as a reply. I was not questioning your powers of observation, but rather it was your observation that I found thought provoking, hence the 'whole text of irrelevant content'.<br><br>And you must understand that the notion that it is irrelevant eludes me, namely so because you quite rightfully rose up the question of how and why we should understand things, without which there can be no basis of making any sort of rational statement at all. It is quite important indeed, and has to be relevant, or we would have nothing to argue about at all.<br><br>And it's vitally important to begin with because should we start with a flawed grasp of logic, it follows that all our subsquent conclusions would be for naught. There is no point arguing about the utility of red as a danger-colour if we start colour-blind. Indeed, all arguments can even carry on because people agree on a certain absolute standard to begin with. All men accept this principle.<br><br>And no, I do not for a moment assumes I know the whole truth based on some book complied 2000 years ago. Though I might dispute the fact (on certain compelling reasons) that the persons who compiled it had less-then-honest intentions. What I can say is that a certain some book does have some rather intriguing incongruities with the normal proceeding of statistics we would accept of normal historical documentations that require a second look.<br><br>And a second look that must be taken with an open acceptance of both possibilities. If it is fake we should indeed reject it with vigor, but if it is true it has several ground-shattering implications that cannot be ignored. Lest the believer say that he is unwilling to entertain the possibility of becoming a skeptic, and the skeptic a believerÂ… this discourse is in vain, and is of fruitless one-upmanship. Which I have absolutely no intention of engaging in. By all means we should question and debate, but for the sake of discovering truth and not of showing superiority of ways (though an honest discourse might reveal inherent superiorities).<br><br>What I will dispute is that the belief that the book in itself flawed beyond belief, and easily proven false quickly. This seems to me to be an assumption that likes to fly before considering all the evidence.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a baptised mormon, I joined the church at a young age, and as I grew older, I didn't agree with the teachings of the church and decided to leave the mormon church once and for all. However, I've never lost my love and interest for God and Christ. I continue to be intrigued by christianity. I visited couple of churches over the years, methodist, catholic, etc, but I've never settled for any church. I guess I'm still searching and I'll let God show me to the right one.<br><br>One of the reasons I didn't go back to a church was becoz I always feel that churches have to look after their own interests, and their teachings sometimes can be bias and they tend to draw conclusions on certain issues too quickly. Like I'm very sure, church leaders will quickly dismiss the credibility of the gospel of judas when they know it was going to be showed in NG, and surely advise ppl not to even bother with the gospel of judas.<br><br>That is just one example I dont enjoy going to church. I'm intrigued about god, and I want to learn every and anything about him whether gnostic or not. orthodox or not.<br><br>Dont you all ever ask yourself, what if the discovery of gospel of judas and various gospels was part of god's plan? what if god has more things install for us? Are we reading his signs wrongly? These are just some of the things I sometimes ask myself.</div>

Go on, show me.</div></blockquote>These are questions that are certainly too deep to be answered via the means of a humble forum like this. Before one considers any evidence however, one needs to remember that how one consider's evidence is directly a result of his or her thinking, which ought to be based on logic.<br><br>Let's say we have compelling evidence that whales do exist, however you do come across a person who for certain reasons, believes that it is impossible for such an animal to exist. No matter what. No matter how convincingly you might show him, or even get him to touch and see the actual animal he can claim that all this is a delusion or a trickery of the senses, or appeal to some alternative reason as to why the very evidence he is seeing is not proof of a whale. It boils down to if the person's particular point of view is open to the possibility of the existence of a whale or not. Evidence can help to strengthen one's logic, but it can never create the logic itself.<br><br>It is the evidence that appeals to the logic, not the logic that is birthed by the evidence. If the logic was created by the evidence then there would be no reason whatsoever to consider why this or that logic should be generated from that particular evidence. In fact, it is as good as saying we can use any kind of logic on any evidence as we do so, which is as good as saying nothing. Obviously one needs the logic first before evidence is considered.<br><br>Of course, 'seeing to believe' is a very common logic that a lot of people use in order to believe in something. However one needs to think if this logic of belief is <span style="font-style: italic;">applicable</span> to everything, and if not, why. Indeed if one uses this logic only to go about life, then it is no surprise that a lot of things will have to be taken on faith, even though with a little shift of expectations many unreasonable things may suddenly become perfectly logical and obvious.<br><br>Obviously, it's an issue of philosophy, first and formost. Obviously philosophy can be strengthened or weakened by various logics that can demostrate their truths in various ways.<br><br>The real question one should ask themselves before asking various questions on the existence of a soul, heaven, hell or God is this: are these notions that in my own point of view that are absolutely impossible? Or are my expectations of their proofs unreasonable? What do I consider more likely or less likely indeed? Is what I am thinking logical, or emotional? If we have many things in our own way of thinking that sets ourselves up from the start towards disbelief, then it might not be very fair to answer these questions on the sheer existence of hell, heaven or God at all.<br><br>Really, what indeed are your expectations? And if granted evidence, how would you take it in? How much proof do you need?<br><br>I am certainly not sure, because first and formost I am not you. But let me say first of all that among Christians I tend to be the rather skeptical kind, and my personal conversion was hardly emotional or wanting to buy pie-in-sky dreams. I don't think I 'reasoned' myself into faith (in the end you still have to leave some things to belief), but first and foremost I would like to say that the assumption that the belief in God or religon is illogical or things that like to fly in spite of the evidence.<br><br>There are good and compelling reasons to be theist, even if you are not a Christian. And obviously if you are a theist, one needs to consider if polytheism or monotheism is more reasonable. And lastly, if one chooses the either, one needs to wonder if any of the either is to be the best form of the sort. But of course these are yet again too complex questions to be answered in such a forum without much cutting out of important concepts and questions.<br><br>And also I am not convinced that we are yet ready to engage in a civil and fair discussion of things. It seems to me that many of us are still raving to get our shots in at the opposite party, and not really willing to listen or answer any questions at all. All too often one might realize that one actually shares 90 percent of his opponent's views when they<span style="font-style: italic;"> truly </span>start to debate. Obviously if the skeptic here should view the Christians as cardboard characters unworthy of trustful speak from which every world is hopelessly marred by biblical bias, and the Christian viewing the skeptic as a cutout of unbelief in 'obvious' things and just disrespect towards God waiting to be put down... we shall get nowhere.<br><br>Shall we shake hands, make that cup of tea, and seriously listen to each other for a change? Could the skeptics think more about what they are really asking and the Christians consider if they really understand what they believe and how to bring that across? That would be most nice, and most fruitful as well.<br><br>On the issue of the bible being biased. First and formost one needs to consider if this is a possibility. Was it all politics of thelogy at the hand of church elders or rather was it an agreement of the doctorine of the entire church versus a fringe group?<br><br>And is the victoring thelogy always a lie? Or are there other reasons behind why the bible is the bible today? Has one considered all the evidence? What would one <span style="font-style: italic;">like</span> to believe? Is what one would like to believe really happening? Is it congruent with reality?<br><br>First and foremost I do not imagine for a moment one should use the argument that the most popular version today is the lie simply because it is the victoring version. It is as good as saying nothing as it means that any losing idea or theory ought to be the truth automatically simply because it was snubbed out. This means that there ought to be no winners.<br><br>And I am not too sure as well, it is also as good as saying we should not trust the accounts of WW2 written from the allies perspective and should instead listen to the 'suppressed' nazi version of history that is the suppressed truth. Yes the victors may get to write history in the end, but that act of writing has little bearing on if it is the truth or not. If the truth wins it wins, as would a lie should it win.<br><br>To seriously consider what was the real christianity back then, one needs to consider all the aspects of the case. I am disinclined to agree with Judas' account simply because he is a vilified character. One might as well agree with a gospel that paints all the white as black, and black as white.<br><br>Do we dare to really test the evidence? Or just fit it into whatever we'd like? This goes for both sides.</div>
