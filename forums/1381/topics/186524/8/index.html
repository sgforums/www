Aside from cultists that crops up once in a while, what harm has mainstream religion (not just Christianity) done to the society? Most religions provide a focus to a moralistic lifestyle and provides a direction for their followers to live by. Sure, you can point out at some overzealous folks who take religion over the cliff, but by and large, serious practitioners of such religions are good and useful citizens.<br><br>To assume that people "get trap" your implication is that these folks are now on their way to be zombified? that they now devoid of independent thoughts?<br><br>Sure we are having a debate/discussion, but even then there are rules of engagement...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Nobody asked you to police Eternal Hope.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> No one said you must agree with the philosophies of Christians residents of EH.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> What's preaching and what's not?
