I accept tis is wat u believe, I find it wrong or confuse and tell u my viewpoint or ask a question. Wat is "not accepting" in tis case ?

Felt confuse then try to see if they had a logical answer for it. If they don't then why aren't u suspicious tat something is wrong somewhere ? U don't understand why certain things r done in a certain way and u just keep believing in it ? Isn't tat a streak of stubbornness and close mindedness ?<br><br><blockquote>It's like this, I disagree with my parents on lots of stuffs, but that does not stop me from fulfilling my duties and continue to love them.

Why don't u treat it like a discussion on the content of a history textbook. This is wat the scripture r isn't it ? They tell of events tat had happened in the past with actually no relationship at all with your parents. After reading it, u find something is wrong and logically impossible, do u still read it as though it is true ? Of course u have to find out wat went wrong and if tis textbook is credible. Don't tell me u still blindly think the history book is right after they claim WW2 is started by Malaysia and George Bush founded singapore in 1819.</div>

Maybe it is u who get emotional instead of debating in a rational manner. As can be said by u, on the example of rape of nanking, if some japanese found tat something seems to be wrong with it after visit to SE asia countries or china, they will go and read about it and found the real truth. If u, after finding out there is something wrong with the history stated, yet do no investigation, then u will be cheated about it for the rest of your life. Even modern history has its own alteration such as rape of nanking, how can u be sure the bible is more accurate given its 2000 years of history and incredulous claims ? Please do not lose your cool and level headedness and become emotional when debating.<br><br><blockquote>Etiquette is a good yardstick to use when both parties disagree....<br>You had previously shown your disdain towards even the intervention of the moderator, so you probably had a total disregard for authority.<br>.</blockquote>If I have a total disregard for authority, I will probably be smuggling drugs and caught in jail now. Just because someone lock away a thread and I to appeal against it, makes me a person who has a total disregard for authority ? Then the people who appeal against any jugdement in a law suit all have disregard for authority. Any men who talk against the Gov of any gov is also having a total disregard of the law.

The theme in eternal hope is about christainity isn't it ? All of u talk about the common theme of christainity too. So u guys r always debating on a common theme and thus should be forbbidden from talking about it anymore ? U guys r always talking about "god god god" in this forums isn't it ?</div>

Maybe it is u who get emotional instead of debating in a rational manner. As can be said by u, on the example of rape of nanking, if some japanese found tat something seems to be wrong with it after visit to SE asia countries or china, they will go and read about it and found the real truth. If u, after finding out there is something wrong with the history stated, yet do no investigation, then u will be cheated about it for the rest of your life. Even modern history has its own alteration such as rape of nanking, how can u be sure the bible is more accurate given its 2000 years of history and incredulous claims ? Please do not lose your cool and level headedness and become emotional when debating.<br></div></blockquote>No lah, did not lose my cool.... more stressed at work than anything.<br>Unfortunately, emotion is part of life, and so is passion.

Just because someone lock away a thread and I to appeal against it, makes me a person who has a total disregard for authority ? Then the people who appeal against any jugdement in a law suit all have disregard for authority. Any men who talk against the Gov of any gov is also having a total disregard of the law. Sorry man, I am not a blind follower.<br></div></blockquote>No lah, you did not just appealed, you continued to post a sequel and even make a challenge to the effect that you will continue if you choose it. This is what I meant when I say you disregard authority. Had you obeyed the authority, you will say I appeal and wait for the authority's decision before taking further action<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">However I am talking about different viewpoints.

U guys r always talking about "god god god" in this forums isn't it ?<br></div></blockquote>Just for argument sake, do you have anything NICE to say about Christians?<br>Is there anything that is within the dogma of Christianity that makes sense to you?
