Here's what he said:<br><br>The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.<br><br>For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.</ul><br><br>then go dig up the dirt on the Israelis and how they themselves used terror tactics...  but it must be said that they have actually pursued peace until Arafat's walking out of the talks and launching his Intifadah when Israel, under Ehud Barak gave everything the Palestinians demanded except total control of Jerusalem (to be negotiated) for peace...<br><br>since then, there has been a state of total chaos..<br><br>read the history books and trawl the internet (stay away from the nutters' sites tho' )...<br><br></div>

Then when both are agreeable, go together and talk to the pastor nicely. Give the pastor some time to reply. After some time, if pastor not reply you both, then go n inform the higher authority lor.<br><br>2) If all in authority are in cohoot, what I can say is this:<br><strong>whatever people say, we just take only those we feel is right. We don't follow what we feel is wrong</strong><br>Yes, pastor may tell u to follow entirely, but a pastor is not God. Pastor only a representative.

When suggesting other people have a problem of accepting your viewpoint, it may be worthwhile to notice sometimes they themselves too have fail to accept the viewpoint of others.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope you are not in one bit arrogant or wrong to point all these out.  Although to be frank, I would say I will not say what he say is wrong or right because I did not know his motives, his references, his interpretations.  Pastors are pretty much human and they are also subjected to interpretations. So I guess I had my fair share of controversial interpretations and preaching from my pastors and even from myself hahaha....but I guess the best example the bible gave us were the BEREANS who consulted the scriptures despite hearing preachings from PAUL, the great apostle, I think thats the attitude we should maintain. To always c heck with God hehehe<br><br>here s the verse.<br><br>Acts 17:11<br>Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.</div>
