              <p>Yes we all have faith in some sort of degree. Faith in that your computer will not blow up this second killing you. And logic too, but its not 100% just like you cannot have logic 100%. I believe blind faith = ignorance. Since you have a choice. Action speaks louder than words</p>

              <p>if every religion interpret the truth according to their faith, the world is a messy place to live in with so many conflicting faiths against one another.I have to quote from a learned english man, what he said is true.</p>
              <p>" You have to bend the faith to meet the facts or truth " and not vice versa.</p>
              <p>so what is the truth? the truth is one I can see, like the sun and moon for instance. these are undeniable facts.</p>

              <p>if there isnt comaprison btw at least 2 things, how can we have inequality? we learn in maths this thing called equation...let me ask u, in an equation, u need the left side and rite side...in other words, can sufferings exist alone without blessings? how would u noe sth is negative if there is nth positive to compare it wif? for inequality to exist, there must be comparison wif sth else...same as why do we say humans are imperfect? its cos we have knowledge of wad perfection is...if not, wad is imperfection?</p>

              <p>You are playing with words (normal and abnormal) and have forgotten the physical sufferings that being abnormal have to go through. To you is just a word "abnormal".</p>
              <p>Let's assume everybody is abnormal and have to suffer. Will you question why we have to suffer ? Even if there is no normal people to compare, we will still question why we have to suffer.</p>

              <p>Funny that you said that he loves those who follow and obey him but also said love is not one of his attributes.</p>
              <p>Can I say a person who is kind to his own race isn't kind at all?</p>
              <p>Actually love is one of his attributes as I had researched.</p>
              <p>Nvm, I respect your views on the three Abrahamic religions although I see them as worshipping the same God.</p>

              <p>u obviously dun understand wad i am saying...u ask wad if we are all born abnormal...can we all be born abnormal without knowing wads normal? can u know the feelings of sufferings without knowing the feelings of joy, happiness and blessings?</p>

              <p>until now, nobody has answered me on this...sufferings, blame God...ok, valid...blessings, who/what do we thank? remember without the existence of sufferings, one wun noe wads blessings/no sufferings...</p>

              <p>Allah only loves those who follow and obey Him as compared to the christian God who loves all including those who dun follow and obey Him...u can choose to say the christian God doesnt love all...but i am juz going according to wad is taught in christianity...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u said u read tat Allah loves all ppl? strange then...cos i read in a book tat gies information abt all major religions that Allah onli loves those who follow and obey Him...which means selective love...and that book said that love is not one of his 99 attributes...now i wonder...which source gave the rite info...urs or mine?</p>
