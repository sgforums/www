                      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;">Your question comes under the broad topic of the problem of evil
                          (which is actually the original topic in this thread). Except you choose to
                          phrase it in very emotive language, which is usually why such questions are
                          very hard to answer because we are usually overwhelmed by the emotions that
                          this topic generates, and disable sound judgment especially when most if not
                          all of us have experienced some form of suffering at one level or another.
                          Maybe you’re trying to use this specific topic to stir up emotional intensity
                          or personally experienced it, but I choose to distance myself from the use of
                          such emotionally-driven examples and address the problem of evil as a general
                          phenomenon, including murder, rape, floods, hate, earthquakes, etc.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;">First of all, what do you mean by evil? On what basis and by
                          what standard do you call certain things evil? I’m not asking for assertions
                          from you that non theists can make moral choices (I know some of them are
                          moral), but what warrants you to call one choice ‘moral’ and another choice
                          ‘not moral’? To be clear, apart from flipping a coin, what distinguishes these
                          actions within your specific belief system? </span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;">Secondly, from that same framework, how do you account for the
                          evil that exists? How do you explain the good that happens? </span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;"> I’ll stop here for now till I hear from you.</span></p>

              the symbol for something with the thing itself. Does this equation not hold

              <p><span style="font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;">How do you know what the other scientists tell you are true? Have you repeated the experiments yourself before you accept it as truth? If you haven’t done the experiments yourself and believe what they say, aren’t you believing in their testimony without having “seen” the evidence yourself? Do I smell “faith” here? Why is it acceptable for you to accept their testimonies as “fact” but not for the Christian to believe upon the witness of the early Christians as recorded in the historical gospels?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;">Can there be truths that you don’t see but are undeniable? How about 1+1= 2? Don’t talk to me about the symbols that are blatantly obvious, no wise person should confuse the symbol for something with the thing itself. Does this equation not hold true even without the visual symbols? Even if I change the symbols, is not 1+1 still =2?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;"> What about the laws of logic? Do you see the absolute and universal laws of logic? I don’t see them in the way I see the sun and moon, can they still exist? Are they still true? </span></p>

              <p>this is called duality, I have no clue if you heard of this before. its like Tao or whatever you want to call it, you have Yin and Yang, ugly and beautiful, high and low etc etc. so normal and abnormal to you is just like duality, in between extremes I see. I dun get what u mean?  if that suits you, fine with me. but the issue is still around hello!!! if y ou avoid the question of equality and fairness, then yes we are on a different channel because you either avoid or deflect the question into duality. but no need bothering to explain anymore, because I know equanimity (wonder if you heard this word before) and egalitarian and fairness do not exists in your religion.</p>
              <p>its about master and slave type of relationship in your religion if I am being direct. also doesnt make sense a planet can be created in 6 days. this truly exists only in stories. if you tell this to people 2010 years ago, I am sure people then have no problems accepting this. but fast forward 2010 years later, I am afraid this is not so, because people are educated and science and technology are so advanced compared to the society then.</p>

              <p>obviously it's not the best i have, but with what i have to work with here, e.g. your intellectual capacity and level of reasoning (actually, the lack thereof), it'll have to do for now while I work my way up. </p>
              <p>you worship science. In other forums, you seem to be a Buddhist but here, you're like a blind follower of science - you've lost all ability to question and investigate, even the assumptions of your own worldview. The dogma that you're holding onto is whatever that you've learnt or read about in science classes (probably primary sch? high sch maximum?) Science is your authority but you fail to realize that you're inconsistent within your own worldview. If you're closed off to question your own basic assumptions, or the views of other systems of thought, you're cut off from "enlightenment". </p>
              <p>The questions i've posed to you are valid. I'm questioning your epistemology (feel free to check up the meaning). Avoiding the question (and passing) simply doesn't cut it for a convincing line of reasoning. Or maybe you fear answering because it'll reveal your unquestioning "faith". </p>
              <p>The way i see you making your case ( i wish i could term them as coherent arguments but really they're more rants) is as if at the back of your mind, you're telling yourself "Argument weak, shout here!"</p>
              <p>I'll be waiting for a coherent response to my questions on evil and your epistemology, but i don't hold high hopes for you. </p>
