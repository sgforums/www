              <p>so the crux of the matter is...if no sufferings is considered blessings, then why must have sufferings? this is logical cos no suffering is defined as blessings...however, if blessings is seen as more than jus having no sufferings, then sufferings would be necessary to bring out the value of blessings.</p>
              <p>it has become more or less a fact that ppl who went thru hardship in life are more appreciative of life. usually, they are less complacent but possess more drive. if life was a bed of roses, we wun appreciate blessings when we experience them cos we have taken them for granted. we say deformity is suffering. true. then are we not blessed to be born normal? we could have been like any of those who are deformed. but we are not. so isnt tat a form of blessing? ah...but why do most of us not see it this way? cos its normal to be born in such a manner. wadever is normal is not seen as blessings as its common.</p>
              <p>so if being born in such a way makes us normal. that would mean being born this way was the origin. wadever came after tat which was different is considered deformed or abnormal. if one realli ponder abt this, wouldnt it suggest good came before evil; blessings came before sufferings? again, it depends on how one define blessings and sufferings...this though is how i would define them...</p>

              <p>no you go asks people of other faith on this issue, they will also feel its unfair and unjust. does it mean that god treated us as his play thing for experiment or to test us if we are strong or weak? you are bias, because you are a christian. of course you will be defending the refutations. so I now know fairness and equality in the system are not considerations in your religion. now i know, even though you did not answer to the questions.</p>

              <p>u said it urself, cant deprove his existence, but neither can you prove his existence. existence is for christians to say so. but to non believers, prove it. so how do you reconcile this? how do you prove that god exists to non believers and to the world. if science ever said god exists in science journals, textbooks and mainstream newspaper and magazines, then god exists.</p>

              <p>No actually. For more info on <strong>science</strong> please read the dinosaur thread on the last page. Unless you want me to copy it over. Science up till today has not explained the creation of the universe. And it will never. And science has its own mistakes also just that you never heared of it.</p>
