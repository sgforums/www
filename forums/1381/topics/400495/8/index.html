              <p>If i presume boldly that u meant God in that statement, i would think that he didnt zor bo, so to speak. He came down in the form of human flesh to take on the penalty of our sins. Jesus Christ came to proclaim peace and goodwill to all men. His atonement was the answer to the problem of sin in creation.</p>

              <p>God may be omnipotent and omnipresent, but in no way is he an illogical being. You cannot be omnipotent if you create beings of free will, because if you do, then you do not grant true free will among your creations.<br><br>The easiest way to see this is if you had a child, in all possible circumstances YOU MAY guide your child to grow up in a certain fashion, directing your child's thought process, but in the process you are constantly interfering with the child's own ability to decide on his or her own. Why do you think it is always taboo in all those movies about God about the infringement of free will? If God wanted to create creatures of free will, then he can no longer truly remain as omnipotent as he once was, he gave part of that up the moment he created humans.<br><br>People who say God is omnipotent and omnipresent do not clearly think about all the contradictions that rise with it and then we come into a full circle argument of how God is full of holes, when in fact the original statement is the one full of holes because most people can't see why he gave humans free will in the first place</p>

              <p>I'm impressed that you've developed this insight.</p>
              <p>The God i worship is omnipotent but there are somethings that He cannot do. For example, he cannot lie, he cannot swear by Himself (for there is no One greater than Himself), he also cannot make a square circle or create a rock so heavy that he cannot lift (because to do contradicts His very nature. The laws of logic reflect the way he thinks, not what He is governed by).</p>
              <p>The problem of evil, that is being discussed in the thread so far, my first response would be "what evil?" If i ask what is evil, you might describe immoral violent acts (etc) to me, that typify the absence of good in those situations. But here, I ask, what makes us (including me) think that such acts qualify as "evil". Is there a category such as this in the framework that we have? What enables us to label an act as good? How did we develop moral categories for our actions?</p>

              <p>To accept something you must also deny something. Slightly unfair, but that is how many minds work today.</p>
              <p>To be Christian means that you deny yourself the right to call yourself any other religion and to live a lifestyle that contradicts the teachings of Christ. Although many Christians take it with a pinch of salt, they dont their oath and their commitment seriously and thus end up contradicting themselves in many ways.</p>

              <p>once again, brilliant observation. the law of non contradiction at work.</p>
              <p>When one says i do to his wife, he's also in effect saying i don't to the other women out there. Truth is exclusive by definition.</p>
              <p>To be Christian, one emulates the person of Christ and obeys the commandments of Christ (taught in context). The false doctrine of the "prosperity" movement must be recognized that it is essentially that, false. The presence of aberrant followers in any school of thought doesn't negate or falsify the truthfulness of the teachings. If anything, the true believer takes heart that these things (false doctrines, prophets) have been described about in the Scriptures (Jude, 1 /2 Timothy).</p>

              <p>if there isnt comaprison btw at least 2 things, how can we have inequality? we learn in maths this thing called equation...let me ask u, in an equation, u need the left side and rite side...in other words, can sufferings exist alone without blessings? how would u noe sth is negative if there is nth positive to compare it wif? for inequality to exist, there must be comparison wif sth else...same as why do we say humans are imperfect? its cos we have knowledge of wad perfection is...if not, wad is imperfection?</p>

              <p>hey mate she is asking why, not asking what, or how. she is asking how do you account and justify for the babies who are borned deformed, since bible said humans are his creations. why some are born in  rich families, some are born in poor families etc etc. if you cant explain the why, pls dun continue anymore. I dun need you to philosophise the beauty and the ugly, rich and poor, strong and weak.</p>
              <p>not only are the questions posed wasnt answered to the point, but deflection and superfluous replies. in short, answered anything but the question.</p>

              <p>God may be omnipotent and omnipresent, but in no way is he an
              illogical being. You cannot be omnipotent if you create beings of
              free will, because if you do, then you do not grant true free will
              among your creations.<br> <br> The easiest way to see this is if you had a child, in all possible
              circumstances YOU MAY guide your child to grow up in a certain
              fashion, directing your child's thought process, but in the process
              you are constantly interfering with the child's own ability to
              decide on his or her own. Why do you think it is always taboo in
              all those movies about God about the infringement of free will? If
              God wanted to create creatures of free will, then he can no longer
              truly remain as omnipotent as he once was, he gave part of that up
              the moment he created humans.<br> <br> People who say God is omnipotent and omnipresent do not clearly
              think about all the contradictions that rise with it and then we
              come into a full circle argument of how God is full of holes, when
              in fact the original statement is the one full of holes because
              most people can't see why he gave humans free will in the first
              place</p>

              <p>so if the machine sucks and cannot do alot of things it was programmed to do, so what now? so it all boils down to the people who created the machine isnt it. but the thing is, why god create some to be genius, some average, some deformed. those who are borned deformed or intellectual disability, wasnt given a chance to live his/her life properly isnt it.</p>
              <p>anyway your analogy is of a different matter altogether, still it doesnt explain the why question.</p>

              <p>seriously, alot of things still goes back to definitions...without a common platform, we cun have friendly discussions...like fairyfairy who is toking abt inequality...the way a person looks at blessings and sufferings depends largely on upbringing, social influence and the books we read...if one focuses a lot on buddhism, sufferings will be magnified but if one focuses on christianity, blessings will be magnified...either way there is inequality but the scales are titlted in diff directions...</p>
              <p>so i completely understand why some here keep harping on sufferings...buddhism has a huge bit of teachings abt sufferings...the essence of buddhism is to escape sufferings...its like moving from sufferings to no suffering...no suffering is seen as blessing...but in christianity, its moving from normality to eternal blessings...so the emphasis are diff leading to very diff schools of tots and beliefs...which is why from the start, i alredi said...its an apple-orange argument...but some ppl are juz not convinced...</p>

              <p>its convenient for you to say these, because you are born normal and healthy. want to ask those who are born deformed to ask how they feel on this issue? still it doesnt address the question asked. the why question. if god is all powerful, why is his creations so wretched and miserable for some, good for some.</p>
