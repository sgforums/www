              <p>God may be omnipotent
                                      and omnipresent, but in no way is he an illogical being. You cannot
                                      be omnipotent if you create beings of free will, because if you do,
                                      then you do not grant true free will among your creations.<br> <br> The easiest way to see this is if you had a child, in all possible
                                      circumstances YOU MAY guide your child to grow up in a certain
                                      fashion, directing your child's thought process, but in the process
                                      you are constantly interfering with the child's own ability to
                                      decide on his or her own. Why do you think it is always taboo in
                                      all those movies about God about the infringement of free will? If
                                      God wanted to create creatures of free will, then he can no longer
                                      truly remain as omnipotent as he once was, he gave part of that up
                                      the moment he created humans.<br> <br> People who say God is omnipotent and omnipresent do not clearly
                                      think about all the contradictions that rise with it and then we
                                      come into a full circle argument of how God is full of holes, when
                                      in fact the original statement is the one full of holes because
                                      most people can't see why he gave humans free will in the first
                                      place</p>

              <p>And as for the bible  being written 2000 years ago, it predates a lot farther than
              that, when Judaism was still a tribal society and it was used as a sort
              of lawbook then. The conception of the New Testament, specifically the
              Gospels, was written with no intent that a group of men were to become
              seers of the rest of humanity. That in itself is a misconception and
              stands in conflict with the reasoning and teaching that is provided in
              the Bible.</p>
