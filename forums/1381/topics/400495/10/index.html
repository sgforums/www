              <p>No again. Religion is not all about faith. It is about logic as well, in fact, it
              is the combination of the two that makes the ideal human. We all
              possess faith at some level, whether or not we can extend it to meet
              with logic, means that we are limiting ourselves and what we can do.
              The world may not need faith in God, but the world does need faith in
              itself, that people can have the faith that the person next to them
              won't kill them, that they can walk home safely at night, that so many
              other things that we do everyday can be done without us dying in the
              middle of it. We have faith in theories of science, because it allows
              us to build such wonderful machines but only because those that do make
              them have faith in the theory after using it time and time again.<br> <br> Criticism of faith is unsound because we all possess it. Faith exists
              in two forms. The first which allows us to have faith in the things
              that are, and the second is faith in possibilities. They are one in the
              same, and yet only slightly different because one is from a closed
              heart, and the other is one with an open heart.</p>

              <p>lol a couple married because they love one another and wants to start a family. whether faith comes into it, I am not sure, but I believe love is the reason why they want to get married.  you use the wrong analogy to reinforce your beliefs dude.</p>
              <p>as for divorce, its simple as they simply cant stand each other or that they simply dun love one another anymore and the like. so it can be said that, its 50-50 if you use betting as analogy whether the marriage is workable or result in divorce. gee someone need to use the right analogy better.</p>

              <p>Its again logic and faith. I'll explain more. What you call a logic is actually a faith in reasoning. How are
                  theories proven? by having a faith that they work and trying to find
                  the way around it.</p>
              <p>Humans are born ignorant for a reason, and that is to develop this
                  faith through reptitious behavior. When did the shadow in the dark
                  become a person? The more logical we become, the more this dilemma
                  changes. Walking home in the evening we see a shadow, and at some point
                  we may fear that the shadow is a person lying in wait for us. If <strong>logic
                  is to point to the dangers of life, then faith is to point towards the
                  beauty of life. </strong><br> <br> As I said it is the one of open heart versus closed heart. Closed
                  because fear of humans will eventually erode all other feelings towards
                  friends, open because you continue to believe in the people around you.</p>

              <p>u didnt understand my qn at the end...prove God's existence then i believe. its like prove the outcome of the 50-50, then i will believe. if ppl can do that for marriage, taking the 50-50 gamble...why cun they do it for christianity or any other religion?</p>

              <p>some say its satan or the devil. but it's convenient to lay the blame on satan,who rebelled against god. but then if god creation is perfect, how come satan, the angel lucifer originally, can rebel against god? doesnt god knows in advance that lucifer will rebel against him and if he knew in advance that he will be satan, then how come he doesnt do anything or why create him in the first place?</p>
              <p>nice story to lay the blame on satan for man's evils.</p>

              <p>For mariage, Actually i think its faith, you need faith for a marriage to go for it. Of course there lies the ugly thing of divorce.</p>

              <p>ok, so u have affirmed that faith is needed in life. but marrying without proof whether u will be divorced...isnt it sth close to blind faith? if u want to tell me its due to love, then it becomes parallel to christianity...wad if ppl became christians for the same reason why they get married? which is due to experiencing love from somebody? in marriage, its called ur husband/wife...in christianity, this someone is God?</p>
