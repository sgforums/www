              <p>this is called duality, I have no clue if you heard of this
              before. its like Tao or whatever you want to call it, you have Yin
              and Yang, ugly and beautiful, high and low etc etc. so normal and
              abnormal to you is just like duality, in between extremes I see. I
              dun get what u mean?  if that suits you, fine with me. but the
              issue is still around hello!!! if y ou avoid the question of
              equality and fairness, then yes we are on a different channel
              because you either avoid or deflect the question into duality. but
              no need bothering to explain anymore, because I know equanimity
              (wonder if you heard this word before) and egalitarian and fairness
              do not exists in your religion.</p>
              <p>its about master and slave type of relationship in your religion
              if I am being direct. also doesnt make sense a planet can be
              created in 6 days. this truly exists only in stories. if you tell
              this to people 2010 years ago, I am sure people then have no
              problems accepting this. but fast forward 2010 years later, I am
              afraid this is not so, because people are educated and science and
              technology are so advanced compared to the society then.</p>

              <p>its funny calling the pot black. when people do not agree with the preachings of your religion, what did you do? you and your lot went for the personal attacks. your reputation preceded you. this does not augers well for your religion.</p>
              <p>and when Rony Tan went on his rantings earlier, what did your community do? kept quiet? your high priest should have taken the moral high ground to say he does not represent the views of the rest of the community. The lack of response seems to concur with his opinions it seems. he got off very lightly, considering there were charges and jail time for people whose actions did not seem far worse than him, considering he is a leader in his church and there are thousands of congregations who listened to his preachings. this is considered as a seditious acts as it can cause social disturbances with the faiths he blasted. in this instance he got off scott free. I dun think he is truly repentent as he still holds the same views, but he will not make the same mistake twice in future. once bitten, twice shy.</p>

              <p>if you're intending to reply to me, pls include my post in your response. otherwise it'll just look like you're trying to 'siam' my questions. at least show some integrity in your actions even if you don't have any intellectually. </p>
              <p>no offense, but trying to comprehend your irrationality is difficult as it is already. you've to complicate it further with your poor grasp of the english language. i honestly don't understand your first part of the "someone said" and then pot calling kettle black. are you trying to say it's wrong to label your cronies... well, cronies? are you trying to say i'm wrong to use the word that i used before somewhere else? what are you trying to say, really? even if you cannot demonstrate a basis for your questions, at least try to substantiate your assertions. </p>
              <p>name calling? again, how? stating the obvious here isn't considered ad hominem because my observation about your intellectual capacity (or the lack thereof) is relevant to our discussion at hand because you dont seem to be able to comprehend the question and is merely avoiding it. If so, it wouldn't be right for me to continue arguing on that level and have to condescend further. check it out <a href="http://plover.net/~bonds/adhominem.html">here</a>... again, only if you can understand...</p>
              <p>one thing you've achieved though. I've nearly lost all hope in hearing a rational response from you. atheistic fundamentalists like yourself are a disgrace to atheism, as this philosopher will <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/02/atheism-dawkins-ruse">concur</a>.  </p>

              <p>I don't blame you for not having come across it, no one scientist has read all science journals either. I really would like to find that specific article for you but like I told you elsewhere, I can neither remember the names or where I read.</p>
              <p>Still, I just want to say also, science is not bad, but it has not been known to be absolute either. Even once wrongly accepted theories could only be rejected lifetimes later. Gaileo's theories on astronomy were not acknowledged till after his death.</p>
