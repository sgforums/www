              <p>if he knows, it is only right to interfere or not to let anything bad to happen at all if it is within his power. didn't many people claimed miracles happened to them and they got cured because they prayed to god. god is interfering isn't it ?</p>
              <p>can you think of anything positive for the future when natural disasters and sufferings happen ? well, i know you are going to say we are humans, we cannot comprehend god, don't use human's judgement to judge god or he will not call god.</p>

              <p>the reason for all these disputes is cos freewill is defined differently and while we can accept civil laws, we find it hard to accept God's laws...reason is simple...civil laws are made by fellow humans who are imperfect but God's laws are made by a perfect God. so which do u tink appears more acceptable and easy to meet?</p>

              <p>Because his children also chose to be treated differently.</p>
              <p>Lets not look at the icing n outset of it and instead look at the reasons behind it.</p>
              <p>I cant tell you why the children were born with deformaties, but I can tell you that most of these deformaties are caused by ourselves. Wars , bombs and accidents aside, some people of karmic faith can say that its your karma, or your parents or grandparents karma upon you?</p>
              <p>What then is equal for you ? Equal in God's eye may be spirittheual and not material and physical.</p>
              <p>Who are we to say that the disabled are of less value then that of a normal child ? Can a disabled child not be a blessing to himself and to those around him ?To touch others and motivate those that are more fortunate then him ?</p>
              <p>Without these disablities, without pain, without suffering, without being poor, how does one experience the opposite ? e.g My parents and thier parents were not as wealthy before but becuase of the pain n suffering they have been through, they appreciate it and made extreme headways now.Like how I never appreciate or know exactly what a poor person feels like. Only after working the volunteer centres n the like can you realise how blessed one is.</p>
              <p>You guys only seem to be touching on the very superficial and surface of the issue based on your own principals and religious or non-religious beliefs.</p>

              <p>read one of my posts...how do u noe natural disasters is bad? cos they lead to sufferings and death...but wad is suffering? wad is death? why do we term them as bad? if there wasnt good to compare them wif, how do we noe they are bad? so who do we give credit for these good?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>an analogy to help u...a normal person is born wif 10 fingers...but how do we noe 10 fingers is considered normal? cos from the beginning this was so...hence, when someone isnt born wif 10 fingers, we consider him/her abnormal...now, supposedly normal humans are born wif 12 fingers and now u meet someone wif 10 fingers, would u say he/she is normal or abnormal? u would say that teh one wif 10 fingers is abnormal. so wad am i trying to say? there must 1st be a normal standard to compare with...onli when there is comparison then we can noe wads gd or bad. question then is: since we noe wad is suffering, then we must 1st have knowledge of wad is not suffering. but where did we get this knowledge from? did it come by chance? or did it originate from some source? so while we blame God for sufferings, then wad abt blessings? we cannot say blessings dun exist cos if there are no blessings, then how do we noe wads suffering?</p>

              <p>Lets not look at the icing n outset of it and instead look at the reasons behind it.</p>
              <p>I cant tell you why the children were born with deformaties, but I can tell you that most of these deformaties are caused by ourselves. Wars , bombs and accidents aside, some people of karmic faith can say that its your karma, or your parents or grandparents karma upon you?</p>
              <p>What then is equal for you ? Equal in God's eye may be spirittheual and not material and physical.</p>
              <p>Who are we to say that the disabled are of less value then that of a normal child ? Can a disabled child not be a blessing to himself and to those around him ?To touch others and motivate those that are more fortunate then him ?</p>
              <p>Without these disablities, without pain, without suffering, without being poor, how does one experience the opposite ? e.g My parents and thier parents were not as wealthy before but becuase of the pain n suffering they have been through, they appreciate it and made extreme headways now.Like how I never appreciate or know exactly what a poor person feels like. Only after working the volunteer centres n the like can you realise how blessed one is.</p>
              <p>You guys only seem to be touching on the very superficial and surface of the issue based on your own principals and religious or non-religious beliefs.</p>

              <p>i read a bit on karma. the explanation is not the grandparents or parents karma upon them but it is individual karma (same karma) that brought them together. there are also cases that people born in the same family but not afffected. anyway not the place to discuss here, here is eh.</p>

              <p>Life itself is a blessing.</p>
              <p>Whether or not the child is suffering is not a matter of fact to be decided by us.</p>
              <p>Maybe u are more concerned with the physical disabilities then the more spiritual or disabilities of the one's ownself.</p>
              <p>Most times, those that are of disabled have touched,motivated, those around him and beyond more so then those who are without disabilities.</p>
              <p>Cant that also be called a blessing ?</p>
              <p>Anyways, its up to whether you want to see the advantages through the disadvantages rather then just its disadvantages alone.</p>

              <p>I'll clear one thing up, About free will. God may be omnipotent and omnipresent, but in
              no way is he an illogical being. You cannot be omnipotent if you create
              beings of free will, because if you do, then you do not grant true free
              will among your creations.<br> <br> The easiest way to see this is if you had a child, in all possible
              circumstances YOU MAY guide your child to grow up in a certain fashion,
              directing your child's thought process, but in the process you are
              constantly interfering with the child's own ability to decide on his or
              her own. Why do you think it is always taboo in all those movies about
              God about the infringement of free will? If God wanted to create
              creatures of free will, then he can no longer truly remain as
              omnipotent as he once was, he gave part of that up the moment he
              created humans.<br> <br> People who say God is omnipotent and omnipresent do not clearly think
              about all the contradictions that rise with it and then we come into a
              full circle argument of how God is full of holes, when in fact the
              original statement is the one full of holes because most people can't
              see why he gave humans free will in the first place.</p>
