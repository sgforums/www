            <div class='col-md body'>In light of the ongoing conflict between davidche and myself, there is a need to address the issue as to why Christians have conflicts. Such conflicts are not new, even here in EH. In the past, there are many such issues, stemming from a difference in denominational theories, differences in perception of scripture, or even a simply, a clash of ego.<br><br>Biblical speaking, are the historical people of God free from such things? Obviously not. Otherwise there will not be a record of Matt 18:15"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. 16But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.17If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.Â”<br><br>In the context of this verse, it is apparent that the offensive brother had not seek reconciliation and continue to live in error. This is different from what follows from verse 21 onwards where the famous passage of forgiving your brother 77 times.<br><br>Therefore the conclusion is, if a brother seeking reconciliation, he is to be forgiven, but if a brother does not seek reconciliation, the brother would be treated as a pagan or a tax collector. <strong>It should be noted here, that hard, decisive decision has to be made, and that they are not always pleasant.</strong><br><br>Now, letÂ’s examine the famous confrontation of Paul on Peter in Galatians 2.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It was done in public.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It was done because Peter is setting a poor example to the other believers and non-believers alike.<br>..in other words, conflicts between Christian is real and has to be dealt with.<br><br>Insomuch that I stand by the principle within the conflict I have with dave, <strong>I will apologise for calling dave a turd. I admit that it was totally unnecessary and I have become too emotional. So dave, I apologise for calling you a turd, which incidentally is a lot worst that calling you pathetic</strong>. But let me state that I had become frustrated because of the lack of desire to learn or improve on the part of this young person.<br><br>Note, however, that I did not apologise that I called him pathetic. I think he is a sad and pathetic young man who does not know where he stands and what he wants. I think he is pathetic in the way he calls attention to himself with his godless chatters and incessant whining. I think he is pathetic that he masks his lack of confidence through loud and boastful actions.<br><br>However, I wish him well, if he is willing to, as he said,  Â“become a better manÂ”.. then again, he has said this many times before and until I see a more proactive approach by dave, my opinion about him will not change.<br><br>But enough about dave.<br><br>In Eternal Hope, what do we do, what can we do. Christians (most of us anyway) here hope to counsel, mentor, explain, and hopefully evangelise. We deal with each other, listen to each others views, debate about it passionately, some try to help publicly, others work in the background. When we see a brother erring, what do we do? We chastise, we admonish,  we counsel,  we encourageÂ… sometimes privately too.... but if a brother does not listen, inspite of an overwhelming amount of discontentment,  what can we do?<br><br>I think that this is a bigger issue than the problem between dave and me.<br>And this is the one we need to answer.... because conflicts will continue to exist. The thing I want to happen is someone misquoting 1 Corinthians 13 about love.<br><br>Most of all, I do not want Christians of protecting ourselves when one of us err. This has happened before when overzealous Christians step beyond the boundary of good human relational transaction and EH had in the past been accused of harbouring such folks under the guise of love.</div>
