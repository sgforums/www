              <h1>'Vicar fleeced me out of £160,000': Despair of mother left 'penniless'</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When her marriage fell apart and her sister died, Amanda Machin was left on the verge of suicide and turned to her local Anglican vicar.</p>
              <p>But  Rev Steve Rankin persuaded her to part with £160,000 and left her ‘penniless’.</p>
              <p>### The vicar convinced her to sell her house and donate thousands to the
                  Church and missionary trips.</p>
              <p>### She also invested £50,000 in a business venture with the ‘charismatic’ cleric which failed.</p>
              <p>Mrs Machin said she was ‘completely dependent’ on the
                  vicar who told her to stop taking anti-depressants
                  prescribed by her GP.</p>
              <p>The minister told her he could cure her depression because it was caused by ‘demonic’ ties to her family.</p>
              <p>She was visiting his £550,000 vicarage several times a week for ‘deliverance
                  ministry’.</p>
              <p>### And he said that to be rid of the depression, she should strive to
                  be a better Christian by giving up ‘worldly possessions’ and giving her
                  money to the Church.</p>
              <p>### ‘When he spoke about the money, he told me
                  this was what it said in the Bible,’ she said. ‘He made me believe I
                  was living a life of excess and I wasn’t a good Christian unless I gave
                  up my possessions.’</p>
              <p>She even made the vicar executor
                  of her will with complete control over her money until her daughter
                  Jenny, 12, reached 21.</p>
              <p>### He also asked for £2,000 for a garage
                  conversion at his home and used £300 of her money for his
                  wife's trip to Finland.</p>
              <p>### She invested
                  £50,000 into a property renovation firm with him and he refused to
                  do work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### He persuaded an elderly parishioner to lend them £15,000 when the business floundered.</p>
              <p>### But the vicar failed to tell her the loan was in both their names until the paperwork was complete.</p>
              <p>### The vicar told her to sell her house and donate
                  £11,000 to the church, demanding the cash before the sale was even
                  complete.</p>
              <p>At his vicarage, Mr Rankin said he was aware of the allegations, adding: ‘I’ve just got back from holiday. I’ve got no comment.’</p>
