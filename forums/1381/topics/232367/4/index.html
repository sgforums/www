Who then can deliver us? Thanks be to God, the answer is Christ. Because we are in Christ, when we fell, we fell in Christ.<br><br>Does this means we can ignore God's commandments? of course not, but knowing that on our own, we cannot, we need to rely on Christ to enable us, to put the desire in us, to help us, to bring us through.... Its all about Christ. Hence I put it up that, there is nothing to boast about.<br><br>If our salvation is assured in Christ, why do we still do all these? its precisely this, that we want to follow the commandments and do the right things, to do charity ..etc, first its out of the abundance of God's grace and second to be a living testamony of His love, kindness, beauty and grace.<br><br>cheers.<br></div>

I think it's by Apostle John. Not me. As I said, somebody could be reading a portion of scripture but not read others so they are still true but incomplete.

Urs and thiers are both mortal intepretation of Scripture. Are u infallible?<br><br>2) Didnt Jesus built a Church and tell us that it resolves doctrinal dispute and is the PILLAR OF TRUTH. Church not Bible (which is created by the Church) is the pillar of Truth.

If he listens to you, you have won over your brother. If he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that 'every fact may be established on the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church. <strong>If he refuses to listen even to the church, then treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector</strong>.  - Matthew 18</blockquote>The Church is clearly the last and final authroity on dispute.<br><br><blockquote>But if I should be delayed, you should know how to behave in the household of God, which is the <strong>church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of truth</strong>. - 1 Tim 3:15</blockquote>A Scriptural reply to wad u said: "The fastest way to gain the whole truth is to throw away what the church teaches"</div>
