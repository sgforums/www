He wants to reward us!</span></strong><br><br>Will a father be pissed if his son looks forward to a reward for performing well in school? Or would the father be even more pleased and eager to reward his son?</blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by Gauze:<br>Be not as servants who serve the master<br>on condition of receiving a reward;<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be rather as servants who serve the master without condition of receiving a reward</span></strong>;<br>And let the fear of heaven be upon you.<br>- Pirkei Avot 1:3 </blockquote>Dumbdumb is correct, but the point is missed.  The key word is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hankering</span></strong> after rewards.  God is just and will reward everyone fairly according to his actions.<br><br><blockquote>Revelation 22:12 NIV<br>"<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done</span></strong>.</blockquote>However the issue is hankering after rewards which are not deserved in God's eyes.<br><br>Many christians believe that salvation is free and the act of merely believing in God will enable them to enter the kingdom of heaven.  This is wrong as good deeds are essential.  However even more important that good deeds is the attitude of the person.  Does he perform his good deeds and expect immediate reward, and if no reward or even suffering comes his way he gets discouraged?  Rather the one that does not expect any reward but trusts that God is fair will be the most blessed as mentioned by Pirkei Avot.<br><br>i.e serve God with the condition of going to heaven = wrong<br>serve God without any condition but trusts that God is fair = right<br><br></div>

They will have the discernment and won't fall into apostasy. They have never really accepted Christ bcos they never show any fruit at all not even one.<br><br>Do you love money more than God? If you love money, you won't love God or Jesus. So how to accept Jesus?<br><br>So if separated by works then what for believe by faith? Work your way to heaven then.</div>
