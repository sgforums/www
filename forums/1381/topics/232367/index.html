This over-emphasis on salvation is unbecoming of a christian as it is self-serving rather than with the intention of serving God.<br><br>Consider the words of Jesus...<br><br><blockquote>Matthew 10:39 NIV<br>Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</blockquote>Similarly, those who hanker after the reward of salvation will lose it while those that serve God fully without desiring any reward will be blessed.<br><br>So I ask again... what's wrong with going to hell?  If God demands that you descend to hell to do battle with the 7,405,926 demons of hell and their master Satan it should be a great honour.

If God demands that you descend to hell to do battle with the 7,405,926 demons of hell and their master Satan it should be a great honour.  The apostle Judas Iscariot was the first, and shall not be the last.</div></blockquote>What a joke .. you mean God is not sovereign over hell? Is hell outside the three realms (san1 jie4)?<br><br>Also, you want to battle satan and demons also not your turn. The honour is reserved for the archangel Michael.</div>
