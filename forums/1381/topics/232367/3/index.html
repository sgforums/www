            <div class='col-md body'>Romans 11<br><br>Paul is not speaking about a future millennial reign of Christ from Jerusalem that precedes the end of the world. No such thing is mentioned either in Romans 11 or any where else in Scripture. Paul is also not speaking about a future conversion of the Jews. Instead, he is speaking about the present conversion of the Jews. How do we know this?<br><br>Thus, PaulÂ’s whole point in Romans 11 is to teach the Jews that they have salvation, here and now, not in the Old Covenant of works, but in the New Covenant of grace (v.6). Paul even says that the purpose of his mission to the Romans was to Â“make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of themÂ” (v.14). Paul is talking about saving the Jews of his day, and never refers to some fuzzy event in the distant future when God will suddenly effect a miraculous, universal conversion of their offspring. What good would that do for the Jews who lived during the Church age? God doesnÂ’t work that way. God wants to save the Jews now.<br><br></div>

Can faith save you?<br><br>Let see how James expand on these<br>James 2 : 15- 16<br>15 If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, "Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill," and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that?<br><br>what he is saying here? to put it in a crude manner, don't just talk only, act one it. Don't just tell people, believe, believe, but you yourself don't believe.<br>Its a very practical teaching in term of practical living, how you interact and relate to others.<br><br>Its not contridicting Paul, when Paul says Salvation is by Faith in Christ Jesus, James is saying, since now that you had salvation, let your life reflected this reality that you already had salvation.<br><br>James 2 : 17-18<br>So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead. But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.<br><br>so what does these means then? can you show what you had believed without doing anything? Let me show you what I believed by how I live my life, this is what we called, lifestyle evangelism, meaning, let your life shows forth His testamonies (not because you need it to be saved, no, you are already saved), its for the world around you to see, and hopefully draws some to Christ. Thats why James says, let me show you my faith, my believe by how I live my life (my works).<br>Why dead? do you light a candle and hide it under the bed, if you do this, what good is the light? no, you put in on the table and let it lights light up the room around it. similarly, what good is your faith/believed to others if you just practice it behind the closet? how does it profits you and others?<br><br>James 2:19<br>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believeÂ—and shudder.<br><br>You believe that God is one, yes, even the demons believe and shudder.<br>Know that the Demons shudder because they know God will judged them, and there is no redemption. For you, do you just stop in God being the Judge? or do you put your faith in Christ and received salvation through His grace?<br><br>James 2:20<br>20 Do you want to be shown, you senseless person, that faith apart from works is barren?<br><br>faith aparts from works is barren? means what? no fruits lah, what type of fruits? let me put it this way, is your works that result from your faith drawing people to Christ or driving them away from Christ?<br><br>At the end of the days, for all these works, be it well done or badly done, you will be saved (salvation assured) but you may lose your reward (reward not assured).<br></span><br></div></blockquote></div>
