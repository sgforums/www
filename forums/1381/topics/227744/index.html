She said those smses are sent out to bless people, I dun have to get so uptight.  Hello, i din ask for those smses!  I dun need such blessings when i dun even believe in Jesus.  (Sorry, no offence to all christians here.  I had a terrible experience at a church years ago that made me refuse to have any contact with christianity.)<br><br>She can't give me a good explanation, she said there's no way to check who gave them my number, and they could only check by name and I had to give her my full name.<br><br>Ridiculous, she even said it's late, she's going home.  Ask me to wait for another week and see whether I receive such smses.  Machiam i owe her like that.  I'm so pissed off!<br><br>There's a limit to my patience.  I will give them a deadline up to Wednesday 3.1.07.  If I still receive such smses on Thursday, then they better be prepared to receive a warning letter from the police.  </span></div>
