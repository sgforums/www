            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sanctification: The process whereby a follower of Christ becomes more and more like Him. </strong><br><br>Oswald Chambers wrote this:<br><br><strong>The Cost of Sanctification </strong><br><br>May the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely . . .<br>Â—1 Thessalonians 5:23<br><br>When we pray, asking God to sanctify us, are we prepared to measure up to what that really means? We take the word sanctification much too lightly. Are we prepared to pay the cost of sanctification? The cost will be a deep restriction of all our earthly concerns, and an extensive cultivation of all our godly concerns. Sanctification means to be intensely focused on GodÂ’s point of view. It means to secure and to keep all the strength of our body, soul, and spirit for GodÂ’s purpose alone. Are we really prepared for God to perform in us everything for which He separated us? And after He has done His work, are we then prepared to separate ourselves to God just as Jesus did? "For their sakes I sanctify Myself . . ." ( John 17:19 ). The reason some of us have not entered into the experience of sanctification is that we have not realized the meaning of sanctification from GodÂ’s perspective. Sanctification means being made one with Jesus so that the nature that controlled Him will control us. Are we really prepared for what that will cost? It will cost absolutely everything in us which is not of God.<br><br>Are we prepared to be caught up into the full meaning of PaulÂ’s prayer in this verse? Are we prepared to say, "Lord, make me, a sinner saved by grace, as holy as You can"? Jesus prayed that we might be one with Him, just as He is one with the Father (see John 17:21-23 ). The resounding evidence of the Holy Spirit in a personÂ’s life is the unmistakable family likeness to Jesus Christ, and the freedom from everything which is not like Him. Are we prepared to set ourselves apart for the Holy SpiritÂ’s work in us?<br></div>

Call me ignorant but may I ask whats the biblical basis for sanctification?</div></blockquote>Sanctification is being set apart. Once a sinner trusts in Christ alone for salvation, he is set apart to God from the world.<br><br>Sanctification [positional] is simultaneous with justification. Justification is being declared righteous by God on the basis of Christ's saving work on the cross whcih you trusted alone for salvation.<br><br>Justification speaks of our standing with God [we are righteous in His eyes even though we are still sinners in this world].<br><br>While sanctification has two aspects: positional and progressive.<br><br>Sanctification [positional] speaks of our position with God. WE are forever set apart unto HIm. Even though the Corinthians were an imperfect  bunch, they were still called SAINTS [meaning set apart].<br><br>Sanctification [progressive] speaks of our being conformed by and by to the image of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Corinthians maybe an imperfect bunch but my!!!!! how they grew into the image of Christ over time.<br><br>The basis of sanctification is the cross.<br><br>Personally, it works when you yield to the Holy Spirit and allow yourself to be taught in His Word the Bible.<br><br>Providentially, all things work for our sanctificaion. ALL THINGS [even our failures]. I don;t know how God does this but we will see it in eternity.<br><br></div>
