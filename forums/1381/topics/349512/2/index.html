              <p>My view is that equality before God means that when we stand
                  before God in judgement after we die to determine whether we go to
                  heaven or hell for all eternity, he will judge us according to our
                  faith <em>and</em> how we lived our lives, ie: our good works and
                  our unrepented sins. It does not matter whether we are rich or
                  poor, strong or weak, Singaporean or Malaysian, Chinese or
                  Eurasian.</p>
              <p>Equality does not mean that we will all be equally prosperous
                  etc in this temporal life.</p>
              <p>And why do you say that God helped the Israelites but not the
                  Egyptians or the Babylonians ?</p>

              <p>I came to this conclusion because you were griping about how God doesn't "warn people HIMSELF to each and everyone individually" and yet you dismiss anyone who said he has met God as being delusional, requiring an IMH visit.</p>
              <p>I agree that there are many folks who are delusional but there are also those who might have had true encounters with God. But based on your belief that God does not exist, you would dismiss all as delusions.</p>
              <p>What good evidence do you want ? There's no need to tell us. Whatever it is, I pray that God will give you your evidence one day and that you will open your heart to him. Just try not to be too stubborn or pig-headed if and when that day comes. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>What makes you think that God favours one race over another in
              this life ? How has he done so ?</p>

              <p>i agree. God allows the sun to shine on good and evil men alike. He allows the rain to fall on good and evil alike.</p>
              <p>Salvation is not exclusive to the jews, but available to all of us, gentiles. </p>

              <p>I came to this conclusion because you were griping about
              how God doesn't "warn people HIMSELF to each and everyone
              individually" and yet you dismiss anyone who said he has met God as
              being delusional, requiring an IMH visit.</p>
              <p>I agree that there are many folks who are delusional but there
              are also those who might have had true encounters with God. But
              based on your belief that God does not exist, you would dismiss all
              as delusions.</p>
              <p>What good evidence do you want ? There's no need to tell us.
              Whatever it is, I pray that God will give you your evidence one day
              and that you will open your heart to him. Just try not to be too
              stubborn or pig-headed if and when that day comes. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let's take sex for example. If
              man is non sexual or at least, reproduction does not entails strong
              urges and pleasure, there will be no sexual crimes. You will not
              read about men having sex with underage girls.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">... but I guess for people that
              takes the easy way out... just believe, don't think, all this is
              too much to try to understand.</span></p>
