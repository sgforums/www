              <p>Yes, God made a covenant with the Israelites in old testament times which has since been replaced with a new covenant with all peoples, both Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews) when Jesus Christ, who is God, came into this world as a flesh and blood human. </p>
              <p>Coming back to my original query regarding your assertion which you have yet to answer; how has God favoured one race (presumably you refer to the Jewish race) over other races such that you're concerned that he may not be 'fair' on judgement day ? </p>

              <p>Regarding the new covenant, you can read verses like Luke 22:19-20 (words of Jesus at the last supper) and Hebrews Chap 8 (I believe the author is also quoting Jeremiah 31:31 from verse 8 onwards).</p>
              <p>I fully agree with you that there are lots of inequality in this world (in terms of material/mental well being, the ability to live in a dignified manner etc). Which is why in my original post, I had explained (in answer to your comments) that in my view, equality before God "<em>does not mean that we will all be equally prosperous etc in this temporal life</em>". It means that God does not discriminate based on our earthly statuses (president or janitor etc) and when we face God after we die, "<em>he will judge us according to our faith <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and how we lived our lives</span>, ie: our good works and our unrepented sins. It does not matter whether we are rich or poor, strong or weak, Singaporean or Malaysian, Chinese or Eurasian</em>."</p>
              <p>You might also be interested to read <a title="Matt 25:31-46" href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/matthew/matthew25.htm">Matt 25:31-46</a>. In this story about the separation of sheep from goats, Jesus taught us the importance of charity, to right these inequalities whenever we can in our own little ways, because it affects our eternal salvation (ability to get to heaven).</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">...ah... free choice... sooner
              or later it crops up to explain why God is hiding like a cocroach
              under a rock.... but it does not explain why people are warned to
              behave and if people are warned, that, does not explain why God
              cannot come out of his hiding place to warn people....</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">But</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Regarding "choice"; some
              schools of thought do not accept that humans have free will to make
              their choices.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For example, just as a shark
              cannot decide to live on land, man cannot choose to live in water
              naturally.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Man is constrained by the
              reality that is the limitation of his body. As far as living
              naturally under water is concerned, he does not have free will. If
              I can point out an instance where humans do not have free will but
              is constrained, that shows that to say humans have free will is
              rubbish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let's take sex for example. If
              man is non sexual or at least, reproduction does not entails strong
              urges and pleasure, there will be no sexual crimes. You will not
              read about men having sex with underage girls.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">... but I guess for people that
              takes the easy way out... just believe, don't think, all this is
              too much to try to understand.</span></p>
