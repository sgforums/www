              <p>The churches all tell people that all are equal in god's eyes, so can someone tell me why in the bible he helped the israelites and not the egyptians or babylonians? Equality? Free will? If what the bible says is true then why don't i see this happening any more?</p>

              <p>My view is that equality before God means that when we stand before God in judgement after we die to determine whether we go to heaven or hell for all eternity, he will judge us according to our faith <em>and</em> how we lived our lives, ie: our good works and our unrepented sins. It does not matter whether we are rich or poor, strong or weak, Singaporean or Malaysian, Chinese or Eurasian.</p>
              <p>Equality does not mean that we will all be equally prosperous etc in this temporal life.</p>
              <p>And why do you say that God helped the Israelites but not the Egyptians or the Babylonians ?</p>

              <p>God did in fact help the Egyptian. One when Joseph was given the necessary wisdom to understand the meaning of Pharaoh's dream. Joseph's wisdom helped the Egyptian evade 7 year long starvation. There was no grain everywhere but Egypt.</p>
              <p>If you think that God had been pampering the Israelites too much remember that God chose them above all nations to be a nation of His priests. A chosen people of God. With that in mind the Israelites had had their share of both help and punishment from God.</p>
              <p>I thank the Israelites for having spread the knowledge of true God. And I thank them even more for rejecting their Savior Jesus Christ so that we the gentiles might be saved and know God and become the chosen people of God as well, maybe not as a nation but as a person.</p>
              <p>From my point of view indeed God views everyone as being equal in His eyes in this world. So whether one is a king or a beggar they are both the same to God. Yes they are the same but not to men but to God. This means that when hearing prayer and acting on it God doesn't see who you are but God sees the heart of each man.</p>
              <p>To God the worth of a king is the same as the worth of a beggar or worse. God may judge each person according to what he has done but the worth of each person is the same to Him.</p>
              <p>Remember that God is not mere man so God knows everything and that makes Him deem each of us the same in His eyes while men do not know everything and are often fooled by social status and appearance thus our judgment are partial and tend to be superficial.</p>
              <p>So do not be afraid to come to God even when you have nothing to offer since God doesn't need anything from us except our obedience and life dedicated to Him. God is rich beyond all means. Come to God whoever you are. Have a chance to get to know Him in your life. And be blessed in this life and in the next.</p>

              <p>For those who refuse to believe, God can appear in all his glory before the person, whack him on the head and (to borrow an army phrase) ask him to 'wake-up his idea' before it is too late; and the person will still refuse to believe. He will probably attribute the whole episode to a hallucination, a dream or something. Your second statement shows it ...</p>
