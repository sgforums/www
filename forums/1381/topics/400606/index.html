              <p>What you said is true. Two people might interpret the bible differently, as they are of course being people. So who is the person that is interpreting the bible for you ? Is he really correct ? So comes to the conclusion, are you following the pastor like a god, or the god itself</p>

              <p>What you said is true. Two people might interpret the bible differently, as they are of course being people. So who is the person that is interpreting the bible for you ?

              <p><br>one thing that set me thinking was this. why did god chose to reveal his revelations 2010 years ago and why not earlier and why not now? so that was the only time god will reveal his revelations back then 2010 years ago?</p>

              <p>There was an article about organized thought versus

              other individual evil amounts to thievery, assault, and other sexual
              things; but in most cases the crimes committed by organized thought
              creates everything from the crusades, inquisition, and genocide, plus
              many more (holocaust etc). The problem always lies in the head for
              organizations of any sort, they may start off with genuine intention
              and a pure heart, but by making compromises to advance in the ranks,
              they slowly sell off their soul, and by the time they do reach a

              <p>Yes they cause lots of shit. like Catholic Church caused the holy crusades, the spanish inquisition,
              the destruction of America, as well as countless other atrocities. But at the same time people are also having war at that time. So i guess its humans/government fault</p>
