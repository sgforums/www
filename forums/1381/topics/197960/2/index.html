            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually I dun mind Hill Song, but if u look into the bible, there are verses which do says something abt order in the church too.<br><br>I also have a question: why must Christians point to the sky during worship and praise......I have culture shock when I first went experienced this......<br><br>What fundies are against are the people who go for an experiential type of worship, rather than really worshipping the lord....<br><br></div></blockquote>I was in a Brethen church before and the worship session is from 8am - 9am and after which is preaching. During the 1 hour, there is no worship leader. Any male can stand up and point to a hymn and we the organist will play and we sing. There are times when no one spoke up and so the one hour passed with no singing and just for reflection and personal worship.<br><br>Now, I was in this church for almost 2 years and I understand every church has their idea or an orderly worship. But to say that your style of worship is orderly while another style which is nosier is disorderly is not exactly right. And I left the church becos I could not stand how they just dismissed every thing that does not fit into their standards which I am afraid, many of them are not relevant anymore.<br><br>I do like the fundamentalist teachings in being biblical based and doing what the bereans did. That is what God gave us the bible for anyway. But the way they dismissed alot of things are not to be desired.<br><br>I like the charismatics becos they bring alot of relevance to our christian beliefs. But I do have a worry is that charimatics have a tendency to believe by sight rather than faith (which is what u mean, experential worship or belief)<br><br>I think both sides have plenty to learn as christians. And for fundamentalists at least they should see that God can be a relevant God without breaking the boundaries.</div>
