Consciously, yes, every believer is taught to be a good steward of money.<br>2.

            <div class='col-md body'>if a church does not mind having a pastor who takes in obscene amount of money as his personal wage, then the church is a bad steward....and anyone who does not object seeks condemnation upon himself or herself.....one may claim it's not public money but that's just a guise.....i've seen how excited worshipers 'throw' money into the coffers and feeling 'good' about their stewardship....are these not monies to be wisely used? apparently in some cases it's not.....so it does matter if it's a yes or no....<br><br>in the early nineties was a man who decided his calling was to form a church that reached out to the rich....so he formed one, got people in and at the expense of the church, took up residence in a bungalow, drove an s-class and wore fine clothes....i think he's still around but low-keyed now...my friend was a young man who started working, bought into the deceit that he too will be exceeding rich if he followed the church, gave up a substantial amount of his pay to 'support' the church vision.....is this faith or fraud? i think it's the latter.....</div>
