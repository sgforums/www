            <div class='col-md body'>I'll speak for the Methodist church...<br><br>The Methodist Church in Singapore has a stringent structure of employment, with various levels of promotion. Obviously the higher one is promoted, the higher is the salary. Not too long ago, the executive council right at the top make a mistake on the Bishop's pay. They did not cover it up but put the issue on the table and explain what had gone wrong.<br><br>Each church has it's own exco and oversees everything from the running of the church to the employment of it's workers. Granted that not every church is professionally run, and there will be some that require a higher level of management than others.<br><br>I don't see anything wrong with a pastor making a reasonable amount of salary. Unfortunately there are always some who feel that a pastor should be paid next to nothing and has to live in extreme frugality.<br><br>Each pastor also has to support his family and his extended family, and the salary structure may be pegged to some secular parallel.<br><br>Having said all that, I am not aware of any Methodist pastor that is seen to be extremely well paid and drive around in high end BMWs or Mercedes.<br><br><strong>Again, as with some of the other threads.... I ask: what is the purpose of this thread?</strong><br><br>I don't believe sillyme and myself speak for all congregations, but I'd assume to be true that most churches observe a practical level of frugality. There are, of course, some churches (a minority I'd say) that may be able to afford their leaders a lifestype of luxury. At the end of the day, they are accountable to God like everybody else, and what God would do to these churches and their leaders is between God and them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Gents, disregardling the tone of the thread starter, I think it's a very legitimate concern.<br><br>while it's obvious that certain denominations have much more stringent checks and balances in place than others, for some it's still a pretty much grey area. And every now and then we heard of financial scandals hitting churches in the US or Africa too. (where unorthodox denominations spring up frequently I suppose). And we do have to keep in mind that our dear friend Durai and the NKF managed to live it up for years despite yearly regulatory audits, eh ?<br><br>it's not just a concern for Christianity of course, but I think a legitimate concern for all religious organizations, a hands free approach is NOT good enough, for the members of the parishes and diocese are too, members of the public, no ?  I think it's not quite right to say that it's solely a matter between the organizations and their followers, it's like saying that the world doesn't have a right, and shouldn't care about cases like waco or the jonestown suicides, or that priests molesting little boys are none of the public's business too, right ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Who is allowed to attend the management meeting?<br><br>Each church may have more than one congregation. At church level, there may be administrative departments like building management, finance and human resource. Other departments may include Christian education, missionary and outreach. At congregational level, such departments are further broken down either at functional level like Sunday School, Ushers, Welcome committee, etc.<br><br>Members who are deemed suitable to serve in such committees are either elected or appointed. The criteria of selection depends on a broad spectrum series of factors which may include professional qualification ie, architects and engineers who may run the building management dept, professional accountants and auditors who may run the finance departments and human resource heads to run the human resource depts and etc. The one point that needed noting is that this are all done at a volunteer basis, ie no salary or financial gains is involved.<br><br>At the higher level, obviously not everyone can attend the meetings. This is no different from any organisation. Any committee can have the right to co-opt an ordinary member into any meeting if the need requires. And believe it or not, most committees will welcome ordinary members into such meetings if such ordinary members have been in the church long enough and show interest in knowing more.<br><br><strong>You obviously don't know that in any given church, looking for people to serve in such committees are NEVER easy.</strong><br><br>2) What information are shared during the meeting?<br>Depending at which level of these meetings, many issues can be discussed, including the remuneration of church staff. Confidentiality issue is no different from any secular organisation as sensitive issues may be discussed and debated (sometimes in rather heated environment) upon.<br><br><strong>I believe I have been nice enough to share with you such information. Yet, you have not even bothered to answer the questions on why you wish to discuss this.<br><br>Again I ask, do you think that all churches are run by brain-washed individuals who'd careless support their leaders extravagant lifestyle?<br><br><span style="color: red;">And again I ask, what is your intent?</span></strong><br><br>Based solely on your opening thread, I think the answer has already been given:<br>1. Yes, it is possible that there are some pastors who live like TT Durai.<br>2. Most churches operate with strong sense of frugality and accountability.<br>3. Money contributed by members to any given church essentially a private matter. If such members wish to support POINT 1, then it's their own business. However, base on what I know, the POINT 2 scenario is probably what most churches are operating on.<br><br>So, now that you have my explanation, what do you plan to do about it?</div>

"reasonable" or "too much" I believe is relative and depend who you speaks to. If the board of directors are multi-millionaire or their tai-tais, I am sure a $15K salary will be considered as "token" or "peanuts". Supposed if the church committee are make up of people from middle income group, a $15K salary will be consider as "generous".<br><br>So back to my question, who is there to decide? are the followers aware of how their contribution is being spent?<br><br></div>
