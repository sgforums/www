            <div class='col-md body'>Mpre stuff to add<br><br>The Eucharist is a true sacrifice, not just a commemorative meal, as "Bible Christians" insist. The first Christians knew that it was a sacrifice and proclaimed this in their writings. They recognized the sacrificial character of JesusÂ’ instruction, "Do this in remembrance of me" (Touto poieite tan eman anamnasin; Luke 22:19, 1 Cor. 11:24Â–25) which is better translated "Offer this as my memorial offering."<br><br>Thus, Protestant early Church historian J. N. D. Kelly writes that in the early Church "the Eucharist was regarded as the distinctively Christian sacrifice. . . . MalachiÂ’s prediction (1:10Â–11) that the Lord would reject Jewish sacrifices and instead would have "a pure offering" made to him by the Gentiles in every place was seized upon by Christians as a prophecy of the Eucharist. The Didache indeed actually applies the term thusia, or sacrifice, to the Eucharist. . . .<br><br>"It was natural for early Christians to think of the Eucharist as a sacrifice. The fulfillment of prophecy demanded a solemn Christian offering, and the rite itself was wrapped in the sacrificial atmosphere with which our Lord invested the Last Supper. The words of institution, Â‘Do thisÂ’ (touto poieite), must have been charged with sacrificial overtones for second-century ears; Justin at any rate understood them to mean, Â‘Offer this.Â’ . . . The bread and wine, moreover, are offered Â‘for a memorial (eis anamnasin) of the passion,Â’ a phrase which in view of his identification of them with the LordÂ’s body and blood implies much more than an act of purely spiritual recollection" (J. N. D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines [Full Reference], 196Â–7).<br><br>from : http://catholic.com/library/Sacrifice_of_the_Mass.asp</div>

I will describe my own experience.<br><br>I believe fevourly in the sacraments. Since we are on the topic of the Eucharist, i'll share with you mine. Everytime i go to church, i try to sit as front as possible as the Priest conduct Mass. When he breaks the bread, to me it's one of the most wonderful sights in the world, i always feel so humbled that Christ died and instituted this Sacrament for me to be in communion with him. Also in Mass, u do not just congregate with Catholics, it's a place where the living, dead and saints all congregate together and i cannot help but feel comforted that my grandparents are there too.<br><br>Remember my girl friend that was from CCC, she nv understood my strong passion for the Eucharist, till after her Baptism, while she was kneeling down and she saw the Priest break the Bread, she told me she almost cried.<br><br>I sincerely feel that sacraments are 1 thing that the Protestant church misses out on. It's something so wonderful, i cannot put it in words, it must be experienced<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Is it a obligation/duty to partake the Eucharist?<br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote>this i have no idea.<br><br>Anyway MC, i would like to stress that most Catholics do not really understand the sacraments and are misinformed.
