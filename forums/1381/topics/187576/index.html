            <div class='col-md body'>Did a search on the word Saint and come out with this.<br><blockquote><br>A saint is a person who has achieved a measure of holiness. Various religions treat the details of such a person differently and their viewpoints are seen below. The term Saint is derived from the Latin Sanctus meaning Â“HolyÂ”. This is a direct translation from the Greek word άγιος (hagios) also meaning Â“HolyÂ”. In its original scriptural usage it simply means Â“HolyÂ” or Â“SanctifiedÂ”. In this form it can be applied to a Â“HolyÂ” person, a place (άγιον όρος; The Holy Mountain, Athos), a thing Â— such as Scripture itself (αγιογράφικα Â— Holy Writing), or even God (άγιον πνεύμα; - The Holy Spirit). But very soon the early Christians began to using the term Â“SaintÂ” more narrowly to refer to a specific, exemplary individual. (For a lexical explanation, see Liddel &amp; Scott. [1])<br>The earliest known occurrence of άγιος as "Saint" seems to be in The Shepherd of Hermas, chapter 5 (or 13, depending on how chapters are counted), verse 2. "The Shepherd" was authored sometime in the second century.<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint<br></blockquote>another search in the concordance, shows a numbers of verses mentioning a group of people refering to as His Saints (example 1Sam2:9, Ps 52:9, Acts 9:13,  ..etc)<br><br>Rom 1:7<br>To all God's beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Here, one thing for sure, Paul is writting a letter address to people who is alive not dead, so these saints are still alive when Paul address them as saints and they are also God's beloved.<br><br>The open discussion now then is who then is the saints?<br>Perhaps, I could susgest that these are people who when God sees them will perceive them and worthly and righteous (Note: Its should be how God sees them that counts, not how men sees them).<br><br>God Bless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Baker's Evangelical Dictionary<br>of Biblical Theology<br><br>Saints [N] [J]<br><br>The word "saint" is derived from a Greek verb (hagiazo [aJgiavzw]) whose basic meaning is "to set apart, " "sanctify, " or "make holy." In the history of the Old Testament religion, the idea of holiness or separateness was inherent in the concept of God. God was unapproachable in the tabernacle or temple by the ordinary individual, being accessible only to the priests and only under carefully specified conditions. His presence (the Shekinah) dwelled in the Holy of Holies or the Most Holy Place, the most remote and inaccessible place in the wilderness tabernacle and later in the Jerusalem temple. Only the high priest was allowed to stand in God's presence in this area, and then only once a year at Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement).<br><br>This sacred place was further separated from the ordinary Jewish worshiper by another room called "the Holy Place, " which could be entered only by priests. The intent was to impress upon the people the utter holiness and sacredness of the God they worshiped, as well as the necessity of their being set apart or sanctified as saints in his service. This sense of Jehovah's separateness from the sins of the people and from the pagan idols of the lands in which they dwelled was the heart of Jewish monotheism. Its eventual disregard led to the destruction of the temple and the exile of Israel.<br><br>This idea of the separateness of God and his people is carried forward in the New Testament, which was written by Jews (except possibly Luke-Acts) who interpreted God's covenant with Israel through the teachings of Christ. Those who were dedicated to the teachings of Christ were frequently called saints by these writers (e.g., Matt 27:52; Acts 9:13; 26:10; Rev 14:12). Six of Paul's letters to churches are addressed to saints (Romans, 1-2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians).<br><br>Saints, in the New Testament, are never deceased individuals who have been canonized by the church and given sainthood. They are living individuals who have dedicated themselves to the worship and service of the one true God as revealed through his Son, Jesus Christ. Even the children of such parents are called "sanctified" (1 Cor 7:14-15). That is, they are considered undefiled by paganism if at least one of their parents is a Christian. All saved are sanctified, but not all sanctified are saved.<br><br>On occasion, when discussing the atonement, Paul carefully differentiates between Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians, calling the former saints and the latter believers. It was the saints, the holy people of God in the Old Testament, who brought the Messiah and redemption into the world, eventually extending the blessings to the Gentiles.<br><br>This usage may be seen in 1 Corinthians 1:2, which is addressed to "those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy [saintsÂ—Jewish Christians], together with all those [Gentiles] everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus ChristÂ—Lord and ours." The same distinction is made in Ephesians 1:1: "to the saints [Jewish Christians] in Ephesus and the faithful [Gentiles] in Christ Jesus." Colossians is also addressed to "the holy and faithful brothers" in Christ.<br><br>Paul addresses the letter to all the Christians in Rome as saints (Rom 1:7, because Gentiles who, as wild olive branches have been grafted into the stem of Judaism, now share in the full relationship to that plant and are also saints ), but the Jewish Christians in Rome, who are to be recipients of a special contribution Paul collected among Gentile churches, are called "the saints" in distinction (Rom 15:25-33).<br><br>It is informative in this regard that Paul refers to this same collection in 2 Corinthians 8:1-4 as a sharing by the Macedonian churches with "the saints, " not with the "other" saints. Paul's apprehension over whether the Jerusalem saints would accept such a contribution was based on the fact that Jewish Christians were being asked to accept the offering from Gentile Christians. The entire discussion of the issue in Acts 21 when Paul arrived in Jerusalem makes this clear.<br><br>Thus, although Gentile Christians are saints, too, because they were given access to the faith of Abraham and the people of the Old Testament, when redemptive history is discussed the Jews are specially designated the "saints" while the Gentiles are considered believers who were later admitted into this "holy" Jewish nucleus.<br><br>John McRay<br><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/Dictionaries/BakersEvangelicalDictionary/bed.cgi?number=T622" rel="nofollow">http://bible.crosswalk.com/Dictionaries/BakersEvangelicalDictionary/bed.cgi?number=T622</a>[/url]</div>
