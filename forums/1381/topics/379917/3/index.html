              hand, or has a humped back or is a dwarf, or has a defective eye,
              or has oozing sores or scabs on his skin, or has damaged

              physical defects disqualify him from presenting offerings to the
              LORD by fire.  Since he has a blemish, he may not offer food
              to his God.  However, he may eat from the food offered to God,

              places.  I am the LORD who makes them holy."</em>

              while David and all the Israelites made merry before the Lord with
              all their strength, with singing and with citharas, harps,
              tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals."<br>     "When they came to the threshing floor of Nodan,
              Uzzah reached out his hand to the ark of God to steady it, for the
              oxen were making it tip. But the Lord was angry with Uzzah; God
              struck him on that spot, and he died there before
              God." </em>  (2 Samuel 6:3-7 NAB)</p>
              <p><strong>Ritual Human Sacrifice</strong><br> <br>     <em>"At that time the Spirit of the LORD came
              upon Jephthah, and he went throughout the land of Gilead and
              Manasseh, including Mizpah in Gilead, and led an army against the
              Ammonites.  And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD. He said, "If
              you give me victory over the Ammonites, I will give to the LORD the
              first thing coming out of my house to greet me when I return in
              triumph.  I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering."<br> <br>     "So Jephthah led his army against the Ammonites,
              and the LORD gave him victory.  He thoroughly defeated the
              Ammonites from Aroer to an area near Minnith - twenty towns - and
              as far away as Abel-keramim. Thus Israel subdued the
              Ammonites.  When Jephthah returned home to Mizpah, his
              daughter - his only child - ran out to meet him, playing on a
              tambourine and dancing for joy.  When he saw her, he tore his
              clothes in anguish.  "My daughter!" he cried out.  "My
              heart is breaking!  What a tragedy that you came out to greet
              me. For I have made a vow to the LORD and cannot take it
              back."  And she said, "Father, you have made a promise to the
              LORD.  You must do to me what you have promised, for the LORD
              has given you a great victory over your enemies, the
              Ammonites.  But first let me go up and roam in the hills and
              weep with my friends for two months, because I will die a
              virgin."  "You may go," Jephthah said. And he let her go away
              for two months.  She and her friends went into the hills and
              wept because she would never have children.  When she returned
              home, her father kept his vow, and she died a virgin.  So it
              has become a custom in Israel for young Israelite women to go away
              for four days each year to lament the fate of Jephthah's
              daughter."</em>   Judges 11:29-40</p>

              Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.  Even worse, half their children
              spoke in the language of Ashdod or some other people and could not
              speak the language of Judah at all.  So I confronted them and
              called down curses on them.  I beat some of them and pulled
              out their hair.  I made them swear before God that they would
              not let their children intermarry with the pagan people of the
              land.  "Wasn't this exactly what led King Solomon of Israel
              into sin?"  I demanded.  "There was no king from any
              nation who could compare to him, and God loved him and made him
              king over all Israel.  But even he was led into sin by his
              foreign wives.  How could you even think of committing this
              sinful deed and acting unfaithfully toward God by marrying foreign
              women?</em>   (Nehemiah 13:23-27 NLT)</p>

              21:32 &amp; John 21:22</p>
              <p>Mark 16:17-1 8 which says believers can drink “any deadly thing”
              and “it shall not hurt” them</p>
              <p>Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family
              members hate each other.  He has “come not to send peace, but
              a sword.”  Matthew 10:34</p>
              <p>Jesus says, “Don’t imagine that I came to bring peace on earth!
               No, rather a sword lf you love your father, mother, sister,
              brother, more than me, you are not worthy of being mine.  “The
              real beauty of this verse is that Jesus demands people truly love
              him more then they love their own family.  I ask you how can
              we love someone that we can not see or interact with?  Love is
              an emotion pertaining to physical existence not to faithful
              ideologies, yet God threatens you with Death just because your love
              for your mother maybe stronger than your love for him. 
              Matthew 10:34</p>
              <p>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus.  <em>“Brother
              shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child:
              and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause
              them to be put to death."</em> Matthew 10:21</p>
              <p>Jesus, whose clothes are dipped in blood, has a sharp sword
              sticking out of his mouth.  Thus attired, he treads the
              winepress of the wrath of God.  (The winepress is the actual
              press that humans shall be put into so that we may be ground
              up.)  Revelations 19:13-15</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Jesus explains that the
              reason he speaks in parables is so that no one will understand him,
              <em>“lest . . . they . . . should understand . . . and should be
              converted, and I should heal them.”</em>  Matthew 13:10-15</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Jesus explains why he
              speaks in parables to confuse people so they will go to hell. 
              Mark 4:11-12</p>
              <p>Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he’ll give your a
              big reward.  Jesus asks that his followers abandon their
              children to follow him.  To leave your child is abuse, it’s
              called neglect, pure and simple. Matthew 19:29</p>
              <p>Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient
              children according to Old Testament law.  Mark 7:9</p>
              <p>Jesus says that those who have been less fortunate in this life
              will have it even worse in the life to come.  Mark 4:25</p>
              <p>Luke 12:47 Jesus okays beating slaves.</p>
              <p>Isaiah 45:7.  <em>“I form the light and create darkness.
               I make peace and create evil.  I the lord do all these
              things”</em></p>
              <p>God allowed my ancestors Adam and Eve to eat the fruit from the
              Tree of Knowledge.  Thus, allowing us <em>“to be like gods,
              and know the difference between good and evil”</em></p>
              <p>Judges 11:30-40 Jephthah killed his young daughter (his only
              child) by burning her alive as a burnt sacrifice to the lord for he
              commanded it.</p>
              <p>2 Kings 2:23-24 The prophet Elisha, was being picked on by some
              young boys from the city because of his bald head.  The
              prophet turned around and cursed them in the Lords name. 
              Then, two female bears came out of the woods and killed forty-two
              of them.  You would think that God could understand that
              sometimes the youthful make childish jokes.  Calling someone
              “bald head” is far from being worthy of death.</p>
              <p>Isaiah 13:15-18 If God can find you, he will “thrust you
              through,” smash your children “to pieces” before your eyes, and
              rape your wife.</p>
              <p>Jeremiah 19:7-9 God will make parents eat their own children,
              and friends eat each other.</p>
              <p>Lamentations 2:20-22 God gets angry and mercilessly torments and
              kills everyone, young and old.  He even causes women to eat
              their children.</p>
              <p>Matthew 19:29 If you really loved Jesus then he insists that you
              abandon your wife and children for him.  Only that way will he
              allow you to go to heaven.  (That is if you meet his other
              hefty requirements, don’t slip through the loopholes, and ignore
              the contradictions.)</p>
              <p>Genesis 19:8 Tells of a man named Lot who offers his daughters
              to a crowd of would be angel rapers.  Later, Lot impregnates
              his own daughters after God kills his wife for simply looking back
              at the remains of her city.</p>
              <p>Genesis 38:16-24 Tells a very interesting story of a man named
              Judah whom lived with his widowed daughter in law.  His
              daughter in law was grieving and wearing the veils of mourning
              which Judah (a rather stupid man) mistook for the clothing of a
              prostitute. He ended up impregnating his daughter in law and she
              left the city.  On a later date Judah sees the young woman
              again and demanded she be burned for being a prostitute (I like how
              only the woman is punished when THEY BOTH engaged in the sexual
              act).  It wasn’t until Judah recognized the woman as his
              daughter in law and she was with his child, that he decided not to
              kill her.  Basically, Judah can commit incest, use a
              prostitute (in his mistaken perception), and impregnate a MUCH
              younger woman, yet he thinks she is the one deserving of death.</p>

              <p>Brother,</p>
              <p>Buddha had nicely pointed out the wrong view on the God belief before. Buddha had also taught different ways of answering back with good intention.</p>
              <p>Anyway don't be angry as it is a mental anguish!!! May you be well and happy always!!!</p>
              <p>I already said this thread is for Christians who want to break away Christianity. Other Christians should not READ AT ALL, why post and start a "havoc" here. I'm trying to stop every "havoc" created here for Christians who want to break away Christianity. You created a "havoc" here and claim to be child of God.</p>
              <p>i don't have the need to say anything to you. since you are already
                                          "knowledgeable" in your bible studies and theory and on other religions.</p>
              <p>you don't even know what you are saying. and i won't bother
                                          because anyone that see and believe is being ignorant. Wow, Christian use the Buddhist term "ignorant", shouldn't you forget about Buddhism terms, or Buddhism is the way of correct teachings. You should said "Thou fool" like Jesus had repeatedly said. But Jesus said, “whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger
                                      of hell fire” (Matthew 5:22)</p>
              <p>Go tell Jesus "don't preach what you can't do".</p>
              <p>You may believe Moses is the most humble person on earth because he told people that he is.</p>
              <p>May you not judge and condemn, because if you hold on to
                  Christian beliefs, you will be judged and condemn. This is a terrible
                  feeling. I don't want you to have this kind of feeling. And I truly
                  mean it.</p>
              <p>See the logic?</p>
              <p>May you be well and happy always!!!</p>
              <p>If
                  you like i would like to know a good reason to leave buddhism if you
                  really know the dharma. So many people trying to leave different
                  religions for different religions or no religion. :D Everyone think
                  that their is correct, others are wrong. Some made informed choice,
                  others not. I came here to provide informed choices.</p>
              <p>I picked buddhism because it teaches how to meditate, how to
                  control anger, ones' children on how to respect parents and it suits
                  people with good-nature. I believe in "Ren Zi Chu, Xing Bun Shang".
                  Everyone is born with an undefiled buddha-nature.</p>
              <p>I come here with a good intention to save Christians who want to
                  break away from Christianity while picking one that will teaches their
                  children better moral guidence. Buddhism helped me, I want it to help them too.</p>

              Well God is not for everybody just that nowadays religion is mainstream.
              <br><br>
              Let's see Jacob had 12 sons how many knew God personally? One. That was Joseph.<br><br>
              God is not for everybody. It's said that many are called but few are chosen.<br><br>
              This may be hard to swallow but God is not for everybody to know. Sure anybody can put their faith in God but God Himself is not for everybody to know.

              You're a Fundamentalist Christian</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">10</span></strong> - You
              vigorously deny the existence of thousands of gods claimed by other
              religions, but feel outraged when someone denies the existence of
              yours.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">9</span></strong> - You
              feel insulted and "dehumanized" when scientists say that people
              evolved from other life forms, but you have no problem with the
              Biblical claim that we were created from dirt.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">8</span></strong> - You
              laugh at polytheists, but you have no problem believing in a Triune
              God.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">7</span></strong> - Your
              face turns purple when you hear of the "atrocities" attributed to
              Allah, but you don't even flinch when hearing about how God/Jehovah
              slaughtered all the babies of Egypt in "Exodus" and ordered the
              elimination of entire ethnic groups in "Joshua" including women,
              children, and trees!<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">6</span></strong> - You
              laugh at Hindu beliefs that deify humans, and Greek claims about
              gods sleeping with women, but you have no problem believing that
              the Holy Spirit impregnated Mary, who then gave birth to a man-god
              who got killed, came back to life and then ascended into the
              sky.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">5</span></strong> - You
              are willing to spend your life looking for little loopholes in the
              scientifically established age of Earth (few billion years), but
              you find nothing wrong with believing dates recorded by Bronze Age
              tribesmen sitting in their tents and guessing that Earth is a few
              generations old.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">4</span></strong> - You
              believe that the entire population of this planet with the
              exception of those who share your beliefs -- though excluding those
              in all rival sects - will spend Eternity in an infinite Hell of
              Suffering.  And yet consider your religion the most "tolerant"
              and "loving."</p>
              <p> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">3</span></strong> - While
              modern science, history, geology, biology, and physics have failed
              to convince you otherwise, some idiot rolling around on the floor
              speaking in "tongues" may be all the evidence you need to "prove"
              Christianity.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">2</span></strong> - You
              define 0.01% as a "high success rate" when it comes to answered
              prayers.  You consider that to be evidence that prayer works.
               And you think that the remaining 99.99% FAILURE was simply
              the will of God.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">1</span></strong> - You
              actually know a lot less than many atheists and agnostics do about
              the Bible, Christianity, and church history - but still call
              yourself a Christian.</p>

              He needs a bible scholar try asking them. Most good Christian only read the bible without knowing the detail of its history.<br><br>
              What I know is the current bible evolves from the nicea council then under byzantium empire who ordered that the ancient records of scriptures be put together. Then they decided which part to be included and which will not

              <p>Brother,</p>
              <p>Buddha had nicely pointed out the wrong view on the God belief
              before. Buddha had also taught different ways of answering back
              with good intention.</p>
              <p>Anyway don't be angry as it is a mental anguish!!! May you be
              well and happy always!!!</p>
              <p>I already said this thread is for Christians who want to break
              away Christianity. Other Christians should not READ AT ALL, why
              post and start a "havoc" here. I'm trying to stop every "havoc"
              created here for Christians who want to break away Christianity.
              You created a "havoc" here and claim to be child of God.</p>
              <p>i don't have the need to say anything to you. since you are
              already "knowledgeable" in your bible studies and theory and on
              other religions.</p>
              <p>you don't even know what you are saying. and i won't bother
              because anyone that see and believe is being ignorant. Wow,
              Christian use the Buddhist term "ignorant", shouldn't you forget
              about Buddhism terms, or Buddhism is the way of correct teachings.
              You should said "Thou fool" like Jesus had repeatedly said. But
              Jesus said, “whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of
              hell fire” (Matthew 5:22)</p>
              <p>Go tell Jesus "don't preach what you can't do".</p>
              <p>You may believe Moses is the most humble person on earth because
              he told people that he is.</p>
              <p>May you not judge and condemn, because if you hold on to
              Christian beliefs, you will be judged and condemn. This is a
              terrible feeling. I don't want you to have this kind of feeling.
              And I truly mean it.</p>
              <p>See the logic?</p>
              <p>May you be well and happy always!!!</p>
              <p>If you like i would like to know a good reason to leave buddhism
              if you really know the dharma. So many people trying to leave
              different religions for different religions or no religion. :D
              Everyone think that their is correct, others are wrong. Some made
              informed choice, others not. I came here to provide informed
              choices.</p>
              <p>I picked buddhism because it teaches how to meditate, how to
              control anger, ones' children on how to respect parents and it
              suits people with good-nature. I believe in "Ren Zi Chu, Xing Bun
              Shang". Everyone is born with an undefiled buddha-nature.</p>
              <p>I come here with a good intention to save Christians who want to
              break away from Christianity while picking one that will teaches
              their children better moral guidence. Buddhism helped me, I want it
              to help them too.</p>
