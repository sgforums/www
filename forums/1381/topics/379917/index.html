              virgin."  "You may go," Jephthah said. And he let her go away for two
              months.  She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she
              would never have children.  When she returned home, her father kept
              his vow, and she died a virgin.  So it has become a custom in Israel
              for young Israelite women to go away for four days each year to lament
              the fate of Jephthah's daughter."</em>   Judges 11:29-40</p>

              <p>Genesis 38:16-24 Tells a very 
              interesting story of a man named Judah whom lived with his widowed daughter in 
              law.  His daughter in law was grieving and wearing the veils of mourning which 
              Judah (a rather stupid man) mistook for the clothing of a prostitute. He ended 
              up impregnating his daughter in law and she left the city.  On a later date 
              Judah sees the young woman again and demanded she be burned for being a 
              prostitute (I like how only the woman is punished when THEY BOTH engaged in the 
              sexual act).  It wasn’t until Judah recognized the woman as his daughter in law 
              and she was with his child, that he decided not to kill her.  Basically, Judah 
              can commit incest, use a prostitute (in his mistaken perception), and impregnate 
              a MUCH younger woman, yet he thinks she is the one deserving of death.</p>

              <p>excuse me TS, but as you said, the verses you provided to surport your claim that christians should be open to reason directly contradicts what you expect us christians to follow, you should also listen to reasoning that we christians might provide. does it mean that if you arent christian you dont have to listen to the opinions of others?</p>
