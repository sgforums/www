              <p>just to inquire,wud did you meant by:</p>
              <p> <span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; color: #333333;">Everyone has
              their own interpretation of Bible. For a non-believer, it is easy
              to see that the Bible cannot hold on its own.</span></p>
              <p>your first sentence is fine, each and every person has their own
              interpretation of the bible, but your next sentence just proposes
              your ideology dat you as a non-believer, understands the whole
              bible from head to toe and definatly 100% understands what it is
              trying to say? are you trying to say that? because if you are, i
              think it is merely ignorance your displaying.</p>
              <p>how can a non-believer say it is easy to see that the bible
              cannot hold on its own? on what grounds are you basing this idea
              on? on the grounds are you saying that you understand the whole
              bible but you still see that it cannot hold on its own?</p>
              <p>sorry if im grumbling, but i just dont feel comfortable with you
              saying this sentence and i hope that you wud change it if you
              understand what im trying to explain...=/</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 17px; font-weight: bold;"> i personally agree on what <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/users/56055">laurence</a>82 said, there
              is no physical prove of religion, but that goes with any other
              religion, i mean, non-believers can also be considered as a
              religion in some aspects if you think about it properly. the only
              way to solve these disputes is to actually apply ours in faith, you
              dun have to come to another religion's forum and post things that
              you know will gain flaming from, if you actually do that, all your
              doing is bring bad name into your religion. in christianity, god
              does tell us that in certain times where non-believers do go
              over-board, we should do something about it, but this isnt the time
              yet.</span></p>

              <p>Yes, I have studied bible in the past. I cannot say I understand it from head to toe. Anyway, who in the world can claim they understand 100% of it. Further, I studied the origin of the bible.</p>

              <p>If you read it with an open mind. This book creates more confusion. I don't have to explicitly tell you which verse. You will know which verse if you read with an open mind and read it critically. (If you realy want me to pinpoint, please read the first messgae of this thread by Ex-christian. I can also add more, but I don't want to.)</p>

              <p>(2) "<span style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333; line-height: 18px;">bible cannot hold on its own"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333; line-height: 18px;">This depends on who you are asking and how you are reading it. if the Bible cannot hold on it's own, that the entire Christian faith would have collapse long time ago. However it is still growing and if the statistics are correct, religion as a whole is doing well. Herein, I am not saying that YOU should believe in the Bible.</span></p>
              <p>(3) religion creates tension</p>
              <p>On the contrary, it's power struggle that creates tension. If people can be bother to agree to disagree, there is no tension.</p>
              <p>(4) religion creates a defensive mind</p>
              <p>Religion creates a defensive insomuch as in Point 3, that if people can agree to disagree, than there is really nothing defensive. If you ask a question (genuinely), I can give an answer. Is that being defensive? However if your question is asked with the intent to offend, then a rebuttal comes in, can that be considered as defensive? You thing atheism doesn't create a defensive mind?</p>
              <p>(5) I want peace in this world</p>
              <p>We, and all Miss Universe, want peace in this world.</p>
              <p>(6) I advocate EVIDENT</p>
              <p>The correct word is EVIDENCE. Everyone wants evidence, however what is evidence to you may not be evidence to me. By saying that you advocate evidence, are you saying that religious people live without evidence?</p>

              <p>(1) My background</p>
              <p>Yes, I have studied bible in the past. I cannot say I understand
                                      it from head to toe. Anyway, who in the world can claim they
                                      understand 100% of it. Further, I studied the origin of the
                                      bible.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>may i ask your motive of studying the bible? did you really study it for the sake of finding help? did you study it for the sake of finding the loopholes in the bible? did you study it as a person opened to teachings? im not going to assume anything, so im just asking you questions so you can realize what im trying to imply here...</p>

                                      confusion. I don't have to explicitly tell you which verse. You
                                      will know which verse if you read with an open mind and read it
                                      critically. (If you realy want me to pinpoint, please read the

              <p>when you read something, may it be literature, the bible, short stories, or any other sort of books, if you know, or think you know something about the book, you tend to recieve a baised mentallity into thinking before you even started to read the book, truthfully, are you sure you really read it with an open mind? or did you already have a bad conception of christianity.</p>
              <p>of course, alot of people who read the bible, have a hard time understanding its logic, and that is not to say that i wont be like this majority, i do have times where i cant understand the logic of the passages, but this doesn't mean that its a loophole of any sort, the bible is written in the old'en times, which if you had studied the origin, should have known that in olden times, books which are written are not written to directly represent the text they appear as. if you had never lived in the olden times, what basis are you making that you have studied and understand the whole bible?(even if its not 100%)</p>

              <p>again you have explained that you didn't understand what i had said, i wont be flaming you for this, because i didn't write this clearly as well personally. what i was trying to warn the other christian believers is that, at a certain point where non-believers go over-board (scolding/flaming a christian just because they are one, attacking them personally due to our religion, saying things that a christian would perceive to be a wrong interpretation and a wrong misconception to non-believers)</p>
              <p>these are the times where christians shouldn't just sit down and take the flow of words from non-believers, religion is a very hard topic to debate or support on, because there would always be some1 who is against your religion in any certain moment in time,</p>

              <p>in what religion do you not have a defensive mind? even as a non-believer, you build a defensive mind&amp;heart(if you know what i meant, not literally) to keep out religion. i heard of this very creative idea from my own pastor who i respect alot, he once said, when we first set up a defensive mind, we build a thin covering around our heart, most things can get thru, but some will get blocked off.</p>
              <p>when we continue to hold up this defensive mind, we build a even stronger covering, which blocked alot of ideas from coming tru into our mind/heart, when we continue even further, to the point where the covering turn into somewhat a diamond, almost every1 is unable to penetrate into your heart anymore..</p>

              <p>i personally have been tolerating what you guys have said cus i was lazy to type a whole passage of text(ok, i admit being lazy), i dont know what other christians think, but i have been using reason to explain to you as well, even point out some misconceptions that non-believers have not noticed they had wrong. if you think i haven't been using reasoning to answer your questions, please tell me, because as a human, im not perfect, i cant know my capabilities like it was common sense to me and others.</p>

              <p>for your last point, i would have nothing to say, i myself aren't all-knowing, i dont have capabilities of a both a bible genius and a science genius, i myself will try to find out an answer to your question asap and pm you if i ever find an answer to your question one day.</p>

              <p>Hi Liquified,</p>
              <p>Thanks for your thoughts, I can see that you are a reasonable person. I wish you happiness in your life journey.</p>
              <p>I know this kind of debate is never ending.</p>
              <p>To answer you: I was introduced to bible by someone. Saw some mistake in the opening chapter. So I studied whole book to find all the faults and loopholes to be frank. When people came to share the gospel, I raised these faults. There was no more discussion. No debate. They walked away.</p>
              <p>Science is a beautiful subject and its frontier needs changing and advancing. It attempts to answer something which may not be final. For big band explanation, scientists will get to understand it one bit in the future. Science is constant search. Science is constant debate and needs mass collaboration.</p>
              <p>The bible was assembled from many religious books many years ago. Many books which not not worthy were not accepted into the bible. So the worthy books are cherry picked into the bible. Many points in the bible are based on ancient context. You may say that it is not applicable now, or we have to see it in another angle. However it cannot be changed literally, or else what is the fundamental of this religion?</p>
              <p>Good day.</p>
