              <p>evidently, you did not even bother to check the verses you are
              quoting....</p>
              <p>there is no chapter 29 in Matthew. This gospel ends with chapter
              28. The verse you are quoting is from chapter 19.... this is either
              a typo on your part or from the atheists website you are extracting
              from. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:26&amp;amp;version=NIV">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:26&amp;version=NIV</a></p>
              <p>so it goes to show that if you can't even get your passage
              right, it suffice to say that you did not even bother to do any
              research into the context of the verses, which can simply be done
              by either refering to Bible concordances, or go read up some
              apologetics studies.</p>
              <p>... but let's go beyond your apparent lack of indepth
              understanding...</p>
              <p>Matt 19:</p>
              <p> <sup><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">23</span></strong></sup>Then Jesus said to
              his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to
              enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">24</span></strong></sup>Again I tell you, it
              is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a
              rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</p>
              <p> <sup><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">25</span></strong></sup>When the disciples
              heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can
              be saved?"</p>
              <p> <sup><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">26</span></strong></sup>Jesus looked at them
              and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are
              possible."</p>
              <p>The response of "With man this is impossible, but with God all
              things are possible" was preceded by the question of who can enter
              the Kingdom of God. Jesus said that is it more difficult for a rich
              man to enter the kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the
              eye of the needle, to which the disciples basically asked "so does
              it mean that no one can enter the kingdom of God?" and Jesus
              answers that according to man's standard, it is not possible,
              but with God, this is possible....</p>
              <p>On Joshua, the record is of a military operation, wherein no
              supernatural power was involved. The army of Israel were facing a
              force with a more superior weapon. Based on military might alone,
              the army of Israel were not able to conquer the enemy's force.</p>
              <p>Could God have been involved supernaturally? Yes! But did He?
              No!</p>
              <p>When challenged by Satan in the desert to jump from the cliff,
              Jesus' respond was, why put God to the test.</p>
              <p>what happen at Lighthouse church has nothing to do with me.... i
              really don't care.</p>
              <p>you couldn't possibly lessen any bad karma of me.... you don't
              even know my real name.</p>
              <p>you know, you cannot even write coherently.... you last para
              doesn't even make any sense at all.</p>

              <p>Yes, point out his typo and cut/paste mistake. Thanks. There is no need to challenge his understanding of the Bible.</p>
              <p>Everyone has their own interpretation of Bible. For a non-believer, it is easy to see that the Bible cannot hold on its own.</p>
              <p>It is like "the Emperor New Clothes". Every one will see it differently. Of course, those people who trust REASONS and EVIDENTS will know if the Emperor has wore anything at all. There is no need to challenge people on the understanding of nudity. (Borrowed this analogy from Richard Dawkins)</p>

              <p>i challenge his understanding of the Bible because that's the basis for his rants. the crux of the matter is that the TS is extracting statements and insert independent meaning away from the context of the passages.</p>
              <p>the issue, really, isn't even about theology. it's about how one should read literature, which i am sure the TS knows.</p>
              <p>if to a unbeliever, the bible cannot hold hold on it's own.... then how do unbelievers become believers????</p>
              <p>it is likely that there are some who will argue that such converted unbelievers are stupid, perhaps, but that does not take into account of the number of professionals, scientists included who are Christians.</p>
              <p><strong>context </strong>- if a buffet restaurant advertises a "eat-all-you-want" meal, does that include the uncooked food in the kitchen, or even the furniture and fittings?</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>the emperor's new clothes.... actually everyone sees the same thing, that the emperor is naked, <em>this is really a bad example to use.</em></p>

              <p>Thank you gasband and Chin Eng,</p>
              <p>Yes, everybody, including you, see the Emperor naked because of the EVIDENTS, i.e. we can see it.</p>
              <p>With REASON, you can convince yourself that he is indeed naked.</p>
              <p>-----------</p>
              <p>I don't think "stupidity" can count into the equation when people stay in a religion or faith. Most of them want the spiritual strength, that's why they want to follow a religion.</p>
              <p>I am not saying religion is right or wrong. I only hate violence coming out from a religious fighting. As a moderate atheist, I just want to people, especially young children from a religious family to be educated and use EVIDENTS and REASONS to help them see the world.</p>

              <p>Dear Chin Eng,</p>
              <p>You are not fair to TS.</p>
              <p>Yes, point out his typo and cut/paste mistake. Thanks. There is
                  no need to challenge his understanding of the Bible.</p>
              <p>Everyone has their own interpretation of Bible. For a
                  non-believer, it is easy to see that the Bible cannot hold on its
                  own.</p>
              <p>It is like "the Emperor New Clothes". Every one will see it
                  differently. Of course, those people who trust REASONS and EVIDENTS
                  will know if the Emperor has wore anything at all. There is no need
                  to challenge people on the understanding of nudity. (Borrowed this
                  analogy from Richard Dawkins)</p>

              <p>Isn't it evidents and reasons enough that many has pointed out that TS really does not know what he is talking about (with regards to his understanding of the Bible)?</p>
              <p>Can't you see the evidence and reasons? Or should we cover it up with excuses such as "Everyone has their own interpretation of Bible" ?</p>
              <p>How can 1 man's wrong interpretation be used to justify his claim that the entire faith is wrong and bad?</p>

              <p>Everyone has their own interpretation of Bible. For a
                  non-believer, it is easy to see that the Bible cannot hold on its
                  own.</p>
              <p>It is like "the Emperor New Clothes". Every one will see it
                  differently. Of course, those people who trust REASONS and EVIDENTS
                  will know if the Emperor has wore anything at all. There is no need
                  to challenge people on the understanding of nudity. (Borrowed this
                  analogy from Richard Dawkins)</p>
              <p>Have a nice day.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely</p>

              <p>just to inquire,wud did you meant by:</p>
              <p> <span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; color: #333333;">Everyone has their own interpretation of Bible. For a non-believer, it is easy to see that the Bible cannot hold on its own.</span></p>
              <p>your first sentence is fine, each and every person has their own interpretation of the bible, but your next sentence just proposes your ideology dat you as a non-believer, understands the whole bible from head to toe and definatly 100% understands what it is trying to say? are you trying to say that? because if you are, i think it is merely ignorance your displaying.</p>
              <p>how can a non-believer say it is easy to see that the bible cannot hold on its own? on what grounds are you basing this idea on? on the grounds are you saying that you understand the whole bible but you still see that it cannot hold on its own?</p>
              <p>sorry if im grumbling, but i just dont feel comfortable with you saying this sentence and i hope that you wud change it if you understand what im trying to explain...=/</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 17px; font-weight: bold;">i personally agree on what <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/56055">laurence</a>82 said, there is no physical prove of religion, but that goes with any other religion, i mean, non-believers can also be considered as a religion in some aspects if you think about it properly. the only way to solve these disputes is to actually apply ours in faith, you dun have to come to another religion's forum and post things that you know will gain flaming from, if you actually do that, all your doing is bring bad name into your religion. in christianity, god does tell us that in certain times where non-believers do go over-board, we should do something about it, but this isnt the time yet.</span></p>
