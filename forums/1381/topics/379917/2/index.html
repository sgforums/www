              Good for me there isn't many positions for the title of eternal kings. There can only be so much and how many chosen people through the ages? too many already... and not counting those who love God today but if it's less you then I may have a little bit better chance still.
              
              <br><br>
              It's even best if I were the sole person who believe in Jesus Christ today. Better yet the sole person who believes in Jesus Christ as God and martyred tomorrow. 
              
              <br><br>Why did the apostles bother to preach the good news? Jesus was right that the kingdom of heaven is like a man who had found a secret treasures in a land then he sold everything to buy that piece of land. Only that I would prefer to misguide people so that I could steal the secret treasures for myself without having to sell anything or little.

            <div class='col-md body'>So if you choose to live in ignorance of God then make sure you live really really happy, eat, dance, have great sex, fulfill your every desires before death catches you because when it does your fate is sealed and you won't even know where you are then nor will you remember anything. You won't even be able to register the passage of time so no chance to feel that blissful waiting but its actually better because being aware of time without having life is an awful torment. What you had will no longer relevant to you even your own children. I tell you a little something that we are all given just one and only one thing and that is TIME. If you think that sinning worth the joy living this short life in total ignorance of God then do so. . .I just think we die too fast..we all die too fast.</div>

              Fundamentalist Christian</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">10</span></strong> - You vigorously deny the existence of thousands of gods claimed by other 
              religions, but feel outraged when someone denies the existence of yours.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">9</span></strong> - You feel insulted and "dehumanized" when scientists say that people evolved 
              from other life forms, but you have no problem with the Biblical claim that we 
              were
              created from dirt.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">8 </span></strong>- You laugh at polytheists, but you have no problem believing in a Triune God.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">7</span></strong> - Your face turns purple when you hear of the "atrocities" attributed to 
              Allah, but you don't even flinch when hearing about how God/Jehovah slaughtered 
              all the babies of Egypt in "Exodus" and ordered the elimination of entire ethnic 
              groups in "Joshua" including women, children, and trees!<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">6</span></strong> - You laugh at Hindu beliefs that deify humans, and Greek claims about gods 
              sleeping with women, but you have no problem believing that the Holy Spirit 
              impregnated Mary, who then gave birth to a man-god who got killed, came back to 
              life and then ascended into the sky.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">5</span></strong> - You are willing to spend your life looking for little loopholes in the 
              scientifically established age of Earth (few billion years), but you find 
              nothing wrong with believing dates recorded by Bronze Age tribesmen sitting in 
              their tents and guessing that Earth is a few generations old.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">4</span></strong> - You believe that the entire population of this planet with the exception of 
              those who share your beliefs -- though excluding those in all rival sects - will 
              spend Eternity in an infinite Hell of Suffering.  And yet consider your religion 
              the most "tolerant" and "loving."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">3</span></strong> - While modern science, history, geology, biology, and physics have failed to 
              convince you otherwise, some idiot rolling around on the floor speaking in 
              "tongues" may be all the evidence you need to "prove" Christianity.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">2</span></strong> - You define 0.01% as a "high success rate" when it comes to answered prayers. 
               You consider that to be evidence that prayer works.  And you think that the 
              remaining 99.99% FAILURE was simply the will of God.<br>  <br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">1</span></strong> - You actually know a lot less than many atheists and agnostics do about the 
              Bible, Christianity, and church history - but still call yourself a Christian.</p>

              <p>Anger is a discomfortable mental suffering that even Gods suffer. It is not a permanent state of mind. Our original state of mind is calm and peaceful.</p>
              <p>ANGER: One’s Own Worst Enemy</p>
              <p>The Buddha spoke about the wretchedness of anger and said that when people are<br>angry, seven things befall them that will cause enemies to rejoice.<br>What are the seven?</p>
              <p>1. They will be ugly despite being well-groomed and well-dressed.<br>2. They will lie in pain, even though they sleep on a soft and comfortable couch.<br>3. They will do things which give rise to harm and suffering by mistaking bad for good,<br>and good for bad, by being reckless and not listening to reason.<br>4. They will lose their hard-earned wealth and even run into trouble with the law.<br>5. They will lose reputation and fame which have been acquired by diligence.<br>6. Friends, relatives and kin will avoid them.<br>7. After death, rebirth will take place in an unfavourable state of existence, since a person who is controlled by anger performs unwholesome actions through body, speech and mind which brings unfavourable results.</p>
              <p>Everybody seeks happiness, and the whole of mankind seeks world<br>peace. But, because of the anger prevalent in all sentient beings, few<br>people feel true happiness, and world peace seems an impossible mission.<br>Why? According to Buddhism, anger has the most destructive power<br>among all negative emotions. Anger will afflict and weaken one’s body and<br>mind. On a larger scale, anger will harm or even destroy the world.</p>
              <p>Happiness Lies in No Anger</p>
              <p>The Chapter of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva in the Avatamsaka Sutra singles<br>out the adverse effects of anger, “Whenever a thought of anger arises, one<br>million doors of obstacles open. A single flame of anger will burn down the<br>forest-like merits.” Anger is thus recognised as the biggest enemy to meditation,<br>spiritual happiness, interpersonal relationships and world peace.</p>

              <p>The fact that you WANTED to break away from Christianity shows that you never really fully understood the power and love of God anyway.</p>

              <p>The fact that you DID NOT WANT to find out about Buddhism shows
                                      that you never really fully understood the power and unconditional love of Buddha

              <p>Important: Don't add on your own words to the quotes of the
              bible. Anyway Christian should never rely on human understanding, what
              they need is faith.</p>
              <p>But I think you did not have any faith. <em>"<strong>Even if you had faith as small
                                      as a mustard seed," the Lord answered, "you could say to this
                                      mulberry tree, 'May God uproot you and throw you into the sea,' and
                                      it would obey you!</strong></em><strong>   (Luke 17:6 NLT)</strong></p>

              <p><strong>God Admits He Did Evil Things</strong></p>
              <p>    [The prophet Jeremiah
                                      speaking]  <em>"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom
                                      you sent me to offer your prayer: If you remain quietly in this
                                      land I will build you up, and not tear you down; I will plant you,

                                      LORD is a jealous God, filled with vengeance and wrath.  He
                                      takes revenge on all who oppose him and furiously destroys his
                                      enemies!  The LORD is slow to get angry, but his power is
                                      great, and he never lets the guilty go unpunished.  He
                                      displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm.  The
                                      billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet.  At his

                                       His rage blazes forth like fire, and the mountains crumble to
                                      dust in his presence.  The LORD is good.  When trouble
                                      comes, he is a strong refuge.  And he knows everyone who
                                      trusts in him.  But he sweeps away his enemies in an
                                      overwhelming flood.  He pursues his foes into the darkness of

                                      a sword</strong>.”  Matthew 10:34</p>
              <p>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus.  <em>“<strong>Brother
                                      shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child:
                                      and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause
                                      them to be put to death.</strong>"</em> Matthew 10:21</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Jesus explains that the
                                      reason he speaks in parables is so that no one will understand him,
                                      <em>“lest . . . they . . . should understand . . . and should be
                                      converted, and I should heal them.”</em>  Matthew 13:10-15</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Jesus explains why he
                                      speaks in parables to confuse people so they will go to hell. 
                                      Mark 4:11-12</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">God allowed my ancestors Adam and Eve to eat the fruit from the
                                      Tree of Knowledge.  Thus, allowing us <em>“<strong>to be like gods,
                                      and know the difference between good and evil”</strong></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway Gods that think they are the Creaters of any worlds and will never die belong to just 1 Realm Of 31 Existence of Realms.</p>
