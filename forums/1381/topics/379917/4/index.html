              <p>Hmmm...I wonder why TS called himself Ex-Christian instead of a Buddhist. Still sore about being a Christian once or still cannot forget Christ?</p>
              <p>Let's says that TS has the facts about Christianity right (in my opinion, it is not right), then Christianity should be commended for the honesty. Even though there are "bad" aspects, they never try to hide it and it is recorded in the Bible so that all can read.</p>
              <p>Christians are followers of Jesus and all He did when He is with us is to show us that God loved us and He wants us to love one another. The missions of Christians is to spread the Gospels (Good News) and that is God love us and want to give us eternal life. And we should live in peace with each other and love one another like how He loved us.</p>
              <p>True, not all Christians can put their faith in their daily lives but then it is not the fault of God or Christ. Is it? True that some dubious "churches" are created and "dubious" teachings are preached but again, it is not God's fault. Is it?</p>
              <p>Like TS said, it is about informed choice. If one has not even gotten the "correct" understanding of Christianity, how can one claimed that one has made an informed choice to leave one faith for another?</p>
              <p>What make TS become a Christian in the first place and what makes him think that he will not leave for another faith again?</p>
              <p>And if he really thinks that Buddhism is great, why not just share with people the teachings instead of trying to flame here?</p>
              <p>So much for not wanting to create havoc etc.. and hope that your new faith can "create" a new "Ex-Christian" to one that is reflects what you said about your new faith. Your words and actions will shape our opinions of your new faith and your words and actions might just help to convert some.....</p>
              <p>God Bless...</p>

              <p>Thanks to everybody that contribute to this thread. I called myself
              Ex-Christian, because i feel something for humanity and compassion. I'm
              glad that Buddha provide these. He taught us many eternal laws of the
              universe. Most Christians know how God was like in the OT. Maybe you
              don't know how loving God is by sending good people to hell by not
              being in His chosen churches. I will not stick to anyone who has bad
              records and proud of showing them, eternally. There must be better
              religions.</p>
              <p>It is all about informed choice. Rest assure about my choice on
              Buddhism. I had read "Lun Yu", "Dao De Jing", and different Gods
              beliefs. A lot on Buddhism, on cultivating wisdom and blessings.</p>
              <p>I was a student of Hai Sing High.</p>
              <p>I started this thread for Christians who want to break away from
              Christianity. And I hope they have a good replacement. I said other
              Christians should not read this thread at all. They should not be here
              at all. Why post? How can I flame at my own thread?</p>
              <p>Yeah, when Buddha pointed out the wrongfulness teachings on the God belief. God belief people thought Buddha created "havoc".</p>
              <p>I will not be here permanently. Please understand, our states of mind is never permanent. Negative emotions come and go when you want. I
              have gave them websites so that they can go and start true Buddhism
              practices with a Master and never come back here. But helping them step
              away fromthe Devil of Heaven's control is the first step. People with wisdom must know some forums are not places to cultivate positive emotions. I'm here till now so that Christians who want to break away from Christianity can be firm on breaking away. Some know God is inhuman and work only for His own end, but find it different to break with the threat of hell.</p>
              <p>Rest assure, with more cultivation on loving-kindness, Buddhists
              will soon feel compassion even for the Devil of Heaven for his mental
              anguish.</p>
              <p>I'm not good enough to teach true practices of Buddhism. But I had provided websites.</p>
              <p>May all be Well and Happy always!</p>

              <p>I read a book from 1st page to last page. With logic of course.
                  Anyway the pali suttas is longer than the bible. I'm a lover of
                  correct wisdom and understanding, ethical systems and philosophies
                  of life. I read a lot. Are you interested in making an informed
                  choice now? If so I can give you a lot of websites to read.</p>
              <p>How do you read the bloody bible?  Ignoring some
                  unacceptable teachings, and obeying some?</p>
              <p>I dun think you want your children to obey this right? <em>“And
                  call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father,
                  which is in heaven”</em> (Matthew 23:9)</p>
              <p>It is important to have a virtuous wife and teaches your
                  children virtues, so they will succeed. And you have a happy
                  family. This is the works of karma.</p>
              <p>Do you know how the Devil of Heaven is like in Buddhism?</p>
              <p>How did you read things? Reading everything? If yes, can you
                  reply on every paragraph I made?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I will try research every paragraph that you've quoted to see if you have quoted it out of context.</p>
              <p>It will take time.</p>
              <p>It looks like you've just copied and pasted the texts. You did not elaborate on the verses that you've quoted.</p>

              <p>Still cannot understand your reason for calling yourself ex Christian when a Buddhist is more appropriate (for you) especially when you claimed you are about "humanity and
              compassion".</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong as I know that most (if not all) main stream religions in Singapore do preach about being good - humanity and
              compassion. So, there is no problem if one wishes to choose whatever faith that appeal to them. It's a personal choice.</p>
              <p>But your claimed of informed choices? I think you should said that you study about Buddhism and find it more appealing to you than Christianity....and if you have no intention to flame, then you should just explained the benefits of being a Buddhist. Not about how bad Christianity is especially when your interpretation may not be correct....so much for informed choices.</p>
              <p>Being in a Christian school does not mean you know the faith....especially when the focus of all schools now is education and not preaching of faith. In fact, they don't impose the faith at all.</p>
              <p>If you really know the Bible as well as you seems to claimed, then please enlighten us why Paul meant when he said it is about "faith, hope and love and nothing is greater than love"....</p>
              <p>I do not want to argue with you on your views about Christianity but God <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>do not</strong></span> send " good
              people to hell by not being in His chosen churches" as you claimed.</p>
              <p>And thanks for trying hard to save Christians by posting here but your are 2000+ years too late......</p>
              <p>May you be well and happy always too.</p>

              <p>I don't think every ex Christian will be told that he dosen't know God when they leave....if they do not post Christians teachings that may not correctly reflect what the faith is about. If what they said seems to contradict what Christians believed, then surely Christains will conclude that these ex Christians do not really know God.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, you should ask why they always claimed that Christianity is bad when they leave..... Why can't they just leave and be happy about it ?</p>
              <p>Being a Christian is about following Christ and living out the faith I.E. the teachings of Christ which is one of love, compassion and charity. Yes, it takes time to know, understand and develop a relationship with God...... just like a marriage when the wedding is not the end but the begining of a relationship. Like a marriage which is not always a bed of roses, it is about carrying our cross and following Him.</p>
              <p>You are right that there are Christians who do not know Christianity and Ex Christian is one such example (while he is still a Christian).</p>
              <p>I also agree with you that an informed choice and knowing Christianity are separate issues....which is why I am asking Ex Christains why he claimed that he made "informed choices" ..... he seems to claimed he knows how "bad" is Christianity (with quotes) and how good is Buddhism....</p>

              your emotion tricked you.</p>

              I asked for an earthquake then not somewhere else but where I stood....never knew how an earthquake would feel since then I know. God put a big smile on my face that day. Of course I don't expect ordinary people to believe me. But to put something true to the anger and rejection of lost people instead of lies...I enjoy that very much. If lies could heart the truth would hurt much much more<br><br>

              <p>I am happy that you found Christianity to be 'wrong' and Buddhism right for you. And there is every possibility that you might be right about your choice. But my wish for you is that you have found the strength and conviction to be able to accept that you might be wrong afterall and accept the consequences that follow. So you must be strong to believe that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IF</span></strong> you are wrong that whatever the bible says will come to light.</p>
              <p>I personally believe that the God I am believing is the only way. But hey, my belief is strong enough yet to accept the consequences that follow if I am wrong afterall.</p>

              <p>I call myself an "ex-christian" because I don't want to lie
              about it. I want board-minded people to know why and how an
              ex-christian breaks away from christianity. I'm giving info to make
              informed choices only. Isn't getting views from people with
              different exposures a good thing. Why are you stopping the flow of
              information.</p>
              <p>I study about Buddhism and find it more appealing to me than
              Christianity.</p>
              <p>After all, it is your personal karma. I don't know I'm flaming
              you because I don't type with anger. I'm just giving out more info
              for the sake of my targeted audiences. I think your emotion tricked
              you.</p>
              <p>My school preached on the specially selected parts of the bible
              every school day, then we sang praises. It is more correct to say I
              used to know the faith, until I gain intelligence.</p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">    <em>Trust in the
              LORD with all your heart, on your own intelligence rely
              not.</em>  </span> <span style="color: black;">(Proverbs
              3:5 NAB)</span></p>
              <p>Are you sure you have faith?</p>
              <p>    <em>"Even if you had faith as small as a
              mustard seed," the Lord answered, "you could say to this mulberry
              tree, 'May God uproot you and throw you into the sea,' and it would
              obey you!</em>   (Luke 17:6 NLT)</p>
              <p>I think there are a few faithful Christians who appeared here
              that know Christianity way better then you did.</p>
              <p><strong>Do Christians know God better than the Jews who walk
              with God, and are His Chosen people? Do you know what will happen
              to fake Jews in the Judgment Day?</strong></p>
              <p>Everybody karma is different. Including those living 2000+ years
              ago.</p>
              <p>Making an informed choice is making a useful choice that will
              help you, within all the knowledge you can get.</p>
              <p>Tell me what will happen to your family if you use this
              teaching? Do you find this teaching unuseful?</p>
              <p><em>“And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
              Father, which is in heaven”</em> (Matthew 23:9)</p>
              <p>What is your Christianity's understanding on this teaching?</p>
              <p>I would like to advice you not to use this teaching from Matthew
              23:9. This teaching will be a bad karma cause that result in a bad
              karma effect.</p>
              <p>Sir, you are a smart person too. You know using this verse "May
              you be well and happy always" is correct. You know what is best for
              you.</p>
              <p>I sincerely wish everyone,</p>
              <p>May you be Well and Happy always!!!</p>

              <p>evidently, you did not even bother to check the verses you are quoting....</p>
              <p>there is no chapter 29 in Matthew. This gospel ends with chapter 28. The verse you are quoting is from chapter 19.... this is either a typo on your part or from the atheists website you are extracting from. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:26&amp;version=NIV">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:26&amp;version=NIV</a></p>
              <p>so it goes to show that if you can't even get your passage right, it suffice to say that you did not even bother to do any research into the context of the verses, which can simply be done by either refering to Bible concordances, or go read up some apologetics studies.</p>
              <p>... but let's go beyond your apparent lack of indepth understanding...</p>
              <p>Matt 19:</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-23784" class="versenum"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">23</span></strong></sup>Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup id="en-NIV-23785" class="versenum"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">24</span></strong></sup>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-23786" class="versenum"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">25</span></strong></sup>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-23787" class="versenum"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">26</span></strong></sup>Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</p>
              <p>The response of "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" was preceded by the question of who can enter the Kingdom of God. Jesus said that is it more difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the eye of the needle, to which the disciples basically asked "so does it mean that no one can enter the kingdom of God?" and Jesus answers that according to man's standard, it is not possible, but with God, this is possible....</p>
              <p>On Joshua, the record is of a military operation, wherein no supernatural power was involved. The army of Israel were facing a force with a more superior weapon. Based on military might alone, the army of Israel were not able to conquer the enemy's force.</p>
              <p>Could God have been involved supernaturally? Yes! But did He? No!</p>
              <p>When challenged by Satan in the desert to jump from the cliff, Jesus' respond was, why put God to the test.</p>
