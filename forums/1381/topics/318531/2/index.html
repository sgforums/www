              <p>Another insult eh? you like to insult people eh? hehehehehehe. I
              would certainly like to repeat my request...but that depends on you
              to make me wanting it. I do not ask to test God. You think you know
              everything don't you?</p>
              <p>You read in the Bible that Moses' staff turned into snake.</p>
              <p>How about you see it now that the eucharist turned into flesh
              and blood.</p>

              <p>Of course some of you would still cry hoax!!!. And when you
              finally see God at the end of time you would also still cry hoax.

              <p>According to christian bible the answer is yes, Moses did fled or run away.  According to the Tanakh, the answer is no, Moses did not run away.</p>
              <p><span id="en-NIV-1605" class="sup">3</span> The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it. NIV</p>
              <p><span id="en-NASB-1605" class="sup">3</span>Then He said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. NASB</p>
              <p> <span id="en-KJV-1605" class="sup">3</span>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. KJV</p>
              <p><span id="en-ASV-1605" class="sup">3</span> And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. ASV</p>
              <p>3 He said, "Cast it on the ground and it became a snake; and Moses recoil from it. Tanakh JPS</p>
              <p>The Tanakh translate the verse as recoil, i.e a reflex action.  I think this is only a case of translation problem, the Jews and Christian translate the same verse differently  changing its meaning.</p>

              <p>The Tanakh translate the verse as recoil, i.e a reflex action.  I think this is only a case of translation problem, the Jews and Christian translate the same verse differently  changing its meaning.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How can the new be better than the old?  Is the 1917 JPS translation better than the 1985 translation?  A difference of 68 years.  For the benefits of those who don't have the 1917 edition:</p>
              <p><strong>1</strong> And Moses answered and said: 'But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say: The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.' <a name="2"></a><strong>2</strong> And the LORD said unto him: 'What is that in thy hand?' And he said: 'A rod.' <a name="3"></a><strong>3</strong> And He said: 'Cast it on the ground.' And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. <a name="4"></a><strong>4</strong> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail--and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand-- <a name="5"></a><strong>5</strong> that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.' Tanakh JPS 1917 edition.</p>
              <p>I will try to explain why I chose the 1985 edition over the 1917 edition. We should first understand the teachings of Judaism.  Ask any rabbi, what am I doing in this world, what's the purpose? I beleive christians also asked this question as in the book 40 days purpose driven life by Rick Warren.</p>
              <p>According to rabbinic teachings, we are created with a free will, to improve ourself, to overcome our evil inclination.  This world is full of temtations for us to overcome, when we overcome we improve. Unlike angels, we human can rise by improving ourself. </p>
              <p><strong>25</strong> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. <a name="26"></a><strong>26</strong> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. <a name="27"></a><strong>27</strong> And he said: 'Let me go, for the day breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.' <a name="28"></a><strong>28</strong> And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And he said: 'Jacob.' <a name="29"></a><strong>29</strong> And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed. Tanakh JPS 1917.</p>
              <p>The Torah teaches us that Jacob has struggled with God and with men and has prevailed. From the day we are born, our struggle begin.  Hashem give us the Torah to help us in our struggle,  to improve and to prevail.  The Torah is the instruction book for life given by Hashem to all humankind.</p>
              <p>With this concept in mind, I will try to answer your question, How can the new be better than the old.  The fundamental scripture, written in Hebrew remain unchanged, only the translation has changed to reflect more accurately the intended meaning that is written in Hebrew.  So, the new translation should be an improvement over the older  translation, otherwise, why bother?</p>
              <p>You will also notice  in verse 4 that, Moses is near enough for him to hold the snake by its tail.  If he had fled, would this be possible?  About the Pirke Eliezer commentary of a 'fiery serpent'  What actually is a 'fiery serpent', is it possible to hold a 'fiery serpent' by its tail? Nobody knows right? </p>
              <p>You have quoted John 3:14. Care to explain how the 2 incidents are related?</p>

              <p><br>This is a Christian problem. They want everything to be in black and white then can confirm. So if never say then better don't speculate.</p>
