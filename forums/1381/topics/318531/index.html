              <p>No doubt about that. So should we take the bible literally? Or only just the first 5 books?</p>
              <p>I can see there's much wisdom inside Judaism, after all, Jews are some of the most skeptical people around, not to mention some of the most shrewdest. Cultivated by the revelation of GOD to them as His chosen nation. Both of you are obviously not Jews, how do you ensure you certainly have a place in the world to come?</p>

              <p>The bible is the one misleading the public. Imagine scores of sunday school kids thinking the proper way to zao4 from the snake is to run away as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p>Mai siao siao .. matter of life and death ok. Not fun to encounter a cobra. Good luck to your life if you think you can run faster than its venomous spit.</p>

              <p>Hmm I once asked the Lord to give me an earthquake on the ground which I stood. Exactly about 3 seconds later the floor was swinging crazily. People started to squat. One girl which I saw soon squatted with her hands holding on the floor and remained in that position until the floor stopped swingging. I remained standing though I thought of squatting but hey I did ask for it. Now I know how an earthquake feels like.</p>
              <p>I know what it feels to have a heavy vehicles passing the road in high speed and it was nothing like that.</p>

              <p>Another insult eh? you like to insult people eh? hehehehehehe. I would certainly like to repeat my request...but that depends on you to make me wanting it. I do not ask to test God nor would I make the same request just for the sake of proving it. Besides it bore me to make the same request. Next time I'll ask for another thing perhaps LOL.</p>
              <p>You read in the Bible that Moses' staff turned into snake.</p>
              <p>How about you see it now that the eucharist turned into flesh and blood.</p>
