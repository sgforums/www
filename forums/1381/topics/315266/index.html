              <p>Well it depends. If the baby is jeopardizing the mother's life abortion is okay imo.</p>
              <p>Or if the foetus has been known to be imperfect but this is real tricky would you grow a blind child or a paralyzed one knowing that you could abort it having come to this world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other than that bring the foetus into the world. You did that and now be responsible for what you did.</p>

              <p>This is a tricky one. But when TS asks the question, wat ru really asking for? To prove a point that religious people are myopic?</p>
              <p>I believe life is present at the moment of conception, so simply put it, when abortion happens, there's murder.</p>
              <p>I think those who believe in abortion are pro-choice - can people choose to keep or abort? But i think the question goes beyond that - it's a question about life. Whose life are u going to protect? Whose life are u going to save? And i think that's where the issue of choice comes in. Pro-life first, then choice.</p>

              <p>if, according to Christian doctrines, all children who die as children will go to heaven.... wouldn't this be a more realistic approach?</p>

              children will go to heaven.... wouldn't this be a more realistic

              question.</p>

              this issue.</p>

              <p>Of course it is the responsibility of the parent to repair the damage child. The issue here is the life is not belong to us, we should not decide on someone's life or death, not even our own, it is belong to God.</p>
              <p>I am not sure which Christian doctrine you are refering to, but Catholic believe that unborn babies will not go to heaven as they die in original sin, which is only removed during baptism, however as I heard that since they have no fault of their own, they will go to highest part of hell called 'limbo'.</p>
              <p>And like you, I also hope and pray that none of us will have to make this tough decision in our life. Because if we are not strong enough to take the burden, it may cost us our relationship with God.</p>

              <p>Another one of those lame topics, as sumone2 (how many sumones
              are there really???) had said, what is the real question?!</p>
              <p>How about I throw this in: Would a parent attempt to repair a
              damage child, or would a parent just simply say, what God has given
              me, I will accept it in whole?</p>
              <p>In simple practical terms, if a child can be born with simple
              defects like a hair-lip, or more serious ailments like a hole in
              the heart. Do we then say, because God has given me this child, the
              way it is, I will accept it as it is?</p>
              <p>.... or do we attempt to correct it....??</p>
              <p>therefore, taking away all healthy children..... should we then
              abort a really sick child knowing that the child will either NOT
              survive or have a miserable life throughout his living years?</p>
              <p>one more thing....</p>
              <p>if, according to Christian doctrines, all children who die as

              <p>He or she could also grow up to be as inspiring as Helen Keller, and his/her upbringing and the support he/she receives from the parents will likely play a part in that. It's in the interest of the child that he or she should get a chance to receive and experience love. I hope that doesn't sound too preachy.</p>
