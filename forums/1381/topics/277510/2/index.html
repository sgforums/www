I prefer logical thought and thinking over thumping someone with verses in the bible.<br><br>While I've studied the bible and church history quite "detailed-ly" (for the lack of a better word), these are just icing on the cake.<br><br>I'd say my faith stems more from inside. A realisation? maybe. A conviction? maybe. I don't know what it is. It just completely makes sense. Almost innately.<br><br>It's hard to make sense of the Bible and the stories contained therein if you don't understand (metaphysical, maybe?) the very basics behind it all.<br><br>It's just hard to explain the reason I have the faith. For the lack of better terms, it's like a carving on the heart. I believe in God. And for the moment, it is Christianity that corresponds most closely to my (innate) understanding.<br><br>However, I don't leave it to that when it comes to discussion and debate about the Bible. I'd endeavour to explain the basics and take those who question through a discussion. I don't believe in telling people, "It is like that because the Bible says so", or because "I can feel it"<br><br>Frankly, for an unbelieving people, of what use is it that the Bible says so? Or what I feel?<br><br>Wouldn't it better that I explain the "misunderstood" verses and the premises from which they were derived. To show that they do indeed follow a logical course of thinking? Please note that I did not say I can prove God. Rather that, I can show that it is not illogical to believe.</div>
