            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TheGoodEarth:</div><div class="quote_body">So that was the premise and that was THE problem. The One God who created christians, muslims, hindus, jews, and cause them to kill, hate, quarrel with one another is no different from a father who cause his children to kill, hate and quarrel with one another over his property!</div></blockquote>I'd liken it more to the Father who dotes on his children but they get influenced all the same by their want to fit in with the rest of the world. Ensnared by the bad influences all around them, they quarrel with one another and within the family for the family assets. What they do not know is that the Father still owns the assets and he has the right not to give it to anyone of them. Yet being the loving Father, he waits in patience and love and tries to correct them time and again because he really wants them to inherit his wealth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But if at the end of it all, they break faith and go their own ways and are waylaid by robbers and thieves, that will be their own undoing. The Father, powerful as he is, does not force them to acknowledge him with force, but instead offers them full pardon and forgiveness if at any point of time, they'd only return to his house. A prodigal son, is no less a son.<br><br>The Father longs for his children who have gone wide and astray. But his love prevents him from restricting them their own right. Torn by his love, he pines for them unceasingly and at every opportunity to let them know that he still loves them and his house is safe from all the dangers of the world.<br><br>Some return after a weary journey. Some don't. And the perfect love suffers the pain of death for each one of his children who didn't make it, for all eternity.<br><br>When heaven and earth fades, at the end of time, while there is triumphant jubilation among all creation, pain remains, taken fully unto his own afflicted soul, a necessary suffering as his labour for love.<br></div>

Mebbe in PM.<br><br></div></blockquote>actually what he is saying pertains to people that has never heard the gospel message. And the people that lived before Christ, etc. There are actually a lot of works pertaining to this area of theology. With that being said, do i agree with Maven totally? i am yet undecided. I remember once using his line of argument when i was talking to a seminarian friend. The discussion went deeper than that actually. we were discussing the issue of suicide. And whether a person committing suicide would be punished with eternal damnnation. It flowed something along the lines of 'it depends on circumstances' where a person having depression has no power over his choice of death very much like a person having HIV has no power over his illness too. In the same way, when a person lives in areas where the Gospel has not been preached, and where he is not offered the choice to turn to God. What will happen to him? It then followed to the people who grew up Buddhist. Kind people who pursue their religion but due to conditioning would not have any chance of turning to God. Do these people have a free choice? it's up to debates too. In our discussion, we discussed about the nature of God. Omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. Yet, the central character of God is Love. or at least to me it is. If God is Characterized by Love, it is interesting to think whether he will give them a 2nd chance. But before anyone labels me as a heretic. These are just my sincere passing thoughts and i understanding that faith and works that flows from that faith is what marks my salvation. But then again, i am privileged. i had the fortunes of being born to Catholic parents who incalcate in me Catholic values since a young age.<br><br>As for my concept of hell. I was quite swayed by the views of the late Fulton Sheen where he describes it as a place devoid of God's love. And in many cases, it is not God  that damns us there. But rather it's the people that do not have the faith or face to face God that condemns themself to that place. But laoda, please understand that these are just personal thoughts. And they are not representative of the stance of the Catholic Church. I am still journeying like you are. and views change. But as long as your foundation doesn't get too much shaken and your faith in Christ remains, i think by all measures, everything will be fine.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
