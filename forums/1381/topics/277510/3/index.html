            <div class='col-md body'>While the bible is inspired by the Holy Spirit, it is still afterall a book with text. Anything in text can be misconstrued, misread, misunderstood and misused. To a certain sense, in a similar way, christians need to take bible studies beyond the text. The text must give a personal word to you, or what we call, a Rhema word. To anyone else in the world, a bible verse can be just a statement but if you choose to dwell deep enough, that statement might just bring you to another spiritual level of understanding and more importantly, deepening your relationship with God.</div>

Nowhere in the Bible does it mention what books are included in the Bible. In fact it possibly shows the contrary.<br><br>In the Old Testament, in Numbers 21:14 it refers to a Book of Wars which to date we have not found. Or once again in 2 Chronicles 12:15 where a Book of Shemai'ah which again has never been found. And in the New Testament, Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 5:9 about a letter that he wrote, a letter that to date we have not found either. Theologians now believe, based on several writings, that there were originally four letters to the Corinthians, instead of two.<br><br>When I refer to books of the Bible being found, I refer to Books that were written by sources authenticated by the Bible itself. One of the several criterias the Councils of Hippo and Carthage required was that the books/letters must have been written by the legitimate authors, i.e, the Apostles, among whom Paul is counted, before the New Testament Book would be counted Canonical.<br><br>The Book of Mormon does not qualify under this definition of Canon. But Its not for me to make any judgements here.<br><br>Green Part:<br><br>At the end of the Gospel of John, the last sentence states that "Jesus did many other things as well.... I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books to be written"<br><br>It emphasizes that the Gospels by no means contain everything that Jesus did and said but were selected by their authors to have particular significance for the purposes they wrote it.<br><br>Again in 2 Thessalonians 2:15, Paul writes "So then brethren... stand firm and hold to the traditions(teachings) we passed to you whether by word of mouth or by letter", indicating that there were teachings that were taught which were not written. He emphasizes it again in the same letter in 3:6.<br><br>Paul also interestingly attributes the "pillar and foundation of truth" not in scriptures or his letters, but to the Church, in 1 Timothy 3:15.<br><br>Instead of Scriptures (which when Paul spoke of, he referred to the Old Testament, for there were no other scriptures in his time), he says in 2 Tim 3:16,<br><br>All Scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching, rebuking, .... so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.<br><br>He does not say it is the pillar and foundation of truth.<br><br>I understand your concern. But it is not in Bible Memory Verses or Bible Verses, that Jesus nor God is found. I do not even need to recall any of these verses. But God is ever-present in everything and everywhere.<br><br>There is only one commandment really that every Christian should know and that is : To love God with all their hearts and to love their neighbours.</div>

Anything in text can be misconstrued, misread, misunderstood and misused. To a certain sense, in a similar way, christians need to take bible studies beyond the text. The text must give a personal word to you, or what we call, a Rhema word. To anyone else in the world, a bible verse can be just a statement but if you choose to dwell deep enough, that statement might just bring you to another spiritual level of understanding and more importantly, deepening your relationship with God.</div></blockquote>Very correct leh. I think the role of pastors is exactly to help us "dwell deep".</div>

It is ready to make allowances, to trust, to hope and to endure whatever comes. Love never comes to an end.<br><br>Paul adds on a few sentences later:<br><br>As it is, these remain: Faith, Hope and Love, the three of them; the greatest of them is love.<br><br>Jesus, when asked about the greatest commandment states that the greatest commandment was "To love God with all their hearts,..." and to  "Love your neighbour as yourself" Jesus also adds, (and I think so does the OT) that all other commandments come from these.<br><br>Now the Whole Bible, including the OT must be seen in the light of this.
