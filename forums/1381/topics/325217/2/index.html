              <p>and God also commands us to eat kosher, I don't see that happening in the catholic church either.</p>
              <p>get my drift?</p>
              <p>i'm not saying that i understand why God asked the jews to build the tabanacle in this way, but it's very clear cut about idolatry. my question is, without them, are you affected in your prayer life? if you are, then something is wrong isn't it. Because God's not in the statue, or part of it. so why should your prayers be less focused if the statues aren't there?</p>
              <p>if your prayer life isn't affected whether the statues are there or not, then it's a good thing, which also proves that you don't need statues to help you focus or concentrate or whatever you want to call it.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>1) All graven images and statues of the supernatural are idols</p>
              <p>2) God commands the Isrealis to build statues and graven images in his Temple and Tabernacle.</p>
              <p>3) God commands the Israelis to adore the man-made Tabernacle.</p>
              <p>Ergo, God has forced idolatry on his people.</p>
              <p>The problem with your argument (and hence your failure to understand the existence of graven images in the Temple) is your first premise.</p>
              <p>The icon is a visual dogmatic method expressing the truth of our faith in the same light as Scripture and Tradition. It can be used as a teaching tool or as a means of focusing people to God.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Idol:<br>An image used as an object of worship. A false GOD.<br>This is how the dictionary defines an idol.<br><br>Image:<br>A reproduction of the form of a person or an object.</span></em></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Are icons graven images or idols? Certainly Not. We stated that the first iconomaker was God and He continued to use iconography in the Old Testament. God Himself commanded Moses to make a bronze snake to heal the dying Israelites. Was that snake an idol? God Himself commanded Moses to create cherubim using pure gold with specific dimensions and place them over the Arc of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies. Were these gold cherubim idols? An idol or a graven image is a depiction of an inexistent being or an inexistent god. The bronze snake was not an idol because it pre-figured Christ on the cross, and the golden cherubim above the golden altar are existing realities of heaven. The golden calf, on the other hand, was indeed an idol because it was depicting an inexistent god. So icons are not idols but precious in the eyes of the Lord!</p>
              <p>Your arguments are only valid if you are able to prove that Catholics treat the graven images as idols. You have 2000 years worth of documents from the Catholic Church. Can you please point to me a single line which commands Catholics to worhship the images?</p>

              <p>now you're putting words in my mouth and taking what i say out of context.</p>
              <p>i'm saying that, your reasons for endorsing idols isn't a good one. because if you need the idols there to help you concentrate, means that it plays a big part in your spiritual walk, which means without it, you're crippled, which doesn't make sense, because God's not part of the statue, so why should the presence of the statue affect (adverse effect or otherwise) your prayers and worship?</p>
              <p>if the lack of statues doesn't affect your prayer and worship, you' would have proven that having statues there is irrelevant to your worship, so why do you need it?</p>

              <p>I have not stated that Catholics only remember/love God through icons. Instead I have mentioned that it is one of the ways Catholics express their love to God. Lets take an example - photos of our loved ones. Imagine you chanced upon the photo of your wife and you said to the picture - "I love you" and then proceeded to kiss the image of your wife. Are you expressing love to the piece of paper or are u using it to express your love to your wife? Its defintely the latter.  It is the same situation in the CC. The icons on the CC are there to remind us of our founder, Jesus, His Mother and the great Saints of the Church. Whenever some prays before a statue, he is praying to the person the statue represents just as how when you kiss a picture of your wife, you are expressing your love to your wife.</p>

              <p>2nd answer rgding the tower of babel..indeed no1 found it.in the accurate bible, it was only stated people were scattered from the ancient babylon of nimrod. only in the additional book of jubilee was it stated that the tower was destroyed..i jus did a wiki on the tower yesterday.</p>
              <p>3rd..noahs ark..according to the size of the ark in the bible, its around titanic size with a few levels.its an engineering feat quite impossible during that time.as for the quota of animals..every sort of living flesh 2 of each was to be gathered. so mayb really include all make n models of animals lor.</p>
              <p>lastly in genesis, it wasnt stated that all was collected in one day ya..the whole building and collection took hundreds of years bah..since when he died he was 950 years old</p>

              <p>For the different denominations in the Christian family, i have
              a simple layout that may enlighten the non-believers or hopefully
              allow us Christians to co-exist in harmony.</p>
              <p>In a big company, there are many departments. For one,
              there is the Accounts department, the Sales Department, the Human
              Resource Department, Research and Design or even Marketing
              Department... The larger the company, the more diverse in
              their structure, right?</p>
              <p>All these departments work in different fields and
              under different managers. Of course there are the
              general company rules like not being late for work, no
              stealing of confidential information blah blah but within the
              department, it also have a set of rules that only applies to
              staff within that department... right? </p>
              <p>Protestants may have rules that doesn't allow them to wear
              crosses with the Lord in the middle but Catholics are
              allowed. So why go into minor rules? Why compare among departments?
              Engineers do not complain why they can't they wear open toe shoes
              in their workshop compared to accountants sitting in the offices
              when the regulations states so.</p>
              <p>Look at Christianity as a big corporate company that has many
              departments... The Protestants, The Roman Catholics, The Eastern
              Orthodox, The Presbyterians etc... All of us are in different
              departments in a big company but we all work for one BIG BOSS...
              God and any squabbling among the departments will only prove futile
              and unproductive. So instead of comparing, why not admire the
              practice and work of different denominations.</p>
              <p>Some of the statues are of great masterpiece... really, just go
              to the Nativity or even St.Joseph Church next to the National
              Library and admire the art of creation.</p>
