              <p>If you happen to find yourself in a situation whereby the state(authority) in which you are living in collides with your faith how would you take your stand?</p>
              <p>Submit to the authority and disavowed God?</p>
              <p>Or take a stand on what you believe and suffer the consequences?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think this is a bit far off think again because during Japanese occupation in world war 2, the Japanese insisted to put their little shrine in each church building and insisted for everyone to bow down to the their sun god.</p>
              <p>I read in a testimonial book that a young Korean women decided to take her stand and lived to tell her tale. The title is: If I had to die. I have the Indonesian language version of it. You probably are not going to find it in the bookstores nowadays. it's been out for a while.</p>
              <p>I honestly want to make my stand but I do not know whether I would be brave enough if I had to make my stand. How about you?</p>

              <p>You know I have a growing belief that in several countries inlcuding my own and Singapore the economy is actually run by a few small number of people who are close to power such that anyone who are viewed by the ruling regime as a rebel or opposition are denied economic opportunites afforded to other 'normal' people.</p>
              <p>Not only on financial or economics, oppositions(<strong>for whatever reasons they are viewed such including personal beliefs</strong>) are also denied fair academic result. I am also suspicious that fair health care are provided for those viewed as opposition.</p>
              <p>I'm saying that if someday(and probably has started to few people) your state and faith collides, you can count on closed economics opportunites and unfair academics treatment. And you can be wary of  a fair health care treatment. Speaking of the devil.</p>
              <p>In awareness of such condition or risk would you still stand on your faith? This provoke a question that <strong>Do you really believe in God?</strong> For those who do not really believe in God they would in most probability submit to authority even when that means colliding with their faith and made them disavowed their faith and God. And these [shameful, really] people who submit to evil(authority) then become a part of that evil system helping to incarcerate innocent people who actually stand by their faith.</p>

              Nice one Fatum ^^
              I have the exact same thoughts as you :)
              
              Religion is detrimental to the advancement of human civilization, as well as a force which brainwashes millions worldwide, causing them to lose their sense of rationality.

              <p>Oh, trust me. We're well aware of that. Fact remains, you have to choose a side, so what makes you think choosing state over faith is any better?</p>
              <p>Had I lived in Nazi Germany, or Imperial Japan during WW2, how then would choosing state be any better? It is widely known that many of the Japs who fought and invaded countries in WW2 joined the war because they were called upon by their country, out of their cultural devotion to their emperor.</p>
              <p>Humans will always be selfish, one way or another, it is only to what extent. So their intentions will always be self serving. Choosing State over Faith is not the solution. At least with the Christian faith, God, who is above all, desires peace so long we all live righteously.</p>
