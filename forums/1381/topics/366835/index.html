              Why?
              
              Because the burden of proof lies on the Evangelist.
              
              He/she is unable to provide positive evidence for the existence of a Christian god.
              
              Therefore, whatever they use to evangelize preys on people's fears of life (can't handle the responsibility you have over your life), fears of death or plain ignorance.
              
              Schools are often a target for evangelists.
              
              As Dawkins said (rephrased), Children are incapable of critical and rational thinking, and such ideologies should not be exposed to them until they reach mental maturity. Can you imagine a Nazi child? a Communist child?
              
              Religion should only be taught to children through a secular perspective.

              <p>Not really. Satanism can also worship without breaking the laws and without bloodshed. (Except for those more extreme, mad kind of Satanist.) But extreme mad kinds of worshippers exist for all religions.</p>
              <p>Look at the two christians who distribute questionable tracts, and the zealous christians who harass secondary students for their numbers and give them tonnes of nuisance calls. That is breaking the law.</p>

              <p><br>If you are a rationalist and a realist... is that the most realistic course of action?</p>
              <p>I find you very strange, you reject religion but do not fully embrace what it means to be a full blooded naturalist and above all this nonsense called morality and human herd-mentality society.</p>
              <p>A true realist would realize that it is in his advantage to manipulate religion to get what he wants from the unthinking masses. In time this will lead the a class of enlightened people making all the choices for humanity while keeping the rest in the delusion of a noble lie.</p>
              <p>Well I don't really agree with that, but the onus is not on me to reach such a conclusion, but for the naturalist and realist.</p>

              <p><br>If you are a rationalist and a realist... is that the most realistic course of action?</p>
              <p>I find you very strange, you reject religion but do not fully embrace what it means to be a full blooded naturalist and above all this nonsense called morality and human herd-mentality society.</p>
              <p>A true realist would realize that it is in his advantage to manipulate religion to get what he wants from the unthinking masses. In time this will lead the a class of enlightened people making all the choices for humanity while keeping the rest in the delusion of a noble lie.</p>
              <p>Well I don't really agree with that, but the onus is not on me to reach such a conclusion, but for the naturalist and realist.</p>

              <p>Schools are often a target for evangelists.</p>
              <p>As Dawkins said (rephrased), Children are incapable of critical and rational thinking, and such ideologies should not be exposed to them until they reach mental maturity. Can you imagine a Nazi child? a Communist child?</p>
              <p>Religion should only be taught to children through a secular perspective.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>There's a problem with this... the thing is that what do we teach our children then?</p>
              <p>I dare say it's impossible to raise a kid without teaching them anything... we teach them it is wrong to lie, to cheat to steal and the like, and we want them to absorb these truths even when they have not reached mental maturity.</p>
              <p>Now why then is this the case? Does this mean that not lying, cheating or stealing are things that kids should be taught without them needing to think critically about it? Or are these values we hold to be self-evident?</p>
              <p>If we examine them... actually no. Parents will obviously raise their children in values they want them to absorb... even raising kids in a secular perspective predisposes them towards a particular perspective of life. At the end of the day there is no neutral position to take, basically this is the case of the rationalist telling us... we ought to raise our kids to be rationalists first and foremost... which is not a bad idea, but basically I don't see how it's different from teaching kids to be religious... it's just a different set of values we want them to absorb without question.</p>
              <p>My take? The onus is on us to raise kids with a brain... that we we can expose them to religion but we should not lock them in dogma and at all times respect that free will and individuals.</p>

              <p>Evangelism should be allowed for all religions, not just

              for the students. It will open them up to religions other than the
              one they grow up in. Therefore, they can then choose to believe in
              the religion that really suits them.</p>
              <p>Freedom of religion should be fully allowed in Singapore.
              Jehovah witness, mormon, Satanism, Paganism and other less

              <p>today i just kenna by two Christian Crusaders.</p>
              <p>Im a Muslim.</p>
              <p>They came to me, saying that they wanna have a chat. i say ok. Play a pathetic game, 'is ur number in the card'. Yes he got the number i choose. Then, his partner ask, do u think he can really read peoples mind or is it just formulas, of course formula. Afterall, he didn't did it professionally-once his eyeballs looking at the sky means thinking cap is on.</p>
              <p>Ah... then... 'so all this happen and due to god right'... something like that. OK, i was like 'urgh, i heard of them before'. So already showing a pissed face...</p>
              <p>Then, the story they told me was kinda pathetic. I have to say that i know all of that already. And i think that was the best they can tell. Let me summerise it,</p>
              <p>1) Jesus is a Muslim Prophet and Christian God. Both believes he will return one day.</p>
              <p>2) He nailed himself on a cross as to sacrifice his sins. (point of view of a Christian)</p>
              <p>3) so we all know that god doesnt like people with sins(smtg like that).......</p>
              <p>For me, point 3 is something that is applied in most religion.</p>
              <p>They ended by saying thank you all....</p>
              <p>I asked myself, should i call in the police? But i didn't... I want to gather more info first... yup, i read about evanglism in Christian..</p>
              <p>Dont mind getting myself in their 'angelic' mindset again.</p>
              <p>The story haven't end yet, the guy come back and say sorry if there are any misunderstandings. ok. wateva.</p>
              <p>Then i asked the guy what is the purpose of doing all these. He said, just to go around and tell people about their believes.</p>
              <p>____________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>I think that as a Muslim, this really gives a bad impression of my current mindset towards some Christians. I can't accept Evangelism here.</p>
              <p>So urm, what is the evangelism law is Singapore? I rmb reading somewhere saying that this is part of the religion? hence, can be banned?</p>
