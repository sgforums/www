            <div class='col-md body'>Hyper-Cooperativism: When Unity Hinders Evangelism<br><br>By Dr. C. Peter Wagner<br><br>We live in an age when church cooperation, both formal and informal, is considered a high value. The World Council of Churches is a pioneer in international church unity. The National Association of Evangelicals gains strength in America each year. Separatism, fashionable during the 1930s and 1940s, seems to have little appeal to the general evangelical public anymore. Staunch denominational loyalty among church members is at a low ebb; many people nowadays look for more than traditional denominational distinctives in a local church they are considering joining.<br><br>Cooperation being the Â“inÂ” thing these days, the danger of what we are calling hyper-cooperativism increases. I need to say here that this chapter is in no way intended to suggest that interchurch cooperation is a bad thing in itself nor is it a church disease. It is not in any way an antiecumenical polemic. I believe we need more Christian unity manifested in more tangible ways, not less.<br><br>Jesus' prayer Â“that they also may be one Â… that the world may believeÂ” (John 17:21) is a directional word for us today. Those familiar with my writings about spiritual warfare will know I am convinced that the wider the agreement we have among Christians, the greater will be our spiritual power as a church. Having said that, I will nevertheless argue in this chapter that cooperation among churches is more useful for accomplishing certain goals than it is for others.<br><br>Interchurch cooperation can be useful for social action projects, for providing relief to victims of earthquakes or famines, for sponsoring theological seminaries, for promoting cordial relationships between ministers and for programs of joint enrichment among churches of different cultures. It can also be useful for militant spiritual warfare over a city, for taking public positions on certain political issues such as abortion or taxation of church properties, or even for projects involving E-2 or E-3 evangelism at home and abroad. If our goal at the moment is evangelism that will result in church growth on the local level, however, the cooperative programs that have been tried to date have not proven effective.<br><br>Church cooperation, as I have said, is a good thing. Hyper-cooperativism occurs, however, when an attempt is made to use cooperation for unwise purposes. It is frequently not just neutral, but in certain circumstances it can become counterproductive.<br><br>A FALSE PREMISE<br><br>For at least three decades, evangelicals, who have typically professed to be committed to effective evangelism and church growth, have been told that one way to evangelize more effectively is to cooperate interdenominationally on a local or regional level. Citywide evangelistic efforts have become popular and have constituted a prominent method of doing evangelization in American since the early Â‘50s, and even before.<br><br>Some of the parachurch evangelistic agencies that have materialized have solicited resources both from the churches of a given city and from their church members to conduct a program of citywide evangelism. Their premise, whether explicit or implied, has been that through supporting the citywide cooperative evangelistic effort, more unbelievers will be won to Christ and folded into the participating churches than without it. Some evangelists will not accept an invitation to come to a city unless a certain degree of interchurch support for the crusade is secured beforehand. The underlying assumption is that the more cooperation, the more fruit will be born by the evangelistic project.<br><br>This premise has shown little or no evidence that it is valid. Research done to date about citywide evangelism seems to indicate that just the opposite may frequently be trueÂ—the more churches cooperate interdenominationally in evangelistic projects, the less effectively they evangelize.<br><br>Of the several reasons hyper-cooperativism frequently reduces evangelistic effectiveness, perhaps the most important is that cooperative efforts tend to dilute the centrality of the local church. Citywide evangelistic efforts involving the churches of just one denomination may have more potential than interdenominational efforts, but the strongest of all is local church evangelism.<br><br>In the typical citywide effort, the meetings are held in a neutral place, such as a stadium or a civic auditorium, and consequently in the minds of the unbelievers who attend, there is no natural or necessary connection between making a decision for Christ and commitment to a local church. Unless the local church remains central, the kind of evangelism that produces fruit that remains and results in church growth will be minimal.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>POSITIVE EFFECTS OF COOPERATIVE EVANGELISM<br><br>Evaluation of the results of any evangelistic program will, naturally, depend on the goals set for it. The assumption in this book, as in all church growth writings, is that evangelism should result in church growth. The premise is that a thorough conversion will involve a dual commitment: (1) commitment to Jesus Christ and (2) commitment to the Body of Christ. An important difference must be kept in mind between evangelism that results in decisions for Christ and evangelism that results in disciples of Christ.<br><br>Having said that, however, it must also be added that many citywide evangelistic efforts have brought positive results that cannot be measured directly in church growth. Some of them are as follows:<br><br>E-0 Evangelism<br>In the previous chapter, we described E-1, E-2 and E-3 evangelism. E-0 evangelism is the other category in the series. It signifies winning to Christ a person who is already a church member, but who has never made a personal commitment to Christ. Theoretically, all church members should have made a commitment to Christ, but we all know that many have not. The percentage will vary from church to church, but virtually every church has some members who are not yet saved or committed or born again or converted or whatever terminology may be appropriate to a certain tradition.<br><br>Recent surveys show that although 56 percent of American adults are active church members, only 36 percent are born again Christians. That leaves 20 percent who probably need E-0 evangelism. We are probably talking about 50 million people!<br><br>When E-0 evangelism occurs, the church, of course, does not grow visibly, because the individuals are already members. But it becomes a better church, it grows in quality; and that is certainly a commendable thing.<br><br>The Rite of Passage<br>Anthropologists tell us that most societies have developed certain prescribed ceremonies that give visible public sanction to the milestone events in the life cycle of individuals. Big evangelistic crusades provide occasions for such so-called Â“rites of passage,Â” both for the children of believers who feel a need to express their faith publicly, and for others who may have already decided to become Christians and who are looking for an appropriate opportunity to finalize their decisions. In all probability, both of these kinds of people would have eventually made professions of faith with or without the crusade, but the citywide evangelistic crusade is as good an opportunity as any to do it.<br><br>Public Exposure to the Gospel<br>Citywide crusades tend to bring Jesus Christ to a high level of public attention. Television and radio spots, billboards, bumper stickers, large meetings reported in the newspapers, all help to draw public attention to the message. How much this actually aids in the total process of evangelization may vary according to the situation. Its effectiveness also depends on the previous level of awareness of the general public. In most cases, it can be listed as another positive benefit.<br><br>Privatized Christians<br>As Thomas Luckmann and other sociologists of religion have pointed out, the phenomenon of Â“privatized religionÂ” has been on the increase in America . Although this includes religious expressions other than Christianity, undoubtedly, an increasing number of Americans may have been reconciled to God through Jesus Christ, but they do not belong to a church, nor do they have any immediate intention of joining one. Many undoubtedly are TV Christians. In their pyjamas and slippers, they may watch Robert Schuller or Jerry Falwell or James Kennedy or others, while sipping coffee and munching a Danish pastry. They send contributions to these programs, and consider them their surrogate churches.<br><br>Undoubtedly, many such TV Christians are truly committed to Jesus Christ. They grow in their faith Sunday by Sunday. They read the Bible and pray regularly. The Church Growth Movement, however, considers this an incomplete commitment. As I have said, we teach that a full commitment to Jesus Christ involved a simultaneous commitment to His Body, the Church. The Bible indicates that authentic Christians are to relate to each other in the Body of Christ (see 1 Cor. 12), using their spiritual gifts to minister to one another.<br><br>Some, of course, are privatized Christians by necessity. They are aged or disabled and could not leave home and attend church if they wanted to. Others are TV Christians by choice. Although I must admit that it is better to be privatized Christian than no Christian at all, I do not believe this should be encouraged as a substitute for responsible church membership. Nevertheless, it must be affirmed that Christians who may not join church are often a fruit of citywide evangelistic efforts.<br><br>FALLING SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS<br><br>E-0 evangelism, evangelistic rites of passage, increased public exposure to the gospel message, and privatized Christians are all positive results of cooperative evangelism. But none of them fully meets the expectations of the average pastor who leads the church into special large-scale evangelism programs. Deep down in their hearts, local church pastors want those programs to help their churches grow through reaching unchurched men and women with the message of Christ and folding them into fellowship in their congregations. To the degree that this doesn't happen, they predictably feel let down.<br><br>Biblically, the goal of the Great Commission is to make disciples. Making disciples is the only imperative verb in the Commission as found in Matthew:<br><br>Â“Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded youÂ” (Matt. 28:19,20).<br><br>Going, preaching, baptizing, teaching and whatever else is necessary to make disciplesÂ—these are all important, but the final goal is to make disciples . In a rare exception or two, such as Joseph of Arimathea, biblical disciples were what we would today call church members. They are described as continuing Â“steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayersÂ” (Acts 2:42). When authentic disciples are made, churches add them to their numbers and grow.<br><br>Evangelistic associations that report their final results in terms of attendance at crusades, decisions recorded, Bible studies joined or anything less than responsible church membership, are fulfilling the Great Commission only partially. The very nature of most cooperative evangelism, as we have seen, hinders making church membership the bottom line against which to measure and report their success or failure.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE FOLLOW-UP GAP<br><br>I began to understand some of the reasons for what I like to call the Â“follow-up gapÂ” when I studied the vast Evangelism in Depth program conducted in Latin America some years ago. The follow-up gap, in my definition, is the difference between the number of persons who make recorded first-time decisions for Christ during an evangelistic effort and those among them who eventually become responsible church members.<br><br>Evangelism in Depth was the largest-scale attempt in cooperative evangelism in the history of Latin American Protestantism. It involved, for an entire year, virtually all of the Protestant churches in a given nation. Behind it were some of the best evangelical minds, and the program was originally designed specifically to correct the follow-up gap discovered in crusade evangelism. Despite all the prayer and money and personnel invested in a large number of Latin American nations, however, the follow-up gap persisted after the dust of the excitement had settled.<br><br>Hyper-cooperativism was by no means the only element contributing to the lackluster showing of Evangelism in Depth. It was however, one of the more significant factors. It tended to reduce the message to the least common denominator. In one country, for example, the so-called Wordless Book was banned from the children's program because the committee chairperson disliked the red page, which was designed to teach children about the blood of Christ. The program attempted to keep the focus sufficiently on the local church, but the total effect on church growth was disappointing.<br><br>Significantly, toward the end of the decade when disillusionment with Evangelism in Depth was surfacing, some denominations were severely criticized for refusing to enter the nationwide program when it came to their countries. Their feeling that Evangelism in Depth would tend to retard their already vigorous growth patterns was not considered legitimate. Some were accused of being divisive because they chose not to cooperate. Those denominations for the most part, however, weathered the accusations and kept growing because they believed they could evangelize better by doing their own thing in their own way. The end results was that they were probably right.<br><br>KEY 73 AND HERE'S LIFE<br><br>The attempt to apply the methods of Evangelism in Depth to the United States came in what was called the Key 73 program. In 1973, the most massive coordinated evangelistic effort that America had yet known was conducted. Expectations were high, but the results were disappointing to the majority of cooperating churches, largely due, once again, to hyper-cooperativism. In this case, an inordinate amount of energy was demanded of church leaders across the board to accomplish the immense task of building bonds of interdenominational communication and cooperation. If ecumenism and cooperation had been the stated goals, Key 73 would have been a singular success. The Christianity Today editorial that originally sparked the entire movement used as its title: Â“Somehow, Let's Get Together.Â” Unintentionally, and often quite subtly, cooperation might have been a higher priority in the minds of some than evangelism.<br><br>Evangelism, according to some analysts, entered the picture as only a means toward the real end, which was cooperation. Nevertheless, the overall goal was communicated to the average pastor in the pulpit as being evangelism, and most of them hoped against hope that Key 73 would be the program that would help their churches grow. When it didn't work out that way, they became disillusioned. Memories have faded since 1973, but widespread desire for national cooperation in evangelism had not reached that level since then. The positive recollections of Key 73 that remain in the minds of those who participated related mostly to new friendships and improved Christian relationships, but not to accelerated church growth.<br><br>A few years later, Campus Crusade for Christ launched a large national effort called Â“Here's Life , America .Â” Large numbers of churches in virtually every city in the United Stated joined in the effort to evangelize the nation. Once again, evidence surfaced that as the program was being implemented city by city, cooperation had become a higher functional priority than had evangelism.<br><br>As an example, the Here's life America Southern California CommuniquÃ© reported a meeting of 42 pastors from divergent denominational backgrounds. It reported how they discovered their mutual devotion to Jesus and how together they were uniting in a new way of corporate church life. The article quoted the leaders as saying that Â“this meeting alone was enough to make the entire Here's Life effort worthwhile.Â” Although I would not want to push it too far, nevertheless, in the minds of those who originally designed the effort, the only thing that could possibly have made it worthwhile was not warm fellowship among believers, but saving lost souls! Many leaders had lost sight of this goal.<br><br>The evangelistic results of Here's Life were rather disappointing. Of those who made first-time decisions for Christ, only approximately 3 percent became church members. Even allowing for those persons who may have received E-0 evangelism and those who became privatized Christians, there appears to be a disproportionately large follow-up gap.<br><br>CHALLENGES OF THE CHAPLAINCY<br><br>One of the most institutionalized example of hyper-cooperativism in the United States is the military chaplaincy. I have spoken with many chaplains who are evangelistic in outlook and who would like their chapels to be effective centers for evangelism. Most of them are frustrated. Chapel growth on a military base is difficult to attain. The major reason for this might be a congenital case of hyper-cooperativism.<br><br>Protestant military chapels according to regulations, have to be nondenominational. This is a distinct disadvantage. Under these rules, it is difficult for a chapel to develop a distinct philosophy of ministry geared specifically to the needs of a given target group. To suppose military personnel constitute a homogeneous unit that could be naturally drawn together in one congregation is naÃ¯ve. The total ministry on a given base might be strengthened if the chaplains were encouraged to be more distinctive in their chapels, but this does not seem to be a possibility in the near future. Thus, success for most chaplains will have to be gauged in some terms other than chapel growth, given the present conditions, which to all intents and purposes dictate hyper-cooperativism.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>SCHALLER ON COOPERATION<br><br>One of America 's outstanding church diagnosticians, Lyle E. Schaller, has come to similar conclusions concerning hyper-cooperativism and church growth. He says, Â“While this runs completely counter to the hopes and expectations of the advocates of church unity and intercongregational cooperation, the evidence is increasingly persuasive. Church growth and cooperative ministries are not compatible!Â”<br><br>Schaller's five reasons concerning hyper-cooperativism and lack of church growth bear examination and commentary as a summary to this chapter. To the degree they are understood, hyper-cooperativism can be avoided.<br><br>Â“ A cooperative ministry may blur the distinctive identity of each participating congregation. Â” This was seen in the case of the military chaplaincy. Churches that have a well-understood philosophy of ministry have growth advantages over churches that continually have to ask themselves, Â“Why are we here, anyway? What is our specific contribution to the kingdom of God ?Â” Fuzzy answers to these questions will lessen growth potential.<br><br>Â“ People unite with a specific worshipping congregation, not with a cooperative ministry.Â” There are some exceptions to this, as Schaller admits, but it is generally true. This is a chief reason that it is not conducive to eventual church membership if the person's decision for Christ is made in a neutral public place such as a stadium, particularly in the midst of a week or two of high-energy meetings. The new Christian may attend several crusade rallies that focus on their spotlights and crowds and 300-voice choirs and celebrities. It is a tough act for any local church to follow, and when reality sets in, disappointment often sets in.<br><br>Â“ People with a strong interest in evangelism and church growth rarely are interested in interchurch cooperation and vice versa.Â” The exception to this is the parachurch evangelistic associations, which have strong interests in evangelism and by their very natures depend on interchurch cooperation for exercising their ministries. That is certainly true of many dynamic, growing local churches. Participating in cooperative evangelism is frequently determined by a different kind of motivation. These churches may not think they need the citywide effort for church growth and vitality, but at the same time they are aware of the effort's high visibility in the community and thereby understand that if they choose not to participate, their decisions would likely be interpreted as unsupportive of Christian unity. This is not the public image they desire, so they frequently go along with the movement, although somewhat reluctantly.<br><br>Â“ Many cooperative ministries come into existence as the result of pressures of dwindling resources.Â” Church mergers, in particular, are often a clear sign of approaching decline, if not death. On the other hand, church splits, whether unintentional or planned, are often signs of vitality and growth. Cell division, not cell fusion, produces healthy, growing bodies.<br><br>Â“ Interchurch cooperation does use the time and energy of ministers and laity in creating and maintaining a new institution, and thus that time is not available for membership outreach. Â” The broader the cooperation, the more complex the social relationships necessary to hold it together. Add to this the seemingly incompatible doctrines and policies, and the result is an association that is extremely demanding of available energy.<br>In a more recent work, Lyle Schaller applies these principles directly to the reasons certain churches grow and others do not. He says, Â“It is only a minor exaggeration to suggest that [the compulsion for promoting interchurch cooperation] is one of the most influential differences between large and numerically growing congregations and most small churches. The former assume that competition is the norm. The latter believe that cooperation should be the norm. That difference in perspective is one more reason why large congregations are large and small churches are small!Â”<br><br>IS THERE ANY HOPE?<br><br>Because both evangelism that helps churches grow and interchurch cooperation are commendable activities, it seems reasonable to assume that there must some way to join the two. Putting past disappointments to one side, it does appear now that some models for programs of cooperative evangelism, that in fact do result in measurable church growth, are emerging on the horizon.<br><br>Edgardo Silvoso, an Argentine evangelist, is one of the foremost leaders in developing strategies for evangelizing cities that combine the two. Silvoso's pilot project, called the Â“Rosario Plan,Â” was designed and executed in Rosario , Argentina , in 1975 and 1976. More than half of the Protestant churches in the city joined the movement, so it was a good example of interchurch cooperation. The difference was that as early as 15 months before the public evangelistic eventÂ—which featured Silovoso's brother-in-law, Luis PalauÂ—teams of church growth experts, including Vergil Gerber, Juan Carlos Miranda, Edward Murphy and Silvoso, worked with the cooperating churches. They helped each church develop plans and goals for growth in its own congregation, as well as in new churches they would plant.<br><br>Approximately 40 churches decided to cooperate. By the time Palau arrives, 45 new churches had been established. A strong growth process had been initiated, and new converts were already being made at rates not seen in Rosario for years. The evangelistic event then was introduced into the growth process at the most appropriate time. The evangelist was coming, not to begin the harvest, but rather to accelerate a harvest already begun. The barns were by then ready for the increased harvest, so to speak.<br><br>In the traditional models of citywide cooperative evangelism, between 3 percent and 16 percent of those who make first-time decisions for Christ become responsible members of the local churches. In Rosario , however, of the decisions registered during Palau 's meetings, an amazing 57 percent were incorporated as members of churches. The follow-up gap had been considerably reduced.<br><br>THE PROCESS AND THE EVENT<br><br>As I see it, the secret of the success of the Rosario Plan, compared to the more traditional models of communitywide efforts in other cities, is skillfully coordinating the evangelistic event by using a growth process in the cooperating churches. When churches cooperating with citywide crusades are not in a healthy growth pattern themselves, the big meetings or the media blitz will not usually stimulate real growth. When the church is already growing, however, and when it is in the habit of folding in new converts before the start of the large, public evangelistic event, the event can then help the churches to grow.<br>The following are two examples:<br><br>In 1969 when Billy Graham conducted his crusades in Anaheim , California , many Orange County churches reported a pleasant, stimulating experience, but little resultant growth. On the other hand, The Crystal Cathedral, which already had been growing at a 10-year rate of more than 500 percent, received hundreds of new members. The church had been tuned up for the crusade by previous growth momentum. It knew well how to take care of new converts. It was ready for the harvest.<br><br>The national follow-up rate for Here's Life America was 3 percent. Lake Avenue Congregational Church in Pasadena , California , however, which had previously developed a sophisticated pattern of folding new converts by Pastor Kent Tucker, folded 30 of 74 decisions, a rate of 42 percent. The evangelistic event helped both The Crystal Cathedral and Lake Avenue because it fit properly into an already established growth pattern.<br>My view is that a long-range component of church growth planning and consultation should be provided as part and parcel of a great high-visibility evangelistic event sponsored by some interdenominational association. This should start as much as one or two years before the event. The timing of the event itself needs to remain flexible until all cooperating churches (or a predetermined percentage of them) have corrected the problems causing their nongrowth or slow growth and are reasonably sure that by the time of the event they will be growing and absorbing new converts. When the cooperating churches are growing at an estimable rate, bring on the evangelist or the media blitz or whatever method may be appropriate. The follow-up gap will narrow dramatically because the barns will be ready for the harvest.<br><br>This kind of thing can be done well through interchurch cooperation. Because the primary growth goals are not focused on the stadium, but on the local church, the local churches remain central to the program. Many local churches together can combine their resources to pay for areawide media, the professional evangelist and the church growth consultation services, which most churches by themselves might not be able to afford.<br><br>THAT NONE SHOULD PERISH<br><br>Edgardo Silovoso contracted a life-threatening disease soon after the Rosario Plan had ended and he was forced to curtail his ministry for the better part of a decade. The Lord healed him miraculously, though, and he is once again strategizing citywide evangelism, this time using the added dimensions of power healing, prayer and spiritual warfare. Silvoso's book That None Should Perish (Regal Books) is in my opinion the state-of-the-art exposition of how to combine high levels of evangelism and Christian unity in reaching a city for Christ.<br><br>If I were to write a prescription for a cure to hyper-cooperativism, I would require reading That None Should Perish , but in tandem with another of the finest recent books I have seen, Primary Purpose (Creation House) by Pastor Ted Haggard of New Life Church in Colorado Springs . Silvoso is the master strategist, and Haggard is the practical, down-to-earth local church pastor, who, out on the front lines of his own city has seen pastors come together across theological lines for the purpose of evangelizing his city. Haggard's advocacy of Christian unity is not unity as an end in itself, but unity aimed at the goal, which he uses as the subtitle of his book: Making It Hard for People to Go to Hell from Your City!<br><br>Notes<br><br>This research was reported in Win C.
