              <p>I think it is better to start a new thread on this than to dilute the other thread. Please continue discussion here.</p>
              <p>Bible critics like to say that the Bible was written by man to control the masses i.e. it is invented fiction, no real truth to it at all. But what Christians are saying is that while the Bible is written by men it is not a mere invention of men. It is a truthful record of God's dealings with man.</p>

              <p>Truly, the bible was the word of man. Its is so heavily misintrepreted. Alot of things inside the bibke has been removed, eg, jesus is the begotten son of god. Begotten is sexual intercourse. So we actually give animal attributes to god, a devine power. So it was removed. The bible forbids eating the flesh of swine. Yet many christians eat them. It was joseph, matthew and the others who compiled this crap! Bible is FLAWED! </p>
              <p>Who is god by the way? Jesus? Father? Son? Holy ghost? Who?</p>
              <p>Just because he was born without a father, we call him god? What about adam, who had no parents? </p>

              <p>Truly, the bible was the word of man. Its is so heavily misintrepreted. Alot of things inside the bibke has been removed, eg, jesus is the begotten son of god. Begotten is sexual intercourse. So we actually give animal attributes to god, a devine power. So it was removed. The bible forbids eating the flesh of swine. Yet many christians eat them. It was joseph, matthew and the others who compiled this crap! Bible is FLAWED! </p>
              <p>Who is god by the way? Jesus? Father? Son? Holy ghost? Who?</p>
              <p>Just because he was born without a father, we call him god? What about adam, who had no parents? </p>

              <p>1. The Bible is the Word of God, not of man. God used man to write. This is called the doctrine of the Inspiration of Scriptures. See <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/Inspiration.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/Inspiration.html</a></p>
              <p>2. That the Bible is heavily misinterpreted is no fault of the Bible and does not count as an argument against the Bible. The solution is to correctly interpret it, not reject it!</p>
              <p>3. You said a lot of things have been removed from the Bible. Please give a lot of examples. You gave just one which hardly qualifies as removal of anything. It's a question of interpretation, not removal! BTW, do you just think only of sex when you see the word "begotten"?. See <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/only-begotten-son.html">http://www.gotquestions.org/only-begotten-son.html</a></p>
              <p>4. Who told you that Christians are forbidden by God to eat pork? While the Bible does forbade the eating of pork it was specifically FOR the Jews and not for the Christians.</p>
              <p>5. Who told you that the Bible was compiled by Joseph, Matthew and others? Name your sources.</p>
              <p>6. There is ONE God who exists in THREE Persons. The Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God. This is the doctrine of the Trinity, not invented by man, but recognised as being revealed in the Bible. See <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/Trinity-Bible.html">http://www.gotquestions.org/Trinity-Bible.html</a></p>
              <p>7. Who told you that Jesus was deified because He had no biological father? No where does the Bible teach such a thing. Jesus is God because that's who He is, not because He has no biological father. Jesus did not become God, He is God and has always been.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: You are seriously MISINFORMED about Christianity. Please find out what Christianity REALLY teaches before you criticise it.</p>

              <p>1. No where in the bible did god mention, " Worship me"</p>
              <p>2.Trinity- Concept of trinity is clearly absurd. The father, son and the holy ghost. When you think of father, you will see a fatherly figure with beard overseeing earth, the son, you'll see a handsome yound man say Jesus, the holy ghost, a devine force. These are 3 distinct images. They are NON-SUPERIMPOSIBLE!! Just admit it, you are forced to believe they exist as three forms. It is a nonsensical approach. 3-in-1 coffee perhaps??</p>
              <p>3. Jesus never return. Many christians believe that jesus return was imminent</p>
              <p>4. In the Bible, Jesus was hungry and wanted to eat figs, a type of fruit. Yet he cant because it was not in season. He cursed the tree. What kind of god gets hungry and curses at a tree. Verily his action was immature. Mark 11:12-14. </p>
              <p>5. David and Jesus had variable number of generations- Matthew(1:1-16) and Luke(3:23-38) In matthew, there are 27 generations, Luke 41. So the bible is not inerrant afterall.</p>
              <p>6. Jesus was tempted by the devil, God can be tempted?? Very undevine indeed. Has no control over the devil</p>
              <p>7. Even you cannot deny the fact that jesus was the begotten son of god! </p>

              <p>8. Why was Jesus cruxified or killed?</p>
              <p>To absolve your sins? Who in the right frame of mind would ever want to kill themselves so that you, humans, and your sins be forgiven.? How can god ever die? He is meant to be immortal. Could he have not done anything to revive himself? Worse part, he was killed by Jews! So jesus was so docile enough to go through the cruxifixion? </p>
              <p>You say that Jsus is god, yet some say he is the son of god! Then who's god??</p>
              <p>Why do christians have to fill up their minds with vague, illogical, mind-twisting set of stories? Cant there be a religion that is logical and straight to the point. Even you dont understand why god exist in three forms. Its more of like pokemon evolution!</p>

              <p>I think it is better to start a new thread on this than to
              dilute the other thread. Please continue discussion here.</p>
              <p>Bible critics like to say that the Bible was written by man to
              control the masses i.e. it is invented fiction, no real truth to it
              at all. But what Christians are saying is that while the Bible is
              written by men it is not a mere invention of men. It is a truthful
              record of God's dealings with man.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you have read the Bible carefully you would realise that it is written by men who tries to explain men dealing with God, not the other way around. So it is open to the interpretation of the reader and much to the chargrin of the "experts".</p>
              <p>Whereas the ;Qur'an, is said to be direct from God, Full stop, do not question. Everything is written there and its final. Islam has its roots in Judaism and Christianity, very easy to dictatorially claim that those are corrupted and Islam absolutely correct, and must not be challenged. By not being challenged like Christianity, we will never know, do we?</p>
