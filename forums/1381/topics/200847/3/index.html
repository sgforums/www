I for one believe that everything is possible if you believe. This is stated in the bible Mark 9:23.<br><br>What exactly is a life of extravagance? How do you define that? So if my family owns 3 european cars, a few landed properties, a couple of condos, have golfing memberships and take holidays, all gained through wise investment and hard work, is that extravagance?<br><br>Instead of whinging get a life go and work hard and pursue your dreams and you may just get rich in the process.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with being rich, it is only when you love being rich more than you love Yeshua that there is a problem. Like Vince was trying to say which you constantly miss... it is a condition of the HEART. What does your heart desire?<br><br>When Yeshua said keep the commandments, you have to read it in the context of the culture, which was distinctly jewish.. the rich young man would have understood that keeping the commandments meant keeping ALL the commandments. Did Yeshua preach about all rich people? I don not think so, just that he used the example of that rich young ruler loving money more than he loved eternal life.</div>

Wat does "sowing" into the Kingdom of God mean to u?</div></blockquote>Sorry to disappoint you, but your reply does not rest on firm biblical foundation.<br><br>1. While Abraham was wealthy and powerful, it was not because he is "Father of all nations". Maybe you'd like to rephrase that?<br><br>2. Moses was a prince, yes, but after he struck the Egyptian dead to rescue the Hebrew slave .. he became a fugitive in the desert for 40? years. Wealth .. what wealth?! You think he had money hidden in anonymous Swiss accounts? Furthermore I disagree with your belief that he needed wealth for the exodus. You think what .. book shuttle bus to ferry the people? Order one lorry of 100-Plus or Gatorade for the walkathon?<br><br>3. Regarding David and Solomon, I have these verses from NIV Deu 17 for you:<br><br><blockquote><br>The King<br><br>14 When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, "Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us," 15 be sure to appoint over you the king the LORD your God chooses. He must be from among your own brothers. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not a brother Israelite. 16 The king, moreover, <strong>must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself </strong>or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the LORD has told you, "You are not to go back that way again." 17 <strong>He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray</strong>.<strong> He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.</strong> </blockquote>David and Solomon did precisely that .. that's why the Davidic kingdom went into decline. Thus your example just show that, if anything, wealth stumbles believers. Furthermore, these verses suggest that God was not totally responsible for the 'wealth' of the kings, they could accumulate themselves and as shown, they had sinned in doing so.<br><br>4. Does it bring God any Glory to see his children in the pits? Yes it does - literally. Remember Daniel and his friends? They were thrown into the pit - but with God's miraculous protection, they were unharmed and in the end glorified the God of Abraham to the pagans.<br><br>5. Jehovah Jireh means "God will provide". I believe it was first used during the sacrifice of Isaac. This, together with the example of Daniel, illustrated the importance of trust and faith, not God will make you wealthy. Here are two examples showing proper usage of Jehovah Jireh.<br><br>5.1. In campus crusade, to go for a mission trip, they have to raise money. To some members, they have to beg for money. It is a humbling experience. But have faith in God and trust that you are doing His work.<br><br>5.2. Mother Theresa ran an orphanage? in Calcutta last time. They are definitely not as "resourceful" as CHCSA, but have faith in God and live out His Word.<br><br>And please do not just quote examples of "rich" biblical figures. And please do not just use OT examples. You should explain why many of the NT figures were poor, like our dear Apostle Paul. By his own admission, he was poor.</div>

You mean that you have never told a white lie? if you have you have just violated one of the commandments. you have never thought about a woman lustfully? if you have you have just committed adultery.</blockquote>Really ?

I for one believe that everything is possible if you believe. </blockquote>I have nothing against rich people. Did I ever claim I hate rich people  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> WHy suddenly give me tis label ? I was only pointing out tat Jesus himself like people to donate their riches and claim it is a way for eternal life.<br><br><blockquote>When Yeshua said keep the commandments, you have to read it in the context of the culture, which was distinctly jewish.. the rich young man would have understood that keeping the commandments meant keeping ALL the commandments. Did Yeshua preach about all rich people? I don not think so, just that he used the example of that rich young ruler loving money more than he loved eternal life. </blockquote>However the list jesus mentioned only mark a few of the commandments. Overall the conversation just list the above. Now u suddenly wanna put words into jesus mouth and say he meant more<br><br><blockquote>There were plenty mighty men of God who were Wealthy</blockquote>Then please explain wat does he means<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

Does he want to see his children in the pits ? Do being humble means he had to donate all the possession ?<br><br><blockquote>When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.<br>'Rich Men' only refers to those who responded the way the young men in the biblical passage did. </blockquote>Then again u r putting words into the pasage. In it is explicitly mention tat guy is rich. And tat is it. Then u defy all the language in it and claim it does not mans "rich" guy but guy tat respond in the same way the bible. Jesus also claim tat the rich people is hard to go to heaven. Then again u defy watthe bible had said and add in your own interpretation. Is the word "rich" so difficult to understand<br><br></div>

You mentioned that most people can keep the commandments that Yeshua spoke about, I am just alluding to the fact that all of us at one time or another have told a white lie... this is giving false testimony. Males being males would tend to ogle a good looking female so this in Yeshua's definition would be adultery. Nothing to do with the rich guy.<br><br>But I do agree with what Vince said about this rich man's response, he is arrogant in saying that he can keep all the commandments. Only one person has ever kept all the commandments, that is Yeshua. You also forget that Yeshua is also God, so He would know the mans heart.</div>

Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount."<br><br>9Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. 10For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost."<br><br>Zacchaeus too was a rich man, and had lots of wealth, but when he found Yeshua, he repented and showed where he truly put his trust and faith in.
