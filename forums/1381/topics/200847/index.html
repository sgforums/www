Interesting notion here, beside the manditory audits (on the financial accounts of the church) that is required by the govenment, I do not know of any other statutory requirments on the church.<br><br>one question I would like to ask is, what is wrong with pastor driving exotic cars? or living in landed properity?<br>cause these pastors may also have other source of income (example: book sales, external talks ...etc) that is enough to support their lifestyle and if their income permits it, why not?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>actually the word used was its "more difficult" not "similar", the context for asking the rick guy to sell away all he had and give all to the poor, is to expose to him one thing, his love for his money, its not his money that is the problem, its being slaved to it that is the problem. </blockquote>IMO, from tis story there r possibly 2 conclusions<br><br>1) The rich man have to donate his money before he can serve jesus in order to be able to go to heaven. The rich people have problems going to heaven<br><br>2) Jesus purposely misled the rich guy into thinking tat he have to donate all his money when in actual fact he don't need to in order to go to heaven<br><br>What is the conclusion u r trying to derive here ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, my view is not unique. Catholic also find tat phrase to tell people tat pastor/priest have to embrace a life of poverty<br><br><a href="http://www.catholicdoors.com/faq/qu20.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicdoors.com/faq/qu20.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Yes, there are two Bible passages that refer to embracing a life of poverty. The first is found in the Gospel of Luke where Jesus teaches that those who wish to follow Him should dispose of their personal property. The second is found in the Acts of the Apostles where it is revealed that the early Christians did not claim private ownership of any possessions, but rather, shared everything in common.<br><br>"A certain ruler asked him, 'Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?' Jesus said to him, 'Why doyou call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: 'You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honor your father and mother.' He replied, 'I have kept all these since my youth.' When Jesus heard this, he said to him, 'There is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me. Jesus looked at him and said, 'How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!'" [Lk. 18:18-23]<br><br>"Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common. With great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold. They laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need." [Acts 4:32-5]</span></div>
