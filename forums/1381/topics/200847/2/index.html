A normal person probably do not murder, steal, commit adultery, give false testimonial, honor their parents and love their neighbour. He didn't mention anything about god in tis statement. The things he quote is achievable. furthermore tis guy is proabbly a jew and normal religion abidding jew followed these commandments. When he reply he did all these, then tat is it. It is not about being perfect. Jesus never ask tat guy to be perfect. Basically he just ask him not to be a criminal tat do like their parents and neighbours.
