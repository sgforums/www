            <div class='col-md body'>I am going to say this,<br><br>as SIS says, the ten commandments are definitely able to be kept. And many Jews have kept them. If the ten commandments could not have been kept, then Yahweh would be very cruel to ask us to keep them.<br><br>But SIS, what you have also not understood is that Yeshua expanded the ten commandments, ie... the example of adultery, Yeshua, expanded it to include the idea of adultery eg Matthew 5:27-28 Â“You have heard that it was said to those of old,[c] Â‘You shall not commit adultery.Â’ 28 But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.<br><br>Still the young rulers attitude when asked about whether he had kept the commandments perfectly may have been arrogant, know that Yeshua knew the man's heart already. What are the commandments? you yourself stated them... what is the first commandment?<br><br>YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER gods BEFORE ME.<br><br>What did the rich young ruler put before Yahweh? His wealth, in this context, his money had become his god and this already meant that he had broken the commandments. That is why Yeshua tested him, ie to ask him to give his money to the poor. If you want to take these verses as they are in the bible, don't add salt on your part also by saying what about the rich young rulers family etc... for all we know, he did not have any family.<br><br>The other point to make here is that the rich young ruler already knew the answer to how to inherit eternal life, but because he knew he had a problem, that is why he asked... to see if he can get out of it.... hence we see he went away sad because he could not give up his love of his wealth and as such, could have missed out on inheriting eternal life....</div>

But i would insist that whatever _____'s view is still a product of men's understanding of God's Words and should not be in any ways, treated as perfectly equal or above God's viewpoint.<br><br>Change and action - of course they are important and they should be the fruits of repentence. But such change and action must be important to God, and not be created for self importance in order to serve God.<br><br>Doing things for God and doing things in obedience to God's commandments and Christ's teachings are totally different. The first glorify the self, the second, glory God.  The first distance oneself from God, the second creates opportunities for intimacy with our God and Saviour.<br><br>And sometimes, Faith is just about "believing" for our God, is powerful and Love is enough to do the rest.<br><br></div></blockquote>God's revelation has ended, but human understanding has not. We have but a human intellect; how is it possible to perfectly know the mysteries of God?<br><br>How does doing things for God contradict obedience? I think it really depends on the mindset of the individual. Needless to say that there are those who bask in human admiration, because they serve God in various ministries. This is something we can learn; we must be humble in serving Him. Aim for the reward in heaven, not on earth.<br><br>Faith is the most important, but we must not forget to carry our crosses. Even Christ himself needed to do it, therefore we are not immune. Let our Faith aid us in our daily crosses.</div>
