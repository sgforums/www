One reason could be they love that car. It may not be they are trying to prove something.<br><br>Actually are pastors very busy in church? I don't think pastors work 8-5 every weekday on top of weekends. Furthermore it is not uncommon for pastors to travel overseas and I'm sure the church allows it (as long as it is for Christ).</div></blockquote>It is about affordability. There are many thing we love to have, but should we pay a high price for it? It may not prove anything but sure show your priority.  In singapore where car prices are the highest in the world, owning a car remains a necessity not everybody can afford, owning a BM or Merc is certainly a luxury.<br><br>I guess how busy pastors are in church depends not only on the church but also themselves. I know pastors who works only 8-5, if they had to attend a wake service in the night they believe they are entitled to come in 2 hours later the next morning. Churches do not tell the pastors what they can do what cannot do. Pastors go overseas with the whole family for holiday once every year nobody will question cause most families do that in Singapore. Pastors must decide for themselves what is reasonable and how it might affect the others.<br><br>Being a pastor is like being a celebrity, you come under the lime light, everything you do affect the people who look upon you as example.  what is their priority?</div>

You mentioned that most people can keep the commandments that Yeshua spoke about, I am just alluding to the fact that all of us at one time or another have told a white lie... this is giving false testimony. Males being males would tend to ogle a good looking female so this in Yeshua's definition would be adultery. Nothing to do with the rich guy. </blockquote>First u need to realise the conversation between jesus and the guy. The man ask Jesus wat should he do to obtain salvation and jesus said a list of things out. HE say tat he had fulfilled all these. Now, u need to realise the 10 commandments is more simpler for jewish than the exaggerated ones stated by christians after jesus death. The 10 commandments is definitely followable and they don't treat ogling at girls as committing adultery. Christians exaggerate it simply because they wanna force people to have faith in god. Jewish 10 comandment is followable and is the basic rule to follow. <strong>Otherwise u think god condemn every single jewish, including moses to eternal hell ?</strong> Then wat a cruel god he is by putting all jewish. god chosen people, to hell. Jewish treat the 10 commandment by reading it literally, unlike christian who like to add in things they like to make jewish sound silyl and unobtainable. Note tat jesus is jewish himself<br><br><a href="http://www.ou.org/chagim/shavuot/aseret.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ou.org/chagim/shavuot/aseret.htm</a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>"Honor your father and your mother;" and it is also written "a person should revere his mother and father." What is reverence and what is honor? "Reverence" includes such behaviors to be avoided as not to stand in their place or sit in their place, not to contradict them and not even to lend your support to what they have to say.  "Honor" includes such actions as to provide food and drink, indirectly and even directly, to provide clothing and even, if necessary, to dress them, to cover them, to bring them in and take them out, etc., etc., in accordance with their needs.<br><br>"They asked Rav Ulla, 'To what extent is a child obligated to honor his or her parents?' He answered, 'go and see how a certain non-Jewish resident of Ashkelon behaved, and his name was Dama, son of Nesina. Once the Rabbis wished to purchase an object from them for ritual purposes, for the sum of six hundred thousand "shekalim," let's say, dollars, but the key to the safe was under the head of his sleeping father, and Dama would not disturb his father!' "<br><br>"They asked Rabbi Eliezer, 'To what extent is a child obligated to honor his or her parents?' He said to them, 'to the extent that even if the parent would throw the child's wallet into the ocean for no reason, the child should not embarrass the parent!' "<br><br>This is one of the three cardinal sins in Judaism, for which an individual is obligated to give up his life. This means that if Person A approaches Person B and says to him, "I will kill you if you do not kill person C," Person B should allow himself to be killed, rather than murder Person C.<br><br>This is the third of the three cardinal sins in Judaism, such that if Person A approaches Person B and says to him, "I will kill you if you do not commit adultery with the wife of Person C," Person B must allow himself to be killed rather than commit adultery.<br><br>This form of stealing is the stealing of souls; that is, kidnapping, for which the penalty is "bet-din," Jewish Court-administered death. Stealing of money, for which the penalty is financial, is referenced elsewhere in the Torah.<br><br>Jewish Tradition holds that one is not even allowed to speak favorably about other individuals, because that too can relatively easily lead one to speak ill of that person. For example, if one says, "What a nice house (car, job, wife, etc.) so-and-so has," it is easy to see how that can lead to feelings of jealousy and "lashon hara," unfavorable speech, or worse. </span></div>

What is reverence and what is honor? "Reverence" includes such behaviors to be avoided as not to stand in their place or sit in their place, not to contradict them and not even to lend your support to what they have to say.  "Honor" includes such actions as to provide food and drink, indirectly and even directly, to provide clothing and even, if necessary, to dress them, to cover them, to bring them in and take them out, etc., etc., in accordance with their needs.<br><br>"They asked Rav Ulla, 'To what extent is a child obligated to honor his or her parents?' He answered, 'go and see how a certain non-Jewish resident of Ashkelon behaved, and his name was Dama, son of Nesina. Once the Rabbis wished to purchase an object from them for ritual purposes, for the sum of six hundred thousand "shekalim," let's say, dollars, but the key to the safe was under the head of his sleeping father, and Dama would not disturb his father!' "<br><br>"They asked Rabbi Eliezer, 'To what extent is a child obligated to honor his or her parents?'

Stealing of money, for which the penalty is financial, is referenced elsewhere in the Torah.<br><br>Jewish Tradition holds that one is not even allowed to speak favorably about other individuals, because that too can relatively easily lead one to speak ill of that person. For example, if one says, "What a nice house (car, job, wife, etc.) so-and-so has," it is easy to see how that can lead to feelings of jealousy and "lashon hara," unfavorable speech, or worse. </span>[/b]</blockquote>actually "first", you need to realise that you dont know who God is.<br>And going by the statements you made, i dont think you even understand what the Bible is all about.<br><br>When you "ogle" at girls - what goes through your mind ?

Of course nothing wrong if you put it that way.  But why bring christians into the picture ?
