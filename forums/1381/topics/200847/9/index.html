He put money before Yahweh.<br><br>You yourself cannot take the literal translation, and you yourself brought in the ideas about the persons family that Yahweh wanted the person's family to suffer because he had to donate all the money to the poor. I think you seem to conveniently forget this.... and this is not the case, see mark 10:29-30.<br><br>first, read the passage again carefully, when Yeshua asked the rich young man to give away his riches, he went away sad, what does this say? He could not let go of his wealth. Yeshua pharased His words exactly. The meaning is very clear. More than anyone of us Yeshua can tell the difference between being rich and being a slave to money.<br><br>Second, already said, the first commandment is thou shall have NO OTHER gods before me... but the rich young man did, his wealth was his god, his trust was in his wealth to gain eternal life. Yeshua went on to elaborate on this. In Mark 10:21 Yeshua said, "... ONE THING YOU LACK... " why would Yeshua say this unless He knew that there was a point of fault in this rich young man?<br><br>Third, read the whole of Mark 10 in context... what exactly did Yeshua say? in Mark 10:23 Yeshua said " How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!" and He elaborated on this in verse 24 Yeshua said "Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God. When Yeshua spoke about it being easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Yahweh, He is using a hyperbole to show just how hard it will be for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of Yahweh. But this does not mean that there is no hope for the rich young ruler for Yeshua says this in verse 27"WIth men it is impossible, but not with Yahweh; for with Yahweh all things are possible."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Fourth, again you have misread this whole exchange, </span>it is clear what Yeshua is emphasising... and the point is this that it is difficult for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of Yahweh. See Mark 10:24.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Fifth, you have missed the mark altogether, the way to inherit eternal life is not by giving money to the poor, but by trusting in Yeshua for your salvation. </span>We are not talking about religion here, but the young man's personal relationship with Yahweh. Like many have said before, performing good deeds does not earn you your salvation. It is trust and faith in Yeshua Hamashiach that will save! Performing good deeds is a by product of this. The point of this whole story is not about giving to the poor, but about WHAT OR WHO YOU PUT YOUR TRUST IN. </div></blockquote>It's in his nature to take things out of context and to intepret the replies of others to what best suits his thinking rather than to see what people are truly trying to say.</div>

You may think it's double standard, but really, I can't be bothered.<br><br>I know of somebody who has been very much more aggressive in "educating" Christians on their own beliefs.
