            <div class='col-md body'>Lets start with the scriptures, I will continue with the comments later<br><br>John 3:1-18<br>1Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. 2He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."<br><br>3In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.[a]"<br><br>4"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"<br><br>5Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 6Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit[b] gives birth to spirit. 7You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You[c] must be born again.' 8The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."<br><br>9"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.<br><br>10"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things? 11I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 13No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heavenÂ—the Son of Man.[d] 14Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.[e]<br><br>16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,[f] that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>The event described here between Jesus and Nicodemus (a short background on him, he is a Pharisees, not just any Pharisees, he is a member of the Jewish ruling council; ie. a high ranking Pharisees)<br>Here, Jesus was telling Nicodemus, that one need to be born again to enter into the Kingdom of God. Nicodemus at the first moment was confused, hence he asked the Lord, "how to be born again?"<br>Here is Jesus' answer to Nicodemus;<br>No one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.<br>at this, Nicodemus obviously lost, asked how can this be? as in what is it to be born of water and the Spirit?<br>At this, Jesus reminded him about the bronze snake that Moses lifted up in the desert.<br>(background to this event: pls read Numbers 21:4-9 - 8 The LORD said to Moses, "Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live." 9 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived.<br><br>Key note to this is that whoever bitten by the snake (consequence of their sin), will to look at the bronze serpent (not fight the snake, not suck out the vernom..etc) will live. )<br><br>contrast this to our Lord Jesus, He was hanged up on the cross (pole) and whoever will to put their faith in Him (not on works or deeds), will not be condemn (consequence of Sin) but have eternal life (live).<br><br>Hence: to be born again is to change our mindset<br>From<br>trying to work it out with God through our works or deeds<br>To<br>believing/depending in the finished works of Christ on the cross.<br></div>

Meaning, acknowledging the perfect scarcifce of Christ on the cross as payment for his/her sins, hence receiving salvation from God by His grace, though Christ Jesus our Lord.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
