One of the purpose of the forum is to help young seekers or even young Christian come to terms with Biblical lessons. When such threads get hijacked and name calling or mud slinging happens, there is a sense of responsibility to put things right. The question really is NOT the DEBATES or the CHATS. I think we'd said many times, that this is not a problem. The problem is when folks come in to provoke with rude words and ill-intentions.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">There r many threads tat appears to be totally unmoderated and I think it is a good development.

Look at AA when one time not too long ago, there was a big blow up. Some threads CANNOT BE UNMODERATED. I am sure you will agree that religion is a sensitive issue, even if one calls himself and atheist (not referring to you) may not like to be challenged. That's why I totally disagree with Christians going to any such forums to whack.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">There r always trolls and opposers and assholes in forum, even in life.

Anyone else can take up the next step. laoda is already doing something about it, maybe dave may be next.... all the best to them.
