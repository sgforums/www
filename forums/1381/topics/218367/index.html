            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ben1xy:</div><div class="quote_body">Oh icey, what's the Jewish concept of heaven ah?</div></blockquote>They call it the world to come. WTC.<br><br>The Jewish is .. *checking references* .. olam haba.<br><br>Some points to note (from <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm</a>):<br><br><blockquote>The Talmud states that all Israel has a share in the Olam Ha-Ba. However, not all "shares" are equal. A particularly righteous person will have a greater share in the Olam Ha-Ba than the average person. In addition, a person can lose his share through wicked actions. There are many statements in the Talmud that a particular mitzvah will guarantee a person a place in the Olam Ha-Ba, or that a particular sin will lose a person's share in the Olam Ha-Ba, but these are generally regarded as hyperbole, excessive expressions of approval or disapproval.<br><br>Some people look at these teachings and deduce that Jews try to "earn our way into Heaven" by performing the mitzvot. This is a gross mischaracterization of our religion. <strong>It is important to remember that unlike some religions, Judaism is not focused on the question of how to get into heaven. Judaism is focused on life and how to live it.</strong> Non-Jews frequently ask me, "do you really think you're going to go to Hell if you don't do such-and-such?" It always catches me a bit off balance, because the question of where I am going after death simply doesn't enter into the equation when I think about the mitzvot. We perform the mitzvot because it is our privilege and our sacred obligation to do so. We perform them out of a sense of love and duty, not out of a desire to get something in return. In fact, one of the first bits of ethical advice in Pirkei Avot (a book of the Mishnah) is: "Be not like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a reward; instead, be like servants who serve their master not for the sake of receiving a reward, and let the awe of Heaven [meaning G-d, not the afterlife] be upon you."<br><br>Nevertheless, we definitely believe that your place in the Olam Ha-Ba is determined by a merit system based on your actions, not by who you are or what religion you profess. In addition, <strong>we definitely believe that humanity is capable of being considered righteous in G-d's eyes</strong>, or at least good enough to merit paradise after a suitable period of purification.<br><br>Do non-Jews have a place in Olam Ha-Ba? Although there are a few statements to the contrary in the Talmud, <strong>the predominant view of Judaism is that the righteous of all nations have a share in the Olam Ha-Ba</strong>. Statements to the contrary were not based on the notion that membership in Judaism was required to get into Olam Ha-Ba, but were grounded in the observation that non-Jews were not righteous people. If you consider the behavior of the surrounding peoples at the time that the Talmud was written, you can understand the rabbis' attitudes. By the time of Rambam, the belief was firmly entrenched that the righteous of all nations have a share in the Olam Ha-Ba. </blockquote>PS: mitzvot = commandments<br></div>

You can say the PAP is the way, the truth and the life. No one gets access to the budget, the national coffer, the legal system etc. except through them. Ahem ..<br><br>OT a little .. after I read about gnosticism I thought it is quite similar to the theology in the Gospel of John. Always talking about spiritual stuffs. Hmm ..</div>
