It may be hard for you to understand and appreciate because you are "contaminated" by Christian theology.<br><br>Since you are Catholic, I suggest you read works by your Catholic forefathers. Some of them were well versed in Jewish exegesis of Scripture and I have no doubt some Jewish ideas crept into Catholic understanding. Remember our Genesis discussion on the missing "it was very good"? You were taught ideas which originated from the Jews.<br><br>For starters, you can read works by Nicolas of Lyra. From wikipedia:<br><br><blockquote>Nicholas Of Lyra (c. 1270Â–October 1349), or Nicolaus Lyranus, a Franciscan teacher, was among the most influential practitioners of Biblical exegesis in the Middle Ages. He was a doctor at the Sorbonne by 1309 and ten years later was appointed the head of all Franciscans in France. <strong>His major work, Postillae perpetuae in universam S. Scripturam, was the first printed commentary on the Bible.</strong> Printed in Rome in 1471, it was later available in Venice, Basel, and elsewhere. In it, each page of Biblical text was printed in the upper center of the page and embedded in a surrounding commentary (illustration, right).<br><br><strong>Nicolas of Lyra's approach to explicating Scripture was firmly based on the literal sense, which for him is the foundation of all mystical or allegorical or anagogical expositions. </strong>He deplored the tortured and elaborated readings being given to Scripture in his time. The textual basis was so important that he urged that errors be corrected with reference to Hebrew texts, an early glimmer of techniques of textual criticism, though Nicholas urged as a good Catholic that the traditions of the Church were of equal weight to Scripture:<br><br>"I protest that I do not intend to assert or determine anything that has not been manifestly determined by Sacred Scripture or by the authority of the Church... Wherefore I submit all I have said or shall say to the correction of Holy Mother Church and of all learned men..." (Second Prologue to Postillae).<br><strong>Nicholas utilized all sources available to him, fully mastered Hebrew and drew copiously from the Talmudic commentaries, the Pugio Fidei of Raymond Martini and of course the commentaries of St. Thomas Aquinas.</strong> His lucid and concise exposition, his soundly-based observations made Postillae the most-consulted manual of exegesis until the 16th century. <strong>Martin Luther depended upon it.</strong> When E.A. Gosselin compiled a listing of the printed editions of works by Nicolaus de Lyra, it ran to 27 pages (in Traditio 26 (1970), pp 399-426).<br><br>He was born in the village of Vieille-Lyre, Normandy, hence his name. Like others in the 14th century, he was occupied by the possibility of the conversion of the Jews, to whom he dedicated hortatory addresses. He wrote Pulcherrimae quaestiones Iudaicam perfidam in catholicam fide improbantes, which was one of the sources Martin Luther used in his On the Jews and Their Lies.</blockquote>Here is the Catholic url on him:<br><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11063a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11063a.htm</a><br><br>PS: The Talmud is the Jewish Oral Tradition. The article said he "drew copiously from the Talmudic commentaries" .. dunno true or not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
