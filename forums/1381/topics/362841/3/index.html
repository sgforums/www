              <p>The ancient Chinese were originally monotheists, meaning they believed in one God above all which they called Shang Di. And they believed that all of nature and creation came from this God. This is remarkably similar to the Juedo-Christian concept.</p>

              <p>Shang Di was the name for the highest God in the pantheon of Gods worshipped by the Chinese during the Shang Dynasty. He was the highest God among the other gods the Chinese worshipped (including ancestor gods).</p>
              <p>It was only during the Ming Dynasty Catholic missionaries who studied the Chinese classics linked Shang Di to Jehovah.</p>
              <p>But during the latter part of the Qing Dynasty, a conservative archbishop decreed that Shangdi doesn't equate to Jehovah.</p>

              <p>If he's trying to link it like that then he is clearly wrong.</p>
              <p>The issue is this, I do not believe that the God is limited to only having the Judeo Christian conception of Him- in other words if you do not accept the Judeo Christian conception of God then you do not believe in God. You may have an unclear, or incomplete picture of Him, but then it does not follow on that you do not in a sense, know Him in some way.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Being a Christian I believe that of course, my personal perception on God under the Christian worldview is the most correct, and that the rest fall short in a certain way. If I didn't think so then there's no point being a Christian. I understand that a Muslim or Hindu would, and justifiably so, hold a similar view. </p>
              <p>This is however, quite different from saying that if you don't see God the way I understand Him, then you don't know Him at all or are praying to nothing.</p>
              <p>I believe personally however, that the ability to know or yearn for God is an innate instinct, so of course all cultures are bound to know Him in some aspect or another in their various religions. There examples in the bible where God has spoken to people who do not have the Judeo Christian conception of Him, so I don't see why this should be so unthinkable that the concept of Shang Di in Chinese culture stems from a particular understanding of God.</p>

              <p>So in a sense yes, if Good and evil are opposed logically, then what you render onto Good cannot be rendered onto evil.</p>
              <p>The Christian position is not that the good deeds done by people of other faiths is totally worthless, if anything they matter and matter a lot and in the eyes of God ought to matter. The catch is that it is also the Christian position that no amount of good deeds done by anybody is ever enough.</p>

              <p>I think it's somewhat foolish to suggest that Christianity has a watertight case in terms of apologetics, such a position is impossible for time simple reason to do so would be to assume that we've reached the end of knowledge, that we've know all there needs to be known. This has clearly not happened yet, and I always feel uncomfortable when some of my peers become all "I have an answer to every difficult question"</p>
              <p>What can be said however is that Christianity as a system is plausible enough that it is not something to be dismissed out of hand once all the facts are laid out and viewed properly with reason. In other words it deserves consideration. How we respond to these facts also depends on our individual perspectives in life as well as other factors.</p>
              <p>The thing is I don't think this is as simple as "the modern scientific and rational people versus the people who believe in the tooth fairy". It is hardly the case.</p>
              <p>Hence the problem comes when both sides meet in discussion often they have stock answers which they don't seem to put much though into. Some will come up with a big chunk of "Da Vinci stuff" and the others would have something like the "Chick Tracts" and toss about athiestic one-liners and religious mantras and jargons... all this is hardly useful and only adds to the barriers of understanding anything at all.</p>
              <p>In fact my personal background had me coming from a place which built barriers and encouraged us to stay away from the world within the four walls of the church and to avoid any kind of contact with others that do not hold our view. Which I felt was strange, if we had an idea that we believe should matter and change the world then we should not be afraid about letting it hit reality and be tested by it. For me so far it has held true not because of the religious mantras my church told me to recite like "have faith" but because I have thought through it seriously and it still holds water for me.</p>
              <p>Lol, basically what I am appealing for in this thread, and forum is for us to be civil, and assume that the other party is an intelligent, civil and logical being that is not here to beat people around with their ideas but to really test them out.</p>

              <p>I think you misunderstood my christianese (one reason why I dislike using it), if I may so translate humans have the inate instinct for the transcendent.</p>
              <p>Being atheistic hardly means you do not have this instinct for the transcendent, the beyond. Buddism is a good example.

              <p>In the Christian perspective the purpose of this instinct is to find God, and that humans will take actions because of this instinct.</p>
              <p>If you'll find God through this instinct however, is of course another question. As they say it's the details that are the bugbear.</p>
