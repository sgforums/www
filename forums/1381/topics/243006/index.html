With CG setting, its easier to foster a more personalised and closer relationship, people in CG tends to know each other better, and more able to share and support each other (being in a ministry helps too, but not all church members are in ministries)... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
