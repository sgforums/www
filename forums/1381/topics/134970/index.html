Nobody have any problem with dating on other events.  There wouldn't have any changes in the year system. The only proposed difference in years u given is, well, dated to christ. If all the other dating scheme is accurate, then there shouldn't have any problem finding out the important dates of christ life. If u look at your website, u found tat even the day of the eclipse is accurate and not ambiguous. In fact your website highlight a contradiction of the date he die, tat is why there is much debate on it since selection of a part of th bible to be true will inevitably forsake a section of the bible and labeled it as wrong.<br><br>U give an example of christ being wrongly dated. Well, tis only shows the uncertainty of important dates of jesus, which give more arguments to show him more fiction than facts</div>

That Jesus must be fiction cos' we cannot be sure when he was born and when he died? I don't even know when my grandfather was born and that was less than 100 years ago <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So is it your argument that he did not exist, was not born, did not die and certainly did not resurrect; but someone wrote a bestseller fiction that is read over 2000 years and commands a following of millions of people today. What's more, followers of 2 other major rival religions (Judaism and Islam) also believed the story that at least he existed. Wow....<br><br>I better read the bible then...maybe I can learn to write something better than Dan Brown...<br><br></div>
