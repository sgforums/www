            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>My answer is always .. "I dunno" .. lol<br><br>As in research, I just do a literature review and show you what some experts think. </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>there r many people who believe in trinity and as such, it is true tat jesus do proclaim he is god by refering to himself as son of god. Unless u r going to tell me no group of christian believe in trinity, then I will eat my words. Frankly individual peopel have very different views from mainstream people. If we cater to all individuals,maybe some mad or attention grabbing then we r losing focus<br><br><blockquote>aiya .. this SIS lose liao nothing to say and so he resorted to using the majority vs minority argument. Very convenient huh? </blockquote>Ha ! Tis argument has always been whether does any church practise masses on christmas eve. U r the one tat bring out a minority group of people into the picture, then u conveniently say tat because of a minority of people who practise christmas mass on other days, u try to ignore the people who really do go for masses on christmas day as well. Your job is to prove to me NO ONE had a masses on christmas eve, NOT a small group of people who do not do so. There r many small group of cults who do obscene and silly things, so u wanna include all their views in as well ?<br><br><blockquote>Not necessary for salvation doesn't mean they don't celebrate. My point is just that his real date is not a life and death matter for xtians. Your argument is that his date is not recorded precisely. I feel that precise or not makes no difference to the message of the gospel and of the Christian bible in general. </blockquote>There r a lot of things tat were not life and death for christians as well. If salvation is the only thing u care for, then the story of jesus, or perhaps more than 50% of the bible can be deleted since they tell of story and nothing of salvation. The bible should simply be a book of laws. However the bible now include many small small details, such as some extraordinary star on the night of his birth yet the date is not recorded or cannto be traced, it just make little sense<br><br><blockquote>Erm who recorded for these people? Maybe some of these people recorded their own life but Jesus never left any such records for us. </blockquote>Can't the disciple, who can even quote out whole conversation or events to jesus birth record at least his birth date ?<br><br><blockquote>I was asking you how the author knew the date. I'm not questioning whether the date is written at all</blockquote>There r tons of reference on the website I have given<br><br><blockquote>Pontius Pilate was recorded by the Jewish historian Josepheus. You don't doubt Josepheus do you? </blockquote>No, I was saying he was not important enough at tat time. U can read the second part of your quoted sentence isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Josepheus wrote his works before AD 300</blockquote>Christainity only get popular after 300 AD. Only then does people written in it get famous and there r interest in their birth dates etc. Before tat there is none and it is not a surprise for their record to be forgotten<br><br><blockquote>what's wrong with people from bible? You don't doubt Caesar Augustus do you? </blockquote>I believe in Caesar but not Adam/eve/noah/job etc. Why not choose secular people instead of a book tat bring much controversies ?<br><br><blockquote>They wrong or not we also dunno, unless the date is verified by another author having no connections with the first one. I was trying to say you do not know the reason and process of the date recording. </blockquote>How do u know the author is not the person himself. U r jumping to another point. If a person older than jesus had his date recorded, why can't his date get recorded ?<br><br><blockquote>I can show you other sites which put 'c' or 'ca'. The point is, we are not entirely clear of the dates. How you explain why some sites put circa? </blockquote>I have already shown u site which do not put down c or ca. U should be the one tat prove the site is wrong, not me to prove to u why other site put c/ca. There is nothing wrong with the sites putting c/ca as technically they r still right<br><br><blockquote>My challenge to you is how you prove buddhism influences "more people for more years than the bible"? </blockquote>More years because buddhism starts off early isn't it ? In the past they have influence more people, and in fact the most populous nations isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>The experts do not know by virtue of the fact no one has knowledge of all records. But with the information we have now, we know - Whatever the precise figure, the Bible is by far the bestselling book of all time.<br><br>If you are not willing to accept this "best guess", it is fine with me.</blockquote>As said before, the writer himself do not know for certain which is the best selling book. If I am not wrong, probably is because they can't have statistic for a large number of literature such as the quran from past till now. Best guess is not absolute.</div>

And I don't think the whole of India was influenced by buddhism for a long time. So your populous nations assumption cannot show more people are influenced. On the other hand, church life is integral to life in Europe before the Enlightenment. There may be Jews and Muslims, but not in large numbers other than in Muslim nations for the latter. But India and China? We find hindus and taoists as major religions also. In no book will you find buddhist life an integral part of life in China.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on the accounts in the gospels of the shepherds' activities, the time of year depicted for Jesus' birth could be spring or summer. However, as early as 354, Roman Christians celebrated it following the December solstice in an attempt to replace the Roman pagan festival of Saturnalia. Before then, Jesus' birth was generally celebrated on January 6 as part of the feast of Theophany, also known as Epiphany, which commemorated not only Jesus' birth but also his baptism by John in the Jordan and possibly additional events in Jesus' life.</div>

As for B.C. and A.D., they are passÃ©, and we now use B.C.E. for "Before Common Era" and C.E. for "Common Era." B.P., meaning "Before Present," is becoming popular in scientific writings; thus, one might read of a campsite which came into use approximately 13,500 B.P. (which would translate to 11,500 B.C.E.).<br><br>The Julian Calendar came with Julius Caesar in 45 B.C.E. Upon the advice of the Greek astronomer Sosigenes, Julius adopted a purely solar calendar. The Julian calendar fixed the normal year at 365 days and, with the naming of July after Julius and August after his successor Augustus, established the order of the months and the days of the week as we know them today.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Julian year was eleven minutes and fourteen seconds longer than a solar year. By 1582 the vernal equinox occurred ten days early, so Pope Gregory XIII dropped ten days from the calendar. He instituted the Gregorian calendar, which provided that any century year divisible by 400 should be a leap year, but all other century years should be regular or non-leap years.<br><br>The Gregorian Calendar was anything but widely accepted, and many European cultures still the old Greek calendar. The Protestants shunned the Gregorian calendar for a long time. Greece, for example, adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1923 for civil purposes, but it still has not gained widespread acceptance in countries dominated by members of the Greek Orthodox Church. This is particularly visible when it comes to festival days such as Christmas and Easter. Britain adopted it in 1752 (shortly before the American Revolution) and the Soviet Union adopted it in 1918. Of course, Hebrews, Muslims and Chinese all use their own calendars, so this is the year 2001 for only a relatively small fraction of the world.<br><br>The Christian era, now almost exclusive throughout the Western world for civil chronology, was established in 525 by the Christian monk Dionysius Exiguus. He fixed the birth of Christ in the 753th year of Rome, and started counting over again, retroactively from that year. Those who suggest that his chronology is off by a few years are using the Christian Gospel accounts to get their information. Since the various Gospels contradict one another (as well as secular history), it's not surprising that by 1910, almost a dozen different years had been proposed for the year of Christ's birth! Certainly that number has grown since then.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">It doesn't seem to dawn on most people that just because the Gospel accounts are the only sources for the Christ story doesn't make them trustworthy: people will derive their understanding of truth from them nonetheless. Besides, many of our philosophical predecessors were marched off to a blazing death for even questioning the validity of the Christian claims. So, you won't find many people before the Enlightenment who were willing to dispute what the Christian Churches have asserted over the centuries. And even though today disputing the Christian Church seems to be a relatively safe activity, most people are still a bit jittery about doing so -- and for good reason.<br><br>The Christian Era chronology was fixed in Roman Catholic Europe and the English-speaking world long before any scholarship began to questions the historicity of Jesus. (As I mentioned above, the life-expectancy of any such scholars stopped being an issue only with the advent of the modern world's first openly secular nation, The United States of America.) Even atheism was not intellectually tenable until Charles Darwin answered the Argument from Design in 1859, so most people simple went along with what had been established because it was convenient and because the Gregorian Calendar works down to a few seconds every decade (which are adjusted out in nuclear clocks every so often by a world council appointed by the nations who use this system to keep track of such matters). But the historicity of Jesus stopped being an issue when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire. The question of Christ's historicity did not resurface until after the Age of Enlightenment, when Strauss and Renan started to question the validity of the Gospel Accounts.<br><br>Even a hundred years ago, only very obscure scholars openly denied the historicity of Christ. One's tenure at a Church-owned university (or the state university of a Christian nation such as Germany or England) was always a concern, so even if a scholar personally doubted the historicity of Jesus, his writings did not reflect this in a way that encouraged open discussion; rather, facts were detailed without the accompanying conclusions spelled out. Arthur Drews, one of the earlier proponents of the Jesus Myth model, used arguments that are not popular amongst the Jesus Myth proponents of today.<br><br>Besides this, the Jesus Myth model itself is, by nature, not a "strong" argument but a "weak" argument. By this I mean that it does not assert that no historical Jesus existed, but rather shows that there is not enough evidence to show that a historical figure named Jesus did exist, whose life story eventually became embellished to become the Gospel story we all know. That is, the Gospel stories can be explained without there having been a historical figure behind them. The rules of logic show that it is impossible to disprove an existential claim (a claim that a thing exists). So, most Jesus Myth proponents of today will admit that they cannot prove that Jesus did not exist (and, indeed, do not make this claim, at least using that language).<br><br>In light of this, I don't foresee any drastic changes even being proposed on the basis of there never having been a Jesus, simply because nobody is claiming that no Jesus ever existed. We do recognize that Jesus is widely seen as the founder-figure of the religion which dominated Europe for sixteen centuries (up until after the First World War), and which has come to dominate the United States since the onset of the Cold War (though it was not the major player before then that Christians make it out to have been). So, even if Jesus is not who they say he is, he is still widely seen as an influential figure in Western culture, and this alone would probably prevail in any discussion regarding any changes that may be proposed.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/mail/eml8701.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.positiveatheism.org/mail/eml8701.htm</a></div>
