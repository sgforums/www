If Plato's date of death is correct in Apollodorus' version, Plato would have been born in 430 or 431. Diogenes' claim that Plato was born the year Pericles died would put his birth in 429.

If u r talking about influence, in the past buddhism has a higher population than christainity. And talking about introducing music etc, wat has tis got to do with saying christainity must be true ? Nothing as well. If going by your argument, then all of us should be jewish since jews started earlier, influence more people and started 2 major religions.

I mean a son with no proper father. In those jewish days, tat is probably little tolerated and he get victimised, leading him to hate the religion since young and he will never have a good future except being a carpenter. Then one day he together with some of his friends formed a group who like to go around acting and cheating people by saying he is god or something. His friend will go ahead and prepare some acting of being heal etc or prepare some illusion to trick the otherwise naive people. He is pretty clever and well, do want to go against jewish and he made some interesting replies to the people who want to say they r fraud. He became popular because people felt the ways of the jews r, probably too harsh and ridiculous to live by and his idea of being more relax and humane makes it popular. He have to continue to use the OT although he do not like it because he already told people he is son of the old god before. He can't contradict himself then. Anyway tis catch the eyes of the jewish priest and they decide to prosecute and kill him. He got caught and he knew he can't escape, so he might as well say he die for the people to make the best use of the lousy cards dealt to him. After he died, he and the rest of his friends, who still wanna go around cheating, decide to say he reserect and carry on the same game so they can laze in future. Much future in time, a political organisation decide to use tis cult as a new pawn in his quest for conquest, compile the bible of things he want to include and delete off things he do not want to, and exaggerated almost everything tat jesus had done to godly status. After tat, it is history<br><br>Tis is a possible scenario but of course, it is all wat I imagine myself and certainly not proven. Anyway it has been fun writing tis scenario, to me at least  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> So if there is anyone who wanna come out and say tis is bull, I am not gonna stop u. The above is really bull but it do sounds like a possible history outcome</div>

Not that they are orthodox and the one in Vatican is not.</span></span><br></div></blockquote>For the benefit of stupidissmart who has failed to do his homework and hence embarassed himself for not knowing the different between orthodox and Orthodox.<br><br>Here you go...<br><br>History of Orthodoxy<br>Eastern Orthodoxy as a distinct branch of Christianity arose as a result of the first major divide in Christendom occurred in the 11th century with the "Great Schism" between East and West. The separation was not sudden or unexpected, however. For centuries there had been significant religious, cultural, and political differences between the Eastern and Western churches. Religiously, the two regions had different views on topics such as the use of images (icons), the nature of the Holy Spirit, and the date on which Easter should be celebrated.<br><br>Culturally, the Greek East has always tended to be more philosophical, abstract and mystical in its thinking, whereas the Latin West tends toward a more pragmatic and legal-minded approach. (According to an old saying, "the Greeks built metaphysical systems; the Romans built roads." )<br><br>The political aspects of the split date back to the Emperor Constantine, who moved the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Constantinople. Upon his death, the empire was divided between his two sons, one of whom ruled the western half of the empire from Rome while the other ruled the eastern region from Constantinople.<br><br>These various factors finally came to a head in 1054 AD, when Pope Leo IX excommunicated the patriarch of Constantinople (the leader of the Eastern church). In response, the patriarch anathematized (condemned) the Pope, and the Christian church has been divided into West ("Roman Catholic" ) and East ("Greek Orthodox" ) ever since. A glimmer of hope for reconciliation came at the onset of the Crusades later that century, when the West came to the aid of the East against the Turks. But especially after the Fourth Crusade (1200-1204), in which crusaders sacked and occupied Constantinople, the only result was an increase in hostility between the two churches.<br><br>However, attempts at reconciliation have been renewed in recent years. In 1964, the Second Vatican Council issued this statement praising its Eastern counterparts:<br><br>The Catholic Church values highly the institutions of the Eastern Churches, their liturgical rites, ecclesiastical traditions, and their ordering of Christian life. For in those churches, which are distinguished by their venerable antiquity, there is clearly evident the tradition which has come from the Apostles through the Fathers and which is part of the divinely revealed, undivided heritage of the Universal Church.<br>On December 7, 1965, the mutual excommunication of 1054 was officially removed by Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras.<br></div>

It has never been about the amount of influence either as it meant nothing as well. Does it means christianity is right ? Wrong because it is only a phase, where buddhism or egytian religion has enjoyed in the past as well. MOreover the amount of influence is probably due much to crusaders as well as inquisition.
