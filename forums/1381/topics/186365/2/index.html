            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NT2:</div><div class="quote_body">Galatians tells us that we need not behave like the Jews as a Christian.<br><br>Passover, Shofars and all these things do place a special place and meaning for the Jews but for us who are Gentiles and under the new covenant. We have no obligations to come under these.<br><br></div></blockquote>Then explain this:<br><br>If we have no obligation to behave as Jews, it does not say that we have no obligation to understand and be feverent in keeping Gods commandments. If we have no understanding of our roots, which for all intents and purposes are jewish,  then why are we also called abrahams seed? The father of the Jewish nation? Why would God bring us back to an Abrahamic covenant and promise? And what did God say to Abraham about his blessings which we have obtained by this promise God made to Abraham?<br><br>In Romans 3:26-29, it says:<br>26For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<br><br>27For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.<br><br>28There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.<br><br>29And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.<br><br>And what new covenant do you think this is? Jesus himself said, I come not to abolish the law but to fulfil it. So if the law is not abolished, it still stands. Jesus himself also said to obey the Fathers commandments. Where do you suppose those commandments are found? In the old testament.<br><br>Just because Jesus came, it does not mean that God does away with all He has said and ordained in the OT. Our God is a God who is the same yesterday, today and forever. Jesus came so that we may be justified and have righteousness by faith in Him because Jesus lived the law perfectly, so therefore, being perfect, He fulfilled the law on our behalf, he was the perfect sacrifice which atoned for our failure to keep the law. By his death we have freedom from the curse of the law if we stumble in keeping the Lords commandments, but it does not mean we do not try to live our lives according to the commandments of the Lord.<br><br>Please remember, the gospel of Jesus is one for the JEW FIRST, then for the gentile. We have grace because they our brothers and sisters (the Jews) have been blinded for our sakes so that God may graft us the wild branches in. But if God did not spare the natural vine, how much more will He also not spare us if we do not obey His commandments?<br><br>That is how death came into place because Adam failed to obey God's commandment. That is the same for the Jew, and also for the gentile. Jesus said this:<br><br>In Matthew 5:16-18<br>16Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<br><br>17Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br><br>18For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br><br>What do you then suppose this means? Why would Jesus or God want us to keep the pagan festivals? Even Christmas, we know that it is the wrong date, and we have a clear idea of when it should be so why not celebrate it at the right time? Why are the significant moments of our Lords' life intertwined with pagan heresy? Why does it need to be and why does it need to replace it?<br><br>And in Galatians 4:8-9, Paul says this:<br>8Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.<br><br>9But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?<br><br>Please bear in mind that when Paul said this to the Galatians, he was talking to people who were not Jews, but pagans who celebrated pagan festivals before, and turned back to celebrating them again even after knowing God.<br><br>Read these same verses in the amplified version:<br>8But at that previous time, when you had not come to be acquainted with and understand and know the true God, you [Gentiles] were in bondage to gods who by their very nature could not be gods at all [gods that really did not exist].<br><br>9Now, however, that you have come to be acquainted with and understand and know [the true] God, or rather to be understood and known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly and worthless elementary things [[d]of all religions before Christ came], whose slaves you once more want to become?<br><br>10You observe [particular] days and months and seasons and years!<br><br>11I am alarmed [about you], lest I have labored among and over you to no purpose and in vain.<br><br>Paul also said this in Romans 3:31<br>31Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.<br><br>By celebrating EASTER, we are missing out on the significance of Jesus being the passover lamb. Easter is easter and passover is passover. I have already posted on this in an earlier post. What then is the significance of the easter eggs and of the easter bunny? All this is not to condemn, but to speak the truth so that to those who have ears, let them hear.</div>

How interesting to lose the significance in heresy.<br><br>So this person is confused, passover is not easter. And lets get the facts straight, Christ rose early on the third day and not during the night!!! Sigh. Also it is not the night that is holy or has it the power to dispel evil. It was not the night that dispelled evil, but Yeshua who conquered death and sin! It is what Yeshua did for us and let us not belittle His death for us. If anything at all we should celebrate His death and ressurection for us. The glory should go to Him and Him alone and not the night or the day or any romanticized notions about this. Give GOD the glory not His creation.<br><br>Easter will never mean the deliverance of us Christians. How can it be since it is pagan????? We have to get out of the mentality that easter is passover. Passover yes, but easter no. Where in the bible is easter ever mentioned? How do you link easter eggs and the easter bunny to passover? Where is the link???? Passover is what it is and always will be. It links to communion, and our redemtion from our sins, but not easter.</div>

How interesting to lose the significance in heresy.<br><br>So this person is confused, passover is not easter. And lets get the facts straight, Christ rose early on the third day and not during the night!!! Sigh. Also it is not the night that is holy or has it the power to dispel evil. It was not the night that dispelled evil, but Yeshua who conquered death and sin! It is what Yeshua did for us and let us not belittle His death for us. If anything at all we should celebrate His death and ressurection for us. The glory should go to Him and Him alone and not the night or the day or any romanticized notions about this. Give GOD the glory not His creation.<br><br>Easter will never mean the deliverance of us Christians. How can it be since it is pagan????? We have to get out of the mentality that easter is passover. Passover yes, but easter no. Where in the bible is easter ever mentioned? How do you link easter eggs and the easter bunny to passover? Where is the link???? Passover is what it is and always will be. It links to communion, and our redemtion from our sins, but not easter.</div></blockquote>oh, so now it's wrong to praise God for sending Jesus to die and rise for our sake?<br><br>If Easter is pagan, why are we 'pagans' celebrating the resurrection of Christ?<br><br>Ok, you are not wrong in saying that the original Easter is of pagan origins. And if you like you can say Christmas coincides with whatever pagan festival.<br><br>Even when Easter existed as a pagan feast, it had something to do with new life. Do not forget that through Christ's death we have new life. Is this not applicable to the resurrection? These pagan days have been transformed to reflecting on the birth and resurrection of Christ.

These pagan days have never been transformed, they have been absrobed into mainstream christianity which dilutes the meaning of why Christ died at passover. (I won't say who the culprit is... you should know.)<br><br>I do not say that it is wrong to praise God for sending Yeshua to die for us, I say that it is wrong to think that easter is part of Christianity. Spritually it never was and never will be. The pagan religion of celebrating easter was rooted in the celebration of the ressurection of baal. Get it?! Who is baal? Do you seriously think that Jesus would want to be associated with this?<br><br>Under the definition for Easter in Webster's Dictionary (College Edition) one finds: "originally the name of pagan vernal festival . . . Eastre, dawn goddess." Further reading in an encyclopedia, or most books on the holidays will identify this Eastre with the pagan goddess known variously as Eostre, Ishtar, Semeramis, and Astarte. This is the same Babylonian "Queen of Heaven," whose worship is condemned in the Word of God (see Jeremiah Chapters 7 and 44).<br><br>The trappings of the modern Easter, and its associated days are all pagan in origin. Lent is not found in the Bible as a Christian holiday. It is rather borrowed from the 40 days of mourning for Tammuz, the lover/ husband/son of Astarte. God's Word condemns its observance in Ezekiel 8:14.<br><br>There is absolutely no Biblical authority for such days as Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, or Maundy Thursday. "Good Friday" is the most bizarre of them all. Any grade school child can see that the Lord could not have died and been buried late Friday, spent three days and three nights in the tomb (Matt. 12:40) and risen again Sunday morning!<br><br>The word Easter is mentioned but once in the Authorized (KJV) Version of Scripture (Acts 12:4). There it is being observed by the pagan King Herod not by any Christian.<br><br>heed God's admonition found in Jeremiah 10:2: "Learn not the way of the heathen . . ."<br><br>The truth is that the forty days of Lent, eggs, rabbits,hot cross buns and the Easter ham have everything to do with the ancient pagan religion of Mystery Babylon.These are all antichrist activities!<br><br>Satan is a master deceiver, and has filled the lives of well-meaning, professing Christians with idolatry.<br><br>These things bring the wrath of God upon children of disobedience, who try to make pagan customs of Baal worship Christian.<br><br>You must answer for your activities and for what you teach your children.<br><br>These customs of Easter honor Baal, who is also Satan, and is still worshipped as the "Rising Sun" and his house is the "House of the Rising Sun."<br><br>How many churches have "sunrise services" on Ishtar's day and face the rising sun in the East?<br><br>How many will use colored eggs and rabbit stories, as they did in ancient Babylon.<br><br>These things are no joke, any more than Judgement day is a joke.<br><br></div>

A JEW.<br><br>FYI, there are jews who believe that the messiah Yeshua has come and will come again, they are called messianic jews. My wife is one of them.<br><br>The point I am making here is that what I speak about is biblical, you are a CHIRSITAN, a follower of Yeshua. God's word should then mean something to you right? So then why are we doing what GOD told us not to do?????<br><br>IT IS NOT BEING LEGALISTIC, IT IS THE TRUTH, WE DO NOT WANT TO BE WISHY WASHY, JUST ACCEPTING HALF TRUTHS OR NON TRUTHS OR THINGS TAUGHT TO US WITH NO BIBLICAL BASIS, I AM GOING BACK TO THE BIBLE AS THE WORD OF GOD TO SEE WHAT IT SAYS.<br><br>It is just being accurate, our GOD is a very accurate, detailed and precise GOD. Do you think just because Jesus came, the OT does not apply? Note, that even the apostle Paul who was sent to the gentiles was a JEW. He would not have taught anything different from what Jesus already taught and these things were all in the context of JEWISH society and customs. Gods customs. If you want to be a CHRISTIAN, how come you don't want to obey GOD?<br><br>By what you say you obviously do not care about what God says in the bible. How far is that going to get you in your walk with GOD?</div>
