            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NT2:</div><div class="quote_body">let's discuss what are some 'special things' that happen in your local churches on easter sunday. any special ceremonies, events?</div></blockquote>why do you insist on spreading fallacy? Especially knowing that easter is a pagan religion. What symbolism has easter got to do with Yahshua's death? His death took place during the passover.<br><br>The significance is this:<br><br><strong>Passover Symbolism</strong><br>Much of the symbolism of Jesus' last Passover week is lost to us because we are unaware of the customs of the time. Two examples of many symbols: Jesus came into the city of Jerusalem five days before the lamb was killed in the temple as the Passover sacrifice for the sins of the people of Israel.<br><br>Five days before the lamb was to be sacrificed, it was chosen. Therefore, Jesus entered Jerusalem on lamb selection day as the lamb of God. The people did not understand the significance of this, since they greeted Him with palm branches and hailed Him as King, shouting "Hosanna," which means "save us." However, they were not looking for a spiritual Savior, but a political savior. Palm branches were a symbol of freedom and defiance, since Simon Maccabeus had entered Jerusalem with that symbolism.<br><br>Jesus' reaction was to weep, since He realized that they did not understand the Messiah's purpose in coming.<br><br><strong>Passover Sacrifice</strong><br>"Good Friday" (so named by the early church) was the day of the Passover celebration and the day that the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed. For the previous 1,200 years, the priest would blow the shofar (ram's horn) at 3 p.m.--the moment the lamb was sacrificed, and all the people would pause to contemplate the sacrifice for sins on behalf of the people of Israel.<br><br>On Good Friday at 3 p.m., when Jesus was being crucified, He said, "It is finished"--at the moment that the Passover lamb was sacrificed and the shofar was blown from the Temple. The sacrifice of the lamb of God was fulfilled at the hour that the symbolic animal sacrifice usually took place.<br><br>At the same time, the veil of the Temple (a three-inch thick, several stories high cloth that demarked the Holy of Holies) tore from top to bottom--representing a removal of the separation between God and man. Fifty days later, on the anniversary of the giving of the law (Pentecost), God left the earthly temple to inhabit those who call on the name of Jesus through His Holy Spirit.<br><br><strong>Passover: Crossing Over Into Your Future</strong><br>A crossing over time has three phases linked with transition: Death, Confusion, and New. The Hebrew word abar means "to cross over" or "pass over." This word illustrates a motion. It also refers to crossing a stream or barrier ("pass through," Numbers 21:22), invading a country ("passed over," Judges 11:32), crossing a boundary against a hostile army ("go over," 1 Samuel 14:4), marching over ("go over," Isaiah 51:23), overflowing the banks of a river or other natural barriers ("pass through," Isaiah 23:10), passing a razor over one's head ("come upon," Numbers 6:5), and the passing of time ("went over," 1 Chronicles 29:30).<br><br>As a verb, the word is used in relationship to transgression or sin, such as transgressing a covenant or commandment. One "passes beyond" the limits set by God's law and falls into transgression and guilt. This meaning appears in Numbers 14:41: "And Moses said, wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord? But it shall not prosper." We want to die to anything in the past season that would hinder us in the season ahead. We want to be sure the power of any besetting sin is broken. Go to the CROSS. Resurrection and new life are on the other side.<br><br>Passover is a key time for the Church to understand for us to enter into our full redemptive purpose. The Church had continued to celebrate this Feast for over 300 years after the Lord's crucifixion, but then Constantine forbade its celebration in the 4th century. The world and the enemy hates the blood.<br><br>God had heard the cry of the Israelites due to the hard labor they were under and remembered and acknowledged His covenant with them. He found a Deliverer, Moses, who would inform Israel that God had come to fulfill His promise to take them to their promised land, Canaan.<br><br>Moses, the Deliverer, also had the marching order from God to go to Pharaoh and command him to allow Israel to journey into the desert and worship Him. Israel responded to these changes with great enthusiasm (see Exodus 4:29-31: "and the people believed and heard that God had come to redeem His people...") and joy, but this initial enthusiasm quickly turned into bitter disappointment when Moses' first encounter with Pharaoh resulted in a 'double workload' (see Exodus 5:18-21) rather than redemption. Sometimes things get worse before breakthrough comes. (see Exodus 6:1-9)<br><br>The people immediately accused Moses of only aggravating their condition. Be careful not to place unnecessary blame on those who are trying to help you break free. "And they did not listen to Moses, due to their crushed spirits and hard work." (Exodus 6:9) It was just as difficult for Moses to convince the Israelites of God's word as it was to convince Pharaoh. He was assigned to not only inform the people but also to educate them on what it meant to come out and cross over and be redeemed. Therefore, they had to prepare themselves for their redemption. That is what Passover is about.<br><br>God had called Israel to repent prior to the Exodus, and to cleanse themselves from idolatry of their Egyptian culture in preparation for their redemption. Joshua did the same thing before "crossing the people over the Jordan" (Joshua 3). We must accept that the Lord has a time of preparation that He takes us through before releasing us into the next dimension of our promise. Celebrating Passover always points us toward our final redemption. This is a season where the Lord wants our end to be greater than our beginning. This Passover is so very important.<br></div>
