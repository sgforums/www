Have you ever wondered why it failed?<br><br>Easter no doubt is connected with Eggs and Rabbits, the essence of the pagan religion is no longer there.  It's more like a fun thing for the kids, which is not even compulsory.  Christmas is celebrated on a pagan holiday.  I don't see anything wrong with it cuz nobody remembers what the pagan religion is all about.  We only remember that Jesus was born to the world.  If you ask me, I really had no idea what was originally celebrated on 25 Dec until the Fundies made a big fuss over this.<br><br>Don't forget the whole of Europe was once upon a time worshipping pagan gods.  Whatever non church related activities practised today was only passed down from generations to generations, just like our Chinese New Year and Duan Wu (Dumpling or Boat Racing) Festival.  There is no pagan religion connotation or conflict with Church teaching/practises.<br><br>I certainly agree with focusing on Jesus alone.  And therefore, there is no need to trace the source of the pagan festival, when the pagan religion has already died and forgotten.  If you asked me Easter is to worship which god, frankly I am not interested to find out.  I only know on Easter Sunday, I go to church to celebrate the ressurrection of Christ.  That's all I need to know and that's what God would like us to do.</div>
