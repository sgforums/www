The fact is the cross is an instrument of death during the Roman times. The cross, after the cruxifixion, is used as a symbol in association with the death and resurrection of Christ. In itself, it is still a form of punishment. This is a classic case where a "foreign" icon is assimilated into our faith.<br><br>As I'd said before, religion and culture goes hand in hand, and religion in any culture will take on a revised form of the culture - that is quite natural.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The thing about festivals - personally, i believe they can used by God to give good messages, time of refreshment, to remind us of.....etc etc.  And also from our part - it is up to us to want to observe (not a MUST) and seek the "good parts" just as Paul mentioned of the "unleavenness".<br><br>Perhaps it is sad to some observers, but for me - such festivals / or times of observance do bring people into great times of corporate worship in a Church.  Granted that the ideal is to worship God daily, but given the structure of our society today - i believe the Lord shown us His grace to inspire the leaders to find a good way to bring people together at different times of the year - just as God told Moses about the Feast of Ingathering.<br><br>What better would it be - then to  observe the birth of Christ on Xmas Day - to tell the Truth of Jesus in replacement of the falsehood of reindeers flying in the sky ? God is so full of grace and love at the times of Moses and also for the current times - And i believe He can turn what is pagan to what is Holy.<br><br>If Jesus teaches during his public ministry at Passover seasons and Tabernacles and even Hanukkah - who are we, to judge over the Love of God for His people - no matter in what form of standings they are today or stage of "spiritual maturity" - cos like me - i do need a big nudge every now and then, to remember and to wait upon the Lord.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, let me share my view after reading all these pages.<br><br>two points<br>1) There are pagan origins to some of these holidays like Easter, Christmas ...etc<br>2) Today most (if not all) churches and christians who do celebrate these holidays do so with a clear conscious that they are remembering the birth, the suffering, death, resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ (at least I hope so).<br><br>Given the above 2 points,<br>What then should we do if we want to celebrate them?<br>I would like to susgest the following,<br>1) we need do it with a clear understanding of why we are doing this, in that we are celebrating Jesus (and not Santa Claus/Easter Bunnies).<br>2) also be ready to explain this to others where chances arise to do so.<br><br>Is there any possibilities (however remote it maybe), that some paganistic practices may slip into the church and hence corrupt it? maybe.<br>Since not all believers are blessed with understanding (ie. mature enough) in this area, some may be young and hence may be confused, hence there is a need to be careful when celebrating these holidays.<br><br>Personally, I feel that these holidays may well be a good evangelistic opportunity for us to share the good news of the gospels, who knows, people may get saved in this way.<br><br>God Bless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
