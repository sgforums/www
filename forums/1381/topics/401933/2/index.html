              What folly!
              
              If Neuman had gone to the doctor, he would not have been putting te doctor before God. God would have used the doctor as an instrument of His power to treat and save his daughter!

              <p>what about those people who died from cancer and other incurable diseases every year? God didnt use the doctor to heal the patient then, what a pity. so much for god's omnipotent.</p>
              <p>I also pity the doctor credentials and experiences, studied so hard to be a doctor, with a stroke of a brush, the doctor efforts in treating the patient has been brushed off conveniently with an explanation of god. in that case, why bother researching and improving medicine because all being attributed to the work of god and not the profession and the untold hard work being put to research.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There are many who believe that miracles are proof of god's existence. We hear wild claims that a healing has taken place but we never get an independent testimony from a medical office or a surgeon. We hear second-hand reports that someone was miraculously saved from disaster but we never get an eyewitness account of what is supposed to have happened. We hear rumors that prayer straightened a diseased body or strengthened a withered limb, but we never see X-rays or get comments from doctors or nurses. Wild claims, second-hand reports and rumors are no substitute for solid evidence and solid evidence of miracles is very rare. However, sometimes unexplained things do happen, unexpected events do occur. But our inability to explain such things does not prove the existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge is as yet incomplete. Before the development of modern medicine, when people didn't know what caused sickness people believed that god or the gods sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such things and when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our knowledge of the world is more complete, we will be able to understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just as we can now understand what causes disease.</p></div>
