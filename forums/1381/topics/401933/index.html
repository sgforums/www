              <p>A US jury has found a man guilty of killing his sick 11-year-old
              daughter by praying for her recovery rather than seeking medical care.<br> <br> <br> The man, Dale Neumann, told a court in the state of Wisconsin he believed God could heal his daughter.<br> She died of a treatable disease - undiagnosed diabetes - at home in
              rural Wisconsin in March last year, as people surrounded her and prayed.<br> Neumann's wife, Leilani Neumann, was convicted earlier this year.<br> The couple, who were both convicted of second-degree reckless homicide,
              face up to 25 years in prison when they are sentenced in October.<br> A lawyer representing Dale Neumann said he would appeal.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Dale Neumann faces up to 25 years in prison<br> <br> 'Faith healing'<br> <br> During the trial, medical experts told the court that Neumann's
              daughter could have survived if she had received treatment, including
              insulin and fluids, before she stopped breathing.<br> On Thursday Neumann, who is 47 and studied in the past to be a
              Pentecostal minister, said he thought God would heal his daughter.<br> "If I go to the doctor, I am putting the doctor before God," he said. "I am not believing what he said he would do."<br> He also said he thought his daughter had had flu or a fever, and that he had not realised how ill she was.<br> Neumann's lawyer said he had been convinced that his "faith healing" was working, and that he had committed no crime.<br> The prosecution argued that Neumann had minimised his daughter's
              illness and that he had allowed her to die as a selfish act of faith.<br> They said the girl should have been taken to hospital because she was unable to walk, talk, eat or drink.<br> Instead, an ambulance was only called once the girl had stopped breathing</p>

              <p>it is as good as having said nothing. if you go see doctor, doctor help you, not god. if u study hard for exams, you are helping yourself, not god. if you go see the doctor and doctor say he cant help you, you think god will help you? if that is the case, why millions of people died of cancer and other terrible diseases, of which there are christians. you mean to say god didnt help those christians who died of cancer?</p>

              <p>In my understanding as a Catholic, God helps people not directly but through the hands of men.</p>
              <p>God will not directly feed the poor on the streets but he's relying on us to feed the poor... on His behalf. For when we serve another, we are serving God indirectly as we are afterall God's creation. </p>
              <p>so if you are sick, God works through the doctor to try to cure you... but only if that is His will. if He does not wish for you to recover, then of course He plans for you to join Him up there as soon as possible. </p>
              <p>my mother in law passed away in April this year from lung cancer's complications... when we first found out 4 years ago, the doctor gave her only 6 months but through prayers AND medical treatment, she lasted 4 years in which she saw her daughter got married and also know she is with child before she decided enough is enough and left us... so all in all, God do help those who help themselves. my mother in law who sought treatment and encouraged by constant prayer that God will give her enough time to "settle" some of her worries... amen.</p>

              <p>what a brilliant way of explanation, attributing the law of nature and physics as god's creations.</p>
              <p>of course you will say this naturally, since you believed in god, but not everyone in this world is a god believer. It is just like one have just discovered a new truth, but some people come to claim it, saying it is god's creations. what a convenient way of putting it to claim credit. so the poor man, having worked all his life to experiment, deduct, hypothesis to discover the new truth, his hard work is being undone by a simple explanation due god's creations.</p>
              <p>I can't accept this kind of simplicity and lack of logic explanation, everything due to god's creations and will or god works in mysterious ways.</p>

              <p>A notion of having a ''god'' i feel means giving mental strength to a person. Having the though of a supernatural being helping you. Thus having the mental strength to fight illness.
