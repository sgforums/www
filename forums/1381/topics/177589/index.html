            <div class='col-md body'>let me start...<br>Notes taken from my archive in my email.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Storms, Saints, and Sinners</span></strong><br><br><strong>The word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, 'Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before Me.' But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. (Jonah 1:1-3 NKJV)</strong><br><br>Jonah does what we must never do--he rebels against God's calling on his life. Rather than go to Nineveh as he was commanded, Jonah goes in the opposite direction and heads for Tarshish. This is like someone living in Detroit being called to Washington D.C. but going to San Francisco instead. Jonah's actions reveal that he despised his calling and couldn't get far enough from it. But as Jonah's journey will show us in the days ahead, the Lord has ways of getting our attention when we don't heed His call.<br><br>God can use storms to keep us from continuing down the path of disobedience. Have you ever had one of those days where everything seems to be working against you? Perhaps you hit every red light, you can't find your wallet, the battery on your watch dies, and so on. To quote a phrase, it seems as though 'all hell has broken loose.' It isn't hell; it's heaven as God sends stormy circumstances to slow you down. He can also use saints to stop you from following a corrupt course. Maybe you're at the movie theater and you run into someone from church just before you buy a ticket to a film you've got no business seeing. It's all a part of God's plan to get you back on track. And sometimes the Lord will send a sinner into your life to remind you of how miserable it is to be outside His will and to warn you of what's around the corner.<br><br>Look at your life. Are you heading in the opposite direction of God's will for you? Is He sending storms, saints, or sinners your way? Learn from Jonah's mistake and stay on course with what God has called you to do.<br><br>DIG - What will God do to get our attention?<br><br>DISCOVER - When has God sent you a storm, saint, or sinner to get your attention?<br><br>DISPLAY - Ask God to give you the strength to stay on course.<br><br>This Bible Study was prepared by Pastor Bob Coy of The Active Word.<br><br>God Bless,<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Avoiding Indiscriminate Love<br><br>I pray "that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment" (Phil. 1:9).<br>As a Christian, you are a repository of divine love. More than anything else, your love for God and for other believers marks you as a true disciple of Jesus Christ (John 13:35).<br><br>In addition to possessing God's love, you have the privilege and responsibility of expressing it to others on His behalf. That's a sacred trust. Paul qualifies it in Philippians 1:9, which tells us love is to operate within the sphere of biblical knowledge and spiritual discernment. Those are the parameters that govern God's love.<br><br>No matter how loving an act or word might seem, if it violates knowledge and discernment, it is not true Christian love. Second John 5-11 illustrates that principle. Apparently some believers who lacked discernment were hosting false teachers in the name of Christian love and hospitality. John sternly warned them, saying, "If anyone comes to you and does not bring [sound doctrine], do not receive him into your house, and do not give him a greeting; for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds" (vv. 10-11). That might sound extreme or unloving but the purity of God's people was at stake.<br><br>In 2 Thessalonians 3:5-6 after praying for the Thessalonians' love to increase, Paul then commanded them to keep aloof from so- called Christians who were disregarding sound teaching. That's not contradictory because Christian love guards sound doctrine and holy living.<br><br>Unfortunately, today it is common for Christians to compromise doctrinal purity in the name of love and unity, or to brand as unloving some practices that Scripture clearly commands. Both are wrong and carry serious consequences if not corrected.<br><br>Be thoughtful in how you express your love. Abundantly supply it in accord with biblical knowledge and discernment. Excellence and righteousness will result (Phil. 1:10-11).<br><br>Suggestions for Prayer:<br><br>Thank God for the love He has given you through His Spirit (Rom. 5:5).<br>Ask for opportunities to demonstrate Christ's love to others today.<br>Pray that your love will always be governed by deep convictions grounded in God's truth.<br><br>For Further Study:<br>What do the following passages teach about love? How might you apply them to your life?<br><br>Romans 12:8-10<br>Romans 5:5<br>1 John 4:7-10<br>Galatians 5:22<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God" (Col. 1:10).<br>Every farmer who enjoys a plentiful harvest does so only after diligent effort on his part. He must cultivate the soil, plant the seed, then nurture it to maturity. Each step is thoughtful, disciplined, and orderly.<br><br>Similarly, bearing spiritual fruit is not an unthinking or haphazard process. It requires us to be diligent in pursuing the knowledge of God's will, which is revealed in His Word. That is Paul's prayer in Colossians 1:9, which he reiterates in verse 10.<br><br>The phrase "increasing in the knowledge of God" (v. 10) can be translated, "increasing by the knowledge of God." Both renderings are acceptable. The first emphasizes the need to grow; the second emphasizes the role that knowledge plays in your spiritual growth.<br><br>As your knowledge of God's Word increases, the Holy Spirit renews your mind and transforms your thinking. As you gaze into the glory of the Lord as revealed in Scripture, you "are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory" (2 Cor. 3:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. You have "put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him" (Col. 3:10).<br><br>One of Satan's ploys to retard spiritual productivity is getting Christians preoccupied with humanistic philosophy and other bankrupt substitutes for God's truth. That's why he planted false teachers at Colosse to teach that knowing God's will is inadequate for true spirituality. Paul refuted that claim by affirming that Christ is the fullness of deity in bodily form (Col. 2:9). In Him are "hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Col. 2:3). He is all you need!<br><br>Scripture commands you to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 3:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Is that characteristic of your life? Are you looking forward to a bountiful spiritual harvest?<br><br>Suggestions for Prayer:<br><br>Thank God for the privilege of knowing His will and studying His Word.<br>Prayerfully guard your mind from sinful influences. Saturate it with God's truth.<br><br>For Further Study:<br>Read the following passages, noting the effects of God's Word:<br><br>Psalms 119:9, 105; Acts 20:32; Romans 10:17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:14-17; Hebrews 4:12-13; 1 John 2:14.<br></div>
