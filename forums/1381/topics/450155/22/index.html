              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">4. Like it or not, you were wrong. An argument is actually a SERIES of statements called premises and conclusion. You can of course choose not to take my word for it, just go check a dictionary or any book on critical thinking if letting someone else correct you makes you feel better."</span></p>
              <p>In other words, no source, no basis for your above arguments. What a poor loser attitude... Come on... you are the one accuse me that my English is bad... Try harder!</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">5. Yes, you heard me right, the Bible teaches that Adam’s sin brought death into the world. The consequences of one man’s actions are not limited to just himself. You should have lived long enough to know this. This is not about God being cruel, it is about the wide reaching effects of sin. BTW, to judge God is to presuppose a basis, a moral standard, for making moral judgement. From where does an atheist get this moral standard?"</span></p>
              <p>I did not judge as I know "cruel" is subjective. So according to you, God is loving when He supposedly made the <strong>other</strong> lifeforms to suffer mortality when the 1st man made his 1st mistake because banishment is not enough. Remember God is Omnipotent/present/benevolence. That actually meant, God intended the various lifeforms to have mortality.  Which is no support to your original claim that"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 15px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">There was no death before sin."</span>  </p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">6. You missed the whole point and is now fixated with splitting hairs here. I am saying that the coney and the rabbits have been classified in the OT law as animals that “chew the cud” because the phrase simply means “to bring up” which is good information enough for the Israelites without having to know the digestive distinctions between cows and coneys. I also mentioned that coney was an old English word for rabbit and I am not wrong. (see </span><a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rabbit.org/links/history.html">http://www.rabbit.org/links/history.html</a><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> ) Anyway, the Hebrew word is shaw-fawn', a species of rock rabbit (from its hiding), i.e. probably the hyrax. Some Bible versions translate it as rock badger while others as hyrax. But whatever it was, it was a rabbit-like rodent."</span></p>

              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">7. I am taking issue with YOUR fallacious statement that the creationists are not credible. You then said I am appealing to authority here? You are diverting the issue by throwing a red herring accusation at me. But like it or not, many creation scientists have PhDs from world class universities. If that does not qualify them as authorities in their respective fields of study, then what does?"</span></p>

              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">8. You are flogging a dead horse. I already made it clear that my “gay” example was an illustration. I did not say you made that claim. I even made it clear with an “IF”. And now you then went on an irrelevant exposition of what a strawman argument is."</span></p>
              <p>Wanna point out that the "gay" example is a red herring... as it could meant from sexual preference to elation where "chewer of the cud" refers to behaviours. The "if" you said in :"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's like you telling me that if the word "gay..." </span></span>was refering to the word "gay" not the "you", which is me. Its a strawman because your English is bad or you don't know how to posit yourself or you just can't stand correction.  I just hate to be corrected incorrectly. </p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">9. I’m not asking you to check out another website on fallacies! But then again, I think you do need to brush up on them anyway. When it comes to stereotyping the village atheists, OK guilty as charged! But you should find out more for yourself what characterizes the village atheists."</span></p>
              <p>You misunderstood. I just don't wanna see a website full of fallacious conclusions. I don't religously discriminate like you do... Not in sync with Jesus's Beautitudes.... Sorry to reject your sincere offer.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Tcms said that truth changes. If that is not holding to the notion of subjective truth, then what is it? Those who hold to relativism do hold to a warped notion of truth, and I have already explained why it is so. Your failure to discern it and instead to confuse it with circular reasoning does not render my case against relativism invalid. Any bloke can cut and paste chunks of WOT on informal fallacies, but not everyone can identify them correctly.</p>
              <p>You claimed that it is circular reasoning for me to argue that relativism is self-defeating, yet you were unable to point out where the circular reasoning is. In the first place did you even understand the point I was making? Let me again show you how self-defeating relativism is. If you claim that relativism is true, then is it ABSOLUTELY true, or relatively true? Think hard, don’t just give a knee-jerk response. Can God exists and God does not exist be both true? Relativists say “can” and thus violate the law of non-contradiction. Not only did you also fail to understand the contradictory nature of relativism, you still erroneously think this is circular reasoning on my part. Wait, there’s more. You also failed to see how relativism has no basis to judge. If what’s true is true for you and what’s true is true for me, then how can anyone be wrong? Relativism self-destructs when it is applied onto itself but instead of realising the absurdity of relativism you again accused me of circular reasoning. Thus you can’t fault me for noticing that you don’t know what circular reasoning is. See <a href="http://carm.org/refuting-relativism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://carm.org/refuting-relativism</span></span></a></p>
              <p>Yes, I affirm that objective truth does not change with time and you still failed to demonstrate how my statement committed the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Good try though, but no cookies. If you were born in Singapore, then one hundred years later the truth would still be that you were born in Singapore. So pray tell where’s the fallacious part?</p>
              <p>Concerning the flat earth myth, not everyone believed that the earth was flat. And the irony is that you failed to see within the wiki link you gave that there is this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth</span></span></a> as well. Oh and let me spoon feed you with this <a href="http://nabataea.net/flatearth.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://nabataea.net/flatearth.html</span></span></a></p>
              <p>Your refusal to accept the truth that an argument consists of a series of statements reflects your stubborn ego than any alleged “loser attitude” by me to produce evidence for something so self-evident. And since you refuse the less embarrassing alternative of self-correction and prefer to be corrected by me, so for what it’s worth here goes, “An argument is a connected series of statements or propositions, some of which are intended to provide support, justification or evidence for the truth of another statement or proposition. Arguments consist of one or more <em>premises</em> and a <em>conclusion</em>.” See <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/</span></span></a> <span> </span>Looks like I am not the one with the loser attitude.</p>
              <p>The very fact that you accused God of being cruel is already a moral judgement, yet now you deny that you made any judgement? Special pleading fallacy spotted! Not only that, you made a fallacious strawman argument. God was JUDGING the sin of Adam’s rebellion, and that meant subjecting the entire created universe to the curse of death. BTW, since you claim to be a parent of five kids (kudos to you for making govt very proud), isn’t punishment for wrong doing also an expression of love? And sometimes the consequences of punishment extends beyond the wrongdoer himself?</p>
              <p>Concerning chewing the cud, I was not appealing to ignorance, but correcting YOUR ignorance.</p>
              <p>Yes, creationists are people who believe God created. But that by itself does not mean that creationists are not credible. To claim that would be to invoke the genetic fallacy. And mind you, I was also talking about creationists who are also scientists. And then you throw out another alleged fallacy of composition, no doubt trying to sound impressive but perhaps without much substance.</p>
              <p>I certainly didn’t miss the personal dig that you find it easier on your patience to teach them, but then again it's easier to educate kids since you probably fare better with them being more impressionable and less equipped to wear you down with well-honed critical thinking skills. Oh, and did you know that teaching kids the wrong things is also very easy too?</p>
              <p>And the gay thingy? It wasn’t a red herring. As mentioned, it was simply another example to further illustrate a point I was trying to clarify with you. When I said “it’s like you saying...” it is not the same as saying “You said....” In any case, I wasn’t attributing that argument to you. I could well have mentioned “Ah Kow” in place of “you” and the point still remains.</p>
              <p>On what basis do you conclude that the websites I suggested were full of fallacious conclusions? That’s the fallacy of cavalier dismissal and/or the genetic fallacy you committed. And talking about religious discrimination, who was it who said that that creationists are not credible?</p>

              <p>It is precisely your kind of stuck-up condescending view of creationists that result in atheists losing public debates with the theists. They enter the debate being wilfully ignorant of creationists arguments and end up being pummelled on the stage. After the loss they then whine and sulk about giving creationists airtime and how they regret dignifying their arguments. Sore loser attitude. And now they refuse to debate.</p>

              <p>Tcms said that truth changes. If that is not holding to the
              notion of subjective truth, then what is it? Those who hold to
              relativism do hold to a warped notion of truth, and I have already
              explained why it is so. Your failure to discern it and instead to
              confuse it with circular reasoning does not render my case against
              relativism invalid. Any bloke can cut and paste chunks of WOT on
              informal fallacies, but not everyone can identify them
              correctly.</p>
              <p>You claimed that it is circular reasoning for me to argue that
              relativism is self-defeating, yet you were unable to point out
              where the circular reasoning is. In the first place did you even
              understand the point I was making? Let me again show you how
              self-defeating relativism is. If you claim that relativism is true,
              then is it ABSOLUTELY true, or relatively true? Think hard, don’t
              just give a knee-jerk response. Can God exists and God does not
              exist be both true? Relativists say “can” and thus violate the law
              of non-contradiction. Not only did you also fail to understand the
              contradictory nature of relativism, you still erroneously think
              this is circular reasoning on my part. Wait, there’s more. You also
              failed to see how relativism has no basis to judge. If what’s true
              is true for you and what’s true is true for me, then how can anyone
              be wrong? Relativism self-destructs when it is applied onto itself
              but instead of realising the absurdity of relativism you again
              accused me of circular reasoning. Thus you can’t fault me for
              noticing that you don’t know what circular reasoning is. See
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://carm.org/refuting-relativism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://carm.org/refuting-relativism</span></span></a></p>
              <p>Yes, I affirm that objective truth does not change with time and
              you still failed to demonstrate how my statement committed the
              fallacy of affirming the consequent. Good try though, but no
              cookies. If you were born in Singapore, then one hundred years
              later the truth would still be that you were born in Singapore. So
              pray tell where’s the fallacious part?</p>
              <p>Concerning the flat earth myth, not everyone believed that the
              earth was flat. And the irony is that you failed to see within the
              wiki link you gave that there is this link <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth</span></span></a> as well. Oh and let me spoon feed you with this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://nabataea.net/flatearth.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://nabataea.net/flatearth.html</span></span></a></p>
              <p>Your refusal to accept the truth that an argument consists of a
              series of statements reflects your stubborn ego than any alleged
              “loser attitude” by me to produce evidence for something so
              self-evident. And since you refuse the less embarrassing
              alternative of self-correction and prefer to be corrected by me, so
              for what it’s worth here goes, “An argument is a connected series
              of statements or propositions, some of which are intended to
              provide support, justification or evidence for the truth of another
              statement or proposition. Arguments consist of one or
              more <em>premises</em> and a <em>conclusion</em>.” See
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/</span></span></a> <span> </span>Looks like I am not the one with the
              loser attitude.</p>
              <p>The very fact that you accused God of being cruel is already a
              moral judgement, yet now you deny that you made any judgement?
              Special pleading fallacy spotted! Not only that, you made a
              fallacious strawman argument. God was JUDGING the sin of Adam’s
              rebellion, and that meant subjecting the entire created universe to
              the curse of death. BTW, since you claim to be a parent of five
              kids (kudos to you for making govt very proud), isn’t punishment
              for wrong doing also an expression of love? And sometimes the
              consequences of punishment extends beyond the wrongdoer
              himself?</p>
              <p>Concerning chewing the cud, I was not appealing to ignorance,
              but correcting YOUR ignorance.</p>
              <p>Yes, creationists are people who believe God created. But that
              by itself does not mean that creationists are not credible. To
              claim that would be to invoke the genetic fallacy. And mind you, I
              was also talking about creationists who are also scientists. And
              then you throw out another alleged fallacy of composition, no doubt
              trying to sound impressive but perhaps without much substance.</p>
              <p>I certainly didn’t miss the personal dig that you find it easier
              on your patience to teach them, but then again it's easier to
              educate kids since you probably fare better with them being more
              impressionable and less equipped to wear you down with well-honed
              critical thinking skills. Oh, and did you know that teaching kids
              the wrong things is also very easy too?</p>
              <p>And the gay thingy? It wasn’t a red herring. As mentioned, it
              was simply another example to further illustrate a point I was
              trying to clarify with you. When I said “it’s like you saying...”
              it is not the same as saying “You said....” In any case, I wasn’t
              attributing that argument to you. I could well have mentioned “Ah
              Kow” in place of “you” and the point still remains.</p>
              <p>On what basis do you conclude that the websites I suggested were
              full of fallacious conclusions? That’s the fallacy of cavalier
              dismissal and/or the genetic fallacy you committed. And talking
              about religious discrimination, who was it who said
              that that creationists are not credible?</p>

              <p>You are confused between truth that does not change over time and practices/beliefs that do change over time. Whether Christians choose to cremate or bury a dead body is a matter of Christian liberty, the Bible makes no demands. People in the past bury their dead, but in land scarce Singapore we usually cremate. What change of truth are you talking about?</p>
              <p>Beliefs also change over time. Long ago some people BELIEVED that the earth was flat but now people no longer believe that. Did the truth change? Nope. Long ago the earth was a globe, today it is still a globe. People lacked the information then to align their beliefs to reality/truth but as we discover more about the world, we discover facts to which we may need to revise our beliefs, or what we BELIEVE to be true. But the truth never changes. Geddit?</p>

              <p>Jesus is the way to salvation. Since when is cremation ADDED onto salvation? The Bible is our authority, pray tell when is cremation taught to affect salvation? Does the Bible teach it so? Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone. You can die in 1000 ways but it does not change the truth that Jesus is the Way.</p>

              <p>Ad hominem. Spotted the your strawman(relativism), made a call and discuss it for fun.</p>

In the first place did you even understand the point I was making? Let me again show you how self-defeating relativism is. If you claim that relativism is true, then is it ABSOLUTELY true, or relatively true? Think hard, don’t just give a knee-jerk response. Can God exists and God does not exist be both true? Relativists say “can” and thus violate the law of non-contradiction. Not only did you also fail to understand the contradictory nature of relativism, you still erroneously think this is circular reasoning on my part. Wait, there’s more. You also failed to see how relativism has no basis to judge. If what’s true is true for you and what’s true is true for me, then how can anyone be wrong? Relativism self-destructs when it is applied onto itself but instead of realising the absurdity of relativism you again accused me of circular reasoning. Thus you can’t fault me for noticing that you don’t know what circular reasoning is.

              <div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br></div>

              <div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Why "not all things are relative" is true? Because "all truth is relative" is true.</div>

              <p>The only thing I am discrediting is YOUR claim to be a Christian, or that you have given thought to it and have even read the Bible and decided to leave the faith. Nothing in my exchanges with you so far has convinced me that you have ever been well educated about the faith. Your knowledge of the Bible is pathetic, and you know little about Christian apologetics. All I see is childish and immature arguments befitting of a typical village atheist. Perhaps at most all you had was mere zeal without knowledge.</p>

              Christian, or that you have given thought to it and have even read
              the Bible and decided to leave the faith. Nothing in my exchanges
              with you so far has convinced me that you have ever been well
              educated about the faith. Your knowledge of the Bible is pathetic,
              and you know little about Christian apologetics. All I see is
              childish and immature arguments befitting of a typical village
              atheist. Perhaps at most all you had was mere zeal without
              knowledge.</p>

              <p>Not true.</p>
              <p>I used to believe that God used evolution. I was wrong. I did not read the Bible as it was meant to be read. I compromised with the clear teachings of the Bible thinking that it would "help" God to look more receptive to unbelievers. I was wrong. It amounted to saying that God cannot speak clearly to us and that God cannot mean what He says, even when He is speaking simply. It also meant distrusting God's Word.</p>

              <p>Depends on what you are talking about.</p>
              <p>But I can highlight a few christian morals that are subjective.</p>
              <p>Christians say that lying is always wrong. This does not apply to every situation. Lying can sometimes be good.</p>
              <p>Christians say that jesus is the only god. This is also subjective. Not every single human being believes int hat. It also depends on many factors like what religion you were brought up in/exposed to, what religious book you have read, and your personality and culture.</p>
              <p>Christians say abortion is always wrong. Subjective again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these christian truths will/can change, and are subjective to the specific situation/individual.</p>
              <p>THey are not universal truths.</p>

              <p>Ad hominem. Spotted the your strawman(relativism), made a call and discuss it for fun.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">You claimed that it is circular reasoning for me to argue that relativism is self-defeating, yet you were unable to point out where the circular reasoning is. In the first place did you even understand the point I was making? Let me again show you how self-defeating relativism is. If you claim that relativism is true, then is it ABSOLUTELY true, or relatively true? Think hard, don’t just give a knee-jerk response. Can God exists and God does not exist be both true? Relativists say “can” and thus violate the law of non-contradiction. Not only did you also fail to understand the contradictory nature of relativism, you still erroneously think this is circular reasoning on my part. Wait, there’s more. You also failed to see how relativism has no basis to judge. If what’s true is true for you and what’s true is true for me, then how can anyone be wrong? Relativism self-destructs when it is applied onto itself but instead of realising the absurdity of relativism you again accused me of circular reasoning. Thus you can’t fault me for noticing that you don’t know what circular reasoning is.

              <ol>
              <li><span style="color: #888888;">If all truth is relative, then the statement "All truth is relative" would be absolutely true.  If it is absolutely true, then not all things are relative and the statement that "All truth is relative" is false.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If the statement of "all truth is relative"=true, then "not all things are relative"=true.</div>
              <div>Therefore, "all truth is relative"=false.</div>
              <div>Why "not all things are relative" is true? Because "all truth is relative" is true.</div>
              <div>Why "all truth is relative" is false? Because "not all things are relative" is true.</div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>The rest are either catch 22 or begging the question.... or similar to circular logic. Similar to the argument you just made above quoted.</div>
              <div>If you hadn't not taken relativism as a law that subject everyone with subjective truth, it wouldn't be difficult at all. Relativism is not a law, its a theory.</div>

God was JUDGING the sin of Adam’s rebellion, and that meant subjecting the entire created universe to the curse of death. BTW, since you claim to be a parent of five kids (kudos to you for making govt very proud), isn’t punishment for wrong doing also an expression of love? And sometimes the consequences of punishment extends beyond the wrongdoer himself?"</span></div>

              <p>I guess the other lifeforms deserved the sudden mortality. Still, does not provide Biblical support that the other lifeforms were imortal.<br>I'm not perfect but God is. Don't make the mistake to compare human rationality with God's way in reference to love.</p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">Yes, creationists are people who believe God created. But that by itself does not mean that creationists are not credible. To claim that would be to invoke the genetic fallacy. And mind you, I was also talking about creationists who are also scientists. And then you throw out another alleged fallacy of composition, no doubt trying to sound impressive but perhaps without much substance."</span></p>
              <p>They are defined as such. What other definitions are there? What else can creationist mean?  If your are referring to the scientists, scholars or whatnots, name them appropriately. The most vocal of the lot cannot represent all of them, can they? Thus moi pointing out the fallacy.</p>
              <p>Its never their origins that I despise, its the noise the vocal lot make. Should you still falsely accuse me of a genetic fallacy or a special pleading, you seemed too desperate. There were so many that I committed, but you just falsely accuse me of two. Pathetic...</p>
              <p>I was hoping your would see my intentions... but you put your self before what good you original intended to do and lost direction. </p>

              <p>If belief is that which changes, then Tcmc should be clear in her communication. In any case, since when is belief defined as subjective truth? And again you any-o-how allege a fallacy of hasty generalisation when there is none committed. Relativism = subjective truth. I suggest you brush up on your knowledge concerning what relativism is here <a href="http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism">http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism</a></p>
              <p>And you are STILL confused between what a circular reasoning is and what a self-defeating argument is. The statement "Relativism is true" is a self-defeating statement akin to saying "The truth is that there is no truth." It's like saying that you have your feet firmly planted in mid-air. And mind you, relativism is not just a theory but for many it has become a worldview. See <a href="http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism">http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism</a></p>
              <p>When there was no earth, there would be no Singapore to speak of. That's the objective truth about the existence of Singapore before earth existed. How difficult is this? Even if today Singapore is wiped off the face of the earth, the objective truth remains that (say you were born in Singapore in 1990) you were born in Singapore in 1990. And even if the whole universe vaporised, that truth is still true, it does not cease to be true, though it may cease to be relevant or meaningful with no one around to take note.</p>
              <p>Regarding the Flat Earth Myth, the only conspiracy is that concocted by the enemies of the Christian faith, who deceptively tries to cast the faith in a bad light by perpetuating a science-faith conflict.</p>
              <p>There is no intimidation on my part at all in merely pointing out that you were WRONG to stubbornly insist that an argument is a statement. How you can even claim to be not wrong is beyond comprehension. Guess it is a matter of ego here for you.</p>
              <p>Of course saying God is cruel is making a moral judgment, because the assumption is that there is something morally wrong with being cruel. If it is just a matter causing pain or suffering, then would you say the doctor is cruel in causing pain and suffering in treating a patient of cancer through chemotherapy? Of course not.</p>
              <p>I don't blame you for your lack of theological training and Bible knowledge. When God finished with Creation on Day 6 He said it was "very good". It couldn't be all "very good" when death and suffering is present then and animals are dropping dead or dying around Adam and Eve. No, the other life-forms did not deserve death at all. It wasn't anything they did but what Adam did. But that's the point I was making, sin affects everything. And God's way is higher than ours. The mistake that atheists make is to think that God must be subject to their rational view.</p>
              <p>I don't know what badger evidence you are talking about. The point is that the rock badger/hyrax/coney is an animal which the Bible classified as one that "chews the cud" using the language of appearance. Why would you consider it an insult when your ignorance is being corrected? You can't be that petty and narrow-minded yah?</p>
              <p>You are employing double standards here: you can treat all creationists as not credible but I cannot speak of creationists generally as credible? The fallacy is all yours. Are creationists making a lot of noise? Sure. And what's your problem with that? Atheists and evolutionists are making a lot of din too.</p>
              <p>Your intention, if I remember you admitted earlier, was to like a challenge and argument. Perhaps you are just being argumentative. But even so, it shows that you are a novice when it comes to critical thinking. Perhaps you were only just introduced to the world of informal fallacies but lacked the training in them, thus explaining how your confusion in recognising and identifying them.</p>

              <p>What is considered objective truth? The objectivity that something exist/s does not mean that that particular thing does not change. </p>
              <p>Reading a textbook is as subjective as reading the bible. Let say their existence is objective(non changing), the objectivity is still subjected to the perceiver interpretations and observations. The interpretations affects the observations and the observations affects the interpretation and give rise to opinions. </p>
              <p>For Christians, I observed (therefore subjective) at least 3 objective truth. God exist, Jesus saves, I sinned. Each not affecting the other in objectivity, but becomes subjective when refering them to each other. </p>

              <p>You are CONFUSED still.</p>
              <p>Objective truth is that which is true regardless of time and space and one's feelings or perceptions. It is independent of what one believes or thinks or feels. And we are not talking about whether a thing changes, but whether truth can change.</p>
              <p>And just because a reader brings to the text his personal background and prejudices/biases which may influence his interpretation, that does not mean that the objective/intended meaning of the text is absent. We have to work at it to DISCOVER the meaning, rather than to think we can decide its meaning whichever way we like.</p>
              <p>Please explain how those 3 truths you highlighted become subjective when referring to each other.</p>
