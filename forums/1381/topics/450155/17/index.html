              <p>What twisting? Dawkins rejected creation. For him life has no purpose but only pitiless indifference. Having said that, what's wrong with me asking why he bothered to get up in the morning? What difference does it make? Who cares?</p>

              <p>to say God was made from nothing still implies God was created...but just as infinity cannot be valued, eternity cannot be timed, God cannot be made...but the universe is not eternal and humans are still uncertain if the universe is infinite...the natural laws that govern the universe are neither infinite nor eternal so its not wrong to say such laws and the universe need to be made...</p>
              <p>my pt is the words ''made'' and ''created'' suggest limitations, finity, and boundaries. every matter even according to evolution will decay, rust, rot etc...every matter is limited within the realm of time and limitation...so to ask who created matter is valid but to ask who created God is not simply cos its tantamount to asking whats the value of infinity, or who limited eternity? this is the last time i am responding on this issue...Over to u, BIC!!! :)</p>

              <p>Then Buddhism should not be called a religion, but it is.</p>
              <p>Then secular humanism should not be called a religion, but it
              is. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vftonline.org/Patriarchy/definitions/humanism_religion.htm">http://vftonline.org/Patriarchy/definitions/humanism_religion.htm</a></p>
              <p>So the problem has to do with the definition of religion. It
              should not be defined narrowly anymore. A better way to determine
              whether a worldview is a religion is to look for certain
              characteristics that religions have in common. The framework set
              forth by Ninian Smart, commonly known as the <em>Seven Dimensions
              of Religion</em>, is widely accepted by anthropologists and
              researchers of religion as broadly covering the various aspects of
              religion, without focusing on things unique to specific
              religions.</p>
              <p>The seven dimensions proposed by Smart are <em>narrative,
              experiential, social, ethical, doctrinal, ritual</em> and
              <em>material</em>. Not every religion has every dimension, nor are
              they all equally important within an individual religion. Smart
              even argues that the “secularisation” of western society is
              actually a shift of focus from the doctrinal and ritual to the
              experiential.</p>

              <p>But you just told me that the bible is not a science textbook before I clarify that I posted such before in this particular thread... Double standard much? You can tell me and I don't need say the same to you even if I had the 1st say?</p>

But since when does "chewing the cud" can only mean the narrow sense as in modern day scientific understanding?</span> <span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's like you telling me that if the word "gay" appears in the Bible it must refer to homosexuals because that's what it's meant today. That would be absurd. Like I said, Scripture writers employ the language of appearance.</span></span> <span style="color: #333333;">Even Linneaus classified the rabbit as one that "chews the cud" based on OBSERVATION of physical characteristics and behaviour."</span></p>
              <p>Let me help you by repeating my simple question:</p>
              <p>Can you accept that the badger/ coney is neither a ruminant nor practises refection? <a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A5&amp;amp;version=KJV">Lev 11:5</a></p>

              <p>Count of illogical fallacy in your post: 2</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What double standards are you talking about? That the Bible is not a science textbook is something I have held to for years, and which I have mentioned before to many atheists I've debated in this forum and in other forums. It's nothing to do with WHEN you said it first here.</p>
              <p>And what false attribution are you harping about?</p>
              <p>Can you accept the fact that to the Hebrews the phrase "chewing the cud" has a broader meaning rather than the limited scientific meaning it has today? And how is my "gay" analogy a strawman? I'm simply illustrating the point that words today may take on a more limited meaning, and perhaps for words like "gay" it may even take on a new meaning!</p>

              <p>Buddhism incorporates MANY supernatural elements, spirits and deities, depending on its sect or denomination.</p>
