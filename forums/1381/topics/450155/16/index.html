              <p>I didnt even bring in atheism because its irrelevant. Atheism isnt a religion, as much as your deluded mind wants it to be.</p>

              <p>Thanks for admitting your previous theological error when you implied that being in heaven is the same as being on earth with jesus.</p>
              <p>Well, going by your religion, yes, every christian SHOULD seek death, because the bible says to seek god earnestly and yearn to be with him. The whole of christianity is about being with god and to become more like him in perfection.</p>
              <p>So isnt seeking death the best way ?</p>
              <p>If you try to give ANY reason to not die and be with god, arent you trying to delay being with god??</p>
              <p>Why would you wanna delay being with god in his FULL PRESENCE?</p>

              <p>Well, going by your religion, yes, every christian SHOULD seek death, because the bible says to seek god earnestly and yearn to be with him. The whole of christianity is about being with god and to become more like him in perfection.</p>
              <p>So isnt seeking death the best way ?</p>
              <p>If you try to give ANY reason to not die and be with god, arent you trying to delay being with god??</p>

              <p>to say God was made from nothing still implies God was created...but just as infinity cannot be valued, eternity cannot be timed, God cannot be made...but the universe is not eternal and humans are still uncertain if the universe is infinite...the natural laws that govern the universe are neither infinite nor eternal so its not wrong to say such laws and the universe need to be made...</p>
              <p>my pt is the words ''made'' and ''created'' suggest limitations, finity, and boundaries. every matter even according to evolution will decay, rust, rot etc...every matter is limited within the realm of time and limitation...so to ask who created matter is valid but to ask who created God is not simply cos its tantamount to asking whats the value of infinity, or who limited eternity? this is the last time i am responding on this issue...Over to u, BIC!!! :)</p>

              <p>Then Buddhism should not be called a religion, but it is.</p>
              <p>Then secular humanism should not be called a religion, but it is. See <a href="http://vftonline.org/Patriarchy/definitions/humanism_religion.htm">http://vftonline.org/Patriarchy/definitions/humanism_religion.htm</a></p>
              <p>So the problem has to do with the definition of religion. It should not be defined narrowly anymore. A better way to determine whether a worldview is a religion is to look for certain characteristics that religions have in common. The framework set forth by Ninian Smart, commonly known as the <em>Seven Dimensions of Religion</em>, is widely accepted by anthropologists and researchers of religion as broadly covering the various aspects of religion, without focusing on things unique to specific religions.</p>
              <p>The seven dimensions proposed by Smart are <em>narrative, experiential, social, ethical, doctrinal, ritual </em>and<em> material</em>. Not every religion has every dimension, nor are they all equally important within an individual religion. Smart even argues that the “secularisation” of western society is actually a shift of focus from the doctrinal and ritual to the experiential.</p>

              <p>Then secular humanism should not be called a religion, but it
                  is. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vftonline.org/Patriarchy/definitions/humanism_religion.htm">http://vftonline.org/Patriarchy/definitions/humanism_religion.htm</a></p>
              <p>So the problem has to do with the definition of religion. It
                  should not be defined narrowly anymore. A better way to determine
                  whether a worldview is a religion is to look for certain
                  characteristics that religions have in common. The framework set
                  forth by Ninian Smart, commonly known as the <em>Seven Dimensions
                  of Religion</em>, is widely accepted by anthropologists and
                  researchers of religion as broadly covering the various aspects of
                  religion, without focusing on things unique to specific
                  religions.</p>
              <p>The seven dimensions proposed by Smart are <em>narrative,
                  experiential, social, ethical, doctrinal, ritual</em> and
                  <em>material</em>. Not every religion has every dimension, nor are
                  they all equally important within an individual religion. Smart
                  even argues that the “secularisation” of western society is
                  actually a shift of focus from the doctrinal and ritual to the
                  experiential.</p>

              <p>You are displaying your serious lack of knowledge of other religions, AS USUAL.</p>
              <p>Buddhism incorporates MANY supernatural elements, spirits and deities, depending on its sect or denomination.</p>
              <p>So fairly speaking, Buddhism IS a religion in practice.</p>
