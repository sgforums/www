              <p>You are definitely falling very deep into myopia.</p>
              <p>Atheist do not believe in God's existence != Atheists believe in Darwin's theory of evolution. Neither does Atheists who do not believe in God's existence have to believe in any alternate forms of evolution. Read the dictionary meaning and stop drawing conclusions with assumptions that it has to be evolution. Just because it is one of the alternative theories that some atheists believe in, does not conclude all atheists are believers. Your brain can't process it because you believe there must be a cause.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Read the dog analogy again and based it against your painter theory. Atheists do not need to believe in your claims and neither are you required to believe in theirs. Paw prints does not equate to have the prints created by an invisible dog. Simple as that.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>All that you said so far are still your opinions and beliefs. You can scream and shout and whine and cry that they are truth but they are perceived truth. That means they are only true to those who see it that way. Making a claim on truth that cannot be proven will only get the following smiley:</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>As for your answer to the bad approach, is believing absolutely correct information as bad approach? Different viewpoint again. It is more like you are assuming superiority because you think you know better based on your Bible. That which you interpreted as truth and others interpreted as not-truth. You can say as much as you want, no proof of existence is as good as try to find an invisible dog.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Atheism entails? Sorry, but you are saying as if theism means other religions believe in exact information as Christianity that is one God? Some believe in multitudes of God. Are you implying that atheism means every single atheists believe in the same secular theories? Hello, you are questioning a big venn diagram contain a multitude of secular beliefs and Darwin's theory of evolution is a small part of it. Misinterpreting the dictionary? Why don't you read the description of Christian and understand why atheists do not encompass as much?</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Oh that means you have successfully refuted the point when you already say that there is no scientific proof to God's existence or non-existence?</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>1. You are definitely uninformed about what atheism is. Please go beyond dictionary definitions and actually read up on atheism and process the appropriate information. Again the test is this, do you know of an atheist who does not believe in evolution? If you can, then please also explain why he does not believe in evolution. Yes, I believe the universe has a cause and must have a cause. Is that a problem? If so, why?</p>
              <p>2. Still leaves the question unanswered. Even if you do not like the explanation of an invisible dog, that doesn't mean you go about ignoring it and pretend it doesn't need any explanation. Is that how you go about doing science?</p>
              <p>3. Well, in that case your views about my views are nothing but your own opinions and beliefs. Here's <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> to you.</p>
              <p>4. You missed the point. The bad approach refers to sidestepping the entire issue of how the paw prints got there and simply dismissing the views of others. As for me and my Bible, I am not assuming superiority, I am saying that my views are right because they are based on the Bible which is God's infallible Word. You can disagree with me of course but that will simply earn you this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>5. Why divert to theism when I was asking you if you know what atheism entails beyond the brief definitions in the dictionary? Atheists comes in all stripes and colours but they all hold to some common beliefs which I suppose you have no idea what they are. Just because the dictionary has little to say about atheism does not mean there is nothing much about atheism to say. Please step out of your little dictionary box world and read up. See <a href="http://creation.com/what-all-atheists-have-to-believe">http://creation.com/what-all-atheists-have-to-believe</a></p>
              <p>6. No scientific proof for God is not the same as saying that God does not exist. There is no scientific proof for the laws of logic either. You can't see them, smell them, touch them, hear them, put them in a test-tube and do experiments on them. Geddit?</p>

              <p>1. Yes, you are all-knowing again. I bow to your all-knowing knowledge of atheists. I am not an atheist afterall since I'm agnostic. So you are so right since you claim agnostic are atheists. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>2. Doing science, whoa, hang on dude. That's a new AV title. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>3. Glad you can. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>4. You finally caught on! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>5. Yes, the dictionary is not a good reference. I should let the teachers know that. Your creation website is the better reference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>6. Yes, you know Science. ROFLMAO. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
