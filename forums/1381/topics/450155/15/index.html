              <p>Rather it shows that you FAILED to understand what the Christian apologists are saying. The problem is that you failed to appreciate that the Bible is not a science textbook, that it was written to people who lived thousands of years ago, and many things are written using the language of appearance to the ordinary Israelite folk. Had you lived back then you would have known nuts about terms like refection or regurgitation. It's not that the Bible is errant, but that skeptics like you impose a modernised restrictive meaning of a term onto the text and then declares that it is wrong. You FAILED to understand the Bible in its own context. The rabbit/hare is being understood as an animal that "chews the cud" because what it does is very similar to what ruminants do. That's the simple answer. But then again it would not surprise me if you choose to disregard the answers given because you are not truly interested in the answer at all.</p>

              <p>5. You need to show that the flat earth belief is a PROMINENT or PREVALENT view in Christianity in order to obligate me to defend it. Question is, can you? Tough luck to ya! On the other hand, I do know of many atheists who rally behind Richard Dawkins. You are probably one of them.</p>
              <p><strong>Whether Flat Earth theory is a prominent belief in Christianity is irrelevant. It is WRITTEN EXPLICITLY and REPEATEDLY in bible scripture.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>YOU were the one who said if I I don't fully subscribe to "Dawkin's atheism" then I am not a true atheist.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>According to your other posts, you don't consider tithing to be true Christian practice. But it is a prominent practice of millions of Christians. Does that simple fact make it representative of true Christianity? Or does it make you not a true Christian?<br></strong></p>

              <p><br>After you realised that you could not show that belief in a flat earth is a prominent belief in Christianity you decide to chuck it aside as irrelevant. What a convenient cop out!</p>
              <p>You claimed that the doctrine of a flat earth written "explicitly" and "repeatedly" in the Bible. Show it then, and prove that the texts were ONLY teaching us about the physical characteristic of the planet earth and were not using metaphorical language or widely accepted idioms or figures of speech.</p>
              <p>Dawkins is as vocal an atheist as possibly can be. So I'll be surprise if you do not believe most, if not all, the things he writes about in his books. He is the No. 1 defender and proclaimer of atheism you can get today. It used to be Anthony Flew but you know lah, Anthony Flew gave up his atheism when he realised that the scientific evidence goes against it. Too bad he's dead. It would be a sell-out event if Anthony Flew and Richard Dawkins would battle it out in a public debate.</p>
              <p>Yes, I don't consider tithing to be Christian, even though millions of Christians practice it. I also don't consider the Prosperity Gospel to be Christian, even though millions of Christians believe it. But then again, millions of Christians don't believe tithing is part of the NT covenant too, and millions reject the Prosperity Gospel. And it's not about what millions of Christians practise, it's about whether what's being practiced can be justified by Scripture and proper exegesis.</p>

              <p>Address the question about lumping atheists together. How can you bind me to a prominent atheist such as Richard Dawkins or call me an untrue atheist for not following?</p>
              <p>If tithing is a prominent practice you don't follow, should you be bound to it or called an untrue Christian simply because it is prominent?</p>

Somebody needs to stand up to your arguments, no matter how Neither does the Bible teach that we should all seek to die. We are live for Christ! In fact, don't you know that Christians "die to themselves" everyday? We are called to present ourselves to God as "living sacrifices".

              <p>No one is binding you to Dawkins. But logic demands that an atheist believes in certain things, which are basically those that Dawkins wrote about. At least he is upfront about what atheism entails and implies.</p>
              <p>It is not the popularity of a practice that determines whether it is Christian, it is whether that practice is supported by Scripture properly exegeted. I am happy to be bound by the Scriptures. It is authoritative for me.</p>

              <p>Of course I can accept facts. But since when does "chewing the cud" can only mean the narrow sense as in modern day scientific understanding? It's like you telling me that if the word "gay" appears in the Bible it must refer to homosexuals because that's what it's meant today. That would be absurd. Like I said, Scripture writers employ the language of appearance. Even Linneaus classified the rabbit as one that "chews the cud" based on OBSERVATION of physical characteristics and behaviour.</p>

              <p>2. when a manufacturer produces faulty products, do you blame the manufacturer or the product? Moreover, the manufacturer (in this case god) KNEW that he was producing products that would go faulty.</p>

              <p>you will never understand xtian beliefs, however how incoherent and illogical they are.</p>
              <p>to me it doesnt make any sense. karl marx is spot on to say, religion is an opiate is very true.opium is addictive and harmful, but people still enjoy and addicted to it in the older days.</p>

              <p>In fact I wish you a long life here. For every person a Christian manages to convert, there are others who will be turned off. Your posts are a monument to flawed logic and serve this purpose nicely.</p>

              <p>Then I am in good company. When Paul preached to the folks in Athens he started from Creation and then to the Cross. Many mocked and scoffed (like many here in this forum) but a FEW believed. While the Bible teaches that Christ died to save all it also teaches that not all want to be saved. For wide is the gate to destruction and narrow is the door to life.</p>

              <p>I already said this a few times, the issue of being omniscient and omnipotent.</p>
              <p>same with SATAN. so does god know that lucifer will betray him and yet he created<br>lucifer, knowingly lucifer will betray and become SATAN. so whose fault is this? none other than the creator isnt it. same with the paradox of creating something god cant lift?</p>
