              <p>The Bible does not teach any Zeus-like figure being responsible for casting lightning. But God is responsible in the sense that in creation week He established the laws of nature. And mind you, it was the Biblical worldview that paved the way for modern science and did away with superstitious ideas. Had it not been Christians like Michael Faraday who knows you may still be believing in Zeus today!

              <p>Yes, I agree with you that humans have created many gods in their own human image. But I am not talking about such gods. I am talking about GOD, the one who created humans in His image.</p>
              <p>BTW, as an atheist please answer the question of who created humans.</p>

              <p><br>Christianity is just a broken off religion from Judaism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Judaism has it's origins in Greece.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p>The extraordinary similarity has, of course, been observed before. It is</p>
              <p>greatly to be regretted that many commentators brought baggage of their</p>
              <p>own to the debate. Hence, early Christian fathers believed that the devil had</p>
              <p>imitated Christian ritual to lead people astray. During the Reformation, the</p>
              <p>existence of Pagan ritual in the Catholic Church was one of the central</p>
              <p>complaints of Protestants – although this paper will seek to show that a</p>
              <p>fundamental similarity of doctrine with Paganism still exists in both</p>
              <p>Churches. Later Christian commentators suggested – more convincingly –</p>
              <p>that perhaps there is a very narrow range of ritual to which human beings</p>
              <p>cleave. Or else they admitted there must have been cross-contamination, but</p>
              <p>that the essentials of Christianity were untouched. Around the turn of the</p>
              <p>twentieth century, a school of ‘debunkers’ seized upon the same similarities</p>
              <p>to try to demonstrate that Jesus was a mere allegory and never existed, and</p>
              <p>that Christianity was, in fact, nothing more than a pagan sect itself. Their</p>
              <p>determination to fit this quart into a pint pot gave rise to tortuous arguments</p>
              <p>– such as attempts to equate the term ‘the Lamb of God’ with the ‘age of</p>
              <p>Aries’, and the later Christian fish symbol with the ‘age of Pisces’. With the</p>
              <p>decline of traditional Christian worship – just as the required objectivity</p>
              <p>became possible – interest has waned, and little study on the subject has</p>
              <p>been done at all in recent times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              
              <p>In this monograph, therefore, the facts are allowed to speak for</p>
              <p>themselves. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The parallels between pagan and Christian ritual are obvious,</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ritual, long after the original rationale behind it has disappeared. They also</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">tell us something about the nature of human belief, and the elements (raised</span></strong></p>

              <p><br>Christianity is just a broken off religion from Judaism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Judaism has it's origins in Greece.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: TimesNewRoman;">The extraordinary similarity has, of course, been observed before. It is</span></p>
              <p>greatly to be regretted that many commentators brought baggage of their</p>
              <p>own to the debate. Hence, early Christian fathers believed that the devil had</p>
              <p>imitated Christian ritual to lead people astray. During the Reformation, the</p>
              <p>existence of Pagan ritual in the Catholic Church was one of the central</p>
              <p>complaints of Protestants – although this paper will seek to show that a</p>
              <p>fundamental similarity of doctrine with Paganism still exists in both</p>
              <p>Churches. Later Christian commentators suggested – more convincingly –</p>
              <p>that perhaps there is a very narrow range of ritual to which human beings</p>
              <p>cleave. Or else they admitted there must have been cross-contamination, but</p>
              <p>that the essentials of Christianity were untouched. Around the turn of the</p>
              <p>twentieth century, a school of ‘debunkers’ seized upon the same similarities</p>
              <p>to try to demonstrate that Jesus was a mere allegory and never existed, and</p>
              <p>that Christianity was, in fact, nothing more than a pagan sect itself. Their</p>
              <p>determination to fit this quart into a pint pot gave rise to tortuous arguments</p>
              <p>– such as attempts to equate the term ‘the Lamb of God’ with the ‘age of</p>
              <p>Aries’, and the later Christian fish symbol with the ‘age of Pisces’. With the</p>
              <p>decline of traditional Christian worship – just as the required objectivity</p>
              <p>became possible – interest has waned, and little study on the subject has</p>
              <p>been done at all in recent times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this monograph, therefore, the facts are allowed to speak for</p>
              <p>themselves. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The parallels between pagan and Christian ritual are obvious,</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ritual, long after the original rationale behind it has disappeared. They also</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">tell us something about the nature of human belief, and the elements (raised</span></strong></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Religion has always played an important part in man's life, as it is a source of spiritual comfort in times of distress. The happenings in legends and myths represent an idealized version of the world that man hopes for the world to become, thus we always see that the monster who eats children is killed by the god or warrior in the end, proving the motto "Good Triumphs Over Evil" to be true. However, in real life, it is not necessarily true that the antagonist always meets with a bad end, while the protagonist triumphs; rather it is often the other way round! </em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Under this topic, we will explore the various customs, traditions and religions that existed during the time of the ancient civilizations. We will also see how these customs, traditions and religions still apply to the modern world today and their importance in the past as compared to the present.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">During the ancient times, religion played an important part in the lives of the people and many different types of gods were worshipped. Why was there the need of a god? What was the importance of a god?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For the Aryans of ancient India, they worshipped gods of Nature around them. This was because they could not understand or control the elements and hence, invested them with divinity and personified them For instance, Indra was the war god (thunder and rainmaker) and the most honoured of the Aryan gods. Surya was the sun god. Agni was the fire god; the power to heal, save, defend or destroy. It was a very important god, as fire was a very important element used in the sacrifice of animals. Marriages were also solemnised in the presence of fire. Male gods were dominant. There were 33 gods where there was no hierarchy. The Aryans did not ignore the unity of god; they did believe in a supreme god where all others were manifestations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Mayas believed that nature was closely related to the world of the supernatural. Thus, they worshipped many different types of gods that were too, like those of the Indians, related to nature. One example was the sun god called Kinich Ahau. They also believed that they could communicate with the gods who dwell in heaven through prayers, visions, and sacrifice. Another god of nature that they worshipped was the World Tree, which they believed was a giant blue-green tree that connected the world of humans to the supernatural world of spirits and gods. Gods were portrayed as men, women, animals, or creatures that looked like either a person or an animal. Each day, month and number was associated with a god. For example, the number 4 was associated with the sun god and the number 10 was associated with the death god. Which number do you think the rain god represented? (Answer:13) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Greek gods were important too in ancient Greece. Every god and goddess had his or her own religious festival, and there were more than sixty festival days each year. The people offered sacrifices on the altar outside the Parthenon, the largest and most splendid of the temples, before going in to pray to the goddess Athena, the patron goddess of the city. Private devotion was important, as well. Houses had their own altars where families could place offerings to the gods, hoping to receive blessings or avert punishments. Athenians also asked their gods and goddesses for advice about the future through oracles, or fortune-tellers. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Egyptians worshipped a number of gods and goddesses, most of which were believed to possess a human form, although some had the heads of birds and animals. There was Ra, the sun-god, who was believed to journey across the sky each day with the sun in a boat. There was Osiris, ruler of the underworld, who was said to judge all dead people, to determine if they would be allowed to enter the afterlife. There was the goddess Isis, wife of Osiris and mistress of magic and Horus, son of Isis and Osiris, and god of the sky. Horus was often pictured with the head of a falcon, and it was believed that he had the power to enter into the very body and soul of the pharaoh. The pharaoh was therefore a very unique being - a link between god and man. Since he was thought to communicate with the other gods, the pharaoh also served as the high priest who officiated at major religious festivals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Sumers worshipped many gods as well. The most important god was Anu, the father of all gods and the lord of heaven. There was also Enlil, the god of earth and Enki, the god of the waters. Other gods of nature included gods of the rivers and mountains, sun, moon, winds, storms, and planets. There were also personal gods. Sumerians believed that it was their duty to feed and shelter their gods and thus, built numerous temples for the gods to live in. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The ancient Chinese too, believed in gods of nature - in mountains, rivers, forests, trees and rocks. (Why do you think gods were associated with nature in the past? Hint: Consider how the occupation of most of the people in the past. How did they obtain their food?) They also worshipped the souls of dead rulers for protection and blessings. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even today, some Chinese still pray to the souls of the dead, especially to their ancestors for the same reasons as in the past: protection and blessing. Most Chinese still pray to certain gods of nature such as the earth god and Chu Jung, god of fire. In addition, the Chinese believe in other gods too, such as the god of wealth, the goddess of mercy and the god of war. The god of wealth is an important god to the present-day Chinese, especially to Chinese merchants and businessmen, as they believe that praying to the god of wealth would enable their businesses to prosper and their wealth to increase!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Gods are still worshipped in other parts of the world today as well. For instance, Indians today, who believe in Hinduism, a religion which will be covered in the next article, still worship Hindu gods such as Brahma the Creator, Shiva the Destroyer and Vishnu the Preserver </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What are the gods that the people of your country worship? What is the importance of the gods that they worship? </span></p>

The happenings in legends and myths represent an idealized version of the world that man hopes for the world to become, thus we always see that the monster who eats children is killed by the god or warrior in the end, proving the motto "Good Triumphs Over Evil" to be true. However, in real life, it is not necessarily true that the antagonist always meets with a bad end, while the protagonist triumphs; rather it is often the other way round!</em></span></p>

              <p>Think about it, the question of origins is about what happened in the past, it's history. Science is mainly about the observable present, repeated and controlled testings, collection of data and interpretation.</p>
              <p>Scientific theories about the past are not really scientific, since you CANNOT test them. Or do you have a time-machine to observe the past?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>That unbelievers go to hell is IRRELEVANT to the question of the origins of the universe. Why are you throwing red herrings all over the place?</p>
              <p>Since when is a scientific qualification required for evangelism? The Bible does not teach that. In any case, is a qualification required to talk about origins?</p>
              <p>Regarding the Galileo case, it seems that you are still perpetuating myths about what really happened.
