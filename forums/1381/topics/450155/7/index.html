              <p>Now you are abusing language and definitions here.</p>
              <p>In what sense are my postings provocative and with intent of causing maximum disruption and argument?</p>
              <p>Kiddo, this is a CHRISTIAN sub-forum. My postings are to stimulate and generate discussion, and not mean to provoke anyone. And atheists should be the least offended of all, since most of the time they are on the offense against the religious folks.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you don't have to be here if you do not wish to. As it is, it is your postings and those of your ilk who are causing maximum disruption and argument. Just look at your red herrings and irrelevant elephant hurling tactics.</p>
              <p>Your analogy of my 6 questions is both irrelevant and redundant, not to mention absurd. If your atheism fails to answer the questions, just admit the bankruptcy of your worldview instead of whining about the questions.</p>

              <p>Many times, as Christians, we find ourselves on the defensive
              against the critiques and questions of atheists. These
              questions, then, are meant to be a part of a
              conversation. They are not, in and of themselves, arguments or
              "proofs" for God.  They are commonly asked existential or
              experiential questions that both atheists and theists alike can
              ponder. <br> <br> <strong>1</strong>.    <strong>If there is no God,
              “the big questions” remain unanswered</strong>, so how do we answer
              the following questions: Why is there something rather than
              nothing?  Why is there conscious, intelligent life on this
              planet, and is there any meaning to this life?  If there is
              meaning, what kind of meaning and how is it found?  Does human
              history lead anywhere, or is it all in vain since death is merely
              the end?  How do you come to understand good and evil, right
              and wrong without a transcendent signifier?  If these concepts
              are merely social constructions, or human opinions, whose opinion
              does one trust in determining what is good or bad, right or
              wrong?  If you are content within atheism, what circumstances
              would serve to make you open to other answers?</p>
              <p><strong>2</strong>.    <strong>If we reject the
              existence of God, we are left with a crisis of meaning</strong>, so
              why don’t we see more atheists like Jean Paul Sartre, or Friedrich
              Nietzsche, or Michel Foucault?  These three philosophers, who
              also embraced atheism, recognized that in the absence of God, there
              was no transcendent meaning beyond one’s own self-interests,
              pleasures, or tastes.  Without God, there is a crisis of
              meaning, and these three thinkers, among others, show us a world of
              just stuff, thrown out into space and time, going nowhere, meaning
              nothing.</p>
              <p><strong>3</strong>.    <strong>When people have
              embraced atheism, the historical results can be horrific</strong>,
              as in the regimes of Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot who saw religion as
              the problem and worked to eradicate it.  In other words, what
              set of actions are consistent with particular belief
              commitments?  It could be argued, that these behaviors – of
              the regimes in question - are more consistent with the implications
              of atheism.  Though, I'm thankful that many of the atheists I
              know do not live the implications of these beliefs out for
              themselves like others did!  It could be argued that the
              socio-political ideologies could very well be the outworking of a
              particular set of beliefs – beliefs that posited the ideal state as
              an atheistic one.     </p>
              <p><strong>4</strong>.    <strong>If there is no
              God, the problems of evil and suffering are in no way
              solved,</strong> so where is the hope of redemption, or meaning for
              those who suffer?  Suffering is just as tragic, if not more
              so, without God because there is no hope of ultimate justice, or of
              the suffering being rendered meaningful or transcendent, redemptive
              or redeemable.  It might be true that there is no God to blame
              now, but neither is there a God to reach out to for strength,
              transcendent meaning, or comfort.  Why would we seek the
              alleviation of suffering without objective morality grounded in a
              God of justice?</p>
              <p><strong>5</strong>.    <strong>If there is no
              God, we lose the very standard by which we critique religions and
              religious people,</strong> so whose opinion matters most? 
              Whose voice will be heard?  Whose tastes or preferences will
              be honored?  In the long run, human tastes and opinions have
              no more weight than we give them, and who are we to give them
              meaning anyway?  Who is to say that lying, or cheating or
              adultery or child molestation are wrong –really wrong?  Where
              do those standards come from?  Sure, our societies might make
              these things “illegal” and impose penalties or consequences for
              things that are not socially acceptable, but human cultures have at
              various times legally or socially disapproved of everything from
              believing in God to believing the world revolves around the sun;
              from slavery, to interracial marriage, from polygamy to
              monogamy.  Human taste, opinion law and culture are hardly
              dependable arbiters of Truth.</p>
              <p><strong>6</strong>.    <strong>If there is no
              God, we don’t make sense,</strong> so how do we explain human
              longings and desire for the transcendent?  How do we even
              explain human questions for meaning and purpose, or inner thoughts
              like, why do I feel unfulfilled or empty?  Why do we hunger
              for the spiritual, and how do we explain these longings if nothing
              can exist beyond the material world? </p>
              <p>I am submitting the above questions for serious discussion,
              dialogue and debate. No trolls please.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;">I honestly don't care. Moral views are that of the individual's. One man's wine is another man's poison.

It is only the amount of people that support one opinion/view that makes it stronger. No more, no less. And that is why different people from different parts of the world have different opinions about different things. Why is abortion illegal in some countries but legal in others? It is all because the respective culture in that country permits or disallows that. It is as simple as that. In the same logic, if that is what you say, how can you be so certain that God speaks the Truth and nothing but the Truth? Standards are derived from values. Different people have different values. Other people can have different values from me. I respect that. But if they don't respect me for what I value, then I don't care about them. It is as simple as that.</p>

In the same token, if there was also a God, why would the supreme being not make us all believe in its existence? And not everyone hungers for the spiritual. For me, if nothing exists beyond the material world, then so be it. If there lies something, then so be it.</p>

But NTLM, that I believe in. For the Christians I thus ask, why is there redemption when an action does not beget a reaction?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;"><em><strong>5</strong>.    <strong>If there is no God, we lose the very standard by which we critique religions and religious people,</strong> so whose opinion matters most?  Whose voice will be heard?  Whose tastes or preferences will be honored?  In the long run, human tastes and opinions have no more weight than we give them, and who are we to give them meaning anyway?  Who is to say that lying, or cheating or adultery or child molestation are wrong –really wrong?  Where do those standards come from?  Sure, our societies might make these things “illegal” and impose penalties or consequences for things that are not socially acceptable, but human cultures have at various times legally or socially disapproved of everything from believing in God to believing the world revolves around the sun; from slavery, to interracial marriage, from polygamy to monogamy.  Human taste, opinion law and culture are hardly dependable arbiters of Truth.</em></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;">Whose opinions matter most? Everyone has one opinion, and that of his/her very own. It is only the amount of people that support one opinion/view that makes it stronger. No more, no less. And that is why different people from different parts of the world have different opinions about different things. Why is abortion illegal in some countries but legal in others? It is all because the respective culture in that country permits or disallows that. It is as simple as that. In the same logic, if that is what you say, how can you be so certain that God speaks the Truth and nothing but the Truth? Standards are derived from values. Different people have different values. Other people can have different values from me. I respect that. But if they don't respect me for what I value, then I don't care about them. It is as simple as that.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;"><em><strong>6</strong>.    <strong>If there is no God, we don’t make sense,</strong> so how do we explain human longings and desire for the transcendent?  How do we even explain human questions for meaning and purpose, or inner thoughts like, why do I feel unfulfilled or empty?  Why do we hunger for the spiritual, and how do we explain these longings if nothing can exist beyond the material world? </em></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px;">We don't make sense? Why so? In the same token, if there was also a God, why would the supreme being not make us all believe in its existence? And not everyone hungers for the spiritual. For me, if nothing exists beyond the material world, then so be it. If there lies something, then so be it.</p>

              <p>Thank you for taking the time to tackle the six questions. I understand that you do not need a reply from me, but nevertheless I would like to respond to them. You can leave it as that if you wish. Let's take a look at them.</p>
              <p>1. I hope you are not confused between apathy and argument. Yes, something exists, we all know that. Question is why? Saying "I don't care" is not answering the question at all. Perhaps it shows that atheism supplies no answer.</p>
              <p>2. As an atheist you necessarily affirm that life is without meaning, though you did not demonstrate that life is indeed without meaning. And it seems to go against human experience that seeks meaning in life. So why do you bother with anything at all? Or are you suggesting that we should all live a hedonistic and nihilistic lifestyle? Do you really not care for material needs?</p>
              <p>3. If atheism is true, then one cannot judge that what atheist regimes have done is wrong or evil. But if theism is true, then one has a basis to call it evil or wrong. In any case, it is to point out that atheists should not be too quick to point out the evil done in the name of religion when much worse atrocities have been done in the name of atheism.</p>
              <p>4. Newton believed in a Creator. The laws of Newton are based on the notion that God has set in placed regularities in nature. But you should not confuse physical laws of motion with moral laws for living. Physical laws do not give rise to moral laws. To do so would be to commit the is-ought fallacy. For the Christian redemption is needed because we are all sinners.</p>
              <p>5. Your response to this question demonstrates the problem highlighted in the question! Thus at the end of the day you can only resort to might makes right. But do you think this is right? I hope not.</p>
              <p>6. If there is no God, then life is just a random accident. What meaning do you perceive in random accidents? God made us free-willed beings, which is why you can choose to reject Him. God did not want to make us robots. BTW, everyone hungers for the spiritual. But many SUPPRESSES that hunger and chase after transcient things to fill that void. And how certain are you that there is nothing beyond the material world? Can you prove that matter is all there is?</p>
