              <p>tcmc,</p>
              <p>this i have clarified wif pastors and christians. on their behalf, i apologise for using the word ''false'' which led to the misunderstanding...u must understand tat to christians, God is defined as the Creator along wif other things...so based on tat definition and believing that theres is only One creator which is the christian God, any other gods will be deemed as ''false''...false in the sense tat these gods are not the creator...</p>
              <p>i modified the qn further by asking...wad if i define God as simply meaning higher being, would they still say all other gods are false and guess wad? the answer is no!!! as usual, u can choose to say i am lying or choose to doubt tat i am telling the truth since i cun provide evidence tat i have done my clarification...but this sth i noe i have done personally and the answer i got was satisfactory...</p>

              <p>who said Buddha is a god.</p>
              <p>Buddha was not a god, never claimed to be a god, and did not
              call himself a god. He lived his life like a nor mall human He was
              awake and a human just like you and me, he bled, got sick and he he
              died of food poisoning. A god would not die from food
              poisoning.<br> --- Yes Buddha never claimed himself as a god, but he was a great
              teacher..., he is a human yet not an ordinary human, he reached the
              enlightenment, a maximum knowledge.. has neutral condition of
              anything around... he understood more than us could expected , the
              only way you can reached by practice meditation...<br> if you ever meet dhamma (buddha's teaching), then you have found a
              priceless, extraordinary diamond... , you can find out by yourself,
              why buddha is so special ... whatever your belief, you still can
              accept dhamma, because dhamma is truth .. valuable life
              knowledge... with loving based teaching, if you don't like it then
              you can leave it immediately..<br> ~When asked if he were a God, Buddha said No. "Then, teacher, what
              are you?" to which he replied... "Awake!"<br> So the Buddha is not a God He is a teacher of all the things he
              learnt in his life.<br> But one more thing a normall human would just die as we know but
              when the Buddha died he met his enlightenment.<br> No, Buddha is not a God. Buddha was a man named Siddharta Gautama,
              who was the first person to receive <em>enlightenment</em>, or
              <em>nirvana</em>...</p>

              <p>THink no one said hes god here.</p>
              <p>We are just saying buddhism has supernatural elements in it, like gods, spirits , depending on the sect and denomination.</p>
              <p>So it qualifies to be a religion.</p>

              <p>You really missed the point about the use of the language of appearance, and merely trying to impose a modern restrictive meaning onto the text. In short, you just disregard the answer. Nothing in the website says that coneys or rabbits are ruminants. It only says that the term "chewing the cud" has been used on rabbits because that's what they would seem to do when observed by the Hebrew folks.</p>

              <p>We are just saying buddhism has supernatural elements in it, like gods, spirits , depending on the sect and denomination.</p>
              <p>So it qualifies to be a religion.</p>

              <p>the supernatural and the deities were mixed with the folks religion in China, Tibet  when it was transmitted from India. Sure India has a lot of god religions, about 300 plus when Buddha was alive, but Buddha has rejected the concept of a creator god. Buddhism has some similarities with Hinduism, which has existed in India for about 5000 years, but their teachings differ. Shiva, Brahma, part of the trinity in Hinduism, but Buddha was never a god. even their  teachings on karma also differs in its meanings.</p>

              <p>You seem confused about what is an ad hominem argument. It is to bypass the argument to attack the person. I am thus not guilty of that because I actually explain where Tcmc's error lies.</p>
              <p>And please explain why you think I committed the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Don't just drop names of fallacies if you are not sure how to use them.</p>
              <p>An argument is either sound or unsound. A statement by itself is usually not treated as logically sound or unsound, unless that statement is crafted in such a way as to become an argument. So you need premises which leads to the right conclusion.</p>

              <p>I thought I already answered that. I reproduce again the answer
                  from the website.</p>
              <p><strong>In modern English, animals that ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ are
                  called <em>ruminants</em>.</strong> They hardly chew their food
                  when first eaten, but swallow it into a special stomach where the
                  food is partially digested. Then it is regurgitated, chewed again,
                  and swallowed into a different stomach. Animals which do this
                  include cows, sheep and goats, and they all have four stomachs.
                  <strong>Coneys and rabbits are not ruminants in this modern
                  sense.</strong></p>
              <p>However, the Hebrew phrase for ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ simply means
                  ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">raising up what has
                  been swallowed</span></span>’. <strong>Coneys and rabbits go
                  through such similar motions to ruminants</strong> that Linnaeus,
                  the father of modern classification (and a creationist), at first
                  classified them as ruminants. Also, rabbits and hares practise
                  <em>refection</em>, which is essentially the same principle as
                  rumination, and does indeed ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">raise up what has been swallowed</span></span>’.
                  The food goes right through the rabbit and is passed out as a
                  special type of dropping. These are re-eaten, and can now nourish
                  the rabbit as they have already been partly digested.</p>
              <p><strong>It is not an error of Scripture that ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chewing the cud</span></span>’ now
                  has a more restrictive meaning than it did in Moses’ day. Indeed,
                  rabbits and hares <em>do</em> ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ in an even more
                  specific sense.</strong> Once again, the Bible is right and the
                  sceptics are wrong.</p>
              <p>God, through Moses, was giving instructions that any Israelite
                  could follow. It is inconceivable that someone familiar with
                  Middle-Eastern animal life would make an easily corrected mistake
                  about rabbits, and also inconceivable that the Israelites would
                  have accepted a book as Scripture if it were contrary to
                  observation, which it is not.</p>
              <p>I still don't quite get your double-standard point.</p>
              <p>Again, what false attribution? Add some details can?</p>
              <p>Dude, I said not restrictive meaning, it does not mean unlimited
                  meaning lah! Fallacy count start for you?</p>
              <p>For my "gay" analogy I used the conditional "IF". Anyway, the
                  word "gay" does appear in the KJV in James 2:3. Does that mean you
                  reduce my fallacy count by 1. Actually I think you should reduce it
                  by 2.</p>
              <p>Anyway, would you like the challenge of counting fallacies
                  committed by atheists? I'm sure you would find it easier to
                  count.</p>

              Food for thought: why is it that we can communicate to each other and employ laws of logic in our reasoning? How does atheism account for the existence of the laws of logic and our ability to communicate, bearing in mind that atheism holds that are evolved pondscum that came from nonliving mattee?

                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">I thought I
                  already answered that. I reproduce again the answer from the
                  website.</span></p>
                  <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">
                  <strong>In modern English, animals that â€˜<span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span>â€™ are
                  called <em>ruminants</em>.</strong> They hardly chew
                  their food when first eaten, but swallow it into a special stomach
                  where the food is partially digested. Then it is regurgitated,
                  chewed again, and swallowed into a different stomach. Animals which
                  do this include cows, sheep and goats, and they all have four
                  stomachs. <strong>Coneys and rabbits are not ruminants in this
                  modern sense.</strong></p>
                  <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">
                  However, the Hebrew phrase for â€˜<span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew
                  the cud</span>â€™ simply means â€˜<span style="color: #2a1d66;">raising
                  up what has been swallowed</span>â€™. <strong>Coneys and rabbits
                  go through such similar motions to ruminants</strong> that
                  Linnaeus, the father of modern classification (and a creationist),
                  at first classified them as ruminants. Also, rabbits and hares
                  practise <em>refection</em>, which is essentially the same
                  principle as rumination, and does indeed â€˜<span style="color: #2a1d66;">raise up what has been swallowed</span>â€™. The
                  food goes right through the rabbit and is passed out as a special
                  type of dropping. These are re-eaten, and can now nourish the
                  rabbit as they have already been partly digested.</p>
                  <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">
                  <strong>It is not an error of Scripture that â€˜<span style="color: #2a1d66;">chewing the cud</span>â€™ now has a more
                  restrictive meaning than it did in Mosesâ€™ day. Indeed, rabbits and
                  hares <em>do</em>â€˜<span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the
                  cud</span>â€™ in an even more specific sense.</strong> Once
                  again, the Bible is right and the sceptics are wrong."</p>
                  <p>You thought I think who confirm? I'll repeat my simple question
                  again:  So coneys refect or don't? Can you explain it the same
                  way as the rabbit?</p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">I still don't
                  quite get your double-standard point."  - </span>I'm
                  saying you have double standard on your posts and the other users
                  here. </p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Again, what
                  false attribution? Add some details can?" </span>- What does
                  creationists have to do with our discussions on ruminants and
                  refection?</p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Dude, I said
                  not restrictive meaning, it does not mean unlimited meaning lah!
                  Fallacy count start for you?" </span>-  You said
                  "...limited scientific meaning...". Things are either limited or
                  not. They are mutually exclusive. What fallacy did you think I
                  commit? Name and list like I do if you can... which I doubt.</p>
                  <p>:<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">For my "gay"
                  analogy I used the conditional "IF". Anyway, the word "gay" does
                  appear in the KJV in James 2:3. Does that mean you reduce my
                  fallacy count by 1. Actually I think you should reduce it by 2. -
                  Y</span>ou said "<span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">It's

                  is strawmaning.... </p>

                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Anyway, would
                  you like the challenge of counting fallacies committed by atheists?
                  I'm sure you would find it easier to count."
                  - </span> Yes its easier to count just because its
                  lesser. Glad that we agree on something....</p>

                  <p>Coneys and rabbits are very similar, if not the same. So what's your point? See http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney#section_2 
                  
                  </p><p>Yes I know you are accusing me of double standards. I am asking you WHY you say that. Based on what?
                  
                  </p><p>Creationists have answered that question about chewing the cud, so why would it be false to give credit to them?
                  
                  </p><p>Your English got problem. The point is not to argue what is the opposite of limited, but the context is saying that chewing the cud has a broader meaning to the Hebrews and applied to the rabbit even in today's scientifically minded use it would exclude the rabbit.
                  
                  </p><p>And you failed to understand what is a strawman argument.
                  
                  </p><p>So how many fallacies have you spotted that were committed by atheists? List a few if you can? Let me know if you need help ya?

              <p>You fail to stand in the shoes of christians who lived hundreds of years ago. To them, cremation is wrong and the truth was to bury. To them , the truth was cremation would prevent them from being resurrected, and cremation was considered a sin .</p>
              <p>You are totally ignorant and self-centred, only thinking about your form of modern christianity.</p>
              <p>Similary, christians 50 years ago believed in truth that christian rock music or any rock music is satanic and will lead christians to hell.</p>
              <p>Of course now, these truths have changed.</p>
