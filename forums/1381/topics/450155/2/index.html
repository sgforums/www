              <p>I spot a red herring. Anyway, Hitler may not have been an atheist but it would be a worst lie to claim that Hitler was a true Christian. Besides, the point wasn't whether Hitler was an atheist, but that millions died in atheistic regimes.</p>

              <p>Please understand that I am not saying that atheists have no
                  morals. This is a common mistake that atheist make when they
                  encounter our argument. It's a knee-jerk reaction along the lines
                  of "How dare you say I have no morals! I am morally better than
                  that Christian jerk who just stole something from the CD shop!"</p>
              <p>Please read carefully what I wrote. I am saying that the atheist
                  have NO BASIS for objective moral values. Can you explain what is
                  the source of your moral values? Your parents? What the government
                  says? What society at large says? Or is it the evolutionary

                  who choose not to believe, or to compel people into belief.</p>

              <p>Why do you ask summer if she is happy?</p>
              <p>We are not talking about whether atheism is good or bad, but true or false. Her evidence is consistent with the atheist claim.</p>
              <p>(If there is a good God, going by the mix of good and bad in the world, I would conclude he is locked in battle with an evil demon of equal power. When the demon has the upper hand, there's world war or the bubonic plague. He gets beaten down but never defeated completely.)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The point is not how you feel about the facts, good or bad, but what they are</span>.</p>
              <p>This brings me to a point made by Bertrand Russel in the passage "Why I am not a Christian".</p>
              <p>He challenged the proposition that the world and universe function according to natural law as created by God. He distinguished between two views of "law".</p>
              <p>The Christian view of natural law takes the form of judicial law: laws are behests to do or abstain from doing certain things. Eg. God gave the planets a behest to move a certain way.</p>
              <p>However, scientific laws are not behests but observations. Planets revolve and things fall down according to the forces of gravity. The observations hold true in every instance of like case. It is imaginative to think someone commanded the planets to move the way they do.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The former is how you feel about the observation, the latter is the way the observation is.</span></p>
              <p>You can't say life has to have a meaning, just because you believe it is too meaningless for life to just come and go just like that. </p>
              <p>Russel also pointed out that if natural law were designed by anyone, it would have been designed to be cruel. He pointed out the sufferings in the world and oiinted out the paradox that someone with omnipotence, omniscience and millions of years to perfect their world, could not do better.</p>

              <p>Yes you are confused. My point is that objective moral values exist because God exists. And this is why every human being is a moral being with a conscience, knowing right from wrong. Atheism does not supply the basis for why objective moral values exist.</p>
              <p>How do chemicals give you any ability to discern and think? You have yet to explain that. How do you know chemicals give you the ability? How do you know that is true? On what basis?</p>

              <p>We are not talking about whether atheism is good or bad, but true or false. Her evidence is consistent with the atheist claim.</p>
              <p>(If there is a good God, going by the mix of good and bad in the world, I would conclude he is locked in battle with an evil demon of equal power. When the demon has the upper hand, there's world war or the bubonic plague. He gets beaten down but never defeated completely.)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The point is not how you feel about the facts, good or bad, but what they are</span>.</p>
              <p>This brings me to a point made by Bertrand Russel in the passage "Why I am not a Christian".</p>
              <p>He challenged the proposition that the world and universe function according to natural law as created by God. He distinguished between two views of "law".</p>
              <p>The Christian view of natural law takes the form of judicial law: laws are behests to do or abstain from doing certain things. Eg. God gave the planets a behest to move a certain way.</p>
              <p>However, scientific laws are not behests but observations. Planets revolve and things fall down according to the forces of gravity. The observations hold true in every instance of like case. It is imaginative to think someone commanded the planets to move the way they do.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The former is how you feel about the observation, the latter is the way the observation is.</span></p>
              <p>You can't say life has to have a meaning, just because you believe it is too meaningless for life to just come and go just like that. </p>
              <p>Russel also pointed out that if natural law were designed by anyone, it would have been designed to be cruel. He pointed out the sufferings in the world and oiinted out the paradox that someone with omnipotence, omniscience and millions of years to perfect their world, could not do better.</p>

              <p>It was a rhetorical question. Only a person without a conscience would be happy at that. But if you think somehow that this is a world gone wrong, then you are right. And this is precisely what the Bible teaches! What Bertrand Russell, and all atheists who parrot his thoughts, missed is that the Bible teaches a perfect original creation that was later marred by Adam's sin and rebellion. We now live in a fallen cursed world. So when atheists complain about suffering and death and evil, they ask how this reflect a God of love, but they deliberately forget that the Bible does not teach that God did not create the world this way. </p>

              <p>1. To think that science can answer all the questions in the first post is to misplace your confidence in science and also fail to understand the nature and limitations of the scientific method. But think about this, why can we even do science at all? Why is the universe capable of being studied and understood by humans? Again only the theist has the answer. It is because God made the universe and endowed us with the rational faculties needed to explore His creation.</p>
              <p>2. The point is that if God does not exist, then there is no meaning in life. This is what atheists like Dawkins has conceded, if you have read some of his works. You insisted that you can still live a meaningful life. But why even bother? Why seek meaning in a meaningless world according to atheism? That's rather inconsistent, isn't it?</p>
              <p>3. You missed the point here. I am not denying that horrors have taken place in the name of religion. What I am pointing out is that atheism should look back at their fruit in the last century alone before pointing fingers at religion. Fact is, atheism is every bit as religious!</p>
              <p>4. Indeed, as an atheist the idea of fairness is moot. There is no such thing. If you suffer and die that's just it. If you were a victim of a murderer, that's just too bad. He's fitter than you. You did not survive his attack you are not fit. That's atheism for you. There is no justice, no fairness, no righting of any wrong. But of course in reality you don't live like this at all. Which is why I argue that atheism is not the right worldview to hold. Atheists are notoriously inconsistent.</p>
              <p>5. Let me explain clearer. Whenever atheists tries to argue a moral point, they will fail. Simply because apart from objective moral values which presupposes a moral lawgiver, there is no standard of morality to judge, no standard of right or wrong. Only might counts. If something is good or true in your eyes, that's just your opinion. You can't insist that you are right.</p>
              <p>6. You missed the point. The point is that if God does not exist, then nothing makes sense at all. There is no meaning in chemicals simply jostling around in our brains. There is no meaning in chance random processes. In atheism nothing ought to make sense because matter is all there is. No soul, no spirit, no God, no morals etc. And the fact is, atheists do not live like that at all. Again this is because they BORROW their values from theism, but then suppress that knowledge in denial.</p>

You may think rationally, I hope, but why the writers of the bible made so many silly errors ? [No need for me to list down.. can google] This make christianity look so bad. </p>
              <p>You sound as if atheist has a wasted life. No soul no spirit no moral. Are you taunting or feeling sad for atheist? Why cannot atheist and theist agree on a moral point ? Is theist belong to educated class of people? Why can't you trust on atheist's point of view ? You belong in a higher class?</p>
              <p>"...There is no justice, no fairness, no righting of any wrong...." This is happening in real life. A lady ran over by a bus recently. What can you do ? The life is gone, so what getting the driver to pay for his crime? I bet you theist will believe if this lady has a religion, she will now in a nice place with her god. This is fairness if you will. To atheist, this is delusional. Wake up.</p>

              <p>This thread is not for discussing alleged errors in the Bible. Neither is this thread arguing that the Christian is superior to the atheist. In any case, the charge of elitism falls on the atheist who takes pride that he is intellectually superior to whom he called the delusional religious folks. Not only that the atheists also call themselves the Brights to insinuate that religious people the dimwitted or dull minded. So if anyone is guilty of taunting the other it would be the atheist.</p>
              <p>Yes bad things happen. People commit offences, but it only makes sense to hold people responsible if there are objective moral values. It is wrong to take away another life because man is made in the image of God. And we feel angered because we are created as moral beings. It makes sense to have moral outrage in a theistic worldview. But an atheistic worldview does not offer any basis for moral judgement at all. If an atheist is making any moral judgement he is doing so not because of his atheistic worldview but in spite of it. He is actually exercising his God-given moral faculties but at the same time suppressing or denying God as Creator. But God is not any less God just because the atheist refuses to acknowledge Him.</p>

              <p>BIC started this questionaire thread for one purpose. To show that theist can have moral judgement by making use of god-given ability. Atheist thinks and discerns on matter using chemicals in the body, that he thinks it is not possible. Atheist is suppressing god-given ability and live in denial.</p>
              <p>I urge BIC not to think so simply on this issue using his god-given power. Thinking and discerning making need more than chemical in the body. The world is more complicated than reading a bible and believing. I do not live in denial, and hope that god appear before me. Then I will believe religion.</p>
