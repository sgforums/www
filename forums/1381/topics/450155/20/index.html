              <p>Sorry but it seems that you are STILL confused about what is an ad hominem argument. I have explained where Tcmc's reasoning error lies in, that's the difference. It's not about pointing a negative, it's about attacking the person but not the argument. An ad homimem simply sidestep interacting with the argument and attack the person, kind of what you are really doing now.</p>
              <p>You also failed to understand the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Anyway, you are confused. I was talking about objective truths which does not change. If it rained on 1 May 2012, then it did. 1000 years later this would still be the truth. Truth by definition is objective.</p>
              <p>You are also confused as to what is a statement. A statement is NOT an argument. It is often a claim or proposition which can be disputed, treated as true or false, but by itself you don't call it sound or unsound. The premise I took was that if you claim lack of evidence, then the conclusion follows that you cannot declare there is no God.</p>

Else its just as subjective as anything else.  For you benefit, you claimed <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"What is true now cannot be false tomorrow." </span>On the  premise that Tcmc was arguing, your arguments seemed to  be claiming something like <em>the earth was flat some donkey years ago = true , therefore the earth is flat today = true. </em>Just to let you know this is not saying you did claim so... <strong style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Objectivity</strong><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> is a central </span><a style="color: #0b0080; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;" title="Philosophy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophical</a><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> concept which has been variously defined by sources. A proposition is generally considered to be objectively true when its truth conditions are met and are "mind-independent"—that is, not met by the judgment of a conscious entity or subject.</span></p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You are also confused as to what is a statement. A statement is NOT an argument. It is often a claim or proposition which can be disputed, treated as true or false, but by itself you don't call it sound or unsound. The premise I took was that if you claim lack of evidence, then the conclusion follows that you cannot declare there is no God."</span></p>
                  <p>An argument <strong>IS</strong> a statement. Rhetorics aside, all claims, propositions, arguments and even opinions are statements...no less. And the premise he/ she took was if one is lack of evidence, one cannot claim existence.</p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Try to catch up with the line of reasoning please."</span></p>
                  <p>Redundundant appeal to ridicule... I'm not one to stoop so low.</p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">But the problem is that the atheist CANNOT account for things like truth, logic, or moral qualities like honesty."</span></p>
                  <p>There wasn't any problem to begin with... even if your above claim was true.</p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">It is not a red herring at all. Coneys and rabbits are belonging to the same kind. You would be missing the point if you wish to split hair on this."</span></p>
                  <p>You can add dogs and rats into the list as they behave the same... in reference to refecting. The point now is you are saying that Lev 11:5 and 6 is describing the same animals by the way, which makes no sense to me.</p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">There is no double standard involved when I am telling you that I already know that the Bible is not a science textbook. I am simply saying that you are not telling me something that I already don't hold to. That's all."</span></p>
                  <p>You exact words... "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I don't need you to tell me that the Bible is not a science textbook. Creationists by and large already know that." </span>is basically telling me to shut up since the creationists already know that... but others cannot have the priviledge to tell you the same.</p>
                  <p> "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">To say that creationists are not credible in their answers is to commit the genetic fallacy. You may wish to make a count of your fallacies I point out."</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">The </span><strong style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">genetic fallacy</strong><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> is a </span><a style="color: #0b0080; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;" title="Ignoratio elenchi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi">fallacy of irrelevance</a><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> where a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">origin</span></strong> rather than its current meaning or context. This overlooks any difference to be found in the present situation, typically transferring the positive or negative esteem from the earlier context.</span></p>
                  <p>This is false accusation... I based my aguments questioning their credibilty rather than origins... Try harder...</p>
                  <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I was using the "gay" analogy as another example. I did not say you made that claim. Why you ignore the word "IF"?</span>"</p>
                  <p>Subtle it may seemed, its not my position at all as "gay" can mean sexual preference to elation... "chewer of the cud" however refers to behaviours/ practise only.</p>
                  <p>'<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And I understand your reluctance to count the fallacies committed by your fellow atheists. You would not wish to antagonise them by agreeing with me."</span></p>
                  <p>Wrong assumption that I can't be bothered to correct... but its reflecting how you stereotype people... I'm quite saddened by this revelation...</p>

              <p>You are knocking down your own strawman argument.</p>
              <p>I am not saying that atheism comes from science. Science is the study of the world, there is nothing inherent in science that should make it the basis of atheism. Nor should doing science leads one to atheism. In fact I have pointed out before how it was the Christian worldview that provided the basis for modern science. Even secular writers have acknowledged this. Sadly many atheists refuse to come to terms with this.</p>

              <p>Let's say I entertain your contention that the universe and the laws of nature were created. How then do we verify the unverifiable parts of the bible, such as whether people used to live till 850 years old, and whether there is really an afterlife? Whether there is really a Satan or if people just sin or err out of their own imperfections?</p>

              <p>It's OK if you wish to patronise my views. But just think about it, what are the options available for you? This universe had a beginning and thus had a cause. Then either the universe was caused by something external to it, or the universe caused itself. But the latter is absurd, so you are only left with an external cause.</p>
              <p>Now, once we get past the point that there is a cause and that this cause is God, it becomes easy to answer the rest.</p>
              <p>Jesus said, "But if you don't believe me when I tell you about earthly things, how can you possibly believe if I tell you about heavenly things?"</p>
              <p>In short, if the earthly things in the Bible can be trusted (i.e. tested and found to be true), then we can also trust what the Bible says about heavenly things or things that cannot be directly verified. Makes sense?</p>
