              <p>Unfortunately that line of argument is not available to the atheist, since he cannot attribute anything to God, a being whose existence the atheist denies.</p>
              <p>Death and suffering is the consequence of Adam's rebellion against God, as the Bible clearly teaches. We now live in a fallen world, but a new heavens and a new earth is coming. The curse will be lifted and death will be no more. This is the living hope of those who are in Christ.</p>
              <p>But for the atheist, suffering is simply the outworkings of nature red in tooth and claw. There is nothing morally bad about suffering at all. It just is. There is no sense or meaning or purpose. Only pitiless indifference, as Dawkins so said.</p>

              <p>You did not read properly. I said that atheists knock down strawman arguments by saying that Christians said that everything has a cause. I repeat, the Christian says that everything that HAS A BEGINNING has a cause. The universe we live in has a beginning, therefore it requires a cause. Either you agree with this or you do not. I will not allow the atheist to skirt and evade the question by ask who created God (which in any case has been answered many times). If I ask you who baked the cake, is it relevant asking who is the parent of the one who baked the cake? </p>
              <p>So the question to you remains, WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE UNIVERSE? Instead of talking about many things, let's just cut to the chase and sum it up at the level of the universe.</p>
              <p>You have only TWO options as an atheist. Either the universe made itself from nothing, or it always existed. Take your pick and defend it.</p>

              <p>So the question to you remains, WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE
                                      UNIVERSE? Instead of talking about many things, let's just cut to
                                      the chase and sum it up at the level of the universe.</p>
              <p>You have only TWO options as an atheist. Either the universe
                                      made itself from nothing, or it always existed. Take your pick and
                                      defend it.</p>
              <p><strong>Nobody knows what caused the universe. To scientific thinkers the question goes unanswered. Does it mean god made it?<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>If you choose to believe a fairy tale that your God made it in 7 days, so be it. Very logical of you.</strong></p>

              <p>I just researched this. According to the bible,</p>
              <p><strong>1. </strong>Our Earth is older than the sun and the moon.</p>
              <p><strong>2. </strong>Our sun is the oldest star in the universe.</p>
              <p><strong>3.</strong> Yet light was created before the sun.<strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>4. </strong>Day and night were created earlier than the sun.</p>
              <p><strong>5.</strong> Day and night are independent of the sun.</p>
              <p><strong>6. </strong>Before all the above was created, there were only two things. Water below and darkness above.</p>
              <p><strong>7.</strong> This applied throughout the universe. Water "down" and darkness "up".  What to do, the concept of round earth was not known. Refer to day and night being independent of the sun.</p>
              <p><strong>8.</strong> I assume water was "down" because god hovered "over" the water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quoting Genesis:</p>
              <p><strong>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. </strong>Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of 
                                  the deep, and <strong>the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.</strong> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <strong>God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.”</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning—<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the first day.</span></strong> &lt;animals, plants and dry land created...&gt;</p>
              <p>And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate 
                                  the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred 
                                  times, and days and years, <sup id="en-NIV-15" class="versenum">15</sup> and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.
                                   <strong>God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the 
                                  lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. </strong>God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.  And there was evening, and there was morning—<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the fourth day. </span></strong></p>

              <p>Then we have lots in common. I also do not believe in elves and fairies, Greek gods and goddesses and many other things.</p>
              <p>So let's focus on the things we do not share in common regarding this. But really, its naturalism vs theism. What's your evidence that matter is all there is?</p>
