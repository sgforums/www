              <p><br>That's because you failed to note what is meant by objective moral values. It simply means there are certain things which are always morally wrong regardless of what or how you feel about it.</p>
              <p>I am going to support that the Bible does not teach a flat or square earth. Ignorant atheists are still desperately trying to disparage the Christian faith by falsely accusing the Bible of teaching a flat earth.

              <p>And to really rub it in, the leader of the Flat Earth Society is an evolutionist! How ironic ya? Really LOL and surely a slap in the face for evolutionists accusing creationists for flat earth beliefs. See <a href="http://www.livescience.com/14754-ingenious-flat-earth-theory-revealed-map.html">http://www.livescience.com/14754-ingenious-flat-earth-theory-revealed-map.html</a></p>

              <p>While we are talking about objective moral values, some clarification would be helpful.</p>
              <p>We should start with what objective means given the word’s versatility.<strong> In philosophy, objective refers to something independent of the human mind. The object of perception does not change with our feelings, interpretations, and prejudices. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objective moral values are therefore discovered, not invented.</span></strong> This is in stark contrast to subjective moral values which change from person to person, culture to culture, etc. If morality is objective, the next logical question to ask is: What is the mind-independent basis for objective morality and is this basis sufficiently binding? In other words, it will not do to merely show some external ground for morality and then subjectively assign value to it. Our obligation to a particular ethical system must transcend personal preference.</p>
              <p><strong>There is also the attribute of universality. This applies when the basis for objectivity is not confined to a particular time and space.</strong> Some say it is enough for moral values to apply equally to all individuals in relevantly similar circumstances. Either way, universality is predicated on objectivity for it is difficult to imagine subjective moral values applying to all people, in all places, and at all times. And of course only volitional beings can act morally. If there were no minds, there would be no morality. If all actions were compulsory, again, there would be no morality. The atheist who accepts objectivity will likely argue that morality is meaningless without man since, on their view, he is the measure of all things. The theist will probably think differently. For example, if the human race had been completely wiped out in World War II, the Holocaust would still be objectively wrong today under theism. The mind of God and His judgment persist.</p>
              <p><strong>We see in Christianity moral values have their objective and universal basis in the immutable nature of God. He neither arbitrarily created the moral law, nor is there an external moral domain in which God is subject. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moral values are, because of who God is.</span></strong> </p>
              <p>But what about those who claim that a divine basis for objective morality is problematic? Religious groups argue, disagree and fight with each other - all in the name of objective moral values handed down from on high. Even within a single religious camp there is some disagreement about what is objectively right and wrong. Who’s right in the mind of God? Well there is no easy answer! <strong>But critics confuse the epistemic problem (the knowing) with the ontological problem (the reality) and miss the point. </strong>God’s moral position on the death penalty is the correct one. Instead of sticking our heads in the sand because there is occasional disagreement, we ought to continually devote ourselves to understanding God’s position. If the God of Christianity doesn’t exist, it’s senseless to point to problems in the Church around divine commands. It would make as much sense to argue about the worldwide chimney damage caused by Santa Claus. If the Christian God does exist, focusing on the same problem is just an excuse to be negligent.</p>
              <p>So do we get to decide how binding an ethical system is regardless of its objective grounds? I suggest we do except in one and only one case. God is the exception. As the greatest conceivable being and locus of moral value, mere created man does not get to decide if His divine commands are binding. <strong>As volitional creatures, we only get to decide if we are going to obey His commands or not.</strong> In all other ethical systems you have a degree of personal preference. Subjectivity is involved if it is human flourishing, self-interest, a green planet, or that which creates the most pleasure, happiness, profit, etc. There is no universal obligation to abide by these systems. <span> </span>Some would say we have no choice but to abide by human self-interest, since we are human. But this only makes sense if man is the measure of all things. If a hyper-intelligent race of aliens were to come through our solar system and consume the entire human population like we consume cattle, would this be wrong? Who will adjudicate and on what objective basis?</p>
              <p>In conclusion; <strong>universally binding objective moral values exist if and only if God exists. Other claims of objectivity are based on subjectively assigning obligatory value to the object of perception.</strong> When we see these systems in conflict and must appeal to a higher ethic, it should raise further doubt about their status. <strong>If we live in the atheist's ecbatic universe, then there is no ultimate justice or final moral consequence. At death, all of our moral choices in life become irrelevant.</strong> Legacy doesn’t really matter as the deep sleep of non-existence dissolves time and space leaving no gap between one's death and the mass extinction of man when the universe reaches maximum entropy. But if the Christian God exists, then our relationship to Him is essential to moral obligation. If there is eternal consequence, binding duty to an objective morality is maximal.</p>

              <p>1. Your reasoning is fallacious. Not all flat earth proponents are Christians. Anyway, even if some flat earth folks believe in six day creation like I do, it doesn't follow that I therefore also believe in a flat earth like they do. You need to employ more critical thinking skills.</p>
              <p>2. You said that I am in no place to determine what is orthodoxy and what is heretical. I suppose you do then? On what basis?</p>
              <p>3. You simply say "so what?" to the fact that the leader of the FES is an evolutionist and tried to make strained distinctions. That's pretty lame. In any case I can also say "so what?" if flat earth proponents are Christians and leave it at that. Why should I be any more concerned if you are not?</p>
              <p>4. I certainly do not claim to speak for Christians everywhere but as far as I know, my beliefs are fully consistent with the major creeds which are based on Scripture. But then again, telling you that also makes little difference since you are in NO POSITION to judge or comment on it as you do not even know what Christianity is about or its doctrines and theology.</p>
              <p>5. You need to show that the flat earth belief is a PROMINENT or PREVALENT view in Christianity in order to obligate me to defend it. Question is, can you? Tough luck to ya! On the other hand, I do know of many atheists who rally behind Richard Dawkins. You are probably one of them.</p>

              <p>How is my link <a rel="nofollow" href="http://creation.com/do-rabbits-chew-their-cud">http://creation.com/do-rabbits-chew-their-cud</a> vague
              and ambiguous in its explanation? Don't just make assertions, back
              it up.</p>
              <p><strong>In modern English, animals that ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ are
              called <em>ruminants</em>.</strong> They hardly chew their food
              when first eaten, but swallow it into a special stomach where the
              food is partially digested. Then it is regurgitated, chewed again,
              and swallowed into a different stomach. Animals which do this
              include cows, sheep and goats, and they all have four stomachs.
              <strong>Coneys and rabbits are not ruminants in this modern
              sense.</strong> Obviously, rabbits do not share the digestive
              anatomy of modern ruminants. However, to describe rabbits chewing
              the cud is not incorrect. Simply stated, it is not reasonable to
              accuse a 3500-year-old document of error because it does not adhere
              to a modern man-made classification system.</p>
              <p><strong>However, the Hebrew phrase for ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ simply
              means ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">raising up what
              has been swallowed</span></span>’.</strong> Coneys and rabbits go
              through such similar motions to ruminants that Linnaeus, the father
              of modern classification (and a creationist), at first classified
              them as ruminants. Also, <strong>rabbits and hares practise
              <em>refection</em>, which is essentially the same principle as
              rumination, and does indeed ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">raise up what has been
              swallowed</span></span>’.</strong> The food goes right through the
              rabbit and is passed out as a special type of dropping. These are
              re-eaten, and can now nourish the rabbit as they have already been
              partly digested. Is this the same as cud? In the final analysis, it
              is. Cud-chewing completes the digestion of partially digested food.
              Why would it be strange to think that centuries ago, the idea of
              “cud” had a somewhat broader meaning than a modern definition.</p>
              <p>But does the rabbit actually <em>chew</em> the cud? The Hebrew
              word translated “chew” is the word <em>‘alah</em>. With any attempt
              to translate one language to another, it is understood that there
              is often more than one meaning for a given word. A cursory glace at
              any Hebrew lexicon reveals that <em>‘alah</em> can mean go up,
              ascend, climb, go up into, out of a place, depart, rise up, cause
              to ascend, bring up from, among others. Here it carries the
              implication of moving something from one place to another. So the
              phrase translated to English as “chew the cud” literally means
              something on the order of “eats that which is brought forth
              again.”</p>
              <p>So is the Bible in error here? No it is not.  It
              is not an error of Scripture that ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chewing the cud</span></span>’ now has a more
              restrictive meaning than it did in Moses’ day. Indeed, rabbits and
              hares <em>do</em> ‘<span><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ in an even more
              specific sense. Rabbits re-ingest partially digested foods, as do
              modern ruminants. They just do so without the aid of multiple
              stomach compartments. Once again, the Bible is right and the
              sceptics are wrong.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It doesn't address the fact that coneys are neither ruminants nor pratise refection, which is an observable and verifiable fact. </p>
              <p>Seeing that your are parroting the same arguments from your <a href="http://creation.com/do-rabbits-chew-their-cud">link</a> shows that you did not read the counter arguement of my <a href="http://www.theskepticalreview.com/tsrmag/4chew94.html">link</a>, or see the strawman attempts of what your link actually argue. </p>

              <p>I get your point Tcmc. You are telling me not to be here so as not to hinder you and your ilk from attacking the Christian faith. You are telling me that you do not like my opposition to your cause of converting people out of Christianity into unbelief. You are telling me that you do not like that I am refuting your arguments for unbelief.</p>
              <p>Yes, people are dying everyday. For you it's just the way life is supposed to be. Death paves the way for evolution and the rise of new species. So why grieve for those who die everyday, ya? Why mourn for them at all? For the atheist death is a good thing. Man is just evolved pond scum to you, nothing special at all.</p>
              <p>But then again, you don't really live like that at all. You do not live consistently with your beliefs at all. Even Dawkins does not like that thought. Death is not a good thing. Death destroys life and ruins things. Death is a curse. But guess what? That's exactly what the Bible tells us about death. It is an intrusion. It is an enemy. It is a curse. Again the Bible, rather than atheism, explains what needs to be explained. It tells us how death entered the world, and how God dealt with it, and how it will be gone when the end comes.</p>

              <p>5. You need to show that the flat earth belief is a
              PROMINENT or PREVALENT view in Christianity in order to obligate me
              to defend it. Question is, can you? Tough luck to ya! On the other
              hand, I do know of many atheists who rally behind Richard Dawkins.
              You are probably one of them.</p>
              <p><strong>Whether Flat Earth theory is a prominent belief in
              Christianity is irrelevant. It is WRITTEN EXPLICITLY and REPEATEDLY
              in bible scripture.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>YOU were the one who said if I I don't fully subscribe
              to "Dawkin's atheism" then I am not a true
              atheist.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>According to your other posts, you don't consider
              tithing to be true Christian practice. But it is a prominent
              practice of millions of Christians. Does that simple fact make it
              representative of true Christianity? Or does it make you not a true
              Christian?<br></strong></p>

              That's exactly what the Bible tells us about death. It is an
              intrusion. It is an enemy. It is a curse. Again the Bible, rather
              than atheism, explains what needs to be explained. It tells us how
              death entered the world, and how God dealt with it, and how it will
              be gone when the end comes.</p>

              <p>If according to your beliefs that every nonchristian ends up in
              hell, and that 2/3 of the world is nonchristians, then many people
              go to hell every day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EVery second, about 1.8 people die. Every minute, thats a 108
              people who die. 2/3 of 108 is 72. Every minute 72 nonchristians die
              and end up in hell. Every day, 103000 nonchristians die. Can you
              imagine how many nonchristians die every year O_O!</p>
              <p>And you are spending hours upon hours here, instead of trying to
              "save" more people? Now dont tell me "god" is the one who does the
              saving. Lol..</p>

And he knew that even wth his son dying, many people will still not believe because its nt convincing enough, yet he still did it....</p>
              <p>And after he did so much, KNOWING his plans will FAIL still, many people still dont buy into his plans.</p>
              <p>..? Failed?</p>
