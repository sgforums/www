              <p>So the question to you remains, WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE UNIVERSE? Instead of talking about many things, let's just cut to the chase and sum it up at the level of the universe.</p>
              <p>You have only TWO options as an atheist. Either the universe made itself from nothing, or it always existed. Take your pick and defend it.</p>
              <p><strong>Nobody knows what caused the universe. To scientific thinkers the question goes unanswered. Does it mean god made it?<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>If you choose to believe a fairy tale that your God made it in 7 days, so be it. Very logical of you.</strong></p>

              <p>Ignorance is not an answer nor an argument. In any case, if you don't know what caused the universe, how you KNOW it ain't God? It's not that the question goes unanswered, but that many scientists have ruled out God from the start. Tell me this ain't bias.</p>
              <p>And you have yet to substantiate the allegation that my belief in 6 days creation is a fairy tale.</p>
              <p>Mind you, evolutionists are the ones who believe that if you kiss a frog long enough it turns into a prince! Get my analogy?</p>

              <p>You are doubly wrong.</p>
              <p>Firstly, God created the heavens and the earth and everything in it in SIX days, not seven. This stems from your ignorance of the Bible, or failure in English comprehension.</p>
              <p>Secondly, contrary to your claim, the Christian KNOWS why God created in six days. This isn't a mystery to fathom at all. God told us why. In Exodus 20 God commanded His people to work six days and to keep the Sabbath holy. Why? Because God worked six days and rested on the seventh. It was a pattern for man to follow. And did you know that our 7 day week has no astronomical basis, unlike the day, month, or year? Only the Bible supplies the basis for that.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I just researched this. According to the bible,</p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong> Our Earth is older than the sun and the moon.</p>
              <p><strong>2.</strong> Our sun is the oldest star in the universe.</p>
              <p><strong>3.</strong> Yet light was created before the sun.<strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>4.</strong> Day and night were created earlier than the sun.</p>
              <p><strong>5.</strong> Day and night are independent of the sun.</p>
              <p><strong>6.</strong> Before all the above was created, there were only two things. Water below and darkness above.</p>
              <p><strong>7.</strong> This applied throughout the universe. Water "down" and darkness "up". What to do, the concept of round earth was not known. Refer to day and night being independent of the sun.</p>
              <p><strong>8.</strong> I assume water was "down" because god hovered "over" the water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quoting Genesis:</p>
              <p><strong>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</strong> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and <strong>the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.</strong> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <strong>God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.”</strong> And there was evening, and there was morning—<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the first day.</span></strong> &lt;animals, plants and dry land created...&gt;</p>
              <p>And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, <sup>15</sup> and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. <strong>God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.</strong> God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.  And there was evening, and there was morning—<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the fourth day.</span></strong></p>

              <p>While I commend you for taking time to read the Bible, I cannot commend you for failing to interpret it correctly. You are taking a fault-finding approach. Just a short comment should suffice.</p>
              <p>You don't need the sun to have day and night. All you need is a directional light source and a rotating earth. And the sun is not the only thing that gives out light. God is light. When Jesus was transfigured He shone brighter than the sun. God caused a temporary light source which was replaced by the sun on day four of creation week.</p>

              <p>Nope. YOU are wrong. You are still misleading people after I have refuted you on these things.</p>
              <p>The Hebrew word translated ‘bird’ is <em>‘ôwph</em>, and simply means ‘winged/flying creature’—it is derived from <em>‘ûwph</em> meaning ‘to fly’.</p>
              <p>Taking it in context, which atheists rarely do with the Bible, the parable refers to the smallest seed that a <strong>Jewish farmer would sow in his field</strong>. It says that it would grow into the greatest of all <strong>herbs</strong> (KJV) <strong>or garden plants</strong> (NIV, NASB), <strong>not all</strong> plants. But this is missing the point anyway. Jesus was teaching that out of something tiny, something huge can grow.</p>

              <p>Nope. YOU are wrong. You are still misleading people after I
              have refuted you on these things.</p>
              <p>The Hebrew word translated ‘bird’ is <em>‘ôwph</em>, and simply
              means ‘winged/flying creature’—it is derived from <em>‘ûwph</em> meaning ‘to fly’.</p>
              <p>Taking it in context, which atheists rarely do with the
              Bible, the parable refers to the smallest seed that a
              <strong>Jewish farmer would sow in his field</strong>. It says that
              it would grow into the greatest of all <strong>herbs</strong> (KJV)
              <strong>or garden plants</strong> (NIV, NASB), <strong>not
              all</strong> plants. But this is missing the point anyway.
              Jesus was teaching that out of something tiny, something huge can
              grow.</p>

              <p>Oh, I am sure you would wish that you can keep on attacking the Christian faith in this forum and that no one stand up to refute your objections, many of which are just plain silly and nonsensical. Like it or not, the apostle Peter exhorted believers to be ready to give a reason for our belief, and Jude commands believers to contend for the faith.</p>
              <p>BTW, why should God inspire the writing of the Bible with fault-finding atheists like you in mind? You are just upset that your "bats are birds" objection has been thrashed, so now you change tact and complain that Bible did not say bats are mammals. That is just so lame and shows how desperate you are.</p>
