              <p>Depends on what you are talking about.</p>
              <p>But I can highlight a few christian morals that are subjective.</p>
              <p>Christians say that lying is always wrong. This does not apply to every situation. Lying can sometimes be good.</p>
              <p>Christians say that jesus is the only god. This is also subjective. Not every single human being believes int hat. It also depends on many factors like what religion you were brought up in/exposed to, what religious book you have read, and your personality and culture.</p>
              <p>Christians say abortion is always wrong. Subjective again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these christian truths will/can change, and are subjective to the specific situation/individual.</p>
              <p>THey are not universal truths.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You are still as CONFUSED as ever.</p>
              <p>Either lying is a sin or it is not. It cannot be a sin and then not a sin. Just because something good or beneficial comes out of telling a lie, it does not mean therefore that lying is good. If it is, then we SHOULD lie regardless of time, place and circumstance. But no relativist would think like that. Would you?</p>
              <p>Either Jesus is God or He is not. That's what is meant by objective truth. It has NOTHING to do with how many people believe that or one's background.</p>
              <p>And the abortion issue is with regards to abortion-on-demand which is what the pro-life debate is about, that people suka suka decide to terminate a pregnancy because it is inconvenient or because they do not want to live with consequences of their actions. There are times when abortion is necessary and justified. Other than such circumstances abortion would be wrong.</p>
              <p>The problem with your argument is that the mere existence of moral ambiguity and controversy in SOME area is then treated as proof that there are no objective (moral) truths at all.</p>

              <p>Yet the irony is that the one doing the accusing is himself being judgemental!</p>
              <p>Believers are called judge ourselves, judge right from wrong, and to discern truth from error. All these require us to be judgemental. The issue then is not about being judgemental, everyone is. The issue is whether one is judging rightly. Also, we should not engage in hypocritical judgement.</p>

              <p>Since when you believe in Christ? Subjective. No one ever is a born believer. Only you failed to see beliefs are subjective, regardless of truth.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">"And again you any-o-how allege a fallacy of hasty generalisation when there is none committed. Relativism = subjective truth. I suggest you brush up on your knowledge concerning what relativism is here</span><a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; " rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism">http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism</a>"</p>
              <p>Just because you equate relativism=subjective truth therefore declare those holding subjective truth as believers of relativism, when the concept of relativism revolves around the definition of subjective truth, is enough to deem you dull. Example, God=love. Therefore a loving person is a god loving person.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">And you are STILL confused between what a circular reasoning is and what a self-defeating argument is. The statement "Relativism is true" is a self-defeating statement akin to saying "The truth is that there is no truth." It's like saying that you have your feet firmly planted in mid-air. "</span></p>
              <p>1st two statements are circular if you still don't see it. Last sentence is physically possible.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">And mind you, relativism is not just a theory but for many it has become a worldview.

              <p>You are saying the Singaporean(your objective truth) did not exist before Singapore. The Singaporean(your objective truth) was non existent before Singapore. Your objective truth <strong>changed</strong> into non existent when there was no Singapore. So your objective truth <strong>changed</strong> to another objective truth. </p>

When God finished with Creation on Day 6 He said it was "very good". It couldn't be all "very good" when death and suffering is present then and animals are dropping dead or dying around Adam and Eve. No, the other life-forms did not deserve death at all. It wasn't anything they did but what Adam did. But that's the point I was making, sin affects everything. And God's way is higher than ours. The mistake that atheists make is to think that God must be subject to their rational view."</span></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was Adam allowed to eat before he sinned? Did God gave him permission to eat before he sinned? According to you there was no death, so Adam consumed lifeforms alive and passes them out alive. According to you, the is no decomposition since nothing was dead. &lt;ok_noted.jpg&gt;</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">I don't know what badger evidence you are talking about. The point is that the rock badger/hyrax/coney is an animal which the Bible classified as one that "chews the cud" using the language of appearance. Why would you consider it an insult when your ignorance is being corrected? You can't be that petty and narrow-minded yah?"</span></p>
              <p>Badgers are not observed to be ruminants or refects. That is where the evidence of lack comes in. You were saying that it can't be proven what exact animals the verse points to, but whatever it is, its as what the bible described. Thats appealing to ignorance. How is that correcting my ignorance? And now you resort to a false dilema of making me either not insulted or being petty and narrow minded, attempting to undermine the insult of calling another ignorant. That's hypocritical. I'm insulted to be corrected by a hypocrite who thinks he corrected me by what he thinks he knew and pointing to the things he think I do not know. I am insulted to be compared to a hypocrite.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You are employing double standards here: you can treat all creationists as not credible but I cannot speak of creationists generally as credible? The fallacy is all yours. Are creationists making a lot of noise? Sure. And what's your problem with that? Atheists and evolutionists are making a lot of din too."</span></p>
              <p>Since when atheist are credible? Since when evolutionist are credible? Since when you are credible? Since when am I credible? The bias is yours alone. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Your intention, if I remember you admitted earlier, was to like a challenge and argument. Perhaps you are just being argumentative."</span></p>
              <p>I like challenges but you miss the part where I wanna  bridge a reasonable communication standard. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"But even so, it shows that you are a novice when it comes to critical thinking. Perhaps you were only just introduced to the world of informal fallacies but lacked the training in them, thus explaining how your confusion in recognising and identifying them."</span></p>
              <p>What I see are ad naseums, tu quoques, ad hominems, appeals to authority, appeals to ridicule, appeals to ignorance... I was begining to favor letting you go in bliss, but y<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">ou are being hypocritical again... dismissing the users here without (perceived)training as if the rationality of their arguments are lesser. The more the personal you get the more you will get exposed. </span></p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You are CONFUSED still."</span></p>
              <p>You miss the spot where I said "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I believe thats what Tcmc was trying to say."</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"Objective truth is that which is true regardless of time and space and one's feelings or perceptions. It is independent of what one believes or thinks or feels. And we are not talking about whether a thing changes, but whether truth can change."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong>And you failed to give me a better example of what is objective truth previously, you can try again.</strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"And just because a reader brings to the text his personal background and prejudices/biases which may influence his interpretation, that does not mean that the objective/intended meaning of the text is absent.

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><strong>The key is: interpretations. Only the source is objective, not what you know not what I know.

              See, even a troll like Jacky agrees with me that Aneslayer is confused. But I certainly disagree with his assessment of me. Jacky cannot explain and justify his allegations at all. I guess it simply boils down to his anti-christian bigotry.

              <p>You are still as CONFUSED as ever.</p>
              <p>Either lying is a sin or it is not. It cannot be a sin and then
              not a sin. Just because something good or beneficial comes out
              of telling a lie, it does not mean therefore that lying is good. If
              it is, then we SHOULD lie regardless of time, place and
              circumstance. But no relativist would think like that. Would
              you?</p>
              <p>Either Jesus is God or He is not. That's what is meant by
              objective truth. It has NOTHING to do with how many people believe
              that or one's background.</p>
              <p>And the abortion issue is with regards
              to abortion-on-demand which is what the pro-life debate is
              about, that people suka suka decide to terminate a pregnancy
              because it is inconvenient or because they do not want to live with
              consequences of their actions. There are times when abortion is
              necessary and justified. Other than such circumstances abortion
              would be wrong.</p>
              <p>The problem with your argument is that the mere existence of
              moral ambiguity and controversy in SOME area is then treated as
              proof that there are no objective (moral) truths at all.</p>

              <p>I never say we should lie regardless of what situation. I am saying lying can be good, it can be bad, depending on situation! And every situation is different. For example, its good to lie to the robber that your grandma is not in the house if he asks you where she is because he wants to rape her. It's also good lie to people sometimes for fear that they cannot take the truth because of a weak heart. It's also good to lie if the truth will hurt someone badly. (to tell him that he is really unpleasant looking).</p>
              <p>Or if you were a German hiding Jews in your house during WW2, it would also be considered a GOOD deed to lie to the Nazi soldiers.</p>
              <p>Lying can also be bad in many circumstances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saying "Lying is ALWAYS bad" is not an objective truth.</p>
              <p>Lying can be bad and good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same applies for abortion, and the existence of gods. (christian, hindu or jewish god)</p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">If belief is that which changes, then Tcmc should be clear in her communication. In any case, since when is belief defined as subjective truth?"</span></p>
              <p>Since when you believe in Christ? Subjective. No one ever is a born believer. Only you failed to see beliefs are subjective, regardless of truth.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"And again you any-o-how allege a fallacy of hasty generalisation when there is none committed. Relativism = subjective truth. I suggest you brush up on your knowledge concerning what relativism is here</span><a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism">http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism</a>"</p>
              <p>Just because you equate relativism=subjective truth therefore declare those holding subjective truth as believers of relativism, when the concept of relativism revolves around the definition of subjective truth, is enough to deem you dull. Example, God=love. Therefore a loving person is a god loving person.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">And you are STILL confused between what a circular reasoning is and what a self-defeating argument is. The statement "Relativism is true" is a self-defeating statement akin to saying "The truth is that there is no truth." It's like saying that you have your feet firmly planted in mid-air. "</span></p>
              <p>1st two statements are circular if you still don't see it. Last sentence is physically possible.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">And mind you, relativism is not just a theory but for many it has become a worldview. See </span><a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism">http://www.theopedia.com/Relativism</a>"</p>
              <p>Just as when there was a time when the world was believed to be flat. No consequence to objective truth.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">When there was no earth, there would be no Singapore to speak of. That's the objective truth about the existence of Singapore before earth existed. How difficult is this?</span></p>
              <p>You are saying the Singaporean(your objective truth) did not exist before Singapore. The Singaporean(your objective truth) was non existent before Singapore. Your objective truth <strong>changed</strong> into non existent when there was no Singapore. So your objective truth <strong>changed</strong> to another objective truth. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Even if today Singapore is wiped off the face of the earth, the objective truth remains that (say you were born in Singapore in 1990) you were born in Singapore in 1990. And even if the whole universe vaporised, that truth is still true, it does not cease to be true, though it may cease to be relevant or meaningful with no one around to take note."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>To make you understand, I'll need to quote the bible; <span>Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former will not be remembered nor come to mind."[Isa 65:17] </span></div>
              <div>The Singaporean(your objective truth) <strong>became</strong> non existent.</div>
              <div>I shall conclude either you don't know as much about objective truth as you presented yourself to be or you refuse to come up with a better example.</div>

              <div>Subjective... I showed you verificable facts that there were people who believed in a flat earth, regardless of their religion.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"<span style="color: #333333;">There is no intimidation on my part at all in merely pointing out that you were WRONG to stubbornly insist that an argument is a statement. How you can even claim to be not wrong is beyond comprehension. Guess it is a matter of ego here for you."</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>&lt;no_u.jpg&gt; much? You don't even know whats a proof by intimidation even when I provided a link in the words.... So much for feeding the ducks....<br>If you insist I'm wrong, so be it. Its your strawman anyway.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"<span style="color: #333333;">Of course saying God is cruel is making a moral judgment, because the assumption is that there is something morally wrong with being cruel." </span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Your assumptions, not my problem. Who died and made you to judge suffering, death and pain morally wrong?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"<span style="color: #333333;">If it is just a matter causing pain or suffering, then would you say the doctor is cruel in causing pain and suffering in treating a patient of cancer through chemotherapy? Of course not."</span></div>

              <div>&lt;Suddenly..._strawman_everywhere.jpg&gt;  See previous reply</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"<span style="color: #333333;">I don't blame you for your lack of theological training and Bible knowledge. When God finished with Creation on Day 6 He said it was "very good". It couldn't be all "very good" when death and suffering is present then and animals are dropping dead or dying around Adam and Eve. No, the other life-forms did not deserve death at all. It wasn't anything they did but what Adam did. But that's the point I was making, sin affects everything. And God's way is higher than ours. The mistake that atheists make is to think that God must be subject to their rational view."</span></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was Adam allowed to eat before he sinned? Did God gave him permission to eat before he sinned? According to you there was no death, so Adam consumed lifeforms alive and passes them out alive. According to you, the is no decomposition since nothing was dead. &lt;ok_noted.jpg&gt;</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">I don't know what badger evidence you are talking about. The point is that the rock badger/hyrax/coney is an animal which the Bible classified as one that "chews the cud" using the language of appearance. Why would you consider it an insult when your ignorance is being corrected? You can't be that petty and narrow-minded yah?"</span></p>
              <p>Badgers are not observed to be ruminants or refects. That is where the evidence of lack comes in. You were saying that it can't be proven what exact animals the verse points to, but whatever it is, its as what the bible described. Thats appealing to ignorance. How is that correcting my ignorance? And now you resort to a false dilema of making me either not insulted or being petty and narrow minded, attempting to undermine the insult of calling another ignorant. That's hypocritical. I'm insulted to be corrected by a hypocrite who thinks he corrected me by what he thinks he knew and pointing to the things he think I do not know. I am insulted to be compared to a hypocrite.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">You are employing double standards here: you can treat all creationists as not credible but I cannot speak of creationists generally as credible? The fallacy is all yours. Are creationists making a lot of noise? Sure. And what's your problem with that? Atheists and evolutionists are making a lot of din too."</span></p>
              <p>Since when atheist are credible? Since when evolutionist are credible? Since when you are credible? Since when am I credible? The bias is yours alone. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">Your intention, if I remember you admitted earlier, was to like a challenge and argument. Perhaps you are just being argumentative."</span></p>
              <p>I like challenges but you miss the part where I wanna  bridge a reasonable communication standard. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"But even so, it shows that you are a novice when it comes to critical thinking. Perhaps you were only just introduced to the world of informal fallacies but lacked the training in them, thus explaining how your confusion in recognising and identifying them."</span></p>
              <p>What I see are ad naseums, tu quoques, ad hominems, appeals to authority, appeals to ridicule, appeals to ignorance... I was begining to favor letting you go in bliss, but y<span>ou are being hypocritical again... dismissing the users here without (perceived)training as if the rationality of their arguments are lesser. The more the personal you get the more you will get exposed. </span></p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">You are CONFUSED still."</span></p>
              <p>You miss the spot where I said "<span style="color: #333333;">I believe thats what Tcmc was trying to say."</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"Objective truth is that which is true regardless of time and space and one's feelings or perceptions.

              </blockquote>
              <p>The question I asked was “Since when is belief defined as subjective truth?” and you changed the subject by asking me since when I became a Christian. A diversion, and an irrelevant one no less.</p>
              <p>Subjective truth is simply another label for relativism, that you cannot understand this simple truth is enough to deem you dull. Even this atheist website apparently got it right <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/philosophyepistemology/a/Subjective.htm"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://atheism.about.com/od/philosophyepistemology/a/Subjective.htm</span></span></span></a><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'></span></p>
              <p>You repeatedly failed to differentiate and distinguish between a self-defeating argument and a circular argument. According to The Philosopher’s Toolkit, a self-defeating argument is an argument that, if taken to be sound, shows itself to be unsound. The term is often used for positions or theses as well as arguments where, if you take the principle proposed to be true, it undermines itself by its own logic. Such cases are more accurately described <span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">as self-defeating positions. </span><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>And pray tell how do you plant your feet in mid-air or are you being facetious? </span></p>
              <p>You missed my point about relativism being a worldview. Oh well, never mind.</p>
              <p>And you are still sorely confused about what is objective truth. The objective truth did not change at all. You mean you disagree with me that before there was a Singapore there were no Singaporeans? Or are you just trying to be funny? Worst, you quoted the Bible but FAILED to understand what it means. That verse is not saying that objective truth about the previous creation became non-existent, it is saying that the former physical earth will cease to exist and will not be remembered anymore because of the new heavens and new earth. See, this again proves my point that atheists really fare pathetically when they try to play Bible exegete.</p>
              <p>And so what if there were some people who believed that the earth was flat? You still missed the point that the objective truth is that the earth is not flat and that these people were wrong. And one can only be wrong if objective truth exists.</p>
              <p>You can play the dishonest game for all I care. You said that an argument is a statement. I corrected you and even provided a third party to correct you when you asked for it, and then you go ad hominem because of a bruised ego. And it’s not that I am insisting that you are wrong, but you are refusing to admit that you are wrong. The evidence is plainly on my side.</p>
              <p>You mean being cruel is not something that is morally wrong? Why would that be just my assumption and not your problem? And then you go shooting off alleged strawman fallacies when you realised that you have been cornered.</p>
              <p>You can read English, right? What does the Bible say in Genesis about what is food for Adam and the animals? Hint: they were vegetarian. So it still means no death before sin. And according to the Bible, plants and fruits are not called “nephesh chayah” which is Biblical life as distinct from biological life. If you wish to debate intelligently with me on Bible interpretation please at least brush up on your Bible knowledge here <a href="http://creation.com/no-death-before-the-fall"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://creation.com/no-death-before-the-fall</span></span></a></p>
              <p>The issue is not whether the rock badger is really a ruminant or engages in refection, but that the phrase “chews the cud” (to bring up) is applied to it because what it does is similar to the cow or other animal that chews the cud. The point was not to teach animal anatomy or biology but to inform the Israelites that they can eat only those that “chew the cud” and have split hooves, but that from among this group of animals they are not supposed to eat the rabbit and the coney and some others. And there’s no false dilemma because you were really being ignorant. Else you were simply playing daft.</p>
              <p>And you still continue to play daft when I exposed your fallacious claim that creationists are not credible.</p>
              <p>And I don’t see how you have been trying to bridge any reasonable communication standard. What standard are you talking about? Whose standards? What criteria? None that can be discerned. All that I have seen are your attempts to undermine the Christian faith, just like the other atheists here.</p>
              <p>Again, spewing out the names of fallacies proves nothing beyond the fact that you can spew out these names. When it comes to actually spotting and discerning them you repeatedly failed. And the more you do this the more your pretence will be exposed.</p>
              <p>The example of Singaporean was a good example of what is objective truth. Your attempt to dismiss it failed. Again if the fact is that you were born in 1990 in Singapore, then that is the objective truth, even if 1000 years have passed. It cannot be that you are born in 1850 in China when it is the year 3000.</p>
              <p>I wonder why there is a need to continue on when you have already conceded the whole argument to me when your very words are that you pursue “absolute truth”. What then is absolute truth? Isn’t that the objective truth I have been talking about all along?</p>
              <p>And please explain in detail your point about time making truths subjective.</p>

              <p>I think they do not understand is because they are not in your position to understand what Truth is. To them, your belief is subjective truth. You cannot deny that in thier p.o.v.</p>

              <p>For example, gravity is truth. And if you subscribe to a very high degree of truth, the theory of gravity is true and not truth.

              <p>So for objective morals, it may be something like "against murder".

              <p>To BIC, lying is always bad.</p>
              <p>But if you did read my response, there are MANY instances where lying is good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, its good to lie to
                                      the robber that your grandma is not in the house if he asks you
                                      where she is because he wants to rape her. It's also good lie to
                                      people sometimes for fear that they cannot take the truth because
                                      of a weak heart. It's also good to lie if the truth will hurt
                                      someone badly. (to tell him that he is really unpleasant
                                      looking).</p>
              <p>Or if you were a German hiding Jews in your house during WW2, it
                                      would also be considered a GOOD deed to lie to the Nazi
                                      soldiers.</p>
              <p>So his "truth": does not stand in every situation, and therefore subjective to many factors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are objective truths, I guess, but when it comes to moral truths, it is very very subjective.</p>

              <p>Truth is not subjective. Truth CAN be subjective if you subcribe to a lower degree of truth. Perhaps like true = truth.</p>
              <p>There are moral truths as well as subjective morals, often related to as relativist morality.</p>
              <p>It just depends on your understanding of morality. Some people have spent thier entire lives on just what Truth is or what Morality is. There are subsequent schools of though within those schools of thought that breaks them down.</p>
              <p>Now for you to instantly reject any objective truth's or moral's just means that you have not really spent the time really understanding the philosophy of morality.</p>
              <p>In the end of day, does it matter subjective or objective ? What does your gut say ? What does it mean to do the right thing ? How do you know that what you are doing is the right thing ? Because the right thing is something deep down within yourself. Your gut.. your instinct... your humanity.</p>
