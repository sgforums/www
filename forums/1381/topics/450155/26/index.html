              <p>Which begs the question, on what basis you say God doesn't exist?</p>
              <p>And yes, we have been through this before. The arguments for the existence of God has been laid out before. And for you to demand that God's existence must be stated in science journals for it to be true is to betray your ignorance of what science is and its limitations. MInd you, great scientists in the past were believers in God. It wasn't their science that proved God exists but that it was God's existence that motivated them to do science. You would do well to read up on the basis of modern science. We have been through this before!</p>

              God created the world and gave us His Word, so why should a Biblical answer be precluded from having a scientific explanation? And why take offense at the mention of your kids? The scientific method emphasizes repeatability as a hallmark. You can repeat it five times and get the same answer. If you do not like me to mention your kids at all, that's perfectly fine with me too.

              </p><p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">You don’t communicate well. That beliefs change over time was already a point I made earlier. But that is not the same as saying truth changes. Assuming that I became a Christian in 2011, then it is TRUE that I was not a Christian in 2010. And it is TRUE that I was a Christian in 2011. My religious position changed but not the truth. To say that truth changes would be to change the earlier claim and say that I was a Christian in 2010. But that would not be true at all."</span></p>
              <p>Your question was phrased <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px;">“S</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px;">ince when is <strong>belief</strong> defined as subjective truth?”. </span>You are the one causing the confusion. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">And since you also believe in objective truth, then I have no quarrel with you. My issue is with Tcmc who believes in relativism aka subjective truths. But then again she just admitted that there are objective truths too. At least she finally came round to changing her mind about the truth."</span></p>
              <p>Everyone but you got the context right the 1st time. Its only after Tcmc elaborated that you thought she changed her mind about the matter which she didn't.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">And by any-o-how labelling fallacies is still you showing off your confusion about what fallacies are. And why would filling in on your ignorance on what is a self-defeating argument be a strawman?"</span></p>
              <p>It just show that you fail to follow the logic or fail to see your own fallacy. Try again.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">You failed to grasp the meaning of “feet firmly planted in mid-air” within the context of relativism. Your attempted demonstration of the simple phenomenon based on your own defining aside, I was referring to the absurdity of trying to stand on air. Planting something means to fix something securely down, as in planting a tree, you need a solid ground/base. You can’t plant your feet in midair because you cannot stand on air."</span></p>
              <p>You fail to see its the dictionary defintion. What else can the definition be to make "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">plant your feet in mid-air</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;"> " </span>sensible?<br>FYI, its possible to stand on air. I can show you another but slightly more complicated phenomenon. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">Truth does not change with time or over time. Beliefs can. Preferences can. Tastes can. And even if you like durians in 1990 but hate it in 2000, the truth did not change over time but your preferences did. The truth remains that you like durians in 1990 but not in 2000. And it is the same with the flat earth issue where beliefs changed to be in accordance to the truth."</span></p>
              <p>Is this your better objective truth example: Truth of the statement? Its dependent on the subjectivity of the... subject.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">Regarding the “argument” issue, you played word games by arbitrarily defining something = argument so that you can argue that a statement is a clear expression of “argument” in writing or speech. This holds no water at all. An argument is NOT a statement but you said it is. You said I have no evidence for my claim, though it is so obvious that you are wrong. I said that an argument is a connected SERIES OF STATEMENTS. Yet when a third party definition is given you teh-gong and asked what relevance? It is not about me wanting to win an argument, it’s about you not willing to admit you lost one."</span></p>

              <p>Accusation with no basis. You were insisting I was wrong. As for me I'd apply occam's razor and an argument can be contained in a statement. And what was the 3rd party?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">And you beg the question, why is being cruel not considered right or wrong? Of course we all know that you are just trying to be funny. Do you teach your five kids that cruel is neither good or bad? That it can be good to be cruel? And you any-o-how accuse me of arguing a strawman when all I demanded from Tcmc was her justification for posing a moral judgement when her atheistic worldview does not supply such a basis, something which you obviously did not grasp."</span></p>
              <p>You made that assumptiion that being cruel is morally wrong not me. Why is being cruel morally wrong. You are trolling by referencing my kids or are you advising me how to teach my kids when its not your influence to do so. What has Tcmc has to do with me saying God had been cruel?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">Regarding “chewing the cud” your ignorance shows again. The issue isn’t about not knowing which animal chews the cud, the issue is that the text has clearly identified the rock badger and the rabbit as two animals that are not to be eaten."</span></p>
              <p>I did ask you what "chewer of the cud" means in your text. You mentioned ruminant and refectings. The rock badger is observed not being ruminant or practise refecting. Are there <strong>observable</strong> behaviours that the cows, goats, rabbit does as the rock badger, but different from non "chewer of the cud" like pigs?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">Unless you can give me a third alternative, it is not necessarily a false dilemma that you are either ignorant or playing daft."</span></p>
              <p>The other options being you did insult or having no restrain to keep insulting or did not see your own inadequacy to realise the relevance of false dilema.... I can go on for 2 pages... But you would still not accept its false dilema. You gave only two: 1) I'm not insulted, 2) I'm <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">petty and narrow minded(ad hominem)</span>  just to direct the attention away from the fact that you did insult.<br><em>Killing is murder only when with murderous intent. Else its called man slaughter. As if the man died for something worth discussing...</em></p>
              <p>" <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">You are shifting goalposts here. You made the claim “since when are creationists credible?” The onus is not on me to prove their credibility but that you should first provide evidence that they are not credible if you do not wish to be guilty of the genetic fallacy.</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;"> "</span></p>
              <p>You brought the creationists to gain weight for your argument <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">"I don't need you to tell me that the Bible is not a science textbook. Creationists by and large already know that." </span>. I'm asking you to prove their credibility in the context of bible not a science text. Else its you shifting the burden of proof or just being flatulent. One more round it will be you committing an ad nauseum.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">As to bridging reasonable communicating standards, I think you failed here since you are so guilty of committing many fallacies, and some more still have the cheek to say that I failed to spot more that you committed. It’s only fun for you to spot fallacies because when exposed you just act blur and throw up more alleged spotting of fallacies but the truth is that you can’t even properly identify them. To me, it’s easier for you to keep spewing names of informal fallacies and pretend that you know what you are talking about when you actually don't. "</span></p>
              <p>Show it, present your claim then. Making me feel and looked guilty before I can defend myself against your baseless accusations.</p>

              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">You don’t communicate well. That beliefs change over time was already a point I made earlier. But that is not the same as saying truth changes. Assuming that I became a Christian in 2011, then it is TRUE that I was not a Christian in 2010. And it is TRUE that I was a Christian in 2011. My religious position changed but not the truth. To say that truth changes would be to change the earlier claim and say that I was a Christian in 2010. But that would not be true at all."</span></p>
              <p>Your question was phrased <span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 15px;">“S</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15px;">ince when is <strong>belief</strong> defined as subjective truth?”. </span>You are the one causing the confusion. </p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">And since you also believe in objective truth, then I have no quarrel with you. My issue is with Tcmc who believes in relativism aka subjective truths. But then again she just admitted that there are objective truths too. At least she finally came round to changing her mind about the truth."</span></p>
              <p>Everyone but you got the context right the 1st time. Its only after Tcmc elaborated that you thought she changed her mind about the matter which she didn't.</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">And by any-o-how labelling fallacies is still you showing off your confusion about what fallacies are. And why would filling in on your ignorance on what is a self-defeating argument be a strawman?"</span></p>
              <p>It just show that you fail to follow the logic or fail to see your own fallacy. Try again.</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">You failed to grasp the meaning of “feet firmly planted in mid-air” within the context of relativism. Your attempted demonstration of the simple phenomenon based on your own defining aside, I was referring to the absurdity of trying to stand on air. Planting something means to fix something securely down, as in planting a tree, you need a solid ground/base. You can’t plant your feet in midair because you cannot stand on air."</span></p>
              <p>You fail to see its the dictionary defintion. What else can the definition be to make "<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">plant your feet in mid-air</span><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"> " </span>sensible?<br>FYI, its possible to stand on air. I can show you another but slightly more complicated phenomenon. </p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">Truth does not change with time or over time. Beliefs can. Preferences can. Tastes can. And even if you like durians in 1990 but hate it in 2000, the truth did not change over time but your preferences did. The truth remains that you like durians in 1990 but not in 2000. And it is the same with the flat earth issue where beliefs changed to be in accordance to the truth."</span></p>
              <p>Is this your better objective truth example: Truth of the statement? Its dependent on the subjectivity of the... subject.</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">Regarding the “argument” issue, you played word games by arbitrarily defining something = argument so that you can argue that a statement is a clear expression of “argument” in writing or speech. This holds no water at all. An argument is NOT a statement but you said it is. You said I have no evidence for my claim, though it is so obvious that you are wrong. I said that an argument is a connected SERIES OF STATEMENTS. Yet when a third party definition is given you teh-gong and asked what relevance? It is not about me wanting to win an argument, it’s about you not willing to admit you lost one."</span></p>

              <p>Accusation with no basis. You were insisting I was wrong. As for me I'd apply occam's razor and an argument can be contained in a statement. And what was the 3rd party?</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">And you beg the question, why is being cruel not considered right or wrong? Of course we all know that you are just trying to be funny. Do you teach your five kids that cruel is neither good or bad? That it can be good to be cruel? And you any-o-how accuse me of arguing a strawman when all I demanded from Tcmc was her justification for posing a moral judgement when her atheistic worldview does not supply such a basis, something which you obviously did not grasp."</span></p>
              <p>You made that assumptiion that being cruel is morally wrong not me. Why is being cruel morally wrong. You are trolling by referencing my kids or are you advising me how to teach my kids when its not your influence to do so. What has Tcmc has to do with me saying God had been cruel?</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">Regarding “chewing the cud” your ignorance shows again. The issue isn’t about not knowing which animal chews the cud, the issue is that the text has clearly identified the rock badger and the rabbit as two animals that are not to be eaten."</span></p>
              <p>I did ask you what "chewer of the cud" means in your text. You mentioned ruminant and refectings. The rock badger is observed not being ruminant or practise refecting. Are there <strong>observable</strong> behaviours that the cows, goats, rabbit does as the rock badger, but different from non "chewer of the cud" like pigs?</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">Unless you can give me a third alternative, it is not necessarily a false dilemma that you are either ignorant or playing daft."</span></p>
              <p>The other options being you did insult or having no restrain to keep insulting or did not see your own inadequacy to realise the relevance of false dilema.... I can go on for 2 pages... But you would still not accept its false dilema. You gave only two: 1) I'm not insulted, 2) I'm <span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">petty and narrow minded(ad hominem)</span>  just to direct the attention away from the fact that you did insult.<br><em>Killing is murder only when with murderous intent. Else its called man slaughter. As if the man died for something worth discussing...</em></p>
              <p>" <span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">You are shifting goalposts here. You made the claim “since when are creationists credible?” The onus is not on me to prove their credibility but that you should first provide evidence that they are not credible if you do not wish to be guilty of the genetic fallacy.</span><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"> "</span></p>
              <p>You brought the creationists to gain weight for your argument <span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">"I don't need you to tell me that the Bible is not a science textbook. Creationists by and large already know that." </span>. I'm asking you to prove their credibility in the context of bible not a science text. Else its you shifting the burden of proof or just being flatulent. One more round it will be you committing an ad nauseum.</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 17px;">As to bridging reasonable communicating standards, I think you failed here since you are so guilty of committing many fallacies, and some more still have the cheek to say that I failed to spot more that you committed. It’s only fun for you to spot fallacies because when exposed you just act blur and throw up more alleged spotting of fallacies but the truth is that you can’t even properly identify them. To me, it’s easier for you to keep spewing names of informal fallacies and pretend that you know what you are talking about when you actually don't. "</span></p>
              <p>Show it, present your claim then. Making me feel and looked guilty before I can defend myself against your baseless accusations.</p>

              <p>Weren't you the one who talked about beliefs when I was pointing out the problems with the notion of subjective truths? Well, since it was just the three of us, I don't presume you can speak for "everyone" who understood Tcmc right. But like I said, since she already finally conceded that objective truth exists, the case is closed, in my favour.</p>
              <p>I would be interested to see how you actually stand on air i.e. plant your feet in mid-air. No wires please.</p>
              <p>Since you are unhappy with the examples of objective truth that I have pointed out, even though I see no problem at all with them, perhaps you like to give me one very good undisputable example that would support the notion that objective truth exists?</p>
              <p>Yes, arbitrarily as in #2. You know, there is really no need to cut and paste whole sale dictionary definitions. The meaning of any word is dependent on the context. Trying to apply Occam's Razor here is not appropriate at all. Third party means those links or people who support my view and not yours. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as "a coherent series of <strong>STATEMENTS</strong> leading from a premise to a conclusion". It's plural, not singular. And if you more evidence why you are wrong about an argument being a statement and not a series of statements, see <a href="http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/jyoung/argument.htm">http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/jyoung/argument.htm</a> </p>
              <p>You interjected into my discussion with Tcmc, so why would it not be right for me to question you as well? This is not guerilla tactics whereby you just interject as and when you like and when pressed you say "what has that to do with me?" So let's settle this once and for all, is being cruel good/right? And why the mere mention of your kids is tantamount to trolling is beyond comprehension. And why can't I or anyone advise you how to influence your kids? No one is taking over your role, just giving opinions on how to play it. In any case, let's remove your kids from this discussion since you are not comfortable with that.</p>
              <p>I already explained what "chewing the cud" means as far as the Biblical text is concerned. It means to bring up. The point of that text is to tell the Israelites not to eat the rabbit or the coney. Critics are pointing that out as an error but as mentioned many times, it is not an error at all. I think you have missed that point and are overly fixated with whether rabbits are ruminants or not, or how we should decide which animal chews the cud. The Bible is not teaching us HOW to identify such, but has identified certain animals as forbidden even though they "chew the cud".</p>
              <p>I already mention about the truce and not turning this into a slugfest so I am not going to address your allegations about me insulting you. Let's just agree that we were both guilty of it and let's just be nice, deal? I am extending the olive branch.</p>
              <p>You need to divorce the issue talking about what creationists believe and their credibility. It is a fact (whether you recognise it or not) that creationists do not regard the Bible as a science textbook, and counting myself as one there was really no need to educate me on that. Nothing is mentioned about their authority or credibility, but just the fact of what they believe about the Bible. That's when you tried to discredit creationists as a whole.</p>
              <p>I think I have already pointed out your fallacies. Remember you even mocked me for pointing out only two when you actually committed more?</p>

              <p>You still missed the point.</p>
              <p>God CANNOT lie. God hates a lying tongue. Jesus said "I am the
              Truth...."</p>
              <p>And you would be hardpressed to find a specific instance whereby
              God APPROVED of lying or praised the act of lying. One apologetics
              website has this to say and I quote,</p>
              <p>"If critics of the Bible would consider the Scriptures in their
              entirety, rather than <strong>isolating individual passages in an
              attempt to justify their preconceived conclusion that the Bible
              contains contradictions and discrepancies</strong>, controversy
              over such matters would cease to exist. Furthermore, it reeks of
              inconsistency for the critic to pick and choose matters that at
              first glance appear to support his allegations and to ignore the
              plain and simple passages that refute those same allegations."</p>
              <p>You cannot use exceptions to normalise things or use
              exceptions to prove that situational ethics is true. One
              must always start with the clear teachings of Scripture. Even in
              everyday life it is the same. It is an offense to go when the light
              is red. The law deems you to have committed an offense when you do
              that, but perhaps you did that because you were racing to the
              hospital with a injured person. In this case the law would accept
              this exception and not charge you with an offense. But you can't
              take this exception and say that the law is wishy washy or that one
              is too extreme to say that going against the red light is
              wrong.</p>
              <p>And mind you, you did not distinguish between my saying that
              lying is acceptable and your saying that lying is good. Acceptable
              and good are not to be equivocated. The only thing I would
              acknowledge is that lying may be acceptable sometimes, and this is
              far from saying that lying is good. It is NOT good. It is
              not a moral virtue. There is a big difference between saying
              "You should not do this but under these extreme circumstances it is
              acceptable" and saying "There is no law for or against lying, it is
              morally neutral so just go with the flow and act accordingly as you
              deem fit." The latter basically means anyone can get away with
              anything so long as he thinks he has a good reason, and who are you
              to disagree or judge otherwise?</p>

                          tactics whereby you just interject as and when you like and when
                          pressed you say "what has that to do with me?" So let's settle
                          this once and for all, is being cruel good/right? And why the
                          mere mention of your kids is tantamount to trolling is beyond
                          comprehension. And why can't I or anyone advise you how to
                          influence your kids? No one is taking over your role, just giving
                          opinions on how to play it. In any case, let's remove your kids
                          from this discussion since you are not comfortable with that.</p>
              <p>I already explained what "chewing the cud" means as far as the
                          Biblical text is concerned. It means to bring up. The point of that
                          text is to tell the Israelites not to eat the rabbit or the coney.
                          Critics are pointing that out as an error but as mentioned many
                          times, it is not an error at all. I think you have missed that
                          point and are overly fixated with whether rabbits are ruminants or
                          not, or how we should decide which animal chews the cud. The Bible
                          is not teaching us HOW to identify such, but has identified certain
                          animals as forbidden even though they "chew the cud".</p>
              <p>I already mention about the truce and not turning this into a
                          slugfest so I am not going to address your allegations about me
                          insulting you. Let's just agree that we were both guilty of it
                          and let's just be nice, deal? I am extending the olive branch.</p>
              <p>You need to divorce the issue talking about what creationists
                          believe and their credibility. It is a fact (whether you recognise
                          it or not) that creationists do not regard the Bible as a science
                          textbook, and counting myself as one there was really no need
                          to educate me on that. Nothing is mentioned about their authority
                          or credibility, but just the fact of what they believe about the
                          Bible. That's when you tried to discredit creationists as a
                          whole.</p>
              <p>I think I have already pointed out your fallacies. Remember you
                          even mocked me for pointing out only two when you actually
                          committed more?</p>

              <p>Tcmc did admit that objective truth exists, and that's the objective truth!</p>
              <p>Using magnetic forces to hold you up (as substitute for wires) is not planting your feet in mid air. The same goes for using the law of aerodynamics to make planes fly. Nice try but no cookies. But I suppose you did not go one step further and ask why do these laws of nature exist and who established them?</p>
              <p>Your definition of objective truth is grossly inadequate. Objective truth is that which really is, independent of place, time, feelings, perceptions etc. It refers to facts that are independent of whether anyone believes in them or not. As mentioned before, you have confused matters of beliefs (which can change over time) with matters of truth (which does not change over time). Both examples I gave were examples of objective truth which you failed to see.</p>
              <p>But if I was right about an argument being a series of statements then why were you so reluctant to affirm it? You were wrong not merely because of my insistence that I am right, but because your error has been shown. An argument is NOT a statement (singular) but a series of statements (plural).</p>
              <p>Why accuse me of causing confusion when Tcmc was the one who said God was cruel? Like I said, I was only asking Tcmc to justify her moral stance since atheism provides no basis for moral judgement.</p>

              <p>My link more than just specified about ruminant or refection concerning the issue of cud chewing. Again the text is not teaching the how to of identifying animals that chew the cud, it is about telling the Israelites not to eat the rabbit or coney.</p>
              <p>What false compromise are you talking about? Are you denying that you ever insulted me? I'm just telling you that we were both guilty of that and move on. But it seems that you prefer to continue hostilities.</p>
              <p>Facts that back up my claim that creationists do not treat the Bible as a science textbook can be found on these main creationist sites in the following <a href="http://creation.com/but-genesis-is-not-a-science-textbook">http://creation.com/but-genesis-is-not-a-science-textbook</a> or <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v2/n4/can-creation-models-be-wrong">http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v2/n4/can-creation-models-be-wrong</a></p>
              <p>It is a fallacious appeal to motive that you accuse me of pointing out your fallacies to win the argument whereas you make out yours to be so noble sounding. But even if true, it does not invalidate the fact that you committed fallacies in your reasoning, which calls into question the soundness of your arguments. Not only that it amounts to you committing the fallacy of appeal to motive.</p>

              <p>Again, Tcmc did admit that objective truth exists. Think about it: To say that there is no objective truth is already to presuppose there is, otherwise that claim is irrational.</p>
              <p>I did not raise any bar. I made clear what is meant by feet firmly planted in mid-air. Your magnetic levitation and aeroplane do not fit at all and it misses the point. But ASSUMING that I grant your examples, does it mean relativism is true. Of course not.</p>
              <p>Why the lack of obligation or incentive to ask where the laws of nature come from? Is it because you do not wish to see that the answer is ultimately philosophical, even theological but not scientific? Sciences cannot go beyond and ask why there are natural laws or who establish them is because that's beyond the capabilities of science. But that just mean that science is limited, we do not need to be limited in the same way. We can always ask further. To do science one has to PRESUPPOSE the existence and uniformity of these laws.</p>
              <p>My first example was that my BELIEFS changed over time, but not the objective truth about my religious position in 1990. Same too with durians example. The objective truth is that I like durian in 1990 but hate it in 2000. My tastes changed but the truth did not. It would be objectively wrong to change it to say that I hate durian in 1990 but love it in 2000, that would be contradictory to the facts in the example.</p>

              <p>There are a host of problems in an atheistic worldview based on philosophical naturalism that are self-refuting. The following includes a few examples:</p>
              <p>1. The consistent atheist says there is nothing immaterial. Those who say otherwise can’t be atheists, as that would allow God, who is immaterial (John 4:24), to possibly exist. But this means that logic cannot exist either as it is immaterial (i.e., abstract). Logic has no mass and is universal (even the universe obeys the laws of logic, such as the law of non-contradiction). Being made in the image of a logical God who created and sustains the universe makes sense. Of course, many people do not perform logic correctly. That is because we have lived in a sin-cursed world ever since Genesis 3. Our fallible, imperfect minds do not always correctly “think God’s thoughts after Him.” But in the atheistic viewpoint, how can one maintain that there is no immaterial and yet refer to the immaterial at the same time in the same relationship? Information is immaterial, Truth is also immaterial. Love, hate, sadness, and all other emotions are immaterial.</p>
              <p>2. The consistent atheist says the universe came from nothing, is going to nothing, and nothing matters (i.e., no purpose). So why debate the subject of God, the Bible, Christianity, and so on (why have this purpose)? In other words, how can one have purpose and have no purpose at the same time in the same relationship?</p>
              <p>3. The consistent atheist says there is no morality (since there is no God who sets an absolute standard of morality). Yet many atheists say there are some absolute moral standards, such as not to murder.</p>
              <p>4. Science comes out of a Christian worldview where God upholds the universe in a consistent fashion (e.g., Genesis 8:22; Hebrews 1:3). And God, who knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10; Revelation 22:13), has declared that this consistency will be the same in the future until the end (Genesis 8:22), so we have a basis to do science since things like the laws of nature should not change (i.e., allowing repeatable and observable science). But why would that be the case in an atheistic evolutionary worldview? How can one know things won’t change tomorrow? Furthermore, how can one know that one accident could explain another accident? There is no basis for science in an atheistic worldview. How can one have no basis for science and yet do science?</p>
              <p>Bottom line: Unbelievers must borrow from the biblical worldview to make sense of the world. They must betray their professed worldview and stand on the Bible’s truth to argue for atheism and oppose the Bible!</p>

              world ever since Genesis 3. Our fallible, imperfect minds do not
              always correctly “think God’s thoughts after Him.” But in the
              atheistic viewpoint, how can one maintain that there is no
              immaterial and yet refer to the immaterial at the same time in the
              same relationship? Information is immaterial, Truth is
              also immaterial. Love, hate, sadness, and all other emotions are
              immaterial.</p>
              <p>2. The consistent atheist says the universe came from nothing,
              is going to nothing, and nothing matters (i.e., no purpose). So why
              debate the subject of God, the Bible, Christianity, and so on (why
              have this purpose)? In other words, how can one have purpose and
              have no purpose at the same time in the same relationship?</p>
              <p>3. The consistent atheist says there is no morality (since there
              is no God who sets an absolute standard of morality). Yet many
              atheists say there are some absolute moral standards, such as not
              to murder.</p>
              <p>4. Science comes out of a Christian worldview where God upholds
              the universe in a consistent fashion (e.g., Genesis 8:22; Hebrews
              1:3). And God, who knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10;
              Revelation 22:13), has declared that this consistency will be the
              same in the future until the end (Genesis 8:22), so we have a basis
              to do science since things like the laws of nature should not
              change (i.e., allowing repeatable and observable science). But why
              would that be the case in an atheistic evolutionary worldview? How
              can one know things won’t change tomorrow? Furthermore, how can one
              know that one accident could explain another accident? There is no
              basis for science in an atheistic worldview. How can one have no
              basis for science and yet do science?</p>
              <p>Bottom line: Unbelievers must borrow from the biblical worldview
              to make sense of the world. They must betray their professed
              worldview and stand on the Bible’s truth to argue for atheism and
              oppose the Bible!</p>

              <p>1. Strange. Many Buddhists say that they believe in the immaterial. Energy is immaterial, yet we can study it. The real problem is in regards to existence. Whether it can be observed and studied. How know if the observations seen are only because of 1 explanation, or can other explanations properly explain it. <br><br>2. Most I know would say that, while Science is trying to understand what is going on at time very close to the start of the universe, they do not yet know how the universe came into existence. Neither do scientists say that the universe is going into nothing, or that nothing matters. </p>
              <p>3. Once again, not that I've heard of. Morals, by definition are what people perceive as principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong; ethicality. Every one has their own idea. Just as different Christians (and all other religions as well) have different ideas of morality, so do atheists. (Euthanasia, divorcing, marriage, slavery, skin color, etc.?) <br>Also, if your God is your idea of what goodness is, how do you know he is really good? Was good defined before God? Was good defined by God? Why are certain actions defined as so?</p>
              <p>4. The entire idea of Science is to try to make sense of the world, to find patterns. If there were be change, scientists will try to understand it and why. Of course, by your logic, atheists would have absolutely no basis on why things wouldn't change radically all of sudden tomorrow. So far in the history of the world, that has yet to happen though. <br>The idea of Science is to predict, observe, explain, and predict some more. Scientists do not have 100% certainty that some is or something will happen, but they have a pretty good understanding of what would happen from past observations. <br><br>For example, I can say now that I predict you will disagree with my statements. Whether or not this is true, I have to wait and see, and then alter it accordingly to have a better psychological analysis of you. This is what Science is. How would I know you wouldn't radically or minutely change before I complete your analysis of at this very moment? I don't know. It is just a premise or assumption that I have to work on. Until otherwise shown that my premise is false, I am just assuming it to be true.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">3. If there is meaning, what kind of meaning and how is it found?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">4. Does human history lead anywhere, or is it all in vain since death is merely the end? </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">5. How do you come to understand good and evil, right and wrong without a transcendent signifier? </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">6. If these concepts are merely social constructions, or human opinions, whose opinion does one trust in determining what is good or bad, right or wrong?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">7. If you are content within atheism, what circumstances would serve to make you open to other answers?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">8. <strong>If we reject the existence of God, we are left with a crisis of meaning</strong>, so why don’t we see more atheists like Jean Paul Sartre, or Friedrich Nietzsche, or Michel Foucault?</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">11. Why would we seek the alleviation of suffering without objective morality grounded in a God of justice?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">12.  <strong>If there is no God, we lose the very standard by which we critique religions and religious people,</strong> so whose opinion matters most?</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">15.  In the long run, human tastes and opinions have no more weight than we give them, and who are we to give them meaning anyway?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">16.  Who is to say that lying, or cheating or adultery or child molestation are wrong –really wrong?</p>

              <p>OK, you were right, you were the one who said that God was cruel. This is what you said, "So are you saying the other lifeforms suffered mortality because of one man sin? Conclusion: God is cruel to impose such suffering to other lifeforms on the 1st mistake that man supposedly made." So you are telling me that you were NOT making a moral judgement about God being cruel but just stating something neutral? I don't see how you can maintain this. The point is that people with a properly working moral compass all agree that being cruel is morally wrong. But now you said it is neither good or evil?</p>
              <p>I know what the definition of troll is, I am challenging YOUR accusation that the mere emotional response you have to my talking about your kids is tantamount to trolling. Mind you I wasn't even badmouthing them. But I am willing to let this pass so that we can move on.</p>
              <p>Concerning the "chewing the cud" issue, what critical ambiguity are you talking about really? As mentioned ad nauseum to you, the context was about the kind of animals that are considered unclean to the Israelites. They were to eat only those that chew the cud AND have divided hoofs, but not if only one of the conditions were met, as with the rabbit and coney.</p>
              <p>Whether you insult me or my alleged hypocrises, the fact is that you DID insult. But like I said, I am not going to continue this slugfest, though you have trampled and spit on my olive branch that was extended to you, justifying that as a refusal to compromise.</p>
              <p>You are CONFUSED between treating the Bible as a science textbook and using the Bible to inform our scientific study of the world. The Bible is NOT a science textbook. It is a HISTORY book as it tells us about beginnings, and also a futuristic one as it informs us of the end to come.</p>
              <p>Yes, I find it hard to believe that you are not here to win arguments. If you were that conscious of tearing down your opponent's fallacies, then why are your posts peppered with such fallacies as well, to the extent that you mocked me for not pointing out more which you committed? Pretty inconsistent, aren't you?</p>
              <p>And whether you intend to insult mother or not, I'm going let it pass. If you did not, then your conscience is clear. And if you did, I'm letting it go and choosing not to hold it against you. So you have absolutely nothing to lose and is walking out of this. A good deal really, win win for you.</p>

              <p>1. Strange. Many Buddhists say that they believe in the immaterial. Energy is immaterial, yet we can study it. The real problem is in regards to existence. Whether it can be observed and studied. How know if the observations seen are only because of 1 explanation, or can other explanations properly explain it. <br><br>2. Most I know would say that, while Science is trying to understand what is going on at time very close to the start of the universe, they do not yet know how the universe came into existence. Neither do scientists say that the universe is going into nothing, or that nothing matters. </p>
              <p>3. Once again, not that I've heard of. Morals, by definition are what people perceive as principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong; ethicality. Every one has their own idea. Just as different Christians (and all other religions as well) have different ideas of morality, so do atheists. (Euthanasia, divorcing, marriage, slavery, skin color, etc.?) <br>Also, if your God is your idea of what goodness is, how do you know he is really good? Was good defined before God? Was good defined by God? Why are certain actions defined as so?</p>
              <p>4. The entire idea of Science is to try to make sense of the world, to find patterns. If there were be change, scientists will try to understand it and why. Of course, by your logic, atheists would have absolutely no basis on why things wouldn't change radically all of sudden tomorrow. So far in the history of the world, that has yet to happen though. <br>The idea of Science is to predict, observe, explain, and predict some more. Scientists do not have 100% certainty that some is or something will happen, but they have a pretty good understanding of what would happen from past observations.<br><br>For example, I can say now that I predict you will disagree with my statements. Whether or not this is true, I have to wait and see, and then alter it accordingly to have a better psychological analysis of you. This is what Science is. How would I know you wouldn't radically or minutely change before I complete your analysis of at this very moment? I don't know. It is just a premise or assumption that I have to work on. Until otherwise shown that my premise is false, I am just assuming it to be true.</p>

              <p>1. Yes, science studies cause and effect. And from the effects we can infer certain things about the cause(s). Once we have postulated possible causes we can examine them further to narrow down the plausible ones, and arrive at that which is the best explanation.</p>
              <p>2. What science has recently confirmed is that the beginning verse of the Bible is absolutely true, that time, space &amp; matter has a beginning. And the book of Genesis dates back thousands of years. Yes, there are many things that science is still discovering, but no discovered fact would contradict the Bible, though the INTERPRETATIONS of these facts may.</p>
              <p>3. Question is, are moral values a matter of one's opinions i.e. we decide for ourselves what is right or wrong, or are they objectively revealed by God. Morality is not to be confused with skin colour, that would be to commit the is-ought fallacy. And to answer your question, God IS good. Goodness is God's nature. So what God says or commands is an expression of His good and morally perfect nature. </p>
              <p>4. Question is, why is the universe so intelligible? Why are there uniform laws of nature? Who established them? Atheism CANNOT account or explain this at all. Science has to presuppose them and assume that these laws of nature will hold in the future just as they were so in the past. But nothing in the philosophy of atheism will explain why this ought to be so.</p>
