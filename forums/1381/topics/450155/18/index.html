              <p>i always wonder why there seems to be a universal principle that

              <p>That's being intellectually dishonest Tcmc. Because atheism DENIES the existence of God. The lack of evidence for something does not mean that you conclude that it does not exist. But should you choose to conclude so, it's based on faith. It's a faith-based conclusion. Similar to saying that the lack of evidence to convict you of murder does not mean you are not the murderer.</p>

              <p>I thought I already answered that. I reproduce again the answer from the website.</p>
              <p><strong>In modern English, animals that ‘<span class="scripture"><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ are called <em>ruminants</em>.</strong> They hardly chew their food when first eaten, but swallow it into a special stomach where the food is partially digested. Then it is regurgitated, chewed again, and swallowed into a different stomach. Animals which do this include cows, sheep and goats, and they all have four stomachs. <strong>Coneys and rabbits are not ruminants in this modern sense.</strong></p>
              <p>However, the Hebrew phrase for ‘<span class="scripture"><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ simply means ‘<span class="scripture"><span style="color: #2a1d66;">raising up what has been swallowed</span></span>’. <strong>Coneys and rabbits go through such similar motions to ruminants</strong> that Linnaeus, the father of modern classification (and a creationist), at first classified them as ruminants. Also, rabbits and hares practise <em>refection</em>, which is essentially the same principle as rumination, and does indeed ‘<span class="scripture"><span style="color: #2a1d66;">raise up what has been swallowed</span></span>’. The food goes right through the rabbit and is passed out as a special type of dropping. These are re-eaten, and can now nourish the rabbit as they have already been partly digested.</p>
              <p><strong>It is not an error of Scripture that ‘<span class="scripture"><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chewing the cud</span></span>’ now has a more restrictive meaning than it did in Moses’ day. Indeed, rabbits and hares <em>do</em> ‘<span class="scripture"><span style="color: #2a1d66;">chew the cud</span></span>’ in an even more specific sense.</strong> Once again, the Bible is right and the sceptics are wrong.</p>
              <p>God, through Moses, was giving instructions that any Israelite could follow. It is inconceivable that someone familiar with Middle-Eastern animal life would make an easily corrected mistake about rabbits, and also inconceivable that the Israelites would have accepted a book as Scripture if it were contrary to observation, which it is not.</p>
              <p>I still don't quite get your double-standard point.</p>
              <p>Again, what false attribution? Add some details can?</p>
              <p>Dude, I said not restrictive meaning, it does not mean unlimited meaning lah! Fallacy count start for you?</p>
              <p>For my "gay" analogy I used the conditional "IF". Anyway, the word "gay" does appear in the KJV in James 2:3. Does that mean you reduce my fallacy count by 1. Actually I think you should reduce it by 2.</p>
              <p>Anyway, would you like the challenge of counting fallacies committed by atheists? I'm sure you would find it easier to count.</p>

              <p>if today i tell you i saw a man with wings walking on water and flying around, would you believe me if i show you a book with writings on it?</p>
              <p>Or would you want more credible evidence like eye witnesses, photographs, the credibility of the eyewitnesses?</p>
              <p>Moreover, your bible talks about talking animals, man in a fish, flying men, unicorn and dragons.</p>
              <p>Of cos we would want more evidence, not jus a book</p>

              <p>who said Buddha is a god.</p>
              <p>Buddha was not a god, never claimed to be a god, and did not call himself a god. He lived his life like a nor mall human He was awake and a human just like you and me, he bled, got sick and he he died of food poisoning. A god would not die from food poisoning. <br>--- Yes Buddha never claimed himself as a god, but he was a great teacher..., he is a human yet not an ordinary human, he reached the enlightenment, a maximum knowledge.. has neutral condition of anything around... he understood more than us could expected , the only way you can reached by practice meditation... <br>if you ever meet dhamma (buddha's teaching), then you have found a priceless, extraordinary diamond... , you can find out by yourself, why buddha is so special ... whatever your belief, you still can accept dhamma, because dhamma is truth .. valuable life knowledge... with loving based teaching, if you don't like it then you can leave it immediately.. <br>~When asked if he were a God, Buddha said No. "Then, teacher, what are you?" to which he replied... "Awake!" <br>So the Buddha is not a God He is a teacher of all the things he learnt in his life. <br>But one more thing a normall human would just die as we know but when the Buddha died he met his enlightenment. <br>No, Buddha is not a God. Buddha was a man named Siddharta Gautama, who was the first person to receive <em>enlightenment</em>, or <em>nirvana</em>...</p>
