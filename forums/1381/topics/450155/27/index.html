              <p>1. Yes, science studies cause and effect. And from the effects
              we can infer certain things about the cause(s). Once we have
              postulated possible causes we can examine them further to narrow
              down the plausible ones, and arrive at that which is the best
              explanation.</p>
              <p>2. What science has recently confirmed is that the beginning
              verse of the Bible is absolutely true, that time, space &amp;
              matter has a beginning. And the book of Genesis dates back
              thousands of years. Yes, there are many things that science is
              still discovering, but no discovered fact would contradict the
              Bible, though the INTERPRETATIONS of these facts may.</p>
              <p>3. Question is, are moral values a matter of one's opinions i.e.
              we decide for ourselves what is right or wrong, or are they
              objectively revealed by God. Morality is not to be confused with
              skin colour, that would be to commit the is-ought fallacy. And to
              answer your question, God IS good. Goodness is God's nature.
              So what God says or commands is an expression of His good
              and morally perfect nature. </p>
              <p>4. Question is, why is the universe so intelligible? Why are
              there uniform laws of nature? Who established them? Atheism CANNOT
              account or explain this at all. Science has to presuppose them and
              assume that these laws of nature will hold in the future just as
              they were so in the past. But nothing in the philosophy of atheism
              will explain why this ought to be so.</p>

              <p>3 or 4 has nothing to do with atheism. Atheism is a belief of the non-existence of God.</p>

              <p>I see your point.</p>
              <p>However, your point suffers when you mix truth with faith. Account for the faith and account for the truth are not really the same.<br><br>Faith is believing. It is a process.<br><br>Truth does not requires believing. It is a state.<br><br>You are suggesting that they cannot prove that your faith is falsified but you are claiming it that it is already truth when you cannot prove to them that their beliefs are falsified either.<br><br>Getting them to acceptance does not mean it changes the process into a state. It just changes the side which they believe.</p>
              <p>Instantly stating it as a truth is like saying you had proven their beliefs are falsified through scientific methods where intervention of any type cannot change the state of justification.</p>

              <p>One can be faithful to the truth and one can have the true faith. It really depends on the context in which the words are used. But my point was that atheism cannot account for the existence of truth.</p>
              <p>The Biblical definition of faith is more akin to trusting, not just mere intellectual assent.</p>
              <p>Truth is simply that which corresponds to reality, it is what is.</p>
              <p>What I am suggesting is that atheism fails to explain what needs explaining. As a worldview atheism does not have the explanatory powers as compared to theism.</p>
              <p>My reasoning is along the lines of: UNLESS God exists, nothing in the universe makes sense.</p>

              <p>If atheism cannot make sense of the universe, then it should be rejected. Of course, if God exists then atheism IS wrong.</p>
              <p>It is not about being is easier to say "God did it". Atheists also think it is easy to say "No God did anything". The issue is about whether it is true that God exists. And  whether it makes better sense.</p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Again, Tcmc did admit that objective truth exists. Think about it: To say that there is no objective truth is already to presuppose there is, otherwise that claim is irrational."</span></p>
              <p>You'd still insist Tcmc conceded when its you who got the context confused...</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I did not raise any bar. I made clear what is meant by feet firmly planted in mid-air. Your magnetic levitation and aeroplane do not fit at all and it misses the point. But ASSUMING that I grant your examples, does it mean relativism is true. Of course not."</span></p>
              <p>It apparent you did just no so to your good self. Anyway told you its was your strawman, this relativism but you choose to argue all the way. Applause for your effort.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Why the lack of obligation or incentive to ask where the laws of nature come from? Is it because you do not wish to see that the answer is ultimately philosophical, even theological but not scientific? Sciences cannot go beyond and ask why there are natural laws or who establish them is because that's beyond the capabilities of science. But that just mean that science is limited, we do not need to be limited in the same way. We can always ask further. To do science one has to PRESUPPOSE the existence and uniformity of these laws."</span></p>
              <p>I'd inquired from my preferred source just not obligated to share it. You, however seemed to have an agenda on teaching your perceived rightness of things so no stopping you there. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">But if I was right about an argument being a series of statements then why were you so reluctant to affirm it? You were wrong not merely because of my insistence that I am right, but because your error has been shown. An argument is NOT a statement (singular) but a series of statements (plural)."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #23262a; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;"><em><a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/">However, in the right context, a single statement can abbreviate a whole argument if the other implicit pieces of the argument are clear from the context.</a></em></span></p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">My first example was that my BELIEFS changed over time, but not the objective truth about my religious position in 1990. Same too with durians example. The objective truth is that I like durian in 1990 but hate it in 2000. My tastes changed but the truth did not. It would be objectively wrong to change it to say that I hate durian in 1990 but love it in 2000, that would be contradictory to the facts in the example."</span></p>
              <p>How can you be so confused... your 1st example was the Singaporean, the 2nd was your beliefs. These and your other examples does not fulfill your definition of objective truths.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">OK, you were right, you were the one who said that God was cruel. This is what you said, "So are you saying the other lifeforms suffered mortality because of one man sin? Conclusion: God is cruel to impose such suffering to other lifeforms on the 1st mistake that man supposedly made." So you are telling me that you were NOT making a moral judgement about God being cruel but just stating something neutral? I don't see how you can maintain this. The point is that people with a properly working moral compass all agree that being cruel is morally wrong. But now you said it is neither good or evil?"</span></p>
              <p>Let you be the judge so show me the laws or definitions pertaining to cruel as being morally wrong in this particular context. I assert again, I did not make any moral judgement when I said God is cruel to the other lifeforms. If you want to pass judgement please refer to law or definition else its just bias and prejudice.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I know what the definition of troll is, I am challenging YOUR accusation that the mere emotional response you have to my talking about your kids is tantamount to trolling. Mind you I wasn't even badmouthing them. But I am willing to let this pass so that we can move on."</span></p>
              <p>It questions your intention of refering to my kids when you could have done perfectly without. Very reasonable question. If you not willing to explain, I'll take it that I can exercise the priviledge make your mom references.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Concerning the "chewing the cud" issue, what critical ambiguity are you talking about really? As mentioned ad nauseum to you, the context was about the kind of animals that are considered unclean to the Israelites. They were to eat only those that chew the cud AND have divided hoofs, but not if only one of the conditions were met, as with the rabbit and coney."</span></p>
              <p>The description "chewer of the cud" can be left out if it was as you claimed. However, if its written it would mean to use the description to identify. You had cloud the description with an ambiguity thats critical for identification. I'll take it as you just don't know whats "chewer of the cud" means.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Whether you insult me or my alleged hypocrises, the fact is that you DID insult. But like I said, I am not going to continue this slugfest, though you have trampled and spit on my olive branch that was extended to you, justifying that as a refusal to compromise."</span></p>
              <p>I did insult your hypocrisies and I'm proud of it. I trample on hypocritical formalities as well.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">You are CONFUSED between treating the Bible as a science textbook and using the Bible to inform our scientific study of the world. The Bible is NOT a science textbook. It is a HISTORY book as it tells us about beginnings, and also a futuristic one as it informs us of the end to come."</span></p>
              <p>The bible is not, but those people ARE taking it as science text, making scientific references to it ALL the time.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Yes, I find it hard to believe that you are not here to win arguments. If you were that conscious of tearing down your opponent's fallacies, then why are your posts peppered with such fallacies as well, to the extent that you mocked me for not pointing out more which you committed? Pretty inconsistent, aren't you?"</span></p>
              <p>Its just your bias or your unwillingness to concede. These does not concern me, only logic and truth does. You really don't understand these fallacies as a tool to test an arguement do you?</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And whether you intend to insult mother or not, I'm going let it pass. If you did not, then your conscience is clear. And if you did, I'm letting it go and choosing not to hold it against you. So you have absolutely nothing to lose and is walking out of this. A good deal really, win win for you."</span></p>
              <p>You are implying that I could have insulted your mother when you cannot even define it. I was not even involved in the insulting in the 1st place. Where from I walk away? But you did accused me of insult. Judge and you shall be judged upon.</p>

              <p>Some atheists believed we are a reality within reality within reality. What happens here is just a computer-like programming within a sandbox by many modular makers which resulted in myriad of boolean fragmentation. The reality in which you call science is just pre-implemented rules set by multiple different programmers. And these programmers belong to a different subset of results not added in the rules of the current sandbox.</p>

              <p>Some atheists believed we are a reality within reality within reality. What happens here is just a computer-like programming within a sandbox by many modular makers which resulted in myriad of boolean fragmentation. The reality in which you call science is just pre-implemented rules set by multiple different programmers. And these programmers belong to a different subset of results not added in the rules of the current sandbox.</p>

              <p>Aliens can be a race existing since beginning of time. I mean why can't they? If your God can exist at the beginning, why can't they? I dont see why they need to evolve in the first place if they exist.</p>
              <p>In fact why are you saying that they evolved since they are advanced? Did your god evolve too? What is he before evolving?</p>
              <p>Since they are an advanced species, aliens can distort science with probabilities and methods not known to man. Your god can make serpent out of sticks, why cant aliens distort our perception with farts?</p>

              <p>EXCEPT you missed something. Aliens, assuming your argument, exists within the universe. The universe has a beginning, which means your alleged aliens could not have existed at the beginning of time. How did they come to exist? By what means? Farts?</p>
