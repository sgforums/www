              <p>You are mistaken. I accept science. I like science. I love science. I enjoy the fruits of science. But the science that send men to the moon falls under operational science, or observational science. But the science that deals with what happened in the past is historical science. They operate rather differently. Besides, science is largely limited to examining natural causes, but that does not mean that supernatural causes are a priori excluded. It's just that supernatural causes cannot be studied or observed empirically.</p>

              <p>from the way this fellow twist facts and logic to bend his faith, is really despicable and contemptible, not to mention reprehensible. it just goes to show what warped logic and rationale to argue his case or rather a non existent case. I am utterly disgusted to say the least. to continue replying back just smacked of one's intelligence. he is just using words to twist and bend the facts to fit his belief system, which is his unique warped way of reasoning.</p>
              <p>when I say he is extreme, he accuses me of being having an extrene atheist views, which is his way of deflecting the extremism from his faith. perhaps he does not know what is extremism and fundamentalism means?</p>

              <p>when I say he is extreme, he accuses me of being having an extrene atheist views, which is his way of deflecting the extremism from his faith. perhaps he does not know what is extremism and fundamentalism means?</p>

              <p>Like the typical village atheist, Jacky resorts to heaping scorn on my postings and spewing personal attacks instead of coming up with counter-arguments. One wonders if Jacky has the intellectual mettle to really deal with my arguments. Personally I am not optimistic about it.</p>

              <p>If there's no good reasons to reject God, then it means there is no good reason to be an atheist. While that does not prove God's existence, it definitely means there is good reasons to be a theist. Like it or not, this is an either/or thing.</p>
              <p>The Bible is a book unlike no other. It makes claims that no other book dares to make. It talks about all sorts of things and touches many things, many of which can be tested. And it states many things that points to a supernatural source. Many have considered this and concluded that the Bible must have a divine source, just like what it claims for itself. It is really up to you to seriously consider the Bible and decide for yourself what your verdict is. I have already made mine. Many people reject the Bible because of hearsay and have never really checked it out for themselves.</p>
              <p>Whether a person is a troll or not depends on his behaviour on the forum rather than his beliefs. I'm not saying all atheists are trolls, but I am convinced that many are on this forum based on my exchanges with them.</p>

              <p>I think you may have been confused. I'm not saying that if there are no good reasons for atheism, therefore God exists. That's not my argument at all. I think it logically follows that if there is no good reason to think that God does not exist, then it follows that there are good reasons to think He does. Because either a person believe that God exists, or he doesn't, and he must have reasons either way. Agnosticism does not count because ignorance doesn't count for anything.</p>
              <p>It's not my style to call people trolls for no good reason. Based on my interaction with some of the personalities you named, there are good reasons for them to be labeled trolls. But I certainly do not wish to get into an argument on this thread as to who are trolls and why. If someone is truly serious in having a discussion then the label of troll does not stick.</p>
