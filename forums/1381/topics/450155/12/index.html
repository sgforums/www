              <p>BroInChrist, are you Singaporean? Rare to find such a commited christian in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Disputes between science and christian religion are not that hotly debated in most asian countries since christian is an alien religion in this region. So I am surprised.</p>

              <p>Actually I think there are many committed Christians in Singapore. But maybe not many who are apologetically minded and willing to defend the faith. Sad to say many Christians frown upon apologetics and disregard the NT writers' commands to contend for the faith.</p>

              <p>Singapore's main ethnic groups are chinese, malay and indians. Their native religions are confucianism, taoism, Islam and Hinduism. Only a few minorities like armenians and eurasians practice christianity as their traditional religion. Before colonialism and the arrival of missionaries, christianity was not widespread in this region. The more established religions were confucianism, taoism, Islam and Hinduism and buddhism.</p>

              <p>Granted your point if you are talking about history and origins of religions in Singapore. But the fact is that at PRESENT Christianity is not considered an alien or foreign religion, whether in Singapore or in this region.</p>
              <p>Using the same logic would you then say that Singaporeans are aliens in this region since we had only a short history compared to the surrounding nations? But so what if it is so? That would still be no basis for discrimination or dismissal or rejection.</p>

              <p>yeap he said it himself in another thread that all unbelievers broke god's law and will burn in hell. So anything tha predates that or basically all chinese until christianity reached the chinese community are all burning in hell now.</p>
              <p>Do not say that i misrepresented your view... you just said those exact same words in another thread. Im not trolling you, but i am applying what you said. So sad for buddhist, islam, hindus and other religions. Probably all burning in hell.</p>

              <p>yeap he said it himself in another thread that all unbelievers broke god's law and will burn in hell. So anything tha predates that or basically all chinese until christianity reached the chinese community are all burning in hell now.</p>
              <p>Do not say that i misrepresented your view... you just said those exact same words in another thread. Im not trolling you, but i am applying what you said. So sad for buddhist, islam, hindus and other religions. Probably all burning in hell.</p>

              <p>ya they are being fed by opiate. just look at the history, wars and bloodshed in the name of their god. even their god is violent and murderous. I have a hard time understanding why got people so willingly so eager to obey something that is not coherent and logical. dun they have a brain and mind to know what is right and wrong, true and fallacy, separate the facts from the fiction lar, come on.</p>

              <p>We've been through this before. Just look at the millions of people killed in the name of atheism in the last century alone, the figures in the last century alone dwarf those that atheists would blame on religion in all the past centuries combined!</p>
              <p>Of course it must be mentioned that other than ASSERTING that the Bible is not coherent or not logical, Jacky has utterly FAILED to back up his assertions. He's just blowing off hot air polemics here.</p>
              <p>And on what basis does Jacky judge something to be right and wrong, true or fallacy? In the first place, atheism cannot even account for the existence of the laws of logic, of moral values, and right or wrong. Whatever atheists may affirm about them, it is not because of atheism, but in spite of atheism.</p>

              <p>Of course Christians are entitled to our beliefs, for that freedom is enshrined in our Constitution. And no one is saying that you must agree or concur with our beliefs. But the horrifying thought is that if people like Jacky gets to run the government, it will probably spell untold atrocities on Christians.</p>
              <p>Look at it this way, if Christians are deluded about Christianity (i.e. false when we think it is true), we can't be any worst off than the atheists when we die. But if atheists are deluded about their atheism and Christianity is true, one can't say that the atheists are going to be better off in any way. That's Pascal's Wager for you.</p>

              Except that the problem isn't Christians demonising atheism, but that atheists are delusionizing all religions. To atheists ALL religions are false and ALL religious people are deluded. Tell me honestly that this isn't what you believe and think.
