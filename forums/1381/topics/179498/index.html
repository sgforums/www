All these 4 books' messages are consistent. For eg, How Jesus heal lepors and cast out demon from the possessed. He ascended into heaven after his ressurection but Jesus will leave us with Holy Spirit to live among us and we, our body, are the temple of God.<br><br>sometime did u ponder why we christians believe it? because before i converted , i always did.

I am not asking you to give up your imaginary friends but am just simply asking what good it does. People of some faith are willing to die for their imaginary friends and have bloody protests to defend their fiction writers. What actually does believing in unproven unvarifiable fiction do for you to merit such behavior? </div></blockquote>Actually my friend we have written testimonies of first hand witnesses. you can set up a court of your own and examine the testimonies of these witnesses whether they are true or not for yourself.<br><br>You can put Christianity under trial. we have the written records of the gospels, the witnesses' affidavits.<br><br>what do you know.........what they're saying might be true. And you have missed the greatest ride in history.<br><br>Prove it wrong and fictitious first before you gave your verdict on it. And when you have proven it wrong, come back to us and tell us.<br><br>well compare notes.<br><br>thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

A virgin birth. In ancient times before people understand reproductive science it does not seem incredible but with today's knowledge we know for a fact that it is an impossibility, fiction.<br><br>The accounts of the Christmas story is different in the GMatthew and GLuke. Since you are a christian, can you tell me what the differences are and how you account for the differences.<br><br>Even without having to refer to these so called affidavits; the whole christian faith rests on the premise that there is a God; no proof is forthcoming for the existence of God. No answer is forthcoming as to why a Good God should chose to hide and why a Good God would allow evil and suffering.<br><br></div>
