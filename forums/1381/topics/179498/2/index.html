This void inside me drove me into searching, evolutions, ufo, cultic practices, witchcrafts (never get to practice any, no guts to do it), all these does not satisfy me, until I across the Bible, I read about Jesus, that I find a God who loves me, a savior who had died for me, that a new sense of peace, joy and hope well up from inside of me that I had never experienced before, its is then that I decide to receive Christ into my life and put my life into His loving hands.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

That this mess is caused by sin.. right?<br><br>P.S. if you wish to get an explanation of Matthew and Luke differences ......can i send it to you through PM........i think we are out of line already from the topic.<br><br>The topic is good............i do not want to mess it up.<br><br></div></blockquote>This was the same response I got from the Buddhists. "If you cannot prove that something does not exixt; well it must exists!"<br><br>Like I said over there; I cannot prove that you are not a murderer so you must be a murderer and deserves to be hanged.<br><br>We are talking about Jesus here and whether the accounts in the Bible can be trusted. We then go on to say that there are internal incoherences (contradictions) in the accounts so that little weight must be given to these accounts.<br><br>So the internal incoherances in GMatthew and GLuke are relevant to these discussions. There is no need to resort to PM<br><br></div>

He gives Adam a freedom to choose not to sin, God even told Adam before he sinned ,"You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die" . After Adam sinned, God did not punish Adam with death penalty but instead He gave him a chance and removed him from the garden along with Eve.<br>Sorry but i cannot formulate or come up with theory to back the bible like what Einstein and Newton did. Instead of being sceptical , why not try to be open-minded?<br><br>so if anyone can fantasize about anything and call his interpretation the truth without any basis , i would like to say the actual person who came up with Theory of Gravity first is actually an Asian but unfortunately he sat under the durian tree.

Many of these people are also active missionaries and would put any of the Christians (me included) to shame with their fervency.</div>

Are you feeling alone by yourself? Are you going thru some suffering which you feel is unfair or do you see someone suffering unfairly? I was like that last time. I questioned God's fairness bitterly. How can a loving God allow people to go to hell or suffer? BUT i must remind you. There is not just God around here. The devil is working behind the scenes also. I want to tell you there is a devil. He is the master of pain, death, deception &amp; he is rebelling against God. I didnt know i was tricked by satan last time. I didnt know he was responsible for my suffering &amp; responsible for so many people going to hell by his deceptive lies.<br><br>The devil is a very powerful fallen angel. God describes him in the book of Job as a very powerful monster or serpent. Nobody can stand up to him alone without God's help. God had to allow suffering bcos of sin. God had to allow people to go to hell bcos of unforgiven sins. He hurts also when one soul perishes.<br><br>Regarding the interpretations, people will see things differently but that doesnt mean they contradict. One could notice one aspect &amp; another could see another aspect but they can fit in harmoniusly. No one person is alike in character or temperament. Regarding fantastic interpretations of the bible, I think more Christians should go to bible college or attend bible classes to have the correct interpretation method taught. I think the problem you mentioned arises with charismatic teachings who always depend on the Spirit until they twist the Word. I guess they quote out of context or worse still they quote to satisfy their lusts. So i am against new age teaching.</div>
