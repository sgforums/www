He was priest of God Most High, 19 and he blessed Abram, saying,<br>"Blessed be Abram by God Most High,<br>Creator [e] of heaven and earth.<br><br>20 And blessed be [f] God Most High,<br>who delivered your enemies into your hand."<br><span style="color: blue;">  <strong>Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything. </strong></span><br><br>Jacob also gave this vow to God in Genesis 28:20-22 (This was before Moses and the Temple too... )<br><br>20 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear 21 so that I return safely to my father's house, then the LORD [g] will be my God 22 and [h] this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, <strong>and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth."</strong></div>
