If I kenna insurance, car road tax, children schools books and my mother in law hospitalisation within the same month, and I offer less than 10%, but end of the year I offer more when I get my bonus, would I be guilty of not tithing for that particular month?<br><br>There is the employer's contribution of CPF which is our money so we should offer 10% of that, but we never have it in cash, so should we pay 10% now or wait untill we withdraw our CPF (though i don't know when ....)<br><br>compensation is for loss of future income and therefore should be considered income. rightfully we should also offer 10%? not sure. also not sure about golden handshake, sometimes I hear people got tax for that but some got it tax free, its all in the name of definition, how the accountant and tax men define them.<br><br>I have concluded that while offering to God is not an option for all chrisitans and blessed are those who offer willingly, tithing should not be taken as a non option, unless there is a clear definition that applies at all time and in all places. if you offer one cent less than the 10% of your income, then you are not tithing, but if the "income" is subject to different interpretations, then tithing would be a moving target, it should therefore be a guideline for Christian at most. just my opinion. Hope we don't have to appoint accountant to verify what each of us should be offering.<br><br></div></blockquote>I the most 'bo chap' care less type, I normally take the gross salary, round it up to nearest hundred then divide it by 10 (easier to write the cheque also), yearend bonus, wait till year end then say....<br>No need accountant to check one, simple mathematics, our own conscience will convict us faster than God.<br>Just my personal opinion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>God bless<br></div>
