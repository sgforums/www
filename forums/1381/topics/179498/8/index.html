It is not optional.<br><br>Here is what I posted about tithing a while ago...<br><br>In the bible, Jesus says this: Matthew 5:48 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.<br><br>Hebrews says this of Jesus: Hebrews 5:9 And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,<br><br>Also Jesus says this in Matthew 5:17 Â“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.<br><br>Question: was Jesus a Jew? Much of what Jesus and the Apostles taught were directed to the Jewish people so in order to understand about the tithe, we have to accept it in the correct context. We have to be very careful about the correct teaching in the bible. Because we all follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Himself says that He comes not to abolish the law but to fulfil it. So this law of tithing is still in place. We are also commanded to be perfect as our Heavenly Father is perfect and that we are to obey Jesus.<br><br>What is a tithe? The word "tithe" is simply an old English word meaning "tenth." It refers to the giving of a "tenth" of one's income to God. And Almighty God directs that this tenth be given to Him-to His true ministers to do His Work-not just to be handed out anywhere.<br><br>Long before the "law of Moses" was ever codified, Abraham-the father of the faithful-was faithfully paying TITHES to God! We read in Genesis 14:17-20 how Abraham honored God's High Priest Melchizedek after God had delivered his enemies into his hand, "And he gave him a TITHE of all."<br><br>Later, Jacob promised to serve the God of Abraham and stated: "Of all that You give me I will surely give a TENTH to You" (Genesis 28:22).<br><br>What else does the bible say about tithing?<br><br>Malachi 3:10 Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, That there may be food in My house, And try Me now in this,Â” Says the LORD of hosts, Â“ If I will not open for you the windows of heaven And pour out for you such blessing That there will not be room enough to receive it.<br><br>Malachi 3:6-9 6 Â“ For I am the LORD, I do not change; Therefore you are not consumed, O sons of Jacob. 7 Yet from the days of your fathers You have gone away from My ordinances And have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,Â” Says the LORD of hosts. Â“ But you said, Â‘ In what way shall we return?Â’ 8 Â“ Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, Â‘ In what way have we robbed You?Â’ In tithes and offerings. 9 You are cursed with a curse, For you have robbed Me, Even this whole nation.<br><br>Proverbs 3:9 says Â“Honor the Lord with your possessions, and with the firstfruits of all your increase.<br><br>1 Corinthians 10:26 says this, Â“For the [whole] earth is the LordÂ’s and everything that is in itÂ”<br><br>Leviticus 27:30 says Â“And all of the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the LordÂ’s; it is holy to the Lord.<br><br>Leviticus 27:31 Â“And if a man wants to redeem [or keep] any of his tithe, he shall add a fifth [or 20%] to it.<br><br>From these verses we see that:<br>1)	God does not change. So God is the same today as He was in the OT.<br>2)	Tithing is a command from God.<br>3)	If we do not tithe, we are robbing God and we come under a curse.<br>4)	We are to honor the Lord with our possessions and with the firstfruits of all our increase.<br>5)	Everything belongs to God.<br>6)	If you want to keep the tithe you have to add 20% to it.<br>7)	If we tithe, we will be blessed.<br><br>In the New Testament, God inspired the Apostle Paul to show that the law of tithing is now altered or changed so that the tithes are once again to be paid to God's spiritual priesthood-as that of Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes. This account is found in the seventh chapter of Hebrews. Paul describes how Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek (v. 2). Next, he describes how GREAT Melchizedek's priesthood must have been (vv. 3-4). Then Paul shows that the Levites themselves-through their ancestor Abraham-paid tithes to Melchizedek, obviously a GREATER priest in view of this fact. In verses 11-12, Paul shows that the Levitical priesthood was only temporary and never brought perfection. Therefore, once again the spiritual priesthood of Melchizedek has been re-instituted through Christ and the tithing law is again CHANGED so that God's tithes revert as before to the spiritual priests-the true ministers of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Apostle Paul was writing to Jewish Christians who understood at least the letter of God's Law and had no "argument" about the FACT of the tithing law. While his main emphasis is the greatness of Christ's spiritual ministry, nevertheless, it is important to realize that throughout the above New Testament passage Paul definitely speaks of tithing as a LAW! And he shows that it is a law, which has existed since antiquity, from the days of Melchizedek-and STILL EXISTS-although now changed so that the tithes revert once again to God's spiritual ministers who are doing His work today! So anyone who fails to tithe is breaking an important LAW of the Creator God!<br><br>Also in Hebrews 7:8 is says Â“Here [on earth] mortal men receive tithes, but there [in Heaven] he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives. In Hebrews 3:1 it says that Jesus is the High Priest of our profession and in Hebrews 8:1 it says Â“Â… We have such a High Priest, One Who is seated at the right hand of the majestic [God] in HeavenÂ” Hebrews 8:3 goes on to say Â“For every high priest is appointed to offer up gifts and sacrifices; so it is essential for this [High Priest} to have some offering to make alsoÂ”<br><br>Thus Jesus as our High Priest reveives our tithes and offerings and presents them to the Father.<br><br>Jesus himself speaks about tithing:<br><br>In speaking to the scribes and Pharisees, who often made a self-righteous display of strictly keeping some of the smaller points of God's Law, Jesus said: "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done [these weightier matters], without leaving the others [carefully tithing] undone" (Matthew 23:23).<br><br>From this verse as well as Luke 11: 42 Jesus said that spiritual qualities such as mercy and faith ought to be put ahead of carefully and strictly paying tithes on every little plant that might grow in your garden-especially when that strictness leads to self-righteousness. But Christ said "NOT to leave the other undone"-NOT to fail to pay your full tithes as God has commanded!<br><br>Man would like to regard God's tithing law as of least importance. But speaking of even the smaller points of God's Law, Jesus stated: "Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and TEACHES men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:19). How plain! If we are looking for an argument, we will always find one. But if we are willing to "hunger and thirst" for righteousness, to obey even the smaller points of God's Law, we will be BLESSED for so doing.<br><br>In John 14:15 it says Â“If you love Me, you will keep (obey) My commandsÂ” and in 1 John 5:3, it says Â“For the [true] love of God is this: that we do His commands [keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and teaching]. And these orders of His are not irksome (burdensome, oppressive, or grievous).<br></div>

If you want to redeem the tithe or not pay it when it is due because you have financial problems, then you have to add a fifth(or 20% to it when you finally give it which I have done on occasion.) It does not mean that when you have financial problems, your duty to tithe is waived, you can put it aside till you have the means, but you have to make it up when you are able and when you do, you add the 20% on top. The tithe is also to God and not to the church, though the church does collect it.<br><br>It is not about brains, it is about faith and obedience.<br><br>Just a reminder of what you posted in the edification corner...<br><br><strong>He reminds me that He is my Source, and not my job. </strong></div>

As they explain, in the bible the tithing is to the Levites during the Temple period. Since the Temple is nonexistent today, it is unbiblical to tithe.<br><br>This is not to say they are stingy! On the contrary, they have this concept called 'Tzedakkah' which can be roughly translated to charity. They use this system to help fellow Jews in need, to support the synagogue etc. (for a difference between tzedakkah and charity, read <a href="http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_charitytzedakah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_charitytzedakah.htm</a>)<br><br>Christians tithe and the money ends up in the church coffer (sp?). Though some may land up in the community (I think CHC community service branch gets their money from the tithe and offerings?), it is still up to the church authority to dictate the usage of the money.<br><br>Compared with the Jews, the Christian's idea of tithing seems a bit warped.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to make some personal comment in regards to Tithes,<br>1) God do not need our tithe, He won't go bankrupt even if all the christians in the world do not tithe.<br><br>2) Tithing in the New Testament context is for christians to show our appreiation to God as our provider, its a reminder to ourselves (christians) of who is our source. Tithing to church won't to bring a person heaven, neither will not doing so forfeit a christian his/her ticket to heaven. We need to know tha the only way to heaven is through the finished work of Jesus (nothing we do/do not do can add/substract from it).<br><br>3) Tithing is received by the church (representing God's storehouse), the church used them to pay the pastors/staffs (they need to eat too), and also to maintain the church building.<br><br>addition...<br>4) A tithe must be given with a willing heart and a cheerful/thanks giving attitude, believing that God is faithful. The attitude is more important than the amount.<br><br>cheers, God Bless<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just another comment about tithing,<br><br>1. We as Christians are spiritual Jews. We tithe to Jesus who is our High Priest who receives our offerings.<br><br>2. Though we give our tithes to the Church, we are tithing to GOD and not to the Church, therefore once you have tithed, you have fulfilled your obligation to God.<br><br>3.
