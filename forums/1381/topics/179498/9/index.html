            <div class='col-md body'>An interesting note for the evangelicals here. Do you know that the Roman Catholics Clergy rather the Catholics not read the bible? To them the bible is leaven that is added to the bread. When the layman reads the bible for himself, to the Catholic clergy, it does not help him. All that is required of Christians is to have faith and serve God. All the bible study is for nothing and can be harmful.<br><br>Now you know why RC is the biggest Christian movement in the world? Simplicity. Faith and Service.</div>

And since then all have fall short the glory of God.

Letz see, angels, being celestial beings, without a body that bleeds or die, what and how do they fight with? Puzzling? Well, that battle that occured then, has happened all the way till the present day. That battle, was for the very soul of man.<br><br>Now everyone knows satan is the accuser. He is the prosecutor. But who does he prosecute? Who does he accuse in front of God day and night? Us. The souls of man. What is the role of a prosecutor in court? It is to bring out your darkest secret, dirty laundries to get you into eternal damnation. That is the job of satan. And the dirty laundries he lashes out will be our darkest secret. Those we'd never want any other people to know. He'll bring out every reason why we have sinned and deserves to be thrown into the fire.<br><br>So someone claims he is sinless? Guess what satan has to say. "In Adam you have sinned! and because you have sinned, you deserve to die again for your sins!" Absurb? well one can be blameless, not sinless. Nobody can be sinless,without blemish, except for one. Who is the ultimate sacrifice for us. Who is the bridge between man back to God.<br><br>In the Law, everyone of us falls away. But through Jesus, the work is done. Jesus is our defendant. Because He who is perfect, is the ultimate sacrifice for us, who is imperfect. satan no longer have a foothold over us. His accusations will fall away like jelly on a plate.. too much? Still blur? haha</span></div>
