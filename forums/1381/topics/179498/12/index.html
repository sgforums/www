And this he did. </strong><br><br>it is obvious that your comprehension skills are a little wanting so I will not discuss this topic with you any further. I believe that I have made my point.

Was Abraham tithing in the biblical sense?<br><br>There is no mention he was tithing in the biblical sense. All that was said was he paid 10%. We're not sure the nature of this 10%.<br><br>2. Were those "goods" (and people?) Abraham's property?<br><br>Tithing is always defined in terms of your own possession. You don't rob people and call it tithing. I remember the Bible wrote something about tithing your farm produce or something like that.<br><br>Abraham did say out loud those were not his property. Even though he was referring to the goods sans the 10%, it is clear the 10% is also included in the definition of the goods. Otherwise you need to establish the 10% were his property and the rest were not.</div>

Well everything that we own is purchased with God's money so if you want to get technical, 10% of everything should be tithed to God.<br><br>but since most of us become Christians at various stages, the more accepted thing today is 10% of your gross income. Tithing is usually taken out of the produce of the land or of the fruits or efforts of your labour.<br><br>Should the Holy Spirit convict you to tithe on things that you had not thought about before, then do it, if not, if God gives you peace, then rest in that peace and no need to strive with it anymore.<br><br>i think the most important thing is to let GOD lead. In Matt 6, Jesus tells us in there not to worry 3 times. So once God has settled it for you in your own heart, just let it be. This conviction and revelation of tithing is I think also a very personal thing between you and God.<br><br>Take the general guide as 10% of your gross income. If God wants to add to it, He will let you know I am sure.<br><br>Malachi 3:6-9 6 Â“ For I am the LORD, I do not change; Therefore you are not consumed, O sons of Jacob. 7 Yet from the days of your fathers You have gone away from My ordinances And have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,Â” Says the LORD of hosts. Â“ But you said, Â‘ In what way shall we return?Â’ 8 Â“ Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, Â‘ In what way have we robbed You?Â’ In tithes and offerings. 9 You are cursed with a curse, For you have robbed Me, Even this whole nation.<br><br>Note here that God also makes the distinction between tithing and offering.<br><br>FYI.<br><br>God Bless<br>Brey</div></blockquote> hello,<br>no dispute on the difference or the definitions between tithing and offering.<br>thanks for the info.<br><br>God bless</div>
