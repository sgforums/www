Are you feeling alone by yourself? Are you going thru some suffering which you feel is unfair or do you see someone suffering unfairly? I was like that last time. I questioned God's fairness bitterly. How can a loving God allow people to go to hell or suffer? BUT i must remind you. There is not just God around here. The devil is working behind the scenes also. I want to tell you there is a devil. He is the master of pain, death, deception &amp; he is rebelling against God. I didnt know i was tricked by satan last time. I didnt know he was responsible for my suffering &amp; responsible for so many people going to hell by his deceptive lies.<br><br>The devil is a very powerful fallen angel. God describes him in the book of Job as a very powerful monster or serpent. Nobody can stand up to him alone without God's help. God had to allow suffering bcos of sin. God had to allow people to go to hell bcos of unforgiven sins. He hurts also when one soul perishes.<br><br>Regarding the interpretations, people will see things differently but that doesnt mean they contradict. One could notice one aspect &amp; another could see another aspect but they can fit in harmoniusly. No one person is alike in character or temperament. Regarding fantastic interpretations of the bible, I think more Christians should go to bible college or attend bible classes to have the correct interpretation method taught. I think the problem you mentioned arises with charismatic teachings who always depend on the Spirit until they twist the Word. I guess they quote out of context or worse still they quote to satisfy their lusts. So i am against new age teaching.</div></blockquote>I'm going to faint again....<img src="http://www.ohgenki.com/forums/images/smilies/talkbubble/confused.gif"></div>

"If you cannot prove that something does not exixt; well it must exists!"<br><br>Like I said over there; I cannot prove that you are not a murderer so you must be a murderer and deserves to be hanged.<br><br>We are talking about Jesus here and whether the accounts in the Bible can be trusted. We then go on to say that there are internal incoherences (contradictions) in the accounts so that little weight must be given to these accounts.<br><br>So the internal incoherances in GMatthew and GLuke are relevant to these discussions. There is no need to resort to PM<br><br></div></blockquote>All i'm saying my friend is that you step back from that position and try to be neutral first. You are coming in with a position already.<br><br>you said that miracles [virgin birth] cannot happen. What are your solid basis in saying this? Well, our modern science says it cannot happen. But it doesn't mean that just because it is modern and sophisticated, that it is full proof and water tight accurate and more importantly FINAL.<br><br>For them to say this..........let them give us evidences in all history and in all the world since this universe began that there definitely was no miracle that ever took place here on earth.....till they cannot furnish us with this evidence.....why say.....miracles cannot happen?<br><br>You turn the tables to me and say: "so why do you believe in Jesus.......you have no proof of Him being resurrected?" Actually i have proof that He resurrected from the dead. I have the gospels as testimonial evidences.<br><br>In any sane, fair, reasonable and just court of law.......no judge cannot just ignore and waive off witnessess....no they check the credibility of witnesses......they weigh their testimonies objectively and etc.<br><br>Well, you say: "they have inconsistencies in their narratives"...........<br><br>Seeming contradictions in the gospel narratives have been ably explained by many in our ranks......books abound........articles are copious....treatises are abundant with regards to this one... we just wonder if critics ever read them for the sake of fairness.<br><br>for you to say that they are contrdictory, i think the burden of proof is on you [somebody correct me on this if i'm wrong].....<br><br>YOu must show us the following [from Dr. A. A. Hodge]:<br><br>Dr. A.A. Hodge:<br>1.	He must show that the passage was in the original text.<br><br>2.	He must show that the translation which he has of the passage is absolutely correct.<br><br>3.	He must show that his interpretation of the passage is the only possible one, and that it represents the exact idea which the writer intended to express.<br><br>4.	He must show, when science is involved, that the present state of our scientific knowledge is final.<br><br>5.	When he has done all this, then he must show that the task of reconciliation is impossible<br><br>Waw!!! Don't you like that scholarly approach................if i were not a Christian.....i'd probably follow this one here proposed by Dr. Hodge for me to be a fair critic of the gospel records.<br><br>I just love those old scholars of Princeton. Fair and reasonable. not to mention godly.<br><br>P.S. I am not asking you my friend not to use your head. i am asking you on the contrary to use your head.<br><br></div>

It seems harmless for you to indulge in your fantasies. So it seems pointless for me to "wake you up" however good my intentions are.<br><br>My position is this; if there is no evidence, then you cannot believe it. If it is against reality; you cannot believe it. Hold firm to reality and find solutions based on reality and not based on fantasy and imagination.<br><br>If you say that I do not know everything and so I cannot say for certain that you are wrong; I repeat myself here: if you cannot show me that you are right, I rather go with people who can show me prove that they are right. I will not go with people who tell me fantasy and then say that there is no way I can prove that the fantasies are not real. I hope you get the point.<br><br>But like I say, there is not much harm as far as I can see for children to believe in santa claus and that santa will give them presents on Christmas day if they were good.<br><br>But I sincerely belive that it is much better for the children to know and understand that the presents come from their parents who love them rather than from some imaginary being.</div></blockquote>How can you say there is no evidence? It is all around you. Just take a good look. Do some soul searching and then speak. Go check your facts, Jesus is real. He is recorded in jewish history till today. Go and check you facts.<br><br>You want to talk about reality... then your reality may actually be the illusion and our reality may be the real thing. You cannot talk about reality without talking about perception, therefore, how can your argument stand? Can you be sure that the reality that you hold firm to is the right one? Then again, what is real and what is not? Are you sure you are believing the right thing? Who here has to wake up?<br><br>Neither can you show us that you are right, can you prove for certain that God did not create the univers and hence the earth and by extrapolation, us? Are you the one having the fantasy? Can you say for certain that you are not having a fantasy?<br><br>All children find out about santa eventually, so what are you griping about here? Anyway santa is not part of Christianity..</div>
