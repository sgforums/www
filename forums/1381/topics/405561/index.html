              <p><br>Legally, in singapore, no churches can stop believers from marrying non believers. Although some churches will not want to conduct such marriage (between believers/non-believers) ceremony. In any case, there is nothing to stop them from going to ROM to register their marriage and have it officated before a civil registrar.</p>

              <p>the problem with being unequally yoked arises due to 2 basic reasons...1) ppl often do not realised(even christians themselves) that love and r/s are part of a perfect God's creation...God Himself is love...worse, non-creationists would never tink along the line tat love and r/s were a result of creation...2) the emotional attachment they developed for each other causes them to stay tgr as a couple at the expense of the christian faith...the christian halves would turn to the fact that they and their spouses are still happy tgr after marriage and that christian couples do get divorced to validate that wad they did wasnt wrong...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to all christians, let not forget that it was God who made the 1st love r/s btw adam and eve...if He had not done that, adam being the 1st man will have no idea wad love was... </p>

              <p>There was a Christian told me God at first allowed incest (or else how to reproduce with just  Adam &amp; Eve), later God knew that he was wrong and he forbid it. So, does it mean God made mistake or that Christian who told me mistaken ?</p>

              <p><br>She did gave you a choice if you really want to be together with her, all you need to do is to convert.</p>

              <p>If you had made up your mind not to be together with her and lost the relationship due to your miscalculated gamble, why you come here and whine about it?</p>
              <p>Do you think you will be happier with her if you had AGREED to convert?</p>
              <p>If not, then why do you come here and whine when you have lost your gamble after you have placed your relationship at risks, using it as a bargaining chip against your girlfriend?</p>

              <p>Maybe now you will learn something, BE PREPARED TO LOSE SHOULD YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD USE YOUR RELATIONSHIP AS A BARGAINING CHIP.</p>

              <p>Congratulations ! You have made the right choice. Why place both your present life and future life at stake ? Both of you have not married yet and you do not know whether she make a good wife. You are a smart guy.</p>
