              <p>Do you think you will be happier with her if you had AGREED to

              <p>I dun get since when TS said he abadoned her, he just merely dun want to convert but to continue with the relationship.</p>

              <p>i see no signs of bargaining, not even the word 'bargain' in the starting post. i dunno where your idea of arguing and quarreling coming from?</p>
              <p>&lt;&lt;If you had made up your mind not to be together with her and

              <p>What is the gamble here? i see the starting post no head no tail, just saying that the gf wanted him to convert and he refused and that's it only. Like i say before, there must be a fire before a smoke come out. either TS or the gf never come out tell us why she never ask him to convert at the start of relationship, but in the midst of it. Dun u find it strange?</p>
              <p>Back to topic proper, what do u look for when you ask your friend to become christian.</p>
              <p>His/her physical body at the chruch , but with heart not at the church?</p>

              <p>In TS's case, even if the gf managed to get him to convert, do you think TS's heart will be at the church?
