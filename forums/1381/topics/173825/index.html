            <div class='col-md body'>Conviction of sin<br><br>One of the main differences between a genuine believer and a spurious convert are those words up there. Conviction of sin. Every true and bona fide conversion has passed through this highway once in their lives. Yup, you got it. No conversion is genuine unless there is no conviction of sin. It is a state wherein one realizes the blackness of sin and of his being a sinner worthy of judgment before the bar of GodÂ’s justice, one who is unable totally to do anything for his salvation and righteousness.<br><br>Anytime you see a person like that your seeing a humble man. You see a man that is crying out to God saying something like this:<br><br>Lu 18:13 "And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his chest, saying, <strong>God, be merciful to me a sinner!Â”</strong><br><br>He cried out for mercy because he saw himself for who he really is: a sinner worthy of judgment. He did not say I am good enough Â“<strong>I am not like other men--extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.Â” </strong> No, he did not say that he said in words of humility: "God be merciful to me a sinner"<br><br>Words of a spiritually humble [or humbled] man isnÂ’t it? What do you think God will do to such a man?<br><br>Lu 18:14 "I tell you, <strong>this man went down to his house justified </strong>[declared righteous or saved]  rather than the other;<strong> for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted</strong>."<br><br>A man under the conviction of sin sees his utter need of salvation, he sees himself lost and so he cries: "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" the Philippian jailor cries.<br><br>He saw the blackness of sin alright, he saw the imminent impending danger of his soul before the bar of GodÂ’s justice, he  owned up his lost state. He humbled himself.  And so he cries: Â‘Sirs, what must I do to be saved?Â”<br><br>Again words of a spiritually humble [or humbled] man. Again, what is the divine principle with regards to matters like these?  Â“Â…Â…everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.Â”<br><br>What happened next was that God opened his eyes to the righteousness of Christ, the gospel of Christ for his lack. And he got saved.<br><br>Ac 16:32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.<br><br>33 And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family were baptized.<br><br>34 Now when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household.<br><br>Conviction of sin is actually just when a man sees his utter helplessness with regards to salvation and righteousness, sees himself for who he really is; a spiritually sick man in need of a spiritual doctor Jesus Christ. Show me a man who went through this state I will show you a man who finds Christ Jesus [the remedy and medicine for his state] precious.<br><br>1Pe 1:18 knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers,<br><br>1Pe 1:19 Â‘but with the <strong>precious</strong> blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.<br><br>Peter was able to described the blood of Christ as precious because he saw himself a spiritually sick man with no other remedy but the work of Christ on the cross.<br><br>Before I am one who has prayed the sinnerÂ’s prayer more than a thousand times already but I did not find the gospel precious. I always found myself backsliding. Easily discouraged when bad things happened. I still could not understand why salvation must be by faith alone. I thought I was a Christian because I have said the prayer and all that but deep within me I was still trusting in my works and not in Christ alone. I never saw my need of an atonement.<br><br>It was when I finally  saw my real condition before God It was whn I saw myself  spiritually lost, totally unable to mark up my righteousness and salvation that I understood and found sooooooooo precious the gospel of Christ.<br><br>To the one who has not yet understood the gospel and why salvation must be by faith alone: why donÂ’t you call on God to show you of your utter helplessness and total inability with regards to righteousness and salvation. It is God who does the work of conviction of sin.<br><br>Joh 16:8 "And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:<br><br>Note: not all conviction of sin is of the same degree in every awakened sinner.

However, our fellowship with Him could be marred and interrupted everytime we refuse to yield and submit to His Holy Spirit.<br><br>Fighting sin by your own strength would ultimately result in burn outs. We were saved by grace and so we must walk the Christian life with grace and in grace also. Our entire Christian lives here must be lived in dependence of that grace if we should experience victory.<br><br>"The just shall live by faith." This verse has been used to prove justification by faith and rightly so but it also proves sanctification by relying on grace.<br><br>One of the errors that has crept into Christianity [though not an essential error] is that  justification is by grace but sanctification is by works, by our own strivings.
