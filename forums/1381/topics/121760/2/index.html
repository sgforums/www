I won't say supreme being is an object.<br><br>For example, is the golden triangle in mathematics an object? Does it have a creator? The golden triangle is an idea, a construct, and it exhibited its properties in nature. Not implying supreme being is a triangle ..  .. I'm just disagreeing with your domain of object. </blockquote>golden triangle is not an object, it is an idea. It cannot perform any physical act. God is not an idea, it is supposed to be physical and can do physical action. It is an object<br><br><blockquote>The answer at the end will be - I am who I am, I shall be who I shall be<br><br>Note that these are words coming out from a 'being', not a galaxy.
