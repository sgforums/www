Day and night is the time frame which was supposed to be understood by human and "god". U cannot say day doesn't means day here.

Men r made as we r, not evolved out from other beings. Men r supposedly created from dust. BTW where on earth does they say men and god r alike "spiritually" ?

It still never say tat we r alike spiritually and u still can't say tat god do not have a corporeal body.

It is possible for morning to occur. Otherwise, wat does the sentence means ? U mean they add the sentence to make them contradictory or laughable or something ? And wat happened after the 4th day ? surely u have to agree the sun was made then, he set up the standard timeline such as "day and night" and "seasons" etc. He even explicitly say tat the greater light governs the day (supposedly sun) and the lesser light the night. He explicitly use the word DAY for tis timeline. Yet on the next day it still shows tat all the animals were created on the same day and adam was created in the next day.In fact adam was able to name the animals and he able to name show tat they had evolved fully to the state they r in now<br><br><blockquote>I just lost a few blood vessels after reading the above quote ..</blockquote>U can only blame on the idea of trinity; making different objects to be one<br><br><blockquote>Science will not know who is the first human to walk on planet Earth.

There is no such thing as a first man since they r continously changing to human then and we human r constantly evolving as well. There is no sudden jump where a clear definition can be set. It will very much depend on your definition of a first human. Should they be more apelike tat can barely stand upright like we see if fossils or the human in BC 0 ? And also according to science, there is no one being that suddenly becoming "human", but a large group of such being evolving into tat state together. So it is still wrong.<br><br>I don't know about u man, u don't think genesis is really fairy tale tat describe why there is sun or stars or animals ? As a normal adult human being, I find them similar to other folkstories or myth on how sun was created or human formed.</div>

As we know, the day is defined in terms of the rising and setting of the sun, that's how our ancestors see it too. Now, as we are more advanced, we also know the rising and setting is due to the revolution of the Earth. Hence it is possible the sun already existed in day 1. But to believe this is to acknowledge indirectly that the author knows something about Earth revolution? After all, if he cannot see the sun in day 1 due to heavy clouds or something, how could he know the sun existed?<br><br><blockquote>Ahh... but science states tat men was evolved from apes.
