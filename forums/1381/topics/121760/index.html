Even if you explain based on the big bang theory, it leaves the question what caused it to happen.<br><br>If we were to strip everything down in terms of cause and effect we are left with two scenarios:<br><br>The first one being that someone or something(Supreme being) willed everything into existence(at least the basic forms).<br><br>The second scenario is that everything came out of nothing???</div>

Eventually, even singularities decay on a quantum level and in the end, there will be nothing left, that's as far as our physics can take us, as of now, in very long term predictions.

If someone give an answer saying the big bang, u will ask wat cause the big bang. (someone say it was caused by some 9 dimensional object) When we found an answer on wat cause the big bang, then u will ask wat cause tis "cause" again and there will really be no limit to these answering. Lets say u ask the cause and effect for infinity times and infinity causes were given. Wat do u think will be the answer at the end of it all ? A supreme being is the least likely answer at the end since it too has to be caused as well. My bet is, it has to be something created out of nothing.</div>
