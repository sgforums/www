No Christian can claim to have an exemplary lifestyle. One's bugbear can be gambling, another can be porn, yet another can be rage, and the list goes on.<br><br>Hey, rappy, you want to play toto, play lah... does not matter to MC or CE what. You had already given an answer to WHY you should not, yet you continue to do it and add statements like "I am not a compulsive gambler", there is nothing to discuss any more lah.<br><br>Reread MC's post: there are lots of valid points in there. Our approval or disapproval of your lifestyle is totally unnecessary.</div>

Though i can't show God to you, i hope you will still seek Him to find Him. Unless you have already made up your mind. Then ok. Don't let me or any one else deter your search for God. It's a private affair b/w you &amp; God. Eternal salvation is too precious &amp; risky to let others influence on you. Decide for yourself. No one can decide for you. As i said if your mind is made up abt God, then go for it or against it. You choose.</div>

I am not a trained pastor who has undergone bible college or some form of bible education. Pls do speak to a pastor. We are all lay men here.<br><br>Or maybe you can search the web for Christian websites. There are many very good apologetics websites around. Maybe you can try googling or yahooing. Type in the topic you want to find &amp; go thru the list of websites. But i must warn you, there are also lousy websites ard.<br><br>Or maybe go to Christian book stores for a look at the books. You can pick any you like &amp; buy it to read it. Or borrow from the libraries if you dont want to spend money. Maybe can also approach bible colleges for data &amp; research papers. Or speak to the professors there.<br><br>If you are sincere, you will go to find what you want to look for. Either you agree or disagree based on what you read or hear or see. I hope you dont just voice your dissent here or elsewhere at other people.<br><br>As to meeting Jesus, why not you pray to see Jesus. Maybe He will really appear to you. But be prepared. When He meets you, what are you going to say? What if you have to have a near death experience? So dont say too quickly or else something might happen. Just a caution.<br><br>I cannot show you Jesus personally or I will be dead! Bcos dead Christians see Jesus! Or you might land up dead! Choy choy choy! See the danger here?</div>

God gave us a conscious. If you feel uncomfortable about it, then don't.<br><br>Personally, I feel whatever is not God given, the "blessing" will not stay for long. You may strike 4D for a few thousand dollars, but someday, you'll loose by some other means. My sis, who was a Catholic, used to tell me, whenever she ended up in a financial crisis, most of the time she'll kena 4D, not alot, but just enough to cover and get over the crisis. And I was like, ok.. But her business venture soon suffered when her partner ran off with the fundings that went into it.<br><br>So, I do not believe that such a "silver spoon" is God given lor. Because someday down, you'll loose it, more than what you've gained. I'll rather He showed me how to fish, that I may learn the art and develope upon it rather than giving me a trunk load of fishes. A metaphor lah u know, a trunk load of fish will be like, smell really bad! ; p<br><br>Speaking of which, note how Jesus always give instructions to his disciples when they fished to no avail? Instead of raining fishes down for them, or again turning 2 fishes into 12 bucket loads full,<br><br><strong>John 21:6<br>He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</strong><br><br>Note that they have to still haul in their prized catch with great efforts. Such is the way of the Lord, I believe. It may not always be the easier way out,<br>"but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings of eagles. They shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not be faint" (Isaiah 40:31)<br></span></div>
