Many people are not rich. BUt i buy toto not bcos i want to be rich but bcos i need the money. I can always observe those poor uncles from the heartlands buying totos. &amp; i guess they are retirees or what. They seem to have low education from their appearance.<br><br>Who would want to buy toto if they are millionaires? Unless of course they gamble lah out of greed. The asia pacific brewery man was well to do but look what he did. He gambled until go to jail. I think should start a gambling discussion bcos IRs &amp; casinos coming soon &amp; i think most churches disagree with the govt regarding the opening of the casinos.</div>

I was saying with $2, how does one hope to invest in stocks? With $2 investment for toto, one can get more than 100,000,000 % returns. Who doesnt want but like what you said it all chance lah. Anyway, i know something abt stocks but all my investment tied up currently &amp; they dont even add up to $10K. Soccer i dont know anything. So what's the best option? TOTO!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
