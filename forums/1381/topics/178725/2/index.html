When a man is broke, he will try to gamble out of it. That's mostly the case. Either gamble with his life by robbery, smuggling drugs etc or just buy 4D or toto or big sweep. What can he lose anyway since he has lost everything? Even if it is mathematically very small chance, he will still want to gamble. A bit of money for the jackpot who doesnt want when he is broke. Imagine $2 for the $1mil jackpot or more.<br><br>Investment is for the rich &amp; well to do. No money how to invest. So invest in toto lor like what someone mentioned earlier.

When a man is broke, he will try to gamble out of it. That's mostly the case. Either gamble with his life by robbery, smuggling drugs etc or just buy 4D or toto or big sweep. What can he lose anyway since he has lost everything? Even if it is mathematically very small chance, he will still want to gamble. A bit of money for the jackpot who doesnt want when he is broke. Imagine $2 for the $1mil jackpot or more.<br><br>Investment is for the rich &amp; well to do. No money how to invest. So invest in toto lor like what someone mentioned earlier.

When church doesnt provide the support you need. When govt cannot help also. So what hope other than lottery?</div>
