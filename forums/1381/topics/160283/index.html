Not a new movement per se.<br>Wikipedia (which I do not consider as an authority in anything other than being a good read) defines it as:<br>1. Most commonly, a number of unique Christian worldviews held by those referring to themselves as Christian;<br>2. Alternatively, the common elements of all Christian worldviews;<br>3. Most rarely, a single "Christian worldview" on the full range of issues, in which all views differing from the "Christian worldview" are seen as "non-Christian" or "sub-Christian."<br><br>There are tons of sites when you type in either "Christian Worldview" or "Definition of Christian Worldview". I had previously stated that I will not provide any links because I am uncertain of these sites' theology.<br><br>In reality, even before reading up wikipedia, I have concluded that there is not one universal Christian worldview (ie point 3 above).<br><br>I just wish that the thread starter can do some prior research instead of just dumping the question here in EH.
