You do not have to tell me so many times indirectly. If Christian treats Christian like that, how can we tell the world about Jesus?

I find you a joker and I find be unhappy about a joker.<br><br>quarrel with you? on what subject? if there is no fire, fuel will not burn by itself, so its okay, i suppose.

I also love spending time with my non-Catholic Brothers and Sisters.<br>Some of the things I have observed are the following.<br><br>1. Non Catholics spend more time thinking about Mary than most Catholics do. It<br>is non-Catholics who usually start threads about her. We don't even spend a lot<br>of time chatting about her, even with each other. In a Catholic forum, most<br>often when there is a Mary thread, it has been started by a non-Catholic who is<br>visiting.<br><br>2. Very little time is spent discovering what we agree on. Most discussions are<br>extremely negative. Does anyone ever spend any time TRYING to understand<br>what the other person is feeling, thinking, why they believe what they do?<br>3. I see a lot of Spiritual Pride. I am so sorry to say this but it is true. We. that<br>goes for me and for you, believe that we are right in everything. Some of you<br>think it is your duty to charge right in, when YOU think something is bad<br>doctrine. What makes you right and another person wrong? You say it is<br>scripture but so does the other person. You say it is the Holy Spirit, but then,<br>so does the other person. Does the Scripture lie to one of you? Does the Holy<br>Spirit? I always get very suspicious of that person who stubbornly digs in his/her<br>heels and closes the ears and eyes to what is being said.<br>4. How often, when you are having a difficult time with someone, do you stop and<br>pray together? This probably should be first. The most important things<br>Christians can do. You and I continually try to do it alone.<br><br>All to often we talk about loving each other, talk about our being Christian Brother and Sisters, but what would most of the world think if they were lurking and watching? Jesus in his prayer for Unity, Prayed that WE would be ONE as HE and the FATHER are one, so that the world will know that the Father sent Him.<br><br>We are not doing a good job and I agree this is not good at all.<br><br></div>
