He couldn't care a F*** about any of this Sh1t and simply convert when one of his trusted official ask him to. Furthermore, the Chinese back then didn't know anything about catholic theology and their persception on religion is very different from westerners. The Emperor didn't really practice the religion though, he was just baptised, which technically made him a Catholic/Christian.</div>

So they read it with a pinch of salt, but is still a supplementary reading. Many Biblic characters are well-known to Muslims.</div>
