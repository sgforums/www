Outside of church, it's not likely that christians would ask a close to total stranger out on a normal lunch/dinner.<br><br>Also, there are very exclusive rules, such as christian dating as discussed in another thread. I have had friends who wished they had more christian colleagues so that they can share in similar working values.
