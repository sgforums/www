For example book of Job, some bible scholars think that the book of Job is not written by himself, by somebody(which I can't remember who now?) . Does job know that his predicament is because of satan? If he knows, then he should not worry in the first place and he would simply tell his friends about it.<br><br>God speak to His children differently. God is more verbal to the saints in the OT. During Jesus time, God speak to us through Jesus, after Jesus return to heaven, through the apostles. Now God speak to us through the bible. Does God still speak to us today? Maybe we should be still and know that He is God. Maybe we can hear His voice.<br><br>Ops, time's up. I can't afford the time to discuss with you further. Cya.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The strongest faith is the one that survives the questions and then as the answers. Believing what you do because you have looked at everything and truly believe it is far stronger than simply having faith and then accepting what you are told. If you don't address the questions as they come, they will build and eventually will weigh on you as a huge burden that could lead you to think your faith is a sham.<br><br></div>
