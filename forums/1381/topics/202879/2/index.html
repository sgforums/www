I cannot say for sure. I have hunches but they are only hunches. My mind would say Balaam was a prophet that Scripture describes  as someone who is not godly. But i cannot say for sure whether he was saved or not because the Bible does not say with finality. Who knows the guy could have repented and got saved.<br>Your question i leave to God.<br><br>About the salvation in the Old Testament.<br><br>Two views:<br><br>a) one group says that they got saved through believing what God has revealed to them. The content of the revelation could vary. And then upon beliveing it, God reckoned their faith to the cross of Christ.<br><br>b) another group [the group which i belong] says they got saved through faith in Christ like in the NT.<br><br>Why i chose the latter view:<br><br>1) we should know that the gospel about the Lord Jesus in seed form was first preached by God in Gen. 3:15:<br><br>Ge 3:15 And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel."<br><br>Adam and Eve first heard of it. Undoubtedly they relayed this to their children.<br><br>2) 2Ti 3:14 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,<br><br>15 and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus</span>.</strong><br><br>Paul was exhorting his student Timothy to continue in the things which he has learned in the Scriptures.<br><br>Question: What Scripture is Paul referring here? OT or NT?<br><br>Surely it is OT. The NT was still in the process of being written at this time. [Paul was still writitng 2 Timothy-this letter!!!] Timothy was taught by his mother and grandmom about the OT Scriptures.<br><br>Now notice what does Paul say about the OT Scirptures?<br><br>02Ti 3:15 and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus</span>.</strong><br><br>What does the OT do with regards to salvation? They are able to make Timothy wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br>The OT prophecies about the coming Messiah that wil bring salvation. Repentant sinners got saved back in the OT by trusting in the Lord Jesus. Where did they get the knowledge about the Lord Jesus? From the OT.<br><br>No wonder it was written of Moses:<br><br>Heb 11:24 <strong>By faith Moses</strong>, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,<br><br>25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,<br><br>26 <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">esteeming the reproach of Christ</span></strong> greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward.<br><br>Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ than Egypts treasures. How did he know about Christ? <strong>OT and Gen. 3:15 relayed.</strong><br><br>NO wonder the LOrd Jesus was able to say:<br><br>Joh 8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see <strong>My</strong> day: and he saw it, and was glad.<br><br>Joh 8:57 Then the Jews said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?"<br><br>Read Faith's Hall of Fame in Hebrews 11. It has always been by Faith.<br><br>Read Romans 4 about Abraham and David. They got saved by faith.<br><br></div>
