The world has gone sleeping too long. Even my mum scoffs at the end time. &amp; many Christians are sleeping. The antichrists are trying to put together a new world order uniting the world under one political. religious &amp; economic body. But Christians are the salt &amp; light of this world. We keep our place bravely till He comes. Be brave Ironside. Keep going! Jesus is coming again soon! I also dont feel too well but the hope of the rapture keeps me going. In Thessalonians, Paul said this hope keeps us pure &amp; helps us to keep going &amp; to encourage one another with this rapture. So i encourage you Ironside. You are not alone &amp; I encourage you to keep looking at the Cross of Calvary &amp; imagine Jesus coming from heaven for you. He is coming! Come Lord come! The Spirit &amp; the bride say come! Hallelujah! Maranatha! Amen.</div>
