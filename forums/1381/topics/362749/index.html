              <p>Well if I were you I would read about the argument being brought against rapture and if you find other interpretation which you disagree on well ... but the man brought the case against rapture well enough to be worth reading. . . . if you are interested.</p>

              <p>Of course as a Christian we each have the obligation to read the bible ourselves so  not to let anyone fool us into believing man made lies. Digest what you need. READ THE BIBLE.</p>
              <p>I intend to write some of the things I've learned from the bible some time in the future. Perhaps including rapture argument. I know i'm nobody but still I just would like to share some interesting points I've found 'buried' in the bible. Still I don't claim to know everything and the truth that I may know now is just a little fraction of the wider picture. You could be right yet I could be right as well though we may differ and we all could be a little wrong. That's why we need each other to correct one another.</p>

              <h1>Introduction</h1>
              <p>Is there really a Secret Rapture with a
                                      second chance of salvation? Regardless of the topic when it is
                                      associated with salvation, Satan has deceptions in every area in an
                                      attempt to steal as many people as possible from God’s kingdom. It is a
                                      grave error to underestimate the enemy. It does not matter how many
                                      people believe a lie, it will never make it truth. Mark Twain once
                                      said, “<em>A lie can travel halfway around the world, while truth puts on its shoes.</em>”
                                      The only way to avoid the enemy’s deception and find truth is to study
                                      the scriptures diligently. Multitudes of people have been exposed to
                                      this “dispensationalist” or “futurist” interpretation of prophecy and
                                      have been utterly confused. So what is the real truth about this
                                      so-called secret rapture?</p>
              <h1>What is the Secret rapture theory?</h1>
              <p>According
                                      to those teaching the secret rapture theory, the coming of Jesus will
                                      be in two separate stages. The first will be a secret rapture of the
                                      Church at the beginning of a seven year tribulation period followed by
                                      a glorious, triumphant return of Christ to the Earth accompanied by the
                                      Church at the end of the seven year period. They believe that during
                                      this seven year period the Antichrist is going to come into power and
                                      God will select and seal 144,000 literal Jews who will take the Gospel
                                      to the whole world converting immeasurable souls to Christ. They also
                                      believe <a href="http://www.battle-of-armageddon.org/">the battle of Armageddon</a> is a literal national war against literal Israel, which occurs near the
                                      end of the seven years and is brought to a halt by Christ’s return with
                                      His Church. Then literal Israel accepts the Lord as the Messiah and
                                      enters with Him as His covenant people into the 1,000 year (millennial)
                                      reign on earth known as the Kingdom Age. Christ will rule directly over
                                      the earth from the throne of David in Jerusalem, where the typical
                                      temple services function again. Those who ultimately reject Christ’s
                                      rule are eventually judged and destroyed at the end of the Millennium.
                                      The new believers will then receive immortality and eternity will begin.</p>
              <p>However,
                                      the Bible nowhere speaks of these two separate comings and the word
                                      “rapture” is also an invention of theologians and occurs nowhere in the
                                      Bible. The deception does not stop there, Christians also debate
                                      whether we will be taken before the tribulation or in the middle of the
                                      seven years or at the completion of the seven year tribulation. These
                                      are called pre-tribulation, mid-tribulation and post tribulation. Now
                                      for the most amazing part of these views in regards to the seven year
                                      tribulation period; are you ready for this? It was manufactured by a
                                      Jesuit Priest who was commissioned to come up with this false
                                      interpretation of Bible Prophecy. This raises many questions, such as
                                      why was this done and how could so many be drawn into this lie. I hope
                                      you will read on as we cover all aspects of this topic and reveal the
                                      Bible truth.</p>
              <h1>Does the Bible teach there is a Secret Rapture?</h1>
              <p>This
                                      is a brief point by point account of the order of events according to
                                      Scripture; there is Christ’s second coming, the resurrection, the
                                      catching up of the saints to meet Jesus in the air which all take place
                                      at the same time and at the end of the world. This is why Jesus said in
                                      Matthew 28:20 “<em>…and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</em>”
                                      Why would Jesus promise to be with the Church until the end of the
                                      world if He intended to come seven years before the end to take them
                                      out of the world? The promise would then have no meaning.</p>
              <p>This
                                      false doctrine on the secret rapture is contradictory to the words of
                                      Jesus in Matthew 13 when He said the wheat and tares would grow
                                      together until the “<em>end of the world</em>” and then would be
                                      separated. According to this dual coming secret rapture theory, both
                                      groups would not grow together until the end of the world. The
                                      righteous would be separated from the wicked seven years before the
                                      end. And what about the promise of the resurrection? Christ said,
                                      concerning the righteous, John 6:40 “<em>…and I will raise him up at the <strong>last day</strong>.</em>” No one denies that this means the <em>last day</em> of the world. Paul declares the saints are caught up to meet the Lord
                                      at the “same time” the dead in Christ are raised. He says, 1
                                      Thessalonians 4:16-17 “<em>For the Lord himself shall descend from
                                      heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the
                                      trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17 Then we which
                                      are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
                                      clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the
                                      Lord.</em>” Did you note that Jesus called this resurrection the “<em>last day?</em>” But how could it be the “<em>last day</em>” if this gathering of the saints takes place seven years before the end of the world? And how could the “<em>last trump</em>”
                                      (see 1 Corinthians 15:52 below) sound if it really wasn’t the very last
                                      moment of time? Imagine the graves opening and the righteous rising and
                                      no one knowing that it had occurred? Consider also the added testimony
                                      from God’s Word;</p>
              <p>Matthew 24:27 “<em>For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</em>”</p>
              <p>Matthew 24:30 “<em>And
                                      then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall
                                      all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man
                                      coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</em>”</p>
              <p>Matthew 24:31 “<em>And
                                      he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they
                                      shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of
                                      heaven to the other.</em>” (This is clearly the time when Christ comes to gather His saints.)</p>
              <p>1 Corinthians 15:52 “<em>In
                                      a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
                                      trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we
                                      shall be changed.</em>”</p>
              <p>Revelation 1:7 “<em>Behold, he cometh
                                      with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced
                                      him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so,
                                      Amen.</em>”</p>
              <p>Revelation 6:16-17 “<em>And said to the mountains
                                      and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on
                                      the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 17 For the great day of his
                                      wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</em>”</p>
              <p>There is
                                      no understood scripture that says the second coming of Christ to gather
                                      His saints will be a secret rapture. All these verses show it will be a
                                      very loud and very visible event that every eye shall see. There is
                                      nothing secret about any aspect of His coming. Those believing in the
                                      secret rapture sometimes quote Matthew 24:40-41 out of context. The
                                      entire passage reads;</p>
              <p>Matthew 24:37-41 “<em>But as the days
                                      of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 38 For as
                                      in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking,
                                      marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
                                      the ark, 39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away;
                                      so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 40 Then shall two be in
                                      the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 41 Two women
                                      shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other
                                      left.</em>”</p>
              <p>Jesus is demonstrating the parallels between the
                                      days of Noah and the second coming of Christ. The eight that entered
                                      Noah’s Ark were saved and those that scoffed perished as the flood “<em>took them all away.</em>”
                                      Many have been taught that the ones taken are the ones saved but note
                                      it is actually the ones taken that are destroyed. There was no second
                                      chance. Jesus<em> said and “so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” </em>The last verse of this chapter tells us what will happen to those who are taken to destruction. Matthew 24:51 “<em>And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</em>”</p>
              <p>Those
                                      believing in the secret rapture also quote Jesus in saying He will come
                                      as a thief in the night, meaning it will be a secret rapture. Jesus
                                      said in Matthew 24:43-44 “<em>But know this, that if the goodman of the
                                      house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have
                                      watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 44
                                      Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son
                                      of man cometh.</em>” Jesus is not talking about coming secretly but
                                      coming unexpectedly when we least expect Him and so the wicked will be
                                      taken by surprise. This is why Jesus tells us to be ready as we know
                                      not the hour of His return. Those who are not right with Christ and
                                      living wickedly when Jesus returns we will be taken to destruction as
                                      in the days of Noah. See Matthew 24:37-41 above. See also 2
                                      Thessalonians 2:8.</p>
              <p>1 Thessalonians 5:2 is also quoted which reads, “<em>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</em>” Same message as before be ready for Christ’s unexpected return. And what happens after His return? 1 Thessalonians 5:3 “<em>For
                                      when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh
                                      upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not
                                      escape.</em>” How secret is sudden destruction? Those that are left after Jesus’ return encounter “<em>sudden destruction.</em>” Again, just like in the days of Noah.</p>
              <p>These two “thief texts” are also used to teach a secret rapture. Revelation 3:3 “<em>Remember
                                      therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent.
                                      If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and
                                      thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</em>” Revelation 16:15 “<em>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</em>”
                                      In both these instances just quoted, the secrecy is also in connection
                                      with the timing not the nature of the event, and is exactly the same as
                                      the other “thief texts.” Notice the phrase in chapter 3:3 which says “<em>hold fast, and repent</em>” and the last part of verse 15 which says “<em>lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</em>”</p>
              <p>This
                                      is once again a warning to be not caught living in sin, because we know
                                      not the hour which Jesus will return. He will come unexpectedly when
                                      you least expect it as does a thief. It would be no good for the thief
                                      if you knew when he was coming as you would be ready for him and he
                                      could not rob you. In the same way we need to be ready and living in
                                      righteousness now and not just when we think Jesus is coming or we will
                                      be “<em>caught naked and our shame seen.</em>” Those who love and obey Jesus will be ready for His return. This is the meaning of the phrase “<em>to come as a thief</em>” that is used several times in the Bible to warn us so we will not be left behind.</p>
              <p>And still one more. 2 Peter 3:10 says “<em>But
                                      the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the
                                      heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt
                                      with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall
                                      be burned up.</em>”</p>
              <p>Again, absolutely nothing secret. To the
                                      contrary, it could not be more obvious. It states after Jesus comes
                                      unexpectedly as does a thief, “<em>the heavens shall pass away with a <strong>great noise</strong></em>” and “<em>the elements shall <strong>melt with fervent heat</strong>, the earth … shall be <strong>burned up</strong>.</em>” So when Jesus returns the very next thing is the end i.e. the last day. If coming “<em>as a thief</em>” is a secret rapture which takes place seven years before the end of the world, how can the heavens and earth “<em>pass away</em>”
                                      as Peter describes it? Three of these “thief texts” are all followed by
                                      the same unmistakable catastrophic sudden destruction. Coming as a
                                      thief is unexpected, NOT a secret!</p>
              <h1>Will Christ’s second coming include a third coming?</h1>
              <p>Those
                                      who believe in a “secret rapture” say that the Greek word “parousia”
                                      refers to the secret “coming” of Jesus in His presence and that the
                                      Greek word “apokalupsis” refers to the visible glorious “coming” of
                                      Jesus in power seven years later. They also teach in middle of this
                                      seven year period, (3.5 years) the antichrist will reign. But
                                      “parousia” and “apokalupsis” are BOTH used to describe the second
                                      coming as we will soon show by its parallel in the “days of Noah.”</p>
              <p>Paul
                                      uses the word “parousia” in the well known so called “rapture chapter”
                                      of 1 Thessalonians 4 when speaking of the coming of Christ and our
                                      gathering together unto Him. Paul then shows that this “parousia” will
                                      destroy the man of sin; the Antichrist. Paul says, “<em>whom the Lord shall...destroy with the brightness of his coming [parousia].</em>”
                                      2 Thessalonians 2:8. These scriptures unmistakably describe the coming
                                      [parousia] of Christ as taking place after the reign of the man of sin,
                                      not as a secret rapture before the Antichrist’s reign begins.</p>
              <p>The
                                      other Greek word “apokalupsis” [revelation] is used in a way that
                                      indicates it is not a separate second coming from the time the
                                      believers are gathered up. Peter said in 1 Peter 1:13 to “<em>… be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation [apokalupsis] of Jesus Christ;</em>”
                                      Why would Christians be exhorted to continue hoping to the end of the
                                      world for the grace brought through the revelation of Jesus Christ if
                                      their real hope was a secret rapture seven years before the revelation?</p>
              <p>These
                                      following verses showing Matthew and Luke’s account of the same event
                                      prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the words “parousia” and
                                      “apokalupsis” do refer to the same event. In Matthew 24:37 we read, “<em>But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming [parousia] of the Son of man be.</em>” And the same account in Luke 17:26, 30; “<em>As it was in the days of Noah...Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed [apokalupsis].</em>”</p>
              <p>This
                                      shows that the coming [parousia] of Christ and the revelation
                                      [apokalupsis] of Christ are the same event. There is absolutely no
                                      basis for placing seven years in between. This whole counterfeit secret
                                      rapture is built upon a constant repetition of words and ideas that
                                      have been repeated so often that millions have assumed that they must
                                      be biblically sound.</p>

              I believe there would be no rapture and that the belief on rapture is not biblical at all or has no biblical basis. To me there is only Christ second coming and the last judgment. There would not be a miraculous wayout even for faithful believers.

              I'm planning to write my argument based on the bible.

              I wouldn't call it rapture but Christ second coming. And Christ is not going to come before that in quiet from the verses I read in revelation or even Paul's Corinthians or the book of Peter. I've searched the bible looking for the basis on the so called pre tribulation rapture but the verses I've found all indicate that God wants its people to endure till the end that is to Christ second coming. There would be no escape for people living in the tribulation period none whatsoever even if they are faithful believers in Christ. So I wouldn't feel being left behind if I happen to be living in the bible's tribulation era.
                                                                    <br><br>
              Imo it's rather dangerous to believe in rapture if rapture turns out not to be real that is not really part of God's foretold end of time prophecy. So if rapture is never meant to happen and people started believing in it and the end time began, those believers would be disappointed and made into thinking since they were not taken why bother holding on to the faith any longer thus willing to let go of their faith and losing their salvation in return.

              1 Thessalonians 4:13-18<br><br>
              Please read the passage slowly like it has never been ready by you before, without prejudice or preconceived ideas<br><br>                 
              <u><b>The Lord's coming</b></u><br><br>
                                                                    
              My friends, we want you to understand how it will be for those followers who have already died. Then you won't grieve over them and be like people who haven't got any hope. We believe that Jesus died[1] and was raised to life[2]. <u>We also believe that when God brings Jesus back again, he will bring with him all who had faith in Jesus before they died[3]</u>. <u>Our Lord Jesus told us that when he comes, we won't go up to meet him ahead of his followers who have already died.[4]</u>
                                                 <br><br>
              <u>With a loud command and with the shout of the chief angel and a blast of God's trumpet, the Lord will return from heaven[5]. Then those who had faith in Christ before they died will be raised to life[6].</u>. Next, all of us who are still alive will be taken up into the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the sky[7]. From that time we will all be with the Lord forever[8]. encourage each other with these words.
                                                                    
                                                   <br><br>
                                                                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                    <br><br>
              This passage is telling about Jesus second coming.<br>
              This passage is telling us that:<br>
              [1] Jesus had died<br><br>
              [2] Jesus was raised to life<br><br>
              [3] Jesus will come back, and when he does the dead in Christ shall be raised to life.<br><br>
              [4] When Christ comes both the living and the dead in Christ will be gathered to live with the  Lord.<br><br>
              [5]Christ second coming will be known to all mankind and will not be hidden.<br><br>
              [6]Only at Christ second coming will the dead <b> in Christ</b> be raised back to life implying clearly that no dead in Christ be living until then.<br><br>
              [7]At Christ second coming, the living in Christ too will be taken to live with the Lord along with the dead who are raised from death.<br><br>
              [8]All those taken will have eternal life.<br><br>
                                                  <br>
              This is telling about the first resurrection that is also written in John's revelation.<br><br>
              Contrary to many believer beliefs that resurrection means the resurrection of physical body, Paul wrote clearly in Corinthians that all who are raised will have no physical attribute but will have a perfected body which is not the physical body.<br><br>
               And I almost forgot to mention this that this passage doesn't indicate when Christ will come but according to John's revelation it will be after the great tribulation. So again there's no rapture or pre-tribulation rapture. There is only Christ second coming that we all look forward too. And according to revelation it will happen after the great tribulation and not before and not during.

              Christians believe there would.<br> <br> I look forward to Christ second coming not Christ one and a half
              coming either from sheol, this world of the living or I don't know
              what.</p>

              <p>If Christ is going to come in the middle of the great tribulation and at the end of the great tribulation, then why not life a sinful lifestyle untill the great tribulation start? then start to repent. Rather then leading a Christly lifestyle lifestyle, why not wait untill the anti Christ rise before changing your mind.</p>
              <p>Further more, I believe with all of my hear, God will not want us to suffer these tribulation that will come to pass. FYI, it is really horrible.</p>

              Err I don't get your argument about leading a sinful life anyway
              <br><br>
              There's no doubt it will be hard and horrible but I believe God wants all to go through to the end.
              <br><br>
              Revelation 13:7-10<br><br>
              <b>It was allowed to fight against God's people and defeat them</b>. It was also given authority over the people of every tribe, nation, language, and race. The beast was worshipped by everyone whose name wasn't written before the time of creation in the book of the lamb who was killed. If you have ears, then listen! If you are doomed to be captured, you will be captured. If you are doomed to be killed by a sword, you will be killed by a sword. <b>This means that God's people must learn to endure and be faithful.</b><br><br>
              
              That is God want us to endure until the end
              
              <br><br>
              Rev 9:4
              The locust were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or any tree. They were to punish only<b> those people who didn't have God's mark on their forehead.</b>
              <br><br>
              Meaning that there will be people whose forehead is marked to be God's people. They are still in this world.
              <br><br>
              
              Other verses too indicate strongly that during tribulation God's people will still remain in this world.

              Daniel 7: 21-22<br><br>
              While I was looking,<b> this horn attacked God's chosen ones and was winning the battle</b>. Then God Most High, the Eternal God came and judged in favor of his chosen ones because the time had arrived for them to be given the kingdom.
              
              <br><br>
              So even the chosen ones of God's will remain in this world suffering what they must suffer for a while before being given a share of God's kingdom.
              
              <br><br>
              Daniel 11:1
              <br><br>
              Michael, the chief of the angels, is the protector of your people, and he will come at a time of terrible suffering, the worst in all of history. And <b>your people who have their names written in The Book</b> will be protected.
              
              <br><br>
              Again this verse tells that God's people will remain in this world.

              <p>Gentile beilever [you and me, unless you are jewish] are known as the church in the book of revelation, Before the first seal, the books of revelation still talks about the church, after that there is only mention of the church in heaven no church on earth.</p>
              <p>The 6th or 7th seals revelation 7 i think seal the 144000 jewish evganist with the seal of God on their forehead.</p>
              <p>Danial passage can refer to converts in the tribulation, I can imagine those atheist father[like mine] after seeing their entire family raptured will turn to God in tears.]</p>
              <p>Yes abosultly, there is nowhere in the bible is there a single verse that explicitly states that the rapture will take place before the great tribulation, but if you examine all the endtime verse, you will unfold the logical flow that harmonize with multiply cross-ref of the bible.</p>
              <p>However Jesus always warn the believer to be ready and to be ready.</p>
              <p>But not to be ready of the tribulation but be ready for when the son of man cometh[mathew 24:44, matthew 25:13]</p>
              <p>there is a passage in the bible that states that God will keep his believer FROM the great tribulation, not IN. I cannot find it man, sorry will post if I found it.</p>
