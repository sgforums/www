              <div><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The Most Well-Known Verse in all the Bible</strong></span><br><span style="color: #000000;">(God's love to sinful humanity)</span><br><br><br><br><br></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</span><br><br><br><br><br><br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Here in this verse we are shown the love of God to sinful men and women.<strong> <strong>Notice the intensity of His love:</strong></strong></span><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Joh 3:16 "For God SO loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The verse doesn't just say: "For God loved.." No, not that, rather, it says 'God SO loved....' The word "SO" answers the question: "How much does God love sinful man?" Answer: "He SO loved them."<br></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">God loves you SO much!!!</span> <br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Notice the objects of His love:</span><br><br><br><br><br><br>Joh 3:16 "For God so loved <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE WORLD</span> that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">There are four uses of the word "WORLD" in the Bible. It could refer to the planet where we live in; earth. It could refer to the system of evil that is cast like a net all over godded by Satan. It could refer to world viewed as a time period. Or it could refer to sinful humanity.</span> <br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The word "WORLD" in this verse however, refers to the fourth. It refers to sinful humanity that is in rebelion against God. God's amazing love!!! He did not love me while I was good enough. No. He loved me while I was still a sinner in rebellion against Him. The apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Rome:</span><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Ro 5:6 For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</span></strong></div>
              <strong><span style="color: #000000;">
              <div><br>Ro 5:7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die.<br></div>
              <div>Ro 5:8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</div>
              </span><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Notice how His loved was expressed:</span><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The opposite of love is not hate as some would put it. No, the opposite of love is selfishness. True love is giving. As some preacher puts it: Lust cannot wait TO GET. While love cannot wait TO GIVE. True love is the commitment of our will for the ultimate good of the one being loved.<br></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Here we see the expression of God's love for sinful men and women. He GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. The expression "only begotten" actually means unique. The Lord Jesus was God's unique Son. God has only one Unique Son but He has many adopted sons. Sinful men and women who puts their trust in Christ alone for salvation become God's adopted sons.<br></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Galatians 3:26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">[Note: the "you" in the above verse does not automatically mean you and me. The "you" there refers primarily to the recipients of the epistle--the Galatians who trusted in Christ Jesus alone for salvation. However, in a secondary way, you and I could become sons of God IF we trust in Christ alone for salvation].<br></span><br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Eph 1:5 having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, <br></span><br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">[Note: again the "us" there primarily refers to the recipients of the epistle--the Ephesians who placed their trust in Christ alone for salvation. They are God's adopted sons. In a secondary way also we could become God's adopted sons IF we repent and put our trust in Christ alone for salvation]<br><br></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">God so loved you. And He demonstrated this love for you when He gave His only begotten Son for you. He gave His all, in other words. If this will not affect us in a profound way, I dont know what will. <br></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The word "gave" here in the expression "He GAVE His only begotten Son" means to give as a sacrifice for our sins. God provided us sinners a payment for our sins. God cannot and will not just brush off sin to one side, sweep it under the rug and ignore it. No, no, a thousand times NO!!!. He would not be a God of justice if that were the case. Any just Judge requires payment for any transgression committed. God's love as Savior desires the salvation of all men. But His justice requres that the penalty for sin must have due payment. His love in Christ Jesus provided the payment that His justice required for sinners like you and me. <br></span><br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Notice the purpose why God gave His only begotten Son for us:<br></span><br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,</span> </strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">I told you earlier that true love is the commitment of the will for the ultimate good of the one being loved. Here we are given the spiritual good that was in the mind of God why He gave His Son for us and it is stated negatively then positively. <br></span><br><br><br><br><br></strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Negatively, God gave His only begotten Son for us so that we should not perish: <br></span><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">not perish</span>............"<br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The word "perish" could also be translated as ruined, destroyed or lost. Sin separates us from God. And what greater ruin could a man experience than being separated from God. Death means separation. The cause of it is Sin. When Adam sinned, corruption set in. His spiritual relationship with God was corrupted, thus he became separated from God [this is spiritual death]. The immaterial part of him [his soul-spirit] is now capable of separating from his body [this is physical death]. And eventually, he will be separated forever from God when he will be judged in the Great White Throne Judgment and thrown into the lake of fire [this is eternal death]. <br></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">What ruin awaits every sinner!!! But God so loved us that He gave His only Begotten Son that we should not perish.</span> <br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Positively, God gave His Son for us that we may have eternal life:</span><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> but have everlasting life.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Eternal Life is actually a person. Eternal Life is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. It [Eternal Life] is also a quality of life. When one yields to the indwelling presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, when he allows the Lord Jesus Christ to live His life in and through him, the abundant life promised in John 10:10 flows from him. People will begin to see Christ [the Eternal Life] in his life. It [Eternal Life] is also a future inheritance. Someday, when the Lord comes, the frail, lowly and mortal bodies of those who have placed their trust in Christ alone for salvation will put on immortality--their bodies susceptible to death will be conformed unto the the glorious body of Him who saved them never to physically die again. </span><br><br><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">The sole means and condition of recieving Eternal Life is through faith, notice the verse again:</span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever</span><span style="color: #000000;"> in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br><br>The word "believe" here means to trust or rely or to have faith. It is not a mere intellectual head belief. We all believe here that a certain place in the U.S. called New York City exists. But we dont trust in New York City. Why would we trust a dead, dumb, lifeless, piece of land? What for? Believing that there is a place called New York City is different from trusting New York City. Again the word "believe" here means to trust, to have faith. <br><br><br><br>The object of our trust or reliance to recieve Eternal Life is a Person--the Savior Himself, notice the verse:<br><br><br>Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br><br><br><br>We may have the strongest faith in the world but if it is not anchored on the Savior, it avails us no salvation. Even if we have the strongest faith in the world but if the Savior did not die for our sins, there can be no salvation. For faith to be saving and true, it must be anchored on the right person. And that right person is the Savior. Of course, where else can we find salvation but in the Savior right?<br><br><br><br>Notice that Eternal Life could be recieved now while we are still alive: <br><br><br>Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br><br>At the moment of faith, the trusting sinner recieves eternal life. Notice that it is: "Have everlasting life" not "will have everlasting life." It is significant to note that the verb "have" here in the Greek is actually in the present tense. Present tenses in Greek are actions that are continuing. John was actually saying here: "....that whoever believes in Him should not perish but continually have eternal life."<br><br><br>You can have eternal life now. <br><br><br><br>Notice also the availability of eternal life offered by the love of God in Christ Jesus to His sinful creatures: <br><br><br>Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br><br><br>God's love is universal, "He so loved the world", hence, eternal life is to WHOEVER in the world that believes/trusts in His Son. <br><br>May you be one of those of the "whoever's" who come to Christ for eternal life and salvation. Jesus Christ died for our sins and rose back to life again for our salvation. Trust Him now.<br><br><br><br>Finally, notice also that the entire verse was actually given to give us the logic of Calvary: <br><br><br>Joh 3:16 "For </span>believes</strong><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Calvary happened for a reason. Calvary has a logic. As the coming Lenten season approaches, may you take time to ponder on Calvary. Why it happened? Why must it happen?</span></strong></div>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>    </span>In respect to the Bible, your Judeo-Christian book, no one knows who wrote<span>  </span>what, or where, or when. It is particularly difficult with the New Testament. There was no Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John. It looks now as if there never was even a Paul. ff there was, there is much debate over whether he did or did not write any of the letters ascribed to him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">T:<span>  </span>That is not true. We know the author of the Bible. It was God himself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">A: Oh? In what language did he write? What was his nationality? Where did he<span>  </span>write it and when? T: He spoke a universal tongue so that everyone could understand him. And<span>  </span>there are just certain things that we need not know. T:<span>  </span>We simply need to trust in<span>  </span>God. All that is necessary is that we have the Bible now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">A: If the most important thing is that you have the Bible now, then surely you<span>  </span>must look at it. We will stand or fall on one direct order from god to his people. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">This is Deuteronomy 21:18-21</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>      </span>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of<span>  </span>his father, or the voice of his mother and that, when they have chastened<span>  </span>him, will not hearken unto them:<span>  </span>Then shall his father and mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>     </span>And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you, and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>    </span>Is that how you want to treat a disobedient son? Remember that this is a<span>  </span>direct order from the lord and if you disobey him you are disobeying what has<span>  </span>been ordered by god.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">T:<span>  </span>That was the Old Testament. Jesus Christ changed all that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">A: Then why did Jesus Christ say in Matthew 5:17, 18:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>    </span>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come<span>  </span>to destroy but to fulfill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>      </span>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">the law,<span>  </span>till all be fulfilled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">T: You are taking out lot context again. That is one little bitty thing and you are trying to make a federal case out of it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">A: Not really, for Jesus Christ repeats this in Luke 16:17:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>    </span>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">S: Why do you insist on making fun of our religions, when we don’t [sic] stand<span>  </span>up as Christians and put Atheist down for their beliefs ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">A:<span>  </span>But the answer is so obvious! Your beliefs are ludicrous. You can't really believe that the devil appeared and wafted Jesus to a mountain from where he could see the entire world and that the devil, personally, tempted Jesus by holding a<span>  </span>long conversation with him? ( Matthew 4:l-11, Luke 4:2-13 ) Or, do you think that god did "moon" Moses -- that he shoved his bare buff at<span>  </span>Moses? ( Exodus 33:23, " And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. '<span>  </span>Or do you think that god farts mighty farts? ( Isaiah 16:ll, " Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp...") Or perhaps you plan to change your diet to suit your god. ( Isaiah 36:12 and 2<span>  </span>Kings 18:27,"....Hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?' )<span>  </span>When you accept stories<span>  </span>like that as "gospel," you know that people are going to laugh<span>  </span>at you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">A: You see how dangerous it is to follow the Bible to the letter ? When you say that this is an inspired you can get into a lot of difficulty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">                                            ATHEIST</span></p>

              <p>I always wondered whether God really existed until I saw Jesus in a vision. I saw because I believed and asked for it. But the truth is God let me saw His glory because He loves me. As He loves everyone of you so none should perish.</p>

              <p><strong>To Brey:</strong> Long time my friend!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, I wrote that to those Catholic friends of ours who will be celebrating their Lenten season. That is why I wrote:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>"Calvary happened for a reason. Calvary has a logic. As the coming Lenten season approaches, may you  take time to ponder on Calvary. Why it happened? Why must it happen?"</em></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">By "you" here, <em>I was here rerferring to our friends who will be celbrating it.  </em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I too believe personally that Christ never died on Easter. Personally, I dont use the word "Easter" myself when referring to Resurrection Sunday for it has pagan connotations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The article was never written to set the correct date of the Lord Jesus' death. Whether they celebrate it on the right date or not was not my concern in this article. That is another issue altogether as far as the article is concerned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they wish to discuss as to when the Lord of glory died on the Cross........we can discuss it in another thread.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks posting a link however for our guidance concerning the matter which you wrote about.</p>
