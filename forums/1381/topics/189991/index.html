(which can be disadvantageous for guys too, e.g. in sexual acts, the court i believe favor woman over man in sexual misconduct.)<br><br>church wise, even the female pastor in chc is abit more like siderole, with more focus on the male pastors during main sermons.<br><br>i don't know what should be the ideal scenerio, but girls don't need to be a helper all the time; nor should every girl be treated like a princess forever.<br><br>*in leadership positions, etc, that is dominant by guys. my mom successful oso hor, in making me fat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ito_^:</div><div class="quote_body">ok. why is he the son of god and not daughter or god?</div></blockquote>Why call Him a father at all?<br><br>Because we insist on trying to impose a gender on God... the thing is we must realize that God far exceeds a biological notion such as that. The notion of gender is to help us understand Him, but obviously this label is actually too <span style="font-style: italic;">weak </span>a notion.<br><br>But having said that, using no terms on God does not help us at all. It's as good as saying nothing about Him. And trying to be politically correct does not help at all, except to degenerate any ideas that He is into terms that everybody can be comfortable with. It is obvious He is something, and He is also not something else. Refering to Him as a 'He', hardly means that He has a gender, but it seems to imply that rather, as C.S. Lewis said, God is such so powerful and awe inspiring that we are [I]all[i] feminine in relation to Him. He is always makes the first move, and we can only respond.<br><br>Hence many parts of the way He relates to us we may very well assign a male notion to, not because He is literally male, and not also because He is metaphorically male, but simply because He is [i]trans-male[/I], far more the father, lover, brother, friend then any man could ever beÂ… and more. Obviously there is a reason He is referred to as 'He', and I suspect that is a big part of the notion.<br><br>Now this of course by no means suppose that we are forbidden to try to discover any feminine traits in God, but we cannot do it for the sake of political correctness lest we destroy the way we should really understand Him as. It is obvious that God can also mother and nurture far better then the greatest instincts of any woman, but to suggest that we should relate to Him as if He was an equal split of male and female features would be erroneous, not because He is not that way, but simply because He is beyond thatÂ… and it is in our good to regard Him in masculine notions, lest we not understand anything at all.<br><br>Now on being the Son of God and not a Daughter, yet again it seems to me that Jesus' function (to humanity say the least) was to be of that of the returning King, the Prince of Light, the Redeemer. A lot of the incarnation involved doing things that are male responsibilities. Could God have chosen a different way to incarnate and let us understand it by? Perhaps, but He choose this way for a reason, and these are my plausible speculationsÂ… perhaps if the God-given notion of gender was like the Amazons, it might have been different. But it's obvious that the issue has to be some ways, and if it's some ways it's not the other way.<br><br>Could he have made the seas purple? Why not, but He choose blue. Does this mean that purple is inferior to blue?<br></div>
