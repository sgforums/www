Again, the generalisation is not wrong but it it is not always right. I believe I am called to use my passion and talent for rock music to reach out to an unique group of people, people on the edge. People who may not walk into a church playing hymns or hillsongs. These are punks, skins or just rebellious teens u see around you. We believe that our on stage ministry which is the music can DRAW them to us and our off stage ministry which is our friendship can DRAW them to GOD. However, again my traditional church frens or pastors will waved my passion off as trends, as not in "the scheme of God". They feel that God does not appreciate rock music and will never use it to reach people. I disagree of cos but well again I work according to my convictions.
