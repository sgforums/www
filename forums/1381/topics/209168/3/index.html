            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Did a historical Jesus exists?</strong><br><br>May i quote Josh MacDowell?<br><br>There are still many people today who make the claim that Jesus never existed, that He was only a mythical character.<br><br>Bertrand Russell puts it this way, Â“I may say that one is not concerned with the historical question. Historically, it is quite doubtful whether Christ ever existed at all, and if He did we do not know anything about Him, so I am not concerned with the historical question, which is a very difficult one. I am concerned with Christ as He appears in the GospelsÂ” (Why I Am Not a Christian, p. 11, note 8].<br><br>However, those who make such an accusation are certainly not historians, but are surprisingly ignorant of the facts.<br><br>The New Testament contains twenty-seven separate documents which were written in the first century a.d. These writings contain the story of the life of Jesus and the beginnings of the Christian church from about 4 b.c. until the decade of the a.d. nineties.<br><br>The facts were recorded by eyewitnesses, who gave firsthand testimony to what they had seen and heard. Â“What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of LifeÂ” (I John 1:1, NASB).<br><br>Moreover, the existence of Jesus is recorded by the Jewish historian, Flavius Josephus, who was born in a.d. 37, Â“Now there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful worksÂ—a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles.<br><br><strong> Â“He was (the) Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those who loved him at the firs did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this dayÂ” (Antiquities, XVIII, III).</strong><br><br>Although this passage has been contested because of the reference to Jesus being the Christ and rising from the dead, the fact of His existence is not in question.<br><br>Cornelius Tacitus (a.d. 112), a Roman historian, writing about the reign of Nero, refers to Jesus Christ and the existence of Christians in Rome (Annals, XV, 44). Tacitus, elsewhere in his Histories, refers to Christianity when alluding to the burning of the temple of Jerusalem in a.d. 70. This has been preserved by Sulpicius Severus (Chronicles 30:6).<br><br>There are other references to Jesus or His followers, such as the Roman historian, Seutonius (a.d. 120) in Life of Claudius, 25.4, and Lives of the Caesars, 26.2, and Pliny the younger (a.d. 112) in his Epistles, X. 96.<br><br>This testimony, both Christian and non-Christian, is more than sufficient to lay to rest any idea that Jesus, in fact, never existed. In light of the evidence, it is absurd to hold such a view. We know more about the life of Jesus than just about any other figure in the ancient world. His birth, life, and death are revealed in much more detail than most ancient figures whose existence is taken for granted by historians.<br><br>After examining the evidence about the life of Christ from contemporary sources apart from the New Testament, Roderic Dunkerley concluded, Â“In none of these various testimonies to the fact of Christ is there any slightest hint or idea that he was not a real historical person.<br><br>Â“Indeed it has been arguedÂ—and I think very rightlyÂ—that myth theories of the beginnings of Christianity are modern speculative hypotheses motivated by unreasoning prejudice and dislike. Â‘It would never enter anyoneÂ’s head,Â’ says Merezhovsky, Â‘to ask whether Jesus had lived, unless before asking the question the mind had been darkened by the wish that he had not livedÂ’Â” (Roderic Dunkerley, Beyond the Gospels, pp. 29, 30).<br><br></div>

He was [the] Christ; (64) and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, <strong>for he appeared to them <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]alive again</span></strong> the third day,[/b] as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.<br><br>Josephus, F. 1996, c1987.

Hendrickson: Peabody<br><br><strong><br>Josh MacDowell on circualr reasoning</strong><br><br>A charge that is frequently leveled against the Bible is that Christians argue in circles. The charge goes that Christians claim the Bible is the inspired Word of God and, as a proof of this contention, they quote a passage from the Bible that says so.<br><br>This type of argumentation is known as begging the question, or circular reasoning. Nothing is proved in this type of argumentation. It is based on assuming something to be true, using that assumption as fact to prove another assumption and using the Â“provedÂ” assumption to prove your original assumption!<br><br>Some Christians (and many non-Christians!) do argue in circles, but about the Bible they certainly donÂ’t need to.<br>Instead of assuming the Bible is the Word of God, we can begin by demonstrating that the Scriptures are basically reliable and trustworthy historical documents. This is confirmed by applying the ordinary test of historical criticism to the Scriptures.<br><br>Once it is established that the Bible is a valid historical record, the next point is realizing that Jesus Christ claims to be the unique Son of God and that He bases this claim on His forthcoming resurrection from the dead.<br>Next, we examine the evidence for the resurrection contained in this historic document and find that the arguments overwhelmingly support the contention that Christ has risen from the dead. If this is true, then He is the unique Son of God as He claimed to be. If He is indeed God, then He speaks with authority on all matters.<br><br>Since Jesus considered the Old Testament to be the Word of God (Matthew 15:1Â–4; 5:17, 18] and promised His disciples, who either wrote or had control over the writing of the New Testament books, that the Holy Spirit would bring all things back to their remembrance (John 14:26), we can insist, with sound and accurate logic, that the Bible is GodÂ’s word. This is not circular reasoning. It is establishing certain facts and basing conclusions on the sound logical outcome of these facts. The case for Christianity can be established by ordinary means of historical investigation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>by Josh MacDowell<br><br><strong>Did Jesus actually rise from the dead? Does it really matter whether He did or didnÂ’t?</strong><br><br>Ronald Gregor Smith gives a typical reply, Â“So far as historicity is concernedÂ…  it is necessary to explain: We may freely say that the bones of Jesus lie somewhere in Palestine. Christian faith is not destroyed by this admission.<br><br>Â“On the contrary, only now, when this has been said, are we in a position to ask about the meaning of the resurrection as an integral part of the message concerning JesusÂ” (Secular Christianity, London, Collins, 1966, p. 103).<br><br>Contrary to this point of view, it does matter to Christianity whether or not it is true that Christ came back from the dead, because Christianity stands or falls on the resurrection of Jesus Christ (I Corinthians 15:12Â–19). If Jesus did not come back from the dead, then the Christian faith crumbles.<br><br>Fortunately, one of the most well-attested events in the ancient world is the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. When confronted by the religious leaders of His day, Jesus was asked for a sign to demonstrate that He was the promised Messiah.<br><br>He answered, Â“An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet; for just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earthÂ” (Matthew 12:39, 40, NASB).<br><br>The sign of the resurrection was meant to set Jesus apart from anyone else who ever lived, and it would designate Him the Son of God (Romans 1:4).<br>The accounts of His appearances are recorded for us by eyewitnesses to whom Jesus appeared alive over a forty-day period after His public crucifixion.<br><br>As the scriptural account sets forth, to these Â“he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of GodÂ” (Acts 1:3, KJV).<br><br>Writing about a.d. 56, the apostle Paul mentions the fact that more than 500 people had witnessed the resurrected Christ at one time and most of them were still living when he wrote (I Corinthians 15:6). This statement is somewhat of a challenge to those who might not have believed, since Paul is saying that there are many people yet living who could be interviewed to find out if Christ had indeed risen.<br><br>The historical evidence is more than sufficient to satisfy the curiosity of the honest inquirer. This can be seen not only by the positive defense that can be made for the case for the resurrection, but also by the lack of any evidence for an alternative explanation. The theories attempting to give an alternative explanation to the resurrection take more faith to believe than the resurrection itself.<br><br>Frank Morrison, who was an agnostic journalist, attempted to write a book refuting the resurrection of Christ. After much investigation, his opinion changed and he became a believer in Jesus Christ. This is how Morrison described what happened to him:<br><br>Â“This study is in some ways so unusual and provocative that the writer thinks it desirable to state here very briefly how the book came to take its present form. In one sense it could have taken no other, for it is essentially a confession, the inner story of a man who originally set out to write one kind of book and found himself compelled by the sheer force of circumstances to write another.<br><br>Â“It is not that the facts altered, for they are recorded imperishably in the monuments and in the pages of human history. But the interpretation to be put on the facts underwent a changeÂ” (Who Moved the Stone? Preface, Zondervan, 1971).<br><br>Morrison discovered that Christ was publicly put in the tomb on Friday, but on Sunday morning the body was missing. If He did not rise from the dead, then someone took the body. There are three interest groups that could possibly have taken the body: the Romans, the Jews, or the disciples.<br><br>The Romans would have had no reason to steal the body, since they wanted to keep the peace in Palestine. The idea was to keep the provinces as quiet as possible, and stealing the body of Christ would not accomplish this objective.<br><br>The Jews would not have taken the body, because the last thing they wanted was a proclamation of the resurrection. They are the ones who asked for the guard, according to Matthew 27.<br><br>The disciples of Jesus had no reason to steal the body, and if they did, they later died for something they knew to be untrue. Moreover, the religion which they proclaimed emphasized telling the truth and not lying. Their actions would have been inconsistent with that which they knew to be true and commanded others to follow.<br><br>The other reasonable explanation is that Christ has risen, and the eyewitnesses make it plain this is the case. The disciples of Jesus may not have been as sophisticated as twentieth century man in the realm of scientific knowledge, but they surely knew the difference between someone who was dead and someone who wasnÂ’t.<br><br>As Simon Peter said, Â“For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majestyÂ” (II Peter 1:16, NASB).<br><br></div>
