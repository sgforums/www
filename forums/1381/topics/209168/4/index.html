After the Jewish garrison of Yodfat was taken under siege, the Romans invaded, killed thousands, and the remaining survivors who had managed to elude the forces committed suicide. However, in circumstances that are somewhat unclear (see also Josephus problem), <strong>Josephus surrendered to the Roman forces invading Galilee in July 67. He became a prisoner and provided the Romans with intelligence on the ongoing revolt.</strong> The Roman forces were led by Flavius Vespasian and his son Titus, both subsequently Roman emperors. In 69 Josephus was released (cf. War IV.622-629) and according to Josephus' own account, he appears to have played some role as a negotiator with the defenders in the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.</blockquote>Haha .. I'm sure you are not the only one. Christians only know (if they know) Josephus wrote about the resurrection of Christ.</div>
