It's like punishing mankind for the sins of 2 individuals, and redemption can only be gained if the later generation (humans as a whole) go back to him based on faith that he is the only savior for their sins.<br><br>Anyway it's like God is this landlord, Adam and Eve his tenants.

Having needs and wants and being about differentiate between right and wrong, having an ego etc?<br><br>If the bible says we must come to God by faith bcos only faith pleases God, and not good works, it makes God look more like a ego-maniac  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Anyway, I'm not an atheist nor am I anti-christian.<br><br>I believe there is a god, but is the bible potraying him as the god he is? I don't know, but there are too many things in the bible itself that I'm too lazy to type and don't agree with.

If an unbeliever reads it, the words are still dead. If a believer reads it, the words suddenly become alive and transform his life.</div>

If your theory can explain more things, you now have [a better approximation to] the truth.</div>
