            <div class='col-md body'>aiya. i guess in the end, u're right. terrorism should be viewed as an entity in itself, and not muddle the situation with religion or whatnot.<br><br>it can come in many forms, and from different motivations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
