            <div class='col-md body'>The stations of the cross are a sacramental.<br><br>In looking at one station he sees Our Lord on trial before Pilate;<br>in another he sees Him crowned with thorns;<br>in another, scourged;<br>in another, carrying His Cross;<br>in another, crucified;<br>in another, dead and laid in the tomb.<br><br>Before all these pictures he reflects on the sufferings of Our Saviour,<br>and begins to hate sin, that caused them. Then he thinks, of his own sins, and<br>begins to be sorry for them. This sorrow, caused by going around the stations,<br>brings him grace that remits venial sins. When we receive the Sacraments we<br>always get the grace of the Sacraments when we are rightly disposed; but in<br>using the sacramentals, the more devotion we have the more grace we receive.<br><br>(Baltimore Catechism Part 4 Lesson 27)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.  (Ephesians 2:8,9)<br><br>By pondering over the last moments of Christ life on earth, one can see the humiliation and shame, pain and hurts our Redeemer went through and for a moment feel sorrowful for our own sins. True repentance is God-origined and does not comes from us seeing some sorrowful wall plagues and reminded of His death.  And the  grace, all sufficient grace is given to us when Christ died on the cross. Never by means of our own actions or devotion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In any case, here are some facts.<br><br>The earliest precedents for the Stations of the Cross to back to the 400s, but the first true forms of the Stations developed in the 1400s. These were modeled after the via dolorosa in Jerusalem, which had been marked out since the early centuries and used as a devotional site for pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem.<br><br>The devotion of the Way of the Cross spread to monasteries around the Christian world as a way of imitating the pilgrim route in Jerusalem, and eventually it became standard in parishes.<br><br>Below are the stations and their biblical evidence.<br><br>1. Jesus is condemned -- Luke 23:24<br>2. Jesus carries his cross -- John 19:17<br>3. Jesus falls the first time -- By inference from stations 2 and 5<br>4. Jesus meets his mother -- By inference from John 19:25-27<br>5. Simon of Cyrene helps carry the cross -- Matthew 27:32<br>6. Veronica wipes Jesus' face -- Not recorded in Scripture<br>7. Jesus falls a second time -- Not recorded in Scripture<br>8. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem -- Luke 23:27-31<br>9. Jesus falls the third time -- Not recorded in Scripture<br>10. Jesus is stripped of his garments -- John 19:23<br>11. Jesus is nailed to the cross -- Mark 15:24<br>12. Jesus dies on the cross -- Mark 15:37<br>13. His body is taken down from the cross -- Luke 23:53<br>14. His body is laid in the tomb -- Matthew 27:60<br><br>You won't find any for St Veronica, it must have been developed during the middle ages.<br><br><a href="http://www.cin.org/users/james/files/stations.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cin.org/users/james/files/stations.htm</a></div>
