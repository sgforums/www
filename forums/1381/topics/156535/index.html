Again, and as a rule, the slaughtering of the cattle should be fully separated from those that are considered Haram such as pigs, dogs, etc. It can only be carried out or performed by a Muslim who is of sound mind, mature, and who fully understands the fundamentals, rules and conditions related to zabihah (slaughtering). The act of Halal slaughtering begins with the positioning of the animal in the direction of Mecca, Saudi Arabia followed by an incision in the neck at a point below the glottis (Adam's apple). The phrase <strong> "Bismillah" (in the name of Allah) </strong> is compulsory and must be immediately recited and invoked during the act. The slaughtering must sever the trachea, the esophagus, and the carotid arteries and jugular veins in one stroke to bring about an immediate and massive hemorrhage (for this purpose, a very sharp stainless knife is recommended). The sawing action of slaughtering for large animal like cattle is permitted as long as the cutting device is not lifted. Any lifting of the knife is considered as the end of one act of slaughtering. In other words, multiple slaughtering acts on one animal are not allowed."</div>
