              <p>its written in the bible. the only way he will change is he gave up christianity. otherwise forget it, he still holds true the same views as before.</p>
              <p>not asking the community to judge him, but to condemn him as his actions was uncalled for and cause friction among other faiths and their followers. do u know that what he did was seditious. what if other followers were to react and do something stupid as a result?</p>
              <p>ok your answers to my question as to why the community did not condemn the actions of Rony Tan explains why the community did not unite and condemn Rony Tan. If the community did speak against him, at least the damage done to the religion is not irreparable. so dun blame the non believers for believing that christianity is not tolerant towards other faiths and the preachings inside. actions speaks louder than words.</p>

              <p>Hi there, I wish to contribute to this thread.</p>
              <p>God is never against us being rich. Indeed, He wants us to live in great prosperity. If you read the book of Genesis, God blessed Abraham with great riches and glory(Gen 13:2). He did the same with Solomon, David and many others. </p>
              <p>However, it is definitely an issue if a Christian worship money instead of God. </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"<strong>For the love of money is the root of all evil:</strong> which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." 1 Timothy 6:10</span></p>
              <p>This was what God meant when He said that you can't worship both God and Money. </p>
              <p>I hope I've helped in answering your questions. I am not very good with the bible yet. But I can try my best if you have any more questions. </p>
              <p>God bless. </p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With all due respect to the bible and the Christian faith, i think in today's world the <strong>lack</strong> of money is the root of all evil.</p>

              <p>in reply to the TS, it is quite normal to worship god and receive his blessings, no?</p>
              <p>Pastors do worship God and in return get blessed. Be it the offerings of the people, I believe they draw a salary. And accordingly, some pastors get more, some get less.</p>
              <p>Money is a tool in life that we all need. Be it if U are a pastor, a christian or even a person of other respected faiths.</p>
              <p>"If God do not promise prosperity and serving God means only
                                          poverty and hardship, would the disciples 
                  embracing the prosperity
                                          gospel still keep their faith or will they 
                  worship tua pek kong
                                          instead." What does Tua Pek Kong promises you that someone would worship him? (no disrespect).  Peace/Health/Good life?? Would any worship if he promises you otherwise?"</p>
              <p>"These pastors whom live in district 10, who wear branded
                                          clothing and drive branded car and who worship 
                  money, have these
                                          pastors lost their moral compass to preach?</p>
              <p>There are many poor people in singapore. The 
                  money would
                                          certainly be better used to help them in their 
                  poverty."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do believe there are many avenues to help the poor. If I am not wrong, many religious bodies in sgp, do help out the society in many ways be it funding, or etc. Some prefer to go about it in a quiet way, but it doesn't mean they are not.</p>
              <p>My two cents.</p>

              <p>not asking the community to judge him, but to condemn him as his

              <p>ok your answers to my question as to why the community did not
              condemn the actions of Rony Tan explains why the community did not
              unite and condemn Rony Tan. If the community did speak against him,
              at least the damage done to the religion is not irreparable. so dun
              blame the non believers for believing that christianity is not
              tolerant towards other faiths and the preachings inside. actions
              speaks louder than words.</p>

              <p>i do believe certain actions are taken but I don't think the washing dirty linens in public is the best approach.</p>
              <p>Also by their big heart and higher understanding, other religious leaders have accepted his forgiveness. I think this is an intelligent way to diffuse the tension. Kudos to them.</p>
              <p>"actions

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>I would like to hold a mini-forum for a discussion on the moral

              of the poor.</p>
              <p>Jesus said that one cannot serve both money or God.</p>
              <p>One would only serve one master and hate the other.</p>
              <p>but the pastors who are preaching prosperity bible have proven
              jesus wrong.</p>
              <p>These pastors whom live in district 10, who wear branded
              clothing and drive branded car and who worship money, have these
              pastors lost their moral compass to preach?</p>
              <p>There are many poor people in singapore. The money would
              certainly be better used to help them in their poverty.</p>
              <p>I would also like to hear from fellow christians on the opinion
              on money and God.</p>
              <p>If God do not promise prosperity and serving God means only
              poverty and hardship, would the disciples embracing the prosperity
