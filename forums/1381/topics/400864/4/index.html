              <p>Yes , some korean churches, the pastors drive fancy sport cars , thier kids in overseas live in luxury condo's and the likes, but if they really went against God's way, why so worried ? hell I even know some of them. But u guys dont know what happened to some of them didnt u ? Their material wealth counts for nothing when they are dead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are u all in some way personally involved in such churches ? Did they  managed to "scum" money of you guys ? Felt the pinch ?</p>
              <p>What about other churches that are genuinely helping those around them that does not preach the doctrines like those churches ?</p>

              <p>dun worry they cant. why cant they? because they are not for profit organisations or missions. the only way they can get public listed is to start a business or acquire other businesses, just like CHC acquiring Suntec Reit recently isnt it.</p>
              <p>question is, how the hell has a church got to do with acquiring business or reits for.</p>

              <p><br>why should the pictures of tua pek kong be offensive to christians?</p>
              <p>It has also been the government's stand that all the religions are equal and be shown equal respect.</p>
              <p>It is inconsiderate of you to even suggest the removal of the pics.</p>
              <p>Are the pics illegal to begin with?</p>
              <p>they are just pictures of tua pek kong, that's all. why be offended?</p>

              <p>its written in the bible. the only way he will change is he gave
              up christianity. otherwise forget it, he still holds true the same

              <p>not asking the community to judge him, but to condemn him as his
              actions was uncalled for and cause friction among other faiths and
              their followers. do u know that what he did was seditious. what if
              other followers were to react and do something stupid as a
              result?</p>
              <p>ok your answers to my question as to why the community did not
              condemn the actions of Rony Tan explains why the community did not
              unite and condemn Rony Tan. If the community did speak against him,
              at least the damage done to the religion is not irreparable. so dun
              blame the non believers for believing that christianity is not
              tolerant towards other faiths and the preachings inside. actions
              speaks louder than words.</p>
