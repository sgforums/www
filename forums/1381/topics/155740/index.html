            <div class='col-md body'>I saw some people recently trying to convince forumers that there is god. Is this the big issue? I think the question in most people mind, except the atheists of course, is that whether the bible is truthful, and whether the intepretations are correct.<br><br>Icemoon and MCsquare have just pointed out in another threads, human arent infallible. I dont mean you start to discard the bible, but for those who are so dogmatic as to take the bible words literally, especially when they evangelise, do take some time to take a step back, and make some judgement calls. For those who are ever so asserive when they want to convert non believers, take a step back and analyse whetherwhat you are doing is right, rather than push everything down other people throats.<br><br>I just watched Cleopatra on Discovery, and they discovered that she probably didnt die of suicide.

            <div class='col-md body'>Q&amp;A time:<br><br>Am I[a Jew] allowed to enter a church or mosque?<br>Entering a mosque does not pose a problem, since Islam is based on a belief in the one-and-only G-d.<br><br>Entering a Church however, is problematic as Christianity is based on belief in the Trinity, a concept in which G-d is not 'one-and-only' but has partners as well.<br><br>[According to many Halachic authorities, belief in the trinity is only forbidden for a Jew. A non-Jew may follow these tenets since belief in the omnipotent G-d is still present.]<br><br>Therefore, it is forbidden for a Jew to enter the sanctuary of the church, i.e. where the actual prayer services are held. This could be misinterpreted as identification with the philosophy. However, it is permitted to enter other rooms in a church for non-religious purposes.<br><br>N. Silberberg<br></div>
