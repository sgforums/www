            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I suppose others here may refer you to a link to answer your question, but here's my take. May be inaccurate. Hope others can correct me.<br><br>1. In the beginning there's only one church, the Catholic Church. You can say it started with the chief apostle Peter since he was the first Pope (Bishop of Rome). Ok, this one is a bit legendary, I must admit, since whether Peter went to Rome is still a mystery. This is the church who convened the important Councils (Chalcedon, Nicea etc.) and gave us the most fundamental doctrines of God. Fast forward to the turn of the first millenium. The Great Schism! The Catholic Church split into two, the Eastern and Western. The Eastern, without much changes, becomes the Eastern Orthodox Church we find today. The Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox all belong to this umbrella. This is 1 of the 3 major denominations. The Western is the Catholic Church, which is based in Europe. This is another of the 3 major denominations. Fast forward 1/2 millenium. The Reformation! Protestantism was born. Started by Luther with his famous 95 theses, but expanded upon by Calvin and Zwingli(sp?). This is the last major denomination.<br><br>2. Methodist and Anglican are both protestant in nature. Methodist was started by famous pracher and hymn writer [John?] Wesley around the 18 or 19 century. In contrast, the Reformation happened around the 15-16 century. Anglican, if you pardon me, is more of like a bastardized version of protestant and catholic. There is a noticeable hierarchy like the catholic, with the monarch of England as the head and all the fanciful titles like bishops and archbishop.<br><br>Well, this is roughly what I remember without referring to any source.

            <div class='col-md body'>Since you mentioned Methodist, here's something interesting.<br><br>Remember I told you the founder was a man called Wesley? Now what does this name remind you of?<br><br>You read the chinese novelist Ni2 Kuang4's books? One of his most famous character is a guy in a scientific thriller called Wei4 Si1 Li3, who has a girlfriend called Bai2 Su4.<br><br>Coincidentally, our Methodist founder here is referred to as Wei4 Si1 Li3 in chinese. The exact same wording.<br><br>I'm sure many people don't know what is Methodist called in chinese. No, don't bother translating Me-tho-dist into chinese syllabus. The correct translation is Wei4 Li3, just remove the middle word.<br><br>Sadly today, traces of the founder's name is removed but in the chinese translation.<br><br>PS: Well, I suppose those students of Methodist schools, like Fairfield Methodist, will know the translation.

This is a fellowship within one, holy, catholic and apostolic church, of those diocese, provinces or regional churches in communion with the See of Canterbury.<br><br>* The Anglican Communion is wide-ranging, doctrinally as well as geographically, but yet there are certain beliefs which unite Anglicans. The Lambeth Quadrilateral, set out at the Lambeth Conference in 1888, defines these as:<br>* The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as "containing all things necessary to salvation," and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.<br>* The Apostles' Creed as the Baptismal Symbol, and the Nicene Creed as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.<br>* The two sacraments ordained by Christ himself - Baptism and Holy Communion - ministered with unfailing use of Christ's words of institution and of the elements ordained by him.<br>* The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of his Church.<br><br>Churches within this Communion are influenced by the Church of England in many ways, such as in matters of faith (39 Articles of Religion), church government (Episcopal), worship and liturgy (Book of Common Prayer), church laws (Canons of the Church of England) and church ordinances (Sacraments and Sacramental Ministries).<br><br>The 39 Articles of Religion<br>As part of the universal Church of Christ, inheriting the faith of the early Church, the Anglican Church does not subscribe to doctrines different from that of the universal Church. However, the Anglican Church possesses certain distinctives in the way it received the Christian faith and tradition, and these are captured in the 39 Articles of Religion.<br><br>Canon A5, Canons of Church of England: "The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrines are to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal."<br><br>These Articles of Religion together with the Creeds, Catechism, Litany, Church Calendar, Lectionary, and Psalter, were translated and compiled by Thomas Granmer in 1549, into the Book of Common Prayer which was authorised in 1662.<br><br>(Source: http://www.livingstreams.org.sg/sac/info/beliefs/anglican.html)<br><br></div>
