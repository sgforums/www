            <div class='col-md body'>Christian churches to work for code on conversion<br>By Robert Evans<br><br>GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Council of Churches (WCC), which groups Protestant and Orthodox believers, said on Monday it was launching a joint effort with the Vatican to shape a code of conduct on religious conversion.<br><br>And a senior WCC official said it was hoped that the essentially intra-Christian project would spark discussion on the issue among Muslims -- who take a stern view of people leaving the faith -- and among followers of other religions.<br><br>"We hope to produce a code that will ensure that believers commitment to their faith never translates into denigration of another," said Hans Ucko, head of the 348-member WCC's Office on Inter-religious Relations and Dialogue.<br><br>The initiative, billed as a three-year study project, will be joined on the Catholic side by the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue, which hosts a first, four-day, meeting in Rome from Wednesday.<br><br>Ucko told Reuters the idea of rules on proselytising had arisen several years ago during regular contacts between the Geneva-based WCC and the Vatican after methods used by Christian missionaries in India had caused problems for local Christians.<br><br>But he said it was not linked to a recent high-profile controversy involving many Western political and church leaders, including Pope Benedict, in defending a 40-year-old Afghan facing a death sentence in Kabul for converting to Christianity.<br><br>The man, Abdur Rahman, was freed from jail to condemnation from many Muslim clerics after intervention by Western-backed President Hamid Karzai, and now lives in Italy.<br><br>CRUSADING<br><br>"This is basically an intra-Christian project, a dialogue between Christians, because although some take a low-key approach others embark on what can be seen as crusading which offends people of other religions," said Ucko.<br><br>There had been examples of this in Sri Lanka after the tsunami tidal wave of December 2004 when a drive by foreign missionaries to win converts among local Buddhists led to attacks on long-established local Christians, he added.<br><br>But Christians were not alone in active proselytising. "In some parts of the world, Muslims also work to make non-Muslims embrace Islam," said Ucko.<br><br>The Rome meeting this week would be attended by representatives of other faiths, including Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims and indigenous religious traditions. Muslim contacts had expressed interest in the project, Ucko said.<br><br>Many Muslim scholars equate "apostasy" -- or leaving the faith -- with treason in secular societies, arguing that Islam is a state as well as religious structure. In many Islamic countries, including Iran, apostates can be put to death.<br><br>"The issue also touches on religious freedom," said Ucko. "In the world we live in today, changing one's religion should not be seen as a betrayal of Islam or of any other faith."<br></div>

I don't think that's much of a life either. Survival it seems, is not the greatest virtue.<br><br>If you got a choice between living in a world where people didn't care much about what they thought and spent life living simply for the moment, where the greatest goal was the avoid pain and death for as long as possible... or would you take in a world that is dangerous, full of evil and horrors, but yet allow that backdrop to let the virtues and the saints shine through? A world in which everyone lives vividly alive? Which is the truly moral world, in which world are the creatures truly making any moral choice at all?<br><br>Having to choose between a safe world where your soul is a puddle of formless jelly and another where you have the potential to become something extremely evil or something unimainably good... which would it be?<br><br>There is a third, and more untried route. In involves disagreeing greatly with people, but still being able to love them. Because according to a certain curious worldview, Love is the greatest virtue.</div>

Its even worse to see that even in religions people still can choose discard and accept what they dont like and like to fulfill self interest and prejudices. i mean, heck, its allright to accept fully the Bibles, whose gospels were chosen by church leaders, and whatever doctrines they have laid down, but not the codes or even present doctrines.
