            <div class='col-md body'>Let me start.<br><br>"men is created in the image of God"<br><br>This statement certainly doesnt imply any phsycal likeness to God. Scripture teaches that God is a spirit and doesnt have physical parts like a man(John 4:24) The bible uses anthropomorphic expressions, such as"the hand of God" only to accommodate our human incapacity to think in any other terms. The strong prohibitation against man's representing God by graven image was given becauseno one had ever seen God; therefore, no one could know wad he looks like. Nothing on earth can represent his spirit(deut 4:15-23)<br><br>The image of God in man has to do, rather, with personality. According to D.M. edwards, ""Man has a free, self consious, rational personality like that of God. A nature, capable of distinguishing right and wrong, and of ascending to the hights of spiritual attainment and communication with God""<br><br>The feeling qualities of feeling, sorrow, communicateing and desire for relationship are part of His personality<br><br>--The original man <span style="font-style: italic;">was intelligent</span>. he could give names to all the animals when they were presented to him(gen2:19-20). He had the power of reasoning and thought, as displayed by SIS. In speaking, he could connect words and ideas. he could and did commune with God.<br><br>--<span style="font-style: italic;">Moral and spiritual</span> qualities differenciated humankind from all other creatures. God's image gave then an awareness, a sense of right and wrong(gen. 3)This 'knowing' from God means that God's people love love and hate evil and differenciate between the two options. This is not an optional software! the new testament calls this 'conscience'.<br><br>--<span style="font-style: italic;">Individual seperateness</span> distinguishes the God and mankind from each other-each beinghis own person. All people are endowed with God's image and seperate form all other ppl. Obviously,I am not you and you r not me and neither of us is God.<br><br>The significance of this seperatenessis that it clarifies our understanding of God as an approchable individual. He is not an amorphous blob, a genie, a pgost, or even 'the force'. We can communicate person-to-person and understand each other.<br><br>above is 100% had typed, so pls read seriously.thx<br>Got this thing from the book. Christians here, any questions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Let me start.<br><br>"men is created in the image of God"<br><br>This statement certainly doesnt imply any phsycal likeness to God. Scripture teaches that God is a spirit and doesnt have physical parts like a man(John 4:24) The bible uses anthropomorphic expressions, such as"the hand of God" only to accommodate our human incapacity to think in any other terms. The strong prohibitation against man's representing God by graven image was given becauseno one had ever seen God; therefore, no one could know wad he looks like. Nothing on earth can represent his spirit(deut 4:15-23)<br><br>The image of God in man has to do, rather, with personality. According to D.M. edwards, ""Man has a free, self consious, rational personality like that of God. A nature, capable of distinguishing right and wrong, and of ascending to the hights of spiritual attainment and communication with God""<br><br>The feeling qualities of feeling, sorrow, communicateing and desire for relationship are part of His personality<br><br>--The original man was intelligent. he could give names to all the animals when they were presented to him(gen2:19-20). He had the power of reasoning and thought, as displayed by SIS. In speaking, he could connect words and ideas. he could and did commune with God.<br><br>--Moral and spiritual qualities differenciated humankind from all other creatures. God's image gave then an awareness, a sense of right and wrong(gen. 3)This 'knowing' from God means that God's people love love and hate evil and differenciate between the two options. This is not an optional software! the new testament calls this 'conscience'.<br><br>--Individual seperateness distinguishes the God and mankind from each other-each beinghis own person. All people are endowed with God's image and seperate form all other ppl. Obviously,I am not you and you r not me and neither of us is God.<br><br>The significance of this seperatenessis that it clarifies our understanding of God as an approchable individual. He is not an amorphous blob, a genie, a pgost, or even 'the force'. We can communicate person-to-person and understand each other.<br><br>above is 100% had typed, so pls read seriously.thx<br>Got this thing from the book. Christians here, any questions?</blockquote>Thank you for sharing with us on this topic. However, I disagree a bit on this point. It was true that man was created in gods image , however, man has become corrupted because of sin.<br><br>He is no longer a likeness of god. Imho, the only man who is in god's image was Jesus. He was perfect, sinless and holy. Man is sinful and full of evil and the evil one, no one can ever be truely said to be in gods image as he is perfect.<br><br>Yet it is so true that god is no genie, blob or even the force. He is real and present around us , able to speak to our hearts and soul. His word contained in the bible is sharper then a double edge sword able to cut to the very soul.<br><br>p.s N.U.S Superstar be wary for you are in danger of hellfire itself<br><br>Mark 3:28-29<br><br>28 I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. 29 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin."</div>
