            <div class='col-md body'>If we look at this thing objectively, the gospel of judas basically adds another dimension to one of history's most prolific character. I agree with what the experts said, the gospel of judas like many other gospels that never made it into the mainstream bible, are more for advance learning about the faith of christianity. even though the whole idea of christianity is about jesus dying for mankind's sins and only through him that sinners are able to gain salvation, I'm pretty sure there are many people out there who would like to learn more about christianity, gain a deeper understanding of our faith.<br><br>Don't you guys ever wonder about Judas? About what he was thinking n feeling when he betrayed jesus? dont christians ever question about the motives of the characters in the bible? for me, i've learnt that jesus death was a plan of god. and i have always been puzzled as to why a jesus disciple who obviously knew jesus is the son of god, the one who could show mankind the way, choose to betray jesus for a pity sum of money! it's like throwing away a diamond for a few cents. the only reason i could see judas doing that was he knows he's doing the will of god, offering the greatest sacrifice of all, JESUS! im not challenging the beliefs of people that judas is a villian, I just feel that there is alot more than we have learnt so far, and all these so called gnostic gospels offer another view or even explanations to some of our questions. I must say, the fact that there is a gospel of judas all the more strengthened my faith in christianity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"the only reason i could see judas doing that was he knows he's doing the will of god, offering the greatest sacrifice of all, JESUS!"</strong><br><br>Within the Plan of God ...yes - but Judas knows ? hrmmm, ..i wonder how could a man who strays from the Discipleship of God Himself still knows about the Will of God ?!<br><br>Gospel of Judas - personally, i have a problem with the word "Gospel of" used in this context.  Translated to more understandable terms - it means the "Good Message" (origin of gospel from old Anglo Saxxon word) of Judas.<br><br>Following which, it implies that it is written / or at least a record of eye-witnessing by Judas himself - as of the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, John and Luke. But no, it is estimated to be written by Gnostics in 5 A.D, found in a cave in Egypt in 1970, and bought by a foundation in Switzerland and its codex only to be publicly released recently.<br><br>So....what "Gospel of" ??  It is by far been described by scholars as a "Heretical Forgery".  But as one of the "Da Vinci" seminar teachers said : "Relax, its just Fiction"  - similarly....."Relax, its just a fake".<br><br></div>

There were two Judases a among the Twelve. But it's true that Judas stole money from the treasury box. I think he was just plain greedy for money &amp; when he saw that there was no more money to be milked from Jesus' ministry, he decided to "sell" Jesus to get whatever little he can get from the remaining days of Jesus on earth since he must have heard from Jesus that He was going to be crucified. So he decided to make the best deal out of it. One he can get some money. Two he can escape from the chief priests, scribes &amp; pharisees from certain death by being a 'rebel' with Jesus.</div>

Sometimes what Jesus said contains a deeper meaning and on surface level doesn't make sense at all. Gospel of Thomas contains teachings on non-dualism.

The book contains mystical teachings by Jesus - although it is not really a religious book.<br><br>It is not strange, but to understand gospel of thomas you must have a basic understanding of christian mysticism.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pls do read the website I gave you. But to answer you:<br><br>From the website I gave you previously: <a href="http://www.frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.html</a>:<br><br><blockquote>....Jesus proclaimed <strong>"I and the Father are one,"</strong> (Jn. 10.30) showing the world what the union of God and man can be. <strong>Christian mysticism is about nothing else but this transforming union.<br><br>Christ is the sole end of Christian mysticism. Whereas all Christians have Christ, call on Christ, and can (or should) know Christ, the goal for the Christian mystic is to become ChristÂ—to become as fully permeated with God as Christ is, thus becoming like him, fully human, and by the grace of God, also fully divine. In Christian teaching this doctrine is known by various namesÂ—theosis, divinization, deification, and transforming union.<br><br>A common misconception about mysticism is that it's about "mystical experiences," and there are many volumes on such experiences in religious literature. But true mysticism is not focussed on "experiences" (which come and go) but with the lasting experience of God, leading to the transformation of the believer into union with God.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>But when Jesus declared "I and the Father are one," (Jn. 10.30) he proclaimed in himself the union of God and humankind, and he offers it to all who follow him (he gave the power to become sons of God to all who believe. (Jn. 1.12).</strong></blockquote>And within this union, there is unconditional love.</div>
