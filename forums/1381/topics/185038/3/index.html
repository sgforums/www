It also teaches human reproduction is evil as it continues the vicious cycle of being "trapped" in the body. All these cannot be found in mainstream Christianity, and in a large sense, heretical, which is why they were not included in the bible canon by the church fathers.<br><br>What the bible teaches is sufficient for Christians. The gnostic gospels may be of value to pple who are into mysticism, but definitely not of significant value to Christians and probably even contrary to Christian teachings. I am against elaine pagels' idea that gnostic gospels are for advanced learning in Christianity.<br><br>In this age of apostasy, it is important for Christians to discern what is truth and what belong to our adversary, the evil one.<br><br>I also dun blame Eternal Now becoz he is just quoting from website, and he is not a Christian.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Blind men, who never had any idea there was such a thing called sight are feeling around and they chance upon an elephant which has for some reason decided to let them touch it.<br><br>Some blind men touch the tail, and they think that it is a brush.<br><br>Some feel the tusk, and think that it is the tip of the spear.<br><br>Some feel the ears, and think that it is a curtain.<br><br>Based on their personal notions, they make their different conclusions about the elephant... some think it is a tool of art, others a weapon, and some more a thing to deconrate windows. Obviously they are all touching one real truth, but have different views on it based on their experience.<br><br>Along comes a man who can see, and knows what the elephant is. He tells them what the elephant is, and what it is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>. Of course the choice now falls on the blind men on what to make out of it... some of them might still insist on viewing the elephant through their old paradigms... some might listen to the sighted man and but still rely on taking in that truth through their personal viewpoints, that the elephant ought to be used for painting, a weapon of war, or a wall decoration.<br><br>There might be some who decide however, to trust the sighted man entirely, and listen despite having little idea of what he could be talking about. In this case the elephant is in a wild safari and that sooner or later there are lions who are going to find the blind men. The real issue, though lost on the blind men of course, is to avoid the lions.<br><br>Some might still insist on staying behind to see what they can paint (in blind art) with the elephant's tail. Others might start to figure out how to train the elephant for war. Yet others are more worried about how to hang the elephant on their windows.<br><br>There are some however, who decide to follow the sighted man and leave the danger area of the safari.<br><br>What I wonder, is the moral of the story?</div>

Rather than a sacrificial death, or atonement, that frees believers from sin, the destruction of Jesus's body in the Gospel of Judas and other Gnostic texts frees his divine soul to rejoin God. </strong>But the Gnostics departed even further from orthodox views of Jesus's suffering and death. Some of their writings say that although Jesus looked as though he inhabited a physical body, this was only an illusion. He was a divine being who could appear in many different forms, like that of a child in the Gospel of Judas. Other Gnostic writings say that while a human being named Jesus did actually die, the divine part of him, or the Christ, did not. Instead this divine part descended into Jesus at his baptism and departed his body just before Jesus's death on the cross, when he uttered the words, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" <strong>Still other Gnostic writings say that someone else entirelyÂ—perhaps Simon of Cyrene, described as having briefly carried the crossÂ—was put to death in place of Jesus, while he remained alive, laughing at the blindness of those who tried to kill him.</strong><br><br>Cain and Abel<br><br>In the Old Testament, Cain kills his brother Abel and is cursed by God. But in Gnostic texts Cain appears as a hero. Why celebrate a murderer? Because Gnostics saw the Old Testament God as a lower deity, a power crazed demiurge, who created a flawed physical world that imprisons human souls. Salvation for them meant escaping the physical realm to be reunited with the true supreme being. To Gnostics, any defiance against the false creator god was an heroic act. So one school of Gnostics celebrated Cain's murder of Abel, whose offering of lambs the Old Testament God favored over Cain's offering of crops. In the same way, The same school celebrated the people of Sodom, the city that the Old Testament God destroys after its people try to rape visiting angels. <strong>These Gnostics were not embracing murder or rape, they were identifying with those who rebelled against the Old Testament God.</strong><br><br>Karen E.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Actually I was thinking, can we consider the gnostics as Christians at all?<br><br>Think they are similiar to the macionites, a cult who believe the old testament writes abt a evil lower god known as the demuirge, while the god of the new testament is the good higher god who sent Jesus.<br><br>Somehow I think these pple cannot recouncilate between the old and the new testament that they form different theories. Chinese say:" Zou Huo Ru Mo"....</strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>(continued)<br>DID YOU KNOW?<br><br>The early Christians known as Gnostics, whose beliefs are reflected in the Judas gospel, were not a homogeneous group; scholars even debate whether the many strains of Gnosticism should be lumped together under one banner. The Gnostic idea that individuals carry a spark of the divine within them may well have existed before Christianity. But after the time of Christ a number of Gnostics adopted Jesus as their saviorÂ—as the man who told humankind the truth about GodÂ—and thus considered themselves Christian. However, they understood his role and teachings in a very different way than orthodox Christians.<br><br>So, where did Jesus fit into Christian Gnostic cosmology?<br><br>Many Gnostics believed that Jesus was sent to Earth to teach humankind about a kind, loving, accepting God, who was very different from the tough, vengeful creator God of the Old Testament. Because Gnostics could not reconcile the two opposing aspects of the divine in one God, they believed there must be another god in addition to the creator God.<br><br>They came to view that second, greater God as a divine mind, who at the beginning of time had thoughts that spun off and became divine entities known as Aeons. The Aeons lived in the Pleroma, or fullness of God, which was a type of celestial ether or realm of light. One of these ideas made into substance was Wisdom, called "Sophia." She started to think and to have a mind of her own, and so she brought forth a new being without consulting the divine mind, and without its approval. This offspring was known as Yaldobaoth, and was called the demiurge, or creator.<br><br>The Gnostics believed it was Yaldobaoth who scooped up Adam and Eve from dirt and blew the breath of life into them. The creator spirit, an aberration in the pure world of the divine mind, brought evil into the world. But he also carried the essence of Sophia, and he exhaled some of the divine into Adam and Eve when he brought them to life. All of humankind has inherited that divine spark.<br><br>Jesus' role on Earth, according to the Gnostic Christians, was to tell humankind that they are descended from the divine. By knowing this, and looking inward to discover the divine spark, a Gnostic can be reunited with the divine and live in the fullness of God.<br><br>Elizabeth Snodgrass<br></div>
