            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>The Origins of New Years' Resolutions, and One Famous List</strong><br>Chris Armstrong | posted 1/2/2004</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Article is taken from <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianitytoday.com/</a></span></span><br><br>Like other Christian festivals, the celebration of New Years Day in the West started before the church came into existence.<br><br>At first, the Romans celebrated the beginning of the new year on March 1, not January 1. Julius Caesar instituted New Year's Day on January 1 to honor Janus, the two-faced god who looks backwards into the old year and forwards into the new. The custom of "New Years resolutions" began in this earliest period, as the Romans made resolutions with a moral flavor: mostly to be good to others.<br><br>When Rome took on Christianity as its official faith, the Christians kept New Years Day. Only, they traded the vaguely moral emphasis for a practice of fasting and prayer aimed at living the New Year in the New Life of Christ. Soon, however, the new year celebration reverted to March 1, and this early emphasis on spiritual things dissolved.<br><br>Or rather, it shifted to a new celebration on January 1. Beginning in the middle of the sixth century, parts of the church began to set aside January 1 as the Feast of the Circumcision, commemorating Jesus' circumcision. As with other Jewish boy babies, Jesus was circumcised eight days after his birth (Luke 2:21, "when eight days were accomplished" ).<br><br>But the pagans had apparently spoiled January 1 for many Christians: the Roman church did not accept this feast day until the 11th century.<br><br>It was finally in 1752, when Britain and its possessions adopted the Gregorian calendar, that January 1 again came to be recognized and celebrated as the first day of the year.<br><br>Some Christians, however, still hesitated to celebrate the day. The Puritans, for example, were leery of the associations of January 1 with the pagan god JanusÂ—they preferred not even to say the name of the month, referring to it rather as "First Month." And of course they stood against the dissipations usually indulged during the celebration.<br><br>Instead, the Puritans urged their young people, especially, to skip the revelry and meditate on the year past and the year to come. Always ready to introspectÂ—in famously excruciating detailÂ—they adopted again the old custom of making resolutions. They vowed to take more care against their besetting sins, make better use of their talents and other divine gifts, and treat others with Christian charity.<br><br>Today, some Christians may be inclined to follow the Puritans' lead, at least absenting themselves from the festivities: January 1st has clearly continued to be a day dedicated more to godless indulgence than to meditative fasting. But many have also seen, as the Puritans did, a divine opportunity in the longstanding practice of making resolutions.<br><br>In fact, this practice even harmonizes with the Feast Day: circumcision is a symbol of sanctificationÂ—that is, the "setting aside" of persons and things for God's purposes.<br><br>With or without such historical understandings, many of us may have taken New Years Eve and New Years Day as God-given opportunities. We have taken at least a few minutes to reflect, pray, and dedicate ourselves anew to our LordÂ—whether at a "Watch Night Service" or in private, with pen and journal (or word processor) in hand.<br><br>If you are one of these, you may wish to extend your meditations this week by reviewing a very famous list of Resolutions. This is the list created by the American Puritan divine Jonathan Edwards. He penned them, not on a single New Years' Day, but throughout two pivotal years after his graduation from Yale, during which entered his first pastorate, in Northampton, Massachusetts.<br><br>During these years, Edwards intensely considered his spiritual state and devised ways he could improve himself as a Christian. The resulting list of resolutions reminded him to dwell each day on his own death and eternal destiny and to bring his every emotion, thought, and action in line with the Word of God:<br><br>"48. Resolved, constantly, with the utmost niceness and diligence, and the strictest scrutiny, to be looking into the state of my soul, that I may know whether I have truly an interest in Christ or no; that when I come to die, I may not have any negligence respecting this to repent of."<br><br>Though I sometimes find the Puritans scary in their spiritual intensity and wonder if their strict practices sometimes erred on the side of works-righteousness, I always find this list of Edwards's not only challenging but inspiring. I am sure that, like New Years resolution-makers throughout history, he often failed to come up to the grand aspirations enshrined in these resolutions. But I also suspect he benefited greatly from the exercise of writing them and trying to live by them.<br><br>To read Edwards's full list of resolutions, click here.<br><br>A footnote: three "fresh starts"<br><br>January 1 has always been a day for "new things." Here are three in the annals of Christian history:<br><br>On this day in 1855, a fresh-faced group of ministerial hopefuls entered their first class at Garrett Theological Seminary (not far from our offices here at CH, in Evanston, Illinois). The seminary was endowed by Eliza Garrett, widow of a mayor of Chicago.<br><br>111 years later, in 1966, Pope Paul VI issued a ringing call to the U.S., Soviet Russia, Communist China, and North and South Vietnam to work towards a peaceful resolution in Vietnam.<br><br>11 years later, on Jan. 1, 1977, the first woman Episcopal priest, Jacqueline Means, was ordained at All Saints Church, Indianapolis.<br><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">The historical information in this article has been adapted from Sue Ellen Thompson's Holiday Symbols (Omnigraphics, 2000) and the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (3rd edition).<br><br>Copyright Â© 2003 by the author or Christianity Today International/Christian History magazine.<br>Click <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/features/info.html#permission" rel="nofollow">here</a> for reprint information on Christian History.</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Resolutions of Jonathan Edwards (1722-1723) </strong><br>---------------------------------------<br>Being sensible that I am unable to do anything without God's help, I do humbly entreat him by his grace to enable me to keep these Resolutions, so far as they are agreeable to his will, for Christ's sake.<br><br>Remember to read over these Resolutions once a week.<br>----------------------------------------<br>1. Resolved, that I will do whatsoever I think to be most to God's glory, and my own good, profit and pleasure, in the whole of my duration, without any consideration of the time, whether now, or never so many myriad's of ages hence. Resolved to do whatever I think to be my duty and most for the good and advantage of mankind in general. Resolved to do this, whatever difficulties I meet with, how many and how great soever.<br><br>2. Resolved, to be continually endeavoring to find out some new invention and contrivance to promote the aforementioned things.<br><br>3. Resolved, if ever I shall fall and grow dull, so as to neglect to keep any part of these Resolutions, to repent of all I can remember, when I come to myself again.<br><br>4. Resolved, never to do any manner of thing, whether in soul or body, less or more, but what tends to the glory of God; nor be, nor suffer it, if I can avoid it.<br><br>5. Resolved, never to lose one moment of time; but improve it the most profitable way I possibly can.<br><br>6. Resolved, to live with all my might, while I do live.<br><br>7. Resolved, never to do anything, which I should be afraid to do, if it were the last hour of my life.<br><br>8. Resolved, to act, in all respects, both speaking and doing, as if nobody had been so vile as I, and as if I had committed the same sins, or had the same infirmities or failings as others; and that I will let the knowledge of their failings promote nothing but shame in myself, and prove only an occasion of my confessing my own sins and misery to God.<br><br>9. Resolved, to think much on all occasions of my own dying, and of the common circumstances which attend death.<br><br>10. Resolved, when I feel pain, to think of the pains of martyrdom, and of hell.<br><br>11. Resolved, when I think of any theorem in divinity to be solved, immediately to do what I can towards solving it, if circumstances don't hinder.<br><br>12. Resolved, if I take delight in it as a gratification of pride, or vanity, or on any such account, immediately to throw it by.<br><br>13. Resolved, to be endeavoring to find out fit objects of charity and liberality.<br><br>14. Resolved, never to do anything out of revenge.<br><br>15. Resolved, never to suffer the least motions of anger to irrational beings.<br><br>16. Resolved, never to speak evil of anyone, so that it shall tend to his dishonor, more or less, upon no account except for some real good.<br><br>17. Resolved, that I will live so as I shall wish I had done when I come to die.<br><br>18. Resolved, to live so at all times, as I think is best in my devout frames, and when I have clearest notions of things of the gospel, and another world.<br><br>19. Resolved, never to do anything, which I should be afraid to do, if I expected it would not be above an hour, before I should hear the last trump.<br><br>20. Resolved, to maintain the strictest temperance in eating and drinking.<br><br>21. Resolved, never to do anything, which if I should see in another, I should count a just occasion to despise him for, or to think any way the more meanly of him.<br><br>(Resolutions 1 through 21 written in on setting in New Haven in 1722)<br><br>22. Resolved, to endeavor to obtain for myself as much happiness, in the other world, as I possibly can, with all the power; might, vigor, and vehemence, yea violence, I am capable of, or can bring myself to exert, in any way that can be thought of.<br><br>23. Resolved, frequently to take some deliberate action, which seems most unlikely to be done, for the glory of God, and trace it back to the original intention, designs and ends of it; and if I find it not to be for God's glory, to repute it as a breach of the 4th Resolution.<br><br>24. Resolved, whenever I do any conspicuously evil action, to trace it back, till I come to the original cause; and then both carefully endeavor to do so no more, and to fight and pray with all my might against the original of it.<br><br>25. Resolved, to examine carefully, and constantly, what that one thing in me is, which causes me in the least to doubt of the love of God; and to direct all my forces against it.<br><br>26. Resolved, to east away such things, as I find do abate my assurance.<br><br>27. Resolved, never willfully to omit anything, except the omission be for the glory of God; and frequently to examine my omissions.<br><br>28. Resolved, to study the Scriptures so steadily, constantly and frequently, as that I may find, and plainly perceive myself to grow in the knowledge of the same.<br><br>29. Resolved, never to count that a prayer, nor to let that pass as a prayer, nor that as a petition of a prayer, which is so made, that I cannot hope that God will answer it; nor that as a confession, which I cannot hope God will accept.<br><br>30. Resolved, to strive to my utmost every week to be brought higher in religion, and to a higher exercise of grace, than I was the week before.<br><br>31. Resolved, never to say anything at all against anybody, but when it is<br><br>perfectly agreeable to the highest degree of Christian honor, and of love to mankind, agreeable to the lowest humility, and sense of my own faults and failings, and agreeable to the golden rule; often, when I have said anything against anyone, to bring it to, and try it strictly by the test of this Resolution.<br><br>32. Resolved, to be strictly and firmly faithful to my trust, that that in Prov. 20:6, "A faithful man who can find?" may not be partly fulfilled in me.<br><br>33. Resolved, always to do what I can towards making, maintaining, establishing and preserving peace, when it can be without over-balancing detriment in other respects. Dec.26, 1722.<br><br>34. Resolved, in narration's never to speak anything but the pure and simple verity.<br><br>35. Resolved, whenever I so much question whether I have done my duty, as that my quiet and calm is thereby disturbed, to set it down, and also how the question was resolved. Dec. 18, 1722.</div>

Resolved, when I am most conscious of provocations to ill nature and anger, that I will strive most to feel and act good-naturedly; yea, at such times, to manifest good nature, though I think that in other respects it would be disadvantageous, and so as would be imprudent at other times.

Jan.14' and July '3' 1723.<br><br>64.
