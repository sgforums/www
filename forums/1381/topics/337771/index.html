              <p> </p>
              <p>In various discussions on hell, the topic of justice comes to the fore. Many believe that everlasting punishment of 1200000000000000+yrs, as compared to 120yrs of small sins is OK.</p>
              <p>Some like myself disagree and do not find it consistent with the concept of mercy.</p>
              <p>We as humans instinctively know that a penalty should fit the level of the sin. An eye for an eye.</p>
              <p>Are we to follow a God that takes that long to cure a soul that began as a perfect soul?</p>
              <p>You will know that, a little sinner of minor consequence, informs me and complained to me that his penalty was unfair as compared to his mates. He and Hitler are sharing the same woes as well as a Khan or two.</p>
              <p>He believes scripture that says that all of God’s works are perfect. All except for Hell that is. Oops.</p>
              <p>Please debate. Is Hell a perfect works as are all of Gods works or Is Hell God’s first Oops?</p>
              <p>Should little sinner be set free?</p>

              <p>A big hello to everyone as it is my first time here on this forum, nice to meet all of you. Been reading the happenings here for a while, and I thought now is a good a time as any to finally say something <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lp, I guess most would agree that He is a God of mercy and justice. To focus on the justice bit, we mere humans will never be able to understand in human logic the justice that God intends for us at the end of our time (just as we will never be able to comprehend His immense love for us). As He chooses to pay the workers who works in his vineyard the same amount regardless of what time they report for work (meaning it's never too late to turn back to Him), we won't be able to 'measure' our sins in human logical terms. Only God has the wisdom and power to do so. Do we even know for sure that Hitler and other infamous personalities are in hell now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He does not 'cure' our souls by burning them in Hell's fire. While we were created in His own likeness with love, our fallen nature (through the sins of Adam and Eve) allows us to be tempted by the devil, and this is where we make our choice to follow God or forget about Him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the bad news is that hell is for all eternity, unless you are talking about the temporal aspect of Purgatory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let us not try not to 'box' God into a corner in our logical and human minds, that more often than not let us down in our pursuit of Christian goodness.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Do u really want to know what Hashem said to Adam, with his own mouth and own words, about death?  For your benefits and study i will quote Hashem own words on this issue of death after Adam had sinned against Hashem.</p>
              <p><em>Then to Adam He said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it';<br>         Cursed is the ground because of you;<br>         </em><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">In toil you will eat of it<br>         All the days of your life</span>. <br>         "Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you;<br>         And you will eat the plants of the field; <br>         By the sweat of your face<br>         You will eat bread,<br>         </em><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Till you return to the ground,<br>         Because from it you were taken</span>;<br>         </em><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">For you are dust,<br>         And to dust you shall return</span>."</em>   Genesis 3:17-19 (NASB)</p>
              <p>Did Hashem say this - Adam after u die u go to eternal hell? No? Did Hashem also say this - Adam after u are dead and buried u will then die again and go to eternal hell?. Or u dun believe in what Hashem has said with Hashem's own mouth and words?</p>

              <p>For some strange reason, you claim to look for a debate, but proceed to recklessly blast whatever that does not seem agreeable to your own self-proclaimed notions of the universe. Actually, your points look quite irrelevant in this forum, as you seem more set on expousing your cosmic-whatever ideas than sincerely desiring to understand Christianity better.

              <p>There are many sects to Christianity now a days. Which sect do you favor and why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do all your sects believe in talking snakes and 10 headed monsters or are there some with intelligent people in them?</p>

              <p>A couple of quotes from the bible that might be of interest.</p>
              <p>Mathew 25:41,46 -<em> "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you accursed, into the <span style="color: #800000;">eternal fire</span> prepared for the devil and his angels. ... And these will go off to <span style="color: #800000;">eternal punishment</span>, but the righteous to eternal life."</em></p>
              <p>Mathew 18:8 - "<em>If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into <span style="color: #800000;">eternal fire</span>."</em></p>

              <p>By the way, what faith do you really subscribed to? Are you a "home alone" Christians trying to read the Bible and using books, internet etc...to make sense of God? Just curious....</p>
