              <p>before u gloat over the so-called tough question the christians have to reply...dun forget the 2 scenarios i asked in another thread directed at the law of karma...which i am also waiting for an answer....</p>
              <p>i asked 1) a man who did good all his life(filial piety, care for needy etc) in a burst of hatred and anger killed someone and was hanged for murder...under the law of karma, heaven or hell? 2) a man who was a crook all his life and is about to die for his crimes decided that he wants to repent...hence, he decided to donate all his wealth to charity and his organs to the needy after he die...under the law of karma, heaven or hell?</p>
              <p>to answer TS question, for such ppl they willbe judged according to the law. simply because they have nvr heard the gospel...the next question then is how would God judge? well, this is sth we wun noe for sure but it would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. my pastor shared once that there was once when missionaries asked cannibals(who nvr heard abt God) if they knew killing humans were wrong and the cannibals said they knew killing was wrong but they knew no better way to survive. for such ppl, my pastor shared that God's mercy might be upon them. however, he cannot say for sure because we as humans do not know from beginning to end the lives of these ppl. what we noe is onli based on wad we observed and wad we read or see...</p>

              <p>the bible says only believers go to heaven...true...but how can one possibly believe in sth they have not heard/experienced? so does this verse apply to those who have not heard/experienced? i dun tink so...</p>

              <p>i thought i've answered that somewhere. ok let me repeat but blame me for talking about karma at eh.</p>
              <p>1) according to the law of karma, every deed is accounted for separately, since there are 6 relams (heaven, human, demi-god, animals, ghosts and hell). and there are many live times and not just one. this guy who was filial and cared for the needy will be born with loving parents and not an orphan, however he killed someone, his life span will be short. however, whether these will happen together in one life time or not i will not know as karma is not 1+2=3, there are many factors and conditions (for instance, buddhists repented for the deeds they had done in their past life will lighten their sins) for the karma to be ripen.</p>
              <p>2) if the man was a crook and he repented and donated to charities. For instance, he robbed someone but later he donated what he robbed to the charities. He will be born as a poor and may be later part of his life, he will become rich. or in one lifetime he will be poor ( he robbed) and the other life time he will be rich (he donated to charities). i understand that the aim of every buddhists is to get out of these cycles of rebirth.</p>
              <p>if you are interested, following is the link of karma which explains in details (deed by deed and the consequence of every deed).</p>

              <p>to add on, he will be born as human provided there are people who dedicate merits to him or he will be born in other realms. even though he was born as human, he will encounter what i said above. buddhists always dedicate merits to all sentiment beings so these guys may benefit from there.</p>
