              <p>come one, you know the reason why they do it. let me be blunt. in their minds, they are cock sure their faith is the truth and all others are false. its written in the bible.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Why ? If they are not COCK SURE their faith is the truth..  then what the fuck are they even doing in the first place ?</p>
              <p>Maybe ur issue is regarding the WAY they presented thier sermons and how it was directed at other religion, now that would be a better question.</p>
              <p>Why nobody scold the Muslims ? I am sure they regard the Quran as.. THE TRUTH, but just because they speak in arabic doesnt mean they never dissed another religion yes ? Or perhaps you guys just bully the weak , kind and easy.. while u fear the extremist suicide terrorists ? lol</p>
              <p>The problem is not about them not dissing anothe religion, its more like you do not have the mental capacity to even factor that in, oh.. and also because u dont know Arabic, unless u are going to claim to be psychic.. or perhaps even an omniscience ?</p>
              <p>U noticed ? U need to use ur brain abit.. or else, like how Stardust is to Hasene, a wind..  its exactly how you are to me in this regard, a small wind too. See the analogy ?</p>
              <p>Notice ur questions are a bit.. silly ?</p>
              <p>If they dont follow the bible, you guys will equally bitch n rant that.. "Ooh... u are supposed to obey the bible...ya da ya da"</p>
              <p>There is understanding..</p>
              <p>and there is opposing something because u simply.. just being .. intolerent , small minded and hateful.</p>
              <p>Simple.</p>

              <p>Well, it depends how I will categorise them. Its in my opinion that Truth is absolute. Its existence is absolute.</p>
              <p>We have alot of other kinds of "truth"</p>
              <p>It also will depend what ur perception of truth is.</p>
              <p>Some , thinks that true = truth.</p>
              <p>So, what is truth to you ? Dont u have ur own truth ?</p>
              <p>If they truly believe thier truth is THE TRUTH, then so be it. Why attack thier truth like how u attack other peoples perception of thier truth ?</p>

              <p>I dont. I cant.</p>
              <p>Who am I to say that thiers is not the absolute truth ?</p>
              <p>Maybe to devout Christians, there is no question that thier truth.. is THE truth.</p>
              <p>Muslims claim that. Buddhism claims the truth also. Hindu..     etc etc</p>
              <p>What if we were all wrong ?</p>
              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>What if.. we are all right ?</p>
              <p>Think out of the box. The endless possibilties there.</p>
              <p>But you cannot be as undecisive in life as you are of your faith.</p>

              <p><br>I did mention about the concept of truth and especially the example of gravity.</p>
              <p>Most of the time the confusion is in the meaning of truth. The meaning of truth has been diluted and has a few meanigs in the dictionary.  The problem always begins in ones definition of that truth.</p>
              <p>Anyways, its pretty funny. lol</p>
              <p>But of course there will be people who disagree. But the rational ones are the ones that agree in disagreeing.</p>

              <p>This is dependable on the person on which religion he wants to follow. Besides, end of the day, it's his relations with GOD. He's answerable to his/her own deeds. I'm a muslim and there is a verse in the Quran that states (bismillah) ''THERE IS NO COMPULSION IN THE RELIGION" (amin) Qur'an Surah 2 (Al-Baqarah) verse 256. You can double check it using the QuranExplorer website.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a malay, we are not fully aware of this in Singapore but in Malaysia and sadly, in the Arabian nations, we are. Just because he's an Arab, does it means that he's a muslim? No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sadly, there are numerous ustaz(religious teachers) in the arabian peninsula which from my view went agaisnt the verse i quoted earlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, the reason why muslim covnert to christianity thru observation is because of misunderstanding of the quran and it's teachings. They think that the Quran preaches jihad and in actual fact it is true but not really. You have to study the historical timeline of the events that took place when the Quran was being delivered to Prophet Muhammad p.b.u.h. At that time, the muslims in Mecca were facing adverse suffering and torture by the idol worshippers (Quraish). Also, the Quraish wanted a war agaisnt Islam (REAL WAR with bloodshed) and with the permission of GOD, the Muslims went to war in defence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This goes to a verse in the Quran which i quoted from a video answer by Dr. Yusuf Estes, a Muslim convert from christianity. ''Attack them (enemy) if they attack you. Otherwise, you are the trangessor (guilty party). If they stop, you stop"</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHRzWpR8pUM</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As mentioned by Dr. Estes, there is translation misunderstandings. Do view this video if you want a cleare picture. I find this beneficial regardless if you are Muslim, Jew or Christian or even any religion you follow.</p>
