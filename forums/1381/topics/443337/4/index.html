              <p>I have some questions, hopefully people here can answer and then
              I have a better understanding as well...</p>
              <p>1) Why didn't the Bible says anything about like the extinction
              of Dinosaurs or about T-Rex etc?</p>
              <p>2) How do we know that the Bible wasn't written by the Devil in
              an attempt to deceive us to go to Hell? I mean we do know from
              Bible teachings that he's a really really really smart Devil having
              lived so many years more than humans, he certainly can deceive
              people easily since he even deceived Adam &amp; Eve.</p>
              <p>3) Why did the Bible say that the universe was created 6000
              years ago? I mean, that conflicts with science that says the
              universe is many millions years old.</p>
              <p>4) I believe God is against incest? But when he created Adam
              &amp; Eve, then in order to populate Earth, then incest is quite
              obvious will happen, isn't it contradictory to say Yes last time
              and then say No now?</p>
              <p>5) If everyone comes from Adam &amp; Eve, then shouldn't we all
              be Ang Moh instead of some Asians, some Africans... I mean we
              certainly don't expect African couple, even with 100 generations
              later, suddenly give birth to a Chinese dude? LOL I would suspect
              my wife is cheating on me!!!</p>
              <p>Someone who can answer these questions please help. Personally,
              I believe in God but it's damn irritating to have unanswered
              questions.</p>

              <p>Regarding question 1 then...<br>The bible did mention about dinosaurs, just that it did not talk about their extinction...<br>In fact, they co existed with Adam and Eve!<br>Noah's ark did have them too, well, dino aint really that big we imagine them to be...

              <p>30cm... hmm... <br>what i saw in another article was 50cm... the baby or at most in their teenage year should be pretty small even for the largest dinasaur...<br>And ya, the ark is HUGE!</p>
              <p>Question 2...<br>the devil has no power over the word of God...<br>the word of God is the truth...<br>the word of God is our sword against the devil...</p>
              <p>Question 4.<br>Yes, God is indeed against incest now, but not the past...<br>One example is that abraham taken a half sister as his wife, but wasnt sin because of that...</p>
              <p>The law against marrying close relative only come during moses time, way beyond abraham or adam and eve time...Why is that so? It's because of genetics problems...<br>Today, one of the reason we do not marry close relative is because of genes problem... <br>And that problem wasn't there in the past because human were almost genetically perfect...<br>But after gereneration and generation, the genes start to have error...<br>so at moses time, he gave this law to protect us from this genetic problem...</p>
              <p>So why do human start to have genetic problem? Isn't God's creation all perfect?<br>Yes, it was perfect. But because Adam sin and death came.<br>before he sin, there was no death.</p>
              <p>Question 5.<br>Genesis 11, that is where God change everyone language and race...<br>Because they wasn't doing what God wanted them to do...<br>God ask them to be fruitful and multiply, and to fill the earth...<br>But they wanted to stay together and build a tower and do not want to be scattered...<br>So God came down and changes everyone language, and the we then disperse...<br>After that, it's prolly about the gene and the enviroment that changes their skin colour, the amount of melanin, the colouring pigment found in everyone's skin...<br><br>I got this from a website:<br>"The dispersion at Babel broke up a large interbreeding group into<br>small inbreeding groups.

              Actually if you take the time to visit the website Creation.com which I referred to many times in my postings you would find these answers too. But then atheists like Tcmc dislike this website because they are Christian websites and thus biased and thus unreliable and thus wrong. Of course he did not prove them, he just make the allegations and think they stick.

                  Your intention to insult by comparing Creation.com to a porn site was uncalled for. I am simply telling you that you can EASILY find the answers there. No need 10 years. If you had spent even 10 seconds at Creation.com you would have noticed the Q&amp;A section and found many questions arranged by topics. Another 10 seconds and you would be reading answers to your questions.

              Can science truly explain everything? You seem confident to say so. I beg to differ. For example science can describe how things work and call certain regular phenomena "laws if nature" but can science tell us why they exist at all? Can science tell us why we can even know anything at all, to be able to seek to understand how nature works, although even so we only know in part? Science cannot explain everything because its methods are limited to the domain of that which can be observed and tested repeatedly. In fact, the philosophy of science seeks to explain such things.

              the age of the world...<br> The science in this website says the earth wasnt that old...</p>
              <p>Regarding question 1 then...<br> The bible did mention about dinosaurs, just that it did not talk
              about their extinction...<br> In fact, they co existed with Adam and Eve!<br> Noah's ark did have them too, well, dino aint really that big we
              imagine them to be... Only a few are big...<br> So what happen to the big one?<br> Of course we didn't have to bring the big one in, we 2 of every the
              same species! The bible didn't state the age of the dino...<br> But big dinosaurs should have big eggs? nah...<br> "They tend to be ovoid or spherical in shape and up to 30cm in
              length" said from this website <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thedinosaurmuseum.com/html/dinosaur-facts.html">http://www.thedinosaurmuseum.com/html/dinosaur-facts.html</a></p>
              <p>30cm... hmm...<br> what i saw in another article was 50cm... the baby or at most in
              their teenage year should be pretty small even for the largest
              dinasaur...<br> And ya, the ark is HUGE!</p>
              <p>Question 2...<br> the devil has no power over the word of God...<br> the word of God is the truth...<br> the word of God is our sword against the devil...</p>
              <p>Question 4.<br> Yes, God is indeed against incest now, but not the past...<br> One example is that abraham taken a half sister as his wife, but
              wasnt sin because of that...</p>
              <p>The law against marrying close relative only come during moses
              time, way beyond abraham or adam and eve time...Why is that so?
              It's because of genetics problems...<br> Today, one of the reason we do not marry close relative is because
              of genes problem...<br> And that problem wasn't there in the past because human were almost
              genetically perfect...<br> But after gereneration and generation, the genes start to have
              error...<br> so at moses time, he gave this law to protect us from this genetic
              problem...</p>
              <p>So why do human start to have genetic problem? Isn't God's
              creation all perfect?<br> Yes, it was perfect. But because Adam sin and death came.<br> before he sin, there was no death.</p>
              <p>Question 5.<br> Genesis 11, that is where God change everyone language and
              race...<br> Because they wasn't doing what God wanted them to do...<br> God ask them to be fruitful and multiply, and to fill the
              earth...<br> But they wanted to stay together and build a tower and do not want
              to be scattered...<br> So God came down and changes everyone language, and the we then
              disperse...<br> After that, it's prolly about the gene and the enviroment that
              changes their skin colour, the amount of melanin, the colouring
              pigment found in everyone's skin...<br> <br> I got this from a website:<br> "The dispersion at Babel broke up a large interbreeding group
              into<br> small inbreeding groups. This ensured that the resultant
              groups<br> would have different mixes of genes for various physical features.
              By<br> itself, this dispersion would ensure, in a short time, that there
              would<br> be certain fixed differences in some of these groups,
              commonly<br> called ‘races’. In addition, the selection pressure of the
              environment<br> would modify the existing combinations of genes so that the
              physical<br> characteristics of each group would tend to suit their
              environment.<br> There has been no simple-to-complex evolution of any genes,
              for<br> the genes were present already. The dominant features of the
              various<br> people groups result from different combinations of previously
              existing created genes, plus some minor degenerative changes,<br> resulting from mutation (accidental changes which can be
              inherited).<br> The originally created (genetic) information has been either
              reshuffled<br> or has degenerated, but has not been added to."</p>

              <p>Hope this can answer your question... I prolly didn't really
              explain in great details cus when I learn these, it was a whole big

              <p>1. The verse you say that mentions ddinosaurs is in book of Job. The verse DOES NOT say it is dinosaurs. In fact many many theologians and christian historians say that the verse MIGHT be implying to elephants or crocodiles or hippos. You have to look at other perspectives. It does not say explicitly that it is dinosaurs that Job saw.</p>
              <p>2. About the devil, if God is allknowing and already knew that adam and eve would fail the test, why did he still insist to test them by putting the fruit so near them? Would you test if your children are obedient by putting a knife to seeif they kill each other, when you know they WILL kill each other?</p>
              <p>3. You said God is against incest now but not in the past. Ah I SEE, so God's moral stands do change according to culture and society?</p>

              <p>1. The verse you say that mentions ddinosaurs is in book of Job. The verse DOES NOT say it is dinosaurs. In fact many many theologians and christian historians say that the verse MIGHT be implying to elephants or crocodiles or hippos. You have to look at other perspectives. It does not say explicitly that it is dinosaurs that Job saw.</p>
              <p>2. About the devil, if God is allknowing and already knew that adam and eve would fail the test, why did he still insist to test them by putting the fruit so near them? Would you test if your children are obedient by putting a knife to seeif they kill each other, when you know they WILL kill each other?</p>
              <p>3. You said God is against incest now but not in the past. Ah I SEE, so God's moral stands do change according to culture and society?</p>
              <p>4. You get your answers from christian sources and christian websites. You commit the error of confirmation bias.</p>

              <p>Have you ever stared at the bums of elephants or hippos? You should! Our world famous zoo is open 7 days a week. Make a trip down one of these days and stare at them (not lustfully of course LOL!) and then report back to us whether elephants or hippos have the tail the size of a cedar tree. I gather you KNOW what a cedar tree look like bro?</p>

              <p>How hard is it seriously for you to understand that "winged creature" is NOT a wrong term to use for birds and bats? Saying something is a mammal does not say anything about its flight capability. I can imagine that if the Bible lumps bats and cows as mammals you would quibble over saying that the Bible failed to make distinction between flying mammals and non-flying mammals. Point is, Bible critics like you will always find something to make an issue out of it. Why? Bible bashing mode mah!</p>
