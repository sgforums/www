              <p>How hard is it seriously for you to understand that "winged
              creature" is NOT a wrong term to use for birds and bats? Saying
              something is a mammal does not say anything about its flight
              capability. I can imagine that if the Bible lumps bats and cows as
              mammals you would quibble over saying that the Bible failed to make
              distinction between flying mammals and non-flying mammals. Point
              is, Bible critics like you will always find something to make an
              issue out of it. Why? Bible bashing mode mah!</p>

              <p>See? Again you show yourself woefully ignorant about HOW to
                      interpret the Bible. You never had any doctrinal foundation, never
                      learned how to study and interpret the Bible, and now pretend to be
                      some knowledgeable atheist who can enlighten believers and
                      nonbelievers about why the Bible should be cast aside? Tcmc, you

              <p>Yes I agree the hebrew version of "winged creature" is ok. But then if God is allknowing, he would have known that scribes later on would translate it wrongly to BIRD, and then he would also have known that many people would then pick out this error in the bible and cite it as a difficulty.</p>
              <p>So if God knew all this would happen, and if he was an efficient allknowing CEO, he should have just simply used the word mammal or ANY word that would not have caused difficulty!</p>
              <p>And now that I have explained, can you please tell me why he must go through all these trouble and then engage people like you to come and explain forhim on his behalf, when he is allknowing and knew that all this shit will happen?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Since you agree that winged creature is OK, end of argument. The rest of your points are just petty points trying to score points. Honestly it is no trouble for me to explain the Hebrew word. For most people this answer would have been entirely satisfactory. But for Bible-bashers NOTHING would satisfy them.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Please refrain from trolling on such things. You are clearly shifting goalpost because you have a vested interest to defend the idea that the Bible is wrong to called the bat a bird. But as mentioned, the Hebrew word translated ‘bird’ is <em>‘ôwph</em>, and simply means ‘winged/flying creature’—it is derived from <em>‘ûwph</em> meaning ‘to fly’. So you think that Hebrew word should be translated as mammal? LOL!</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>I wonder why you exhibit this bizarre pathology where you would want to allow yourself to be in a self-pwned situation. Which passage has Jesus commanding that ANYONE who wants to follow Him to sell everything? You really need a course on how to interpret the Bible in context, but then again, you have no interest or desire to do so.</p>

              <p>BIC,</p>
              <p>Ah..see, like what I said, suddenly this "selling everything" verse becomes meatphorical and has to be read in context!</p>
              <p>Then why not verses that talk about Jesus telling his disciples to love and to preach the gospel or to do miracles? Those HAVE TO BE READ IN CONTEXT TOO! Jesus was only talking to them and NOT applicable today too!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do you choose which to be literal or not?</p>
              <p>Or rather HOW do you do it? You can explain briefly here. I might accept.</p>
