              Their website loads super slow, the search function not working
              properly, just searching for 1 question only like for question 3
              about how do they know the Bible wasn't written by the Satan since
              he's really good at deceiving reveals no answers, and you tell me
              all the answers to my questions can be found there... Are you
              helping Satan to deceive me?</p>

              Your computer slow lah. The website loads well for my computer. Nothing to refute so just complain about slow speed? That's really lame. Yes satan is a deceiver, so you think satan would write a book that has been the source of influence on society to bring many to God? A kingdom divided against itself will fall, as taught by Jesus.

              <p>So you brag about your sense of morality. Tell me, to whom do you owe this sense of morality? What and who is your standard of morality? In the atheist's survival-of-the-fittest worldview, what determines right from wrong? If you cannot even justify your own moral stance, then you have no business trying to judge God's actions or the moral actions of another.</p>

              <p>Again you show no knowledge of basic Christian doctrine, yet still claim to be some Bible study "expert"? What does the Bible teach about sinners? Non-Christians will get saved when they repent and call upon the Name of Christ. Non-Christians like you do not want to be saved. Do you wish to be compelled against your will to be saved?</p>

              <p>You missed the point. I am asking you, justify your moral stance. You have no rational basis to simply assume the existence of some objective moral code or standard. You have no rational basis to say that morals has always been there. Since when? When there was no life to speak of? When did those "always been there" morals come into existence? When you think the sun was formed? At the big bang? When? I believe you can supply NO answers to my questions. Again, defend your sense of morality if you can. Otherwise don't find fault with my house when you do not even have a roof over your head.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>See the problem you have? People got answers from the Bible you say it is egoistic, a classic ad hominem argument. Let me have my confidence in the Word of God whereas you take confidence in your own ignorance OK? I can never be scientific? Again another ad hominem argument. Of course you convenient forget that it is hardly scientific to say that we evolved from pond scum since that cannot neither be tested or repeated in a lab.</p>
              <p>Why do you have a problem with me needing answers when you are here engaging in elephant hurling and demanding answers from the Christian for every question? And when Christians say we do not know you scoff at the answer that says "God works in ways we do not know" or that "the secret things belong to God." You are just operating on double-standards here. The problem with you is not just that you claim not to know, but that you claim to know that it cannot be God.</p>

              <p>1. Define your source of morality for starts. Heaven's entry requirements is determined by God, or you? God has every right to set the conditions for entry into heaven. God demands 100% holiness in all aspects of our lives. Those nice people you have in mind, you know the evil they think in thoughts and the inclinations in their hearts? My brain is working fine, thank you.</p>
              <p>2. You said God sent a flood to kill indiscriminately. You failed to read the Bible. God said the flood was sent to kill off mankind (except those 8 on the Ark) because of the wickedness of their ways. Again you are not God who is omniscient and can judge the ways of man. The creation God made was perfect, it was later corrupted by man's sin. So please don't blame God. So there WAS a perfect creation, IS now corrupted, but WILL BE restored to perfection again.</p>
              <p>3. Yes it is my reply, founded on the Bible.  But since you know not the Bible it is understandable that you will think it is all my own thinking. You do not have the tools to evaluate the Biblical basis of my answers. That's just too bad. I can't help you on that.</p>
