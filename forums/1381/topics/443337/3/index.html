              <p>Tcmc, you are hopelessly confused and obviously trolling here. People are talking about life after death and God's judgement and you talk about using it in our criminal procedures? Dude, even in the Scriptures the forgiveness of one's sins does not negate the earthly consequences of one's sins. Think David's adultery. Again you show your ignorance of Scripture. Haven't you been embarassed enough?</p>

              <p>use your brain alright. so u mean to say god created evaporation, condensation, the entire processes of rain and also natural diasters as well.so when it rains god created rain for us.</p>
              <p>thats the problem with you people of creationism. everything claimed that god created everything, which science has time and again, utterly and completely disprove that. Frankly I feel disgusted by the replies you provided, because its a misnomer and complete fabrication, not to mention utter nonsense.</p>

              Godliness is a fragrance of one's being kind, being compassionate, being inclusive and there is no exclusivity to ... eg, does the rain discrminate whom or where to rain on. a flower in the garden gives off its fragrance - one who is awake can partake of it, one who is sleep-walking misses it lah.
              What one is being .... matters more then being mired in concepts and conceptualized models.
              
              It is not a critique on Christianity but to all forms of organised religionists who practice the former.

              Muse over this ;
               A pickpocket  was trailing a gem merchant and wanted very much to get hold of this gem â€“ he tried all means and ways and to no avail and was still trying; all this time the merchant knew what he was up to and allowed the thief to be and when an opportunity rose he dropped the precious gem into the pocket of the thief.
               After a lapse of some moments, the pickpocket out  frustration blurted out to the merchant that he was a professional in pickpocketing and queried where is the gem as it could not even find it in the merchant!
