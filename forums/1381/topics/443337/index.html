              <p>I have some questions, hopefully people here can answer and then I have a better understanding as well...</p>
              <p>1) Why didn't the Bible says anything about like the extinction of Dinosaurs or about T-Rex etc?</p>
              <p>2) How do we know that the Bible wasn't written by the Devil in an attempt to deceive us to go to Hell? I mean we do know from Bible teachings that he's a really really really smart Devil having lived so many years more than humans, he certainly can deceive people easily since he even deceived Adam &amp; Eve.</p>
              <p>3) Why did the Bible say that the universe was created 6000 years ago? I mean, that conflicts with science that says the universe is many millions years old.</p>
              <p>4) I believe God is against incest? But when he created Adam &amp; Eve, then in order to populate Earth, then incest is quite obvious will happen, isn't it contradictory to say Yes last time and then say No now?</p>
              <p>5) If everyone comes from Adam &amp; Eve, then shouldn't we all be Ang Moh instead of some Asians, some Africans... I mean we certainly don't expect African couple, even with 100 generations later, suddenly give birth to a Chinese dude? LOL I would suspect my wife is cheating on me!!!</p>
              <p>Someone who can answer these questions please help. Personally, I believe in God but it's damn irritating to have unanswered questions.</p>

                  Please search for the answers at Creation.com first. All the answers to your questions can be found there. Take a bit of time to read and then discuss. I think this is a fair thing to do. If you are not willing to spare the effort to do so then it may mean you are not genuinely interested in finding out.

              <p>1. The bible does mention a very unclear verse about dinosaurs in the book of Job. But many historians refute this claim. But many christians told me that T-rex was a vegetarian in the beginning.</p>
              <p>2. By faith</p>
              <p>3. Some christians believe the earth is 6000 years old. Some don't. Christians also dont agree with each other on this. </p>
              <p>4. According to what christians told me, the Bible God allowed this incest thing because there was "no other way" to "populate" the earth.</p>
              <p>5. Actually scientific evidence does point us to the first woman and first man. But of course whether this first woman and first man were called adam and eve, ate a supernatrual fruit and saw a talking serpernt, all these are unproven.</p>

              <p>even a 3 year old kid wont also believe in this kind of dope, much less an adult isn't it.</p>
              <p>anyway from science perspective, I have read an article many years ago in ST, that first life form on earth billions of years ago, were not animals/mammals/dinausaurs or plant life but microbes/bacteria etc. the rest as they say was history since then.</p>
              <p>on the universe beginning? it was started by a series of big bang. if you have 1 big bang, why not many isnt it. also this was not the beginning of the universe as time started, as there was a beginning before the beginning and so forth. to find out the beginning is really impossible, cause there was a beginning before a beginning, so how to you first subscribe which is the first beginning? the fallacy is why should there be a beginning at all. even if the universe is destroyed, that is not the end of the universe. the universe will start with a new bang or a series of big bangs. so its a fallacy to attribute a beginning and an ending.</p>

              <p>Moreover, all religions claim that their Gods did it. Hindus say it's Lord Brahma. Christians say it's Jesus. Muslims say it's Allah and sikhs say it is the Sikh God.</p>
              <p>And so far, after speaking to many christians about this, they have not shown me effectively how they know for sure it's their God who did it.</p>

              <p>I respect Christians. </p>
              <p>Of course I value religious harmony.</p>
              <p>That is why we must really be balanced. We cant just say "the Christian God is real only." </p>
              <p>We got to learn to appreciate all religions. And admire all the Gods and their beauty!</p>

              That's the problem. You trivialise sin. You have no idea what holiness means and the nature of God.

              Jesus was a man, Krishna was a man, Buddha was a man, Mohd was a man - after their ''passing'' away - Christianity,Hinduism, Islam came into the pix; the same can be said so for the others. For the purpose of collective identity down the years each was made into a religion. Buddha, Jesus, Krisha, Mohd - all shared experiences and it was existential expereinces in human form.
              
              Of course, there are some who go to temples/church or ... to pray and sadly it is prayer of supplication which is tantamount to ''begging''. Prayer when it is a prayer of gratitude is healthy. The same goes for all others. The neurosis is that man created a fiction and that fiction is God in man''s image. Hence, the exclusivity, the prejudices, the judgements, the bigotry.
              
              A fiction needs maintenance and what is true is missed cos the preoccupation with maintenance of fiction is enegry-sapping. Eg Personality needs maintenance cos it is a mask(s). Individuality (indivisible) does not need cos there are no personas. Real religion is always an individual experience and cannot be contained or shut in a box cos what is true always changes! Not to be confused with truth.
              
              The sutras, the scriptures, the texts .... add on are mere devices to bring one ''home'' inwards to one's being. How to know? Am i being nasty now? Am I being kind now? These are footprints of one's being It is a process, a continuum, that is the essence of being religious, if one call himself or herself as religious. My standing in a church or a temple does not make me religious. My being nice to strangers, animals, all people without selection is the essence of being religious. Sadly, when one were to look around it does not feel so. Wearing ''badges'' or merely quoting texts, sutras or .. is not religion it is a ritual.Knowledge cannot pretend wisdom. Wisdom emanates from one''s being, knowledge is acquired from outside of oneself. The former frees, the latter binds. When one comes across someone who can relate to ... it reflects the quality of his Being. Being means being eg, kind, being loving, being rude, being considerate or .... .
              
              Muse over this
              
              A man is at the bar n another walks up to him n asks him, "Are you Ernie Smith?"
               The man says, 'yes"
               The man then says, 'Were you in Boston a few days ago?'
               Ernie says, "Just a min," n from his bag takes out a notebook, turns some pages, and then says, "Yes, I was a few days ago."
               The man says, "Were you in rm 5?"
               Ernie looks into his notebook n says, "Yes."
               The man says, "Did you meet Mrs.Dorothy in rm 6?"
               Ernie looks into his notebook n replies, "Yes."
               The man says, "Tell me, did you make love to Mrs Dorothy?"
               Ernie looks into notebook again, says, "Yes, I made love to Mrs. Dorothy."
               The man says, "Well, I'm Dorothy's spouse n I don't like it."
               Again, Ernie looks in his notebook and utters, "You know, that's funny. I didn't like it either."
              
              This is what hearing is all about. One agrees perfectly, but one hears only what one wants to hear; one understands only what one wants to understand.
              In being somebody one is most likely to miss, in being nothing one is likely to arrive sooner than one knows
              
              This seems to be the predicament at least it seems for too many of us for now
