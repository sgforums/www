            <div class='col-md body'>I was waiting for this thread. If I started it, some bigot is going to close it.<br>I have already set a record here in EH.<br>The old saying 'as poor as a church mouse' no longers hold true.  The church is the richest organised religion for more than 3 decades. I posed a question before: anyone has any idea how much the Vatican Treasury holds?<br>So, it does not come as a surprise that the top 5 out of 7 are Christian groups.</div>
