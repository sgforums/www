            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Welcome to EH<br><br>Personally, I feel that it ok to attend 2 church service on the same day, and even have communion twice (after its to bring to remembrance what the Lord had done for us).<br><br>My only concern is the physical aspect of it, being in a rush in-between two location may eventually take a toll on your physical health and may lead to a 'burn out' (there was a period of time I was doing this also, and I got burned out and in the end, going to church become a chore rather than a joy). Hence I will recommend that you stay and serve in one church, rather than tire yourself out.<br><br>But at the end of this, the decision is up to you.<br><br>cheers and God bless.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The method of worship is absolutely different (so is it ok?) and<br>2. Is it ok to have 2 holy communions on the same day?(To drink the red wine and eat the bread)<br><br>My opinion:<br>1. The method of worship thing should be something you are comfortable with. Some people have certain inclination while others do not. So it's all up to you.<br>2. Multiple holy communion? My personal take is: while there is really no reason why you cannot take, I don't see the need to take more than one.<br><br>Having said all that, I think you need to make a choice as to what you want to do. Going along with a friend for the sake of friendship is really not a good reason why one goes to church. <strong>Worshipping in church goes beyond sitting in the sanctuary and going through the motions of the rites and rituals. A worshipper should go towards committing oneself to the attitude of servanthood within the chosen church.</strong><br><br>Hope this helps.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Sorry, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  hehe... but as far as I know, we use the traditional way to worship god. Unlike other churches (take FGA or Calvary for example), we (in Lutheran) confest by reading the script which is found in the liturgist. Then we praise by singing the hymn from the book provided by the church. Just put it simply it's quite traditional lar <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">. I might be wrong, I heard from my cousins saying that the way of worshipping is quite similar to any catholic churches in which they use Anglican style. Not sure how true it is but if I'm wrong...hey, no offence yah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Also, I noticed that the layout of the lutheran church is also quite similar to this Catholic church (in the pic).

The distance is not 'out of way'. Like,... if you take a ruler, u travel 30 cm (from 0 cm) to ur first church. Then minus 10 cm to your second. So, just put it simply it's quite convenient lar. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Speaking about the holy communion, in Lutheran, they didn't mention anyhing about having multiple of it.

Everybody knows each other and gets a chance to serve god. Unlike other big churches, (like I've attended FGA) we just worship by singing some songs and then go home... hehe frankly it's actually my friends who brought me there. He knows that my current worhip starts at 10:30 so he ask me to join at 7:30 in the morning. Somore it's not out of way.

If you subscribe to one form, stick to it. It has to do a lot with testimony - example - your friends know you are from a traditional lutheran church. one day they spotted you at the other church with contemporary worship service. They may question "Eh, why is bobby35 doing there? Lutheran church don't mind contemporary worship?"<br><br>Hope it gives you a better insight.<br><br></div>
