I was a non-believer too when I started dating with my gf who is a christian. We have lots of quarrels becoz I always think she want to force me to convert to christianity. Luckily for us, she does not have any friends to ask her to leave me. Eventually, we managed to sort out our problems.<br><br>My gf always wanted me to believe for myself and not becoz I want to be with her.<strong> Believe in Christ is building a relationship between urself and GOD....definitely not something that can be forced on u.</strong> I come from a buddhist/taoist family and my mum is a staunch believer in chinese traditions. When I quarrelled with my family and gf, I thought everything going to end. I was sandwiched until i can bearly breathe. <strong>But take faith, everything bad will pass....just have more faith in urself and ur bf, and everything GOD will make well for u.</strong><br>You have to talk things out with ur bf. I can see u love him very much and dun want to lose him. Assure him of your love, tell him for the good of both of u u will be receptive in going to church and listen to his word. You said:"I am a non Christian now, but that does not mean I will remain that way forever. "<br>I can see u are a receptive person, <strong>just have more faith in GOD, and eventually build up ur own relationship with GOD, and GOD will do the rest for u definitely.</strong></div>
