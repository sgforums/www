            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rainee:</div><div class="quote_body">Thanks for your opinion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I was wondering about that as well, I asked one of my Christian friends about this and she said it is good that I am considering Christianity as my religion after I have learned about it through my bf. Before this, even though my parents are strong Buddhists, I am not really someone who is really into religion. But after getting to know him and hearing about his faith in God, I decided to try to learn more about the religion.<br><br>I mean, isn't this a good thing in itself? If I have not been in this r/s with such a strong believer in Christianity, would I even be tempted to learn more about it? </div></blockquote>Hi rainee, I have been following this thread but have yet to share with you yet. My first point to you is: don't become a Christian for the sake of your BF. Be a Christian only if you are convinced that there is a God and that accepting Jesus as your personal saviour will provide you with salvation.<br><br>The sentiments about whether one should marry a non-Christian or not stems mainly from 2 Cor 6:14. To most traditional (and possibly rather rigid) Christians, it is a popular verse to quote to justify the stance of not marrying Christians. For starters, nothing in the entire chapter of 2 Cor 6 talks about marriage specifically. It talks about relationship between people. I have even heard some speakers in church saying that Christians should not have non-Christian business partner, base on this verse. Taking the context of the books of Corinthians, Paul was specifically addressing the immoral conditions of the city of Corinth at that time, hence, one need to consider why the letters were written.<br><br>We need to understand that in this era, it is impossible NOT to have any dealings with non-Christians. While business dealings are easier managed, marriage is not. One pastor (that I respect immensely) shared this to his congregation: marrying a non-Christian is not a sin punishable by death, it is just that there is a huge amount of issues to be resolved subsequently. When a couple is not of the same mind in faith, issues like upbringing of children, what to do on Sabbath, life style etc will all become major flashpoints in their life. I fully agree that it does not mean that the grace of God is not in the couple if the couple is not of the same mind in faith. I have seen too many couples coming totally in Christ even up to 30 years after their marriage.<br><br>One last point.... ask your bf to leave CHC! There are many many good churches who are sympathic to your current situation. If you or your bf wish to discuss on CHC, drop me a PM.... Alternatively, the EH Christians are more than happy to give you our take on CHC.</div>

While most of the more "seasoned" EH contributors are avoiding a protracted, thus pointless, discussion with the anti-Christians, we will be more than happy to discuss and when possible nudge seekers the way we see to be right. After all, as laoda, and myself (in the past) had maintained, this is a CHRISTIAN forum. No different from those who reside in Light of Atlantis or the Buddhist threat who may advice their seekers to go those ways, and as I have said before, it would be totally wrong to preach there.

When I quarrelled with my family and gf, I thought everything going to end. I was sandwiched until i can bearly breathe.

I can see u love him very much and dun want to lose him. Assure him of your love, tell him for the good of both of u u will be receptive in going to church and listen to his word.
