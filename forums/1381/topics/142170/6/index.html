I am not a full fledged Christian yet because I came from a staunch Buddhist family and my parents are strong Buddhists. So I think I will face objection and arguments when I voice my decision to become a Christian to them.<br><br>As some of you might know, I am currently studying overseas and am already facing a lot of stress over here, so I think it would be better for me to get their approval only when I go back home(which will be roughly a year or so from now). I would like them to know of my decision, I don't like to change my religion behind their back because that would be like lying to them. So since my parents are not exactly the easiest people to talk to on Earth plus they don't really like to accept changes, I think it would be best if I talk to them abt this when I am face to face with them, not over the phone. I have experienced heated arguments with them over the phone before over other matters and the problems never got solved cos most of the time we would spend our time arguing and getting frustrated when we ended the call.</div>

But, the idea is that we will not be influence to go into another religion.<br><br>But being born in a family where mother is serious buddhist and father is a so so christian. I am still born in a christian setting. I came up with the conclusion, that it is not your spouse that determine your faith but rather you yourself.<br><br>My take. See if your spouse is ok with you keeping your religion. If you do not like your present church people heavy handedness, you can change church... Take it from me, GOD will not punish you or love u less. Better still near your house, can don't need to wake up earlier... (like me)<br><br>If your spouse insist u change religion, then make up your own mind. Don't let anything, church people or spouse, to determine which is more important to u. Personally, if she loves me, she will respect my religion even though it is not the same as her. Likewise, I will respect her religion.<br><br>We see a lot of heavy handedness in christianity these days... They are marketing like a corporation. I pray that these churches do the right thing and not become another NKF. It make sense for them to keep people in the church and discourage u to find a partner non christians.</div>

I took it quite negatively last time and even argued with my gf who is a strong believer in the hope that I will persuade her that I can love her even though I am not a believer. I cant accept that to her GOD is always no.1, i am no.2. Now I know why she believe.<br><br>What I believe: if one really want to make a relationship work, it is not only up to the both of u, but GOD also. Bring GOD into your relationship, ask GOD for guidance and show u his direction. U may not have a lot of faith now, but to have little faith is better than no faith at all, and I believe your bf who is a strong believer will be able to show u the positive side of our relationship with GOD. Really hope that u can sort out your problems and would be happy for u if u receive christ into your life, for Christ is the only one whom we can really rely upon when we are in trouble.<br><br>Focus on Christ when u decided u want to pray. The words of men may failed but Christ is the one whom u can trust.</div>

While most of the more "seasoned" EH contributors are avoiding a protracted, thus pointless, discussion with the anti-Christians, we will be more than happy to discuss and when possible nudge seekers the way we see to be right. After all, as laoda, and myself (in the past) had maintained, this is a CHRISTIAN forum. No different from those who reside in Light of Atlantis or the Buddhist threat who may advice their seekers to go those ways, and as I have said before, it would be totally wrong to preach there. This is EH, you either come in to share, to seek or to argue. I'd ignore those who wants nothing more than to pick a fight.<br><br>To anyone who does not believe in God (or the Christian God), the prayers would not offend 'cos to these people God does not exist, thus the prayers will NOT work.<br>To believers, it is well within our agenda to try to nudge non-believers to our faith.<br>While, as most forumites may know, that I am totally against the forcing-down-your-throat brand of Christianity, I will be more than happy to provide some comfort and answers, and if such answers will lead an individual to Christ I will unabashly do it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If I am addressing the needs of a specific individual and this individual feels that these needs are met, I would not consider the opinions of those who are not involved. They are totally unimportant. </span></div>
