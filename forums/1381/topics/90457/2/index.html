After police know about this incident....u wan to sue..or dun wan is not up to the victim choice. By just telling police..he come into church make noise is sufficient. No need to say...u wan to sue him...i wan to bring him to court. Except for private law. Then is up to u to sue him.<br>Eg...if someone punch ur face...u report police. the fellow scared liao, then he pay u S$10000 for not to sue him..and he beg u...So u tell the police..i dun wan to sue him liao. Haha..more charges ahead. The victim have no right to stop the prosecution...only the Attorney General.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Why do you think The Chick publication literature are discreetly slotted into letterboxes of Catholic Families instead of giving to the Catholics face to face?<br><br>Yes, the churchgoers who parked their car illegal were in the wrong.  That's why all the Parishioners of OLPS Church decided not to sue the guy.  But the authority has stated that this is a criminal law and there is nothing that the victim could do.<br><br>I am amazed to see that the Catholics from OLPS were, throughout the whole time, being impartial and fair about this whole thing.  They agreed that the car owner was selfish and at fault.  They felt that the guy who disrupted the church service should not be sued.<br><br>I am sure Jesus, During the Lord Supper, will take pride in them -- The Roman Catholics of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Eh, what is a Chick publication?</div></blockquote>It is a series of anti-Catholic tracts with cartoons in it. It was written by a man named Jack Chick. Not much is known about him. You are advised not to read them, because they are full of lies. Examples include:<br><br><ul>The Catholic Church keeps "the name of every Protestant church member in the world" in a "big computer" in the Vatican for use in future persecutions.<br><br>But the conspiracy is much broader than this, and it has been going on for a very long time. In the sixth century, for instance, Catholic leaders manipulated the Arabian tribesman Mohammed into creating the religion of Islam to use as a weapon against the Jews and to conquer Jerusalem for the pope.<br><br>The Jesuits instigated the American Civil War, supporting the Confederate cause and seeking to undermine the Union. When they failed, they arranged the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Later, they formed the Ku Klux Klan.<br><br>"Jesuits worked closely with Marx, Engels, Trotsky, Lenin, and Stalin" to create Communism, and it was "believed that soon . . . Communism would rise up as the new strong daughter of the Vatican." It was Rome that instigated the Bolshevik Revolution and the murder of the czarÂ’s family. The Communist "liberation theology" movement also is a Vatican plot.<br></ul><br><a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/sr_chick_tracts_p1.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/library/sr_chick_tracts_p1.asp</a><br><br>A total load of rubbish from a man who does not know anything about the Catholic Church.<br></div>
