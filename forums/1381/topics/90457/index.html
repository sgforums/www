            <div class='col-md body'>actually such incidences are not limited to this Catholic church. On all Fridays near mosques you can see cars double parked. A religious building sees a spike in attendance on special days and most of these cannot afford to have a multilevel carpark built within the compound.<br>It is obviously wrong for the church-goers to park their cars outside someone's house, but it is equally wrong that some home owners choose to "chop" the empty space on the opposite side of their houses by putting plastic chairs on these empty spaces.<br>But I must say that it is awakening for the church to understand the need to be considerate in their driving habits and I can understand the frustration of the individual who had waited to have his problem resolved.<br></div>

In S'pore, the constitution provides fundamental rights of citizens and these include freedom of speech. Criminal law is related to public. That means, any action that threaten the well being of the scoiety fall under this category. Public right is place more importance than individual right in law. Eg...u can sing...is ur right to sing ( individual right)...but if u sing at 4am..the well being of the society is being threaten...then u r consider to have commited an offence...if serious...a crime.  So...this guy..has definetely threaten the well being of the society..even though he is personally right. He could have sue the car owner under private law...but he made a wrong move. Even the victims ( church goers) dun wan to sue him...but under crimal law, the victims have no say in whether a person is charged. Only the Attorney General can stop the prosecution.<br><br>hope this help.<br>To all catholics...pls park ur car properly. Amen.</div>
