              <p><br> I am not sure about CHC and NCC.   In the past, i have
              come across churches who focus too much on quantity desperate to
              get the church people to teach bible study though some of them have
              no firm or much bible knowledge.</p>

              <p>I dunno really, somehow i think the church has to be responsible to train the people well before getting them to teach bible study.</p>
              <p>I was glad i attended the seminar or bible study by Pastor Peter Tan who is so well versed and know the bible well.   He has good interpretation of the bible.    Too bad, his church is in Malaysia.   If not I can recommend you to attend his church.  He is a humble man</p>
