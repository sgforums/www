              <p>When one wears a Badge - be it Islam (Muslim), Hinduism(Hindu), Buddhism(Buddhist), Xtianity (Christian) - one is merely a prisoner- one is bound by so many tenents. It limits one in many ways. It is an unfreeing experience, one is in bondage.</p>
              <p>However, when one is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEING</span> Mohd, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being</span> Krishna(?), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being</span> Buddha or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being</span> Christ - one is flowing and one is relating to oneself and vice versa. One embodies consciousness of being eg Christ or .... one is free and one is longer bound to ....</p>
              <p>Sadly, in today's organized religion it is more of rituals and rituals. One is no longer flowing one is merely trapped.</p>
              <p>Real religion is one who is loving, being kind, being grateful and I m sure many of us have across such a person. He or she has arrived. He/she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has not alienated the God within him/herself</span>. Many today are so alienated they go around searching looking for God (call whatever it may suit u) in a church , temple, mosque or ...</p>
              <p>When one cannot find God (or...) within him/herself one cannot find it in a church, temple , mosque or ...</p>
              <p>This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my expereince</span> - and the reader is free to reject or whatever suits him/her.</p>

              I've given it a thought and for whole my life have given it a chance I like what I saw, I like what I experienced. Evil fled when I cried out to God, I get to receive the things that I really wanted when I asked, I've had been shared a revelation of sort, I've had a few other nice surprises as well. I never thought God could be more alive.  Sure I've had many Christians who let me down but what more can I ask from God. I'm happy being a Christian. I just fix my eyes upon Jesus and do not seek the approval or even acceptance of other Christians who many are really not Christian at all. I'm not saying that I'm better than other Christian I'm saying that I at least I really believe in what I believe in.

              Some people who are able to transfer their consciousness inside others MUST REALIZE that what they do doesn't escape God and the coming judgment.<br><br>
              They must also realize for every evil there's the equivalent good. As far as I'm concerned there are people who know and watch them without their knowing. Haha. You don't really think the ruler of the universe would allow chaos to rule?<br><br>
              They MUST give account for what they have done sooner or later. They are after all only human.<br><br>
              They must realize that the heart of each man is SACRED. In it dwells the Lord. Intruding into other people's heart without God's consent is a SACRILEGE.
              You can be either an agent of good or evil when you intrude into other people's heart.
              <br><br>
              If you can try intruding into the heart of a dead person. You can't can you? I hope you could so that you would know your fate!

              You know at some point you learn to speak in your opponent's own language the only kind that they understand. Had you known what these people who rule Singapore like you would hate them too. They consider themselves above all including above law, moral and God. Their own lives are insults to God. But you don't know this. They are lower than street thugs! I despise them. They are the kind of people who could only feel good about themselves when they degrade and dehumanize others and strip others from their basic human rights. They are cowards with a false sense of pride!

              humans are not aware of. After that you feel good thinking that
              something good will come out of this accident as it is GOD's will
              that it should happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you have incurable cancer and you will die 6 months later,
              the christians come and tell you to thank GOD that you will be
              going to heaven soon to enjoy life. You end up feeling good and
              happy that you are going to die soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you break up with your gf, the christians come and tell you
              that GOD will give you another better gf. You end up feeling good
              and happy again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you have a low salary job, the christians come and tell you
              to thank GOD that at least you have your hands and legs and you are
              able to walk and at least you have food to eat. Again you end up
              feeling good and happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you see evil people not getting punished and getting away
              with it, the christians comes and tell you that these people will
              get punished when they are dead and they will be send to hell.
              Again you end up feeling happy and good.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Actually Christanity is all about self deception to make yourself feel good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You believe in Jesus Christ and you will go to heaven after you die. You feel good and happy believing that you will got to heaven.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you meet with a accident and become hadicapped, the christains will tell you to thank GOD that you are at least still alive and that this accident happen for a good reason in which we humans are not aware of. After that you feel good thinking that something good will come out of this accident as it is GOD's will that it should happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you have incurable cancer and you will die 6 months later, the christians come and tell you to thank GOD that you will be going to heaven soon to enjoy life. You end up feeling good and happy that you are going to die soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you break up with your gf, the christians come and tell you that GOD will give you another better gf. You end up feeling good and happy again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you have a low salary job, the christians come and tell you to thank GOD that at least you have your hands and legs and you are able to walk and at least you have food to eat. Again you end up feeling good and happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you see evil people not getting punished and getting away with it, the christians comes and tell you that these people will get punished when they are dead and they will be send to hell. Again you end up feeling happy and good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in reality Christanity is all about self deception and thinking on the good side to make yourself feel better <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in actual fact christanity is a religion</p>
