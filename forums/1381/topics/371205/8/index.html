              <p>speaking abt the ark..the size and shape of it was way too technological advance..that the titanic was inspired with that design.</p>

              <p>they are in an ark..and whats under them??water and more water...where else u wanna dump the waste that eventually became very fertile soil??hehehe...</p>
              <p>as for them staying in harmony..God had said that the lion will lie beside the cow and eat grass..so i think its ok...im just curious how he managed to collect so many animals in so little time..its just ard 40 years if im not wrong..and he got to build the ark..</p>
              <p>and dont forget the food supply...how it was kept fresh even for the animals..</p>

              <p>Most Hebrew scholars believe the cubit to have been between 17½ -21½ inches long. This means that the ark would have been 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high if the 18 inch cubit was used. If a larger cubit was used it would have been proportionately longer.</p>
              <p>The displacement tonnage of the ark, which is the weight of water it would displace at a draught of 15 cubits, would be more than <strong>22,000 tons</strong>. By comparison the U.S.S. <em>Salem</em>, a 716-foot-long heavy cruiser commissioned in 1949, has a displacement tonnage of 21,500 tons. The ark's gross tonnage which is a measure of cubic space (100 cubic feet is one gross ton) would be 15,100 tons. The ark's total volume would have been <strong>1,518,000 cubic feet</strong>. This would equal the capacity of 569 modern railroad stock cars. The standard size for a stock car is 44 feet long and a volume of 2670 cubic feet. This would make a train more than 5 ½ miles long. The floor space for the ark would be over <strong>101,000 square feet</strong>
              </p><p>The following calculations show the amount of the ark space that would be required to carry the stated number of animals, based on the average size of a sheep.</p>

              <p>wah..very technical...as according to NIV version..genesis 7:1-4 he was to take in 7 of each male/female of clean and 2 of each of unclean..as according to its various kinds..7:3 mentioned the various kinds..which means the darwin evolution theory as mistaken..birds and animals even fishes were able to adapt to their surroundings at different circumstances..for darwin point the birds of his that some had larger beaks while some had smaller..he call it evolution.but in his theory, creatures will eventually evolved into something else totally..like ape to man..some land dwelling dog like creature to the eventual whale..this would be wrong..</p>
              <p>adapting to differenct settings will only cause the creature to develop little changes even in the physical sense so it will be able to better survive..this adaptibility and possible genetic mutation is already mapped out by God when he created stuff...</p>
              <p>and such a huge vessel ends up not being found at all..no traces..no nothing..just imagine the amount of trees needed to build the ark..</p>

              <p>If the basics of the bible are all the same, then u should perceive Jesus &amp; Yeshua as the same person. Jesus is written in the bible! regardless of wat churches teach.</p>

              <p>thats where the congregation and the elders comes in lor..say eg im a noob..i read the bible and perceived topic A as such..during a group study..i voice out my interpretation and is corrected by say an elder..but he cant just say im wrong..he have to show me why im wrong..with other verses..that will all prove to be in line with what he said..that is the consistency i was saying..so from there..if im not convinced..i will find other verses to "debate" with..so either way, its either i learn the truth..or they learn the truth..and both will benefit no matter what..just like if chuck norris were to fight chuck norris..winner will be chuck norris..u ask brey many qns leh...</p>

              <p>how hard is the question, tell me which feast of Yahweh you want to discuss first... by your answer you clearly show me that you do not even know what the feasts of Yahweh are.</p>
              <p>no way I will ever precieve the church's jesus as Yeshua. They are different people altogether.</p>

              <p>i would stick to how one perceive didnt matter because when compared with the bible...the consistency of God's personality will show..the only eg i can think of is say im a foreigner..i got the huge thick book of how lee kuan yew wrote about his life...i got no idea who he is in the beginning..nor the chance to talk to him as he is so high up..but i got the damn book..luckily at $1 from bras basah complex..</p>
              <p>the first thing i will learn is he is call lky..the church omitted the name of God and subtituted it with titles even though the name of God appeared more than 7000 time in both testament..</p>
              <p>so as i read on the book of lky..i (assuming there is no whitewashing..), i come to realize what kind of a leader and person he is and believe in him,makin him my idol..and i began to hear ppl calling him names and negative remarks..so i can only re check it with that damn book i have in hand and refute those name calling assholes..because i cant talk to lky personally..so thats how i dare say i understand God better than many long time christians or even high level clergymen out there..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like GoW ar??hmm..i like my side scrolling..PS2 LoI and the other one didnt really interest me for long...see liao den sianzzz..</p>
