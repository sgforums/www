              <p>hence your misunderstanding.. .I did not say the you keep the commandments for salvation, I said you have to keep the commandments because of salvation. These are two very distinct and separate ideas. Unfortunately, the church always gets this mixed up when one starts to mention Torah. Torah does not earn me righteousness, grace through Yeshua does.</p>
              <p>I said that because you are saved you are now under His rules and His ways so therefore the commandments have to be kept as you are His child, they are our very basic foundation for living life according to what pleases Him. He has already told you what pleases Him yet man chooses to follow vain tradition, the Jews who do not know Maschiach do things more right than the church would ever do. At least they follow His ways.</p>
              <p>The point of Maschiach coming the first time was so that we would have grace and the opportunity to repent and Teshuva back to Yahweh. The message of the church has always been wrong. They made it about jc, but the message of Yeshua has always been turn back to the Father. This message is central to all the works in the bible... G_d calling us to turn back to Him.</p>

              <p>BUT....Jesus also left a gift..a gift of redemption(not the song by gackt)..those who will die in the name of Jesus will live...but many who choose to die in Jesus name will be rejected by Jesus and God..for they do not know those people...</p>

              <p>why is it that when ever one talks about Torah/Commandments/Law the first thing christians assume is that we cannot keep it? or we don't have to keep it? why also do christians always make that distinction that salvation and Torah are mutually exclusive?</p>
              <p>Yet Yeshua did say follow Yahweh's commandments. His sacrifice for us is not so that we don't have to keep Torah, His sacrifice for us is so that we have the grace to repent and turn back to Yahweh and walk in Torah.</p>

              <p>Yes, that is right. What i mean is because Jesus has already purchased for us freedom and there is therefore now NO condemnation, a christian can walk boldly in God's prescence and continue in Gods ways. However, should he fail, he should not condemn himself for failing, but pick himself up,look to Jesus, and continue walking...</p>
              <p>There is no longer a spirit of fear, but a spirit of love and confidence that we are empowered to live Godly lives ...  Grace is not an excuse to carry on sinning. It is a providence for the sinner to come back and continue his walk..     </p>

              <p>Jesus Himself defined Fear of the Lord..  Not fear as in scared, in terror, but rather, I'll quote instead..  =)</p>
              <p>Deuteronomy 6:13</p>
              <p>Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.</p>
              <p>In Luke 4:8   , <sup id="en-KJV-25072" class="versenum">8</sup>And Jesus answered and
              said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>worship</strong></span> the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. All Bible references give Deut 6:13 for this verse..</p>
              <p>Also, Paul has written in 1 John 4:18,:  There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because
              fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</p>
              <p>Now, back on topic, please realise that I am not posting against you.  I am in fact, agreeing WITH you that "His sacrifice
                                      for us is so that we have the grace to repent and turn back to
                                      Yahweh and walk in His ways" ...   </p>
              <p>Also, its not exactly nice to lump all christians together as one lot..  there are many good churches around who encourage believing right and living right.. </p>
