Lampstand is certainly not salvation but ministry.</div></blockquote>It is salvation as Christ himself will remove it.<br><br><blockquote>"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only <strong>he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</strong><br>Mat 7:21</blockquote>Doing the will of the Father = works.<br><br><blockquote>11"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. 12Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. <strong>13Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away</strong>. 14The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. 15But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. Luke 8</blockquote>Even those who believe can FALL AWAY.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes.</strong> They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy. 5He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels - Rev 3</blockquote>In Sardis, Jesus explained that some people received the white garment and soiled it with sin.<br><br><blockquote>2through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we[a] rejoice in the <strong>hope</strong> of the glory of God. - Rom 5:2</blockquote>We rejoice in the "hope" (not the presumptuous certainty) of sharing the glory of God. If salvation is absolutely assured after accepting Jesus as Savior, why would Paul hope?<br><br></div>
