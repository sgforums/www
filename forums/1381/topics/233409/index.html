It is a quality of life. IT IS THE LIFE OF CHRIST JESUS [THE ETERNAL LIFE HIMSELF] in the Christian.<br><br>2Co 6:2 For He says: "In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you." Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>now </strong></span>is the day of salvation.<br><br>You can have eternal life NOW.

Jesus Christ's death and Resurrection is the sole source of our justification (bieng in a right relationship with God) and salvation (heaven). But as a result of Christ's death and resurrection, we are now able to receive God's grace. Grace is God's own divine life which He placedinto our souls.  This grace initially causes us to seek God and to believe in Him (the "faith" part).<br><br>This is where u will stop. The Catholic position goes on.<br><br>God desires us to respond to His grace by putting our faith into action (the "works" part). This is why Jesus always taught about our salvation in the idea of what we actually did during our  lives, and not how much faith we had ("whatever u did to the least of my brothers, u did to Me."). When Jesus teaches about His second coming where He will separate the sheep from the goats, He bases salvation and damnation upon what we actually did ("works"), whether righteous or evil.<br><br>I personally feel it does not contradict the Lutheran position as it is the same doctrine but explained in a different manner. However this Catholic belief contradicts the novel Protestant notion of "once saved, always saved" or what I prefer to term as OSAS.<br></div>
