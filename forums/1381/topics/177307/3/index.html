When i was in there, everyday i'm busy with church stuff e.g bible study, prayer meeting (not inclusive of my quiet time at night), give 10%of my money (weather i earn it or my parents give, 10% will definately goes to church), offering (in cg and svc) and plus activities (e.g bbq, games day etc). I'm always poor even though i was holding a job.<br><br>At the later part, then i know that church staff are paid quite high monthly though no claims etc. This explains why they always urge the members to give generously. Imagine the highest pay was $8000.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I have no time for my family/friends or for anyone else. Until i get into depression and think of all that i done. The church dont worth so much of my time and money. Ultimately, i'm not getting paid to do all these (my phone bills always shoot up high) and my relationship with family/friends were drift apart. My parents say the house is like a hotel to me, came back eat and sleep only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Whenever we have outings (with pri sch friends) i can't attend  b'cos of church.<br><br>I'm glad that i've left the church and visit another church which is smaller (in membership and building) but its much more relax and dont require so much of me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
