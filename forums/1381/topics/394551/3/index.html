              <p>Oh i see. i wasnt talking about things that sully their image, i was only pointing out that if you want to know what they believe you should hear from the horse's mouth, instead of just any gossipy website thats all.</p>
              <p>When it comes to sensitive things like religion there are lots of gossip floating around but we have to look for reliable information. That applies to other things too actually. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>after doing research from their official websites above, I would like to clarify a few things that are abit wrong- they are generally joyful people, they hold funerals, and they pay taxes to the state. It might be better if you actually verified some information from the proper sources. For example on taxes:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20031208a/article_03.htm">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20031208a/article_03.htm</a> </p>
              <p>If you want to find them i'm sure one day they will come to your door, then you can ask them some questions<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>What might be more interesting is to actually check the <em>reason</em> why they believe certain things, and how they reason from the Bible. From the official websites i checked above, they seem to quote quite alot of scriptures. Maybe must check my own bible to follow to see if it makes sense lah.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p>The funeral part is from the death of a Catholic friend, whose daughter was  JW. I went to the "wake", at a Lavender St parlor. There was no one there. Just the casket and the deceased and all the trappings of a wake. I asked the workers there, and they said that the family just set up the place and left. Other visitors has also come and left. I put the blame on JW doctrines. I guess I was wrong, or not exactly right.</p>
              <p>I understand they will not salute the state flag, or pay taxes, but these may be hearsay.</p>
              <p>But I certainly do not find the daughter of my deceased friend a joyful person, and it is from her that I learnt that JW do not celebrate birthdays, and other joyful events.</p>
              <p>Anyway thanks for the insight.</p>

              <p>I had a close friend who is/was a JW.. that was almost 15 years ago...</p>
              <p>He went to DB instead of NS cos of his religious beliefs. WHY he believed was something we argued over - I was a skeptic and he was , too, all along until suddenly he converted.</p>
              <p>We wrote during this time until I went overseas to study. It was hard to keep in touch when we could only snailmail and he was only allowed 1 letter every week. He used to write to one person on the top half of the letter, and another person on the bottom half. Whoever receives the letter will need to send the other half to family or friend or.. anyone else.</p>
              <p>It was hard to keep in contact and slowly we lost touch.</p>
              <p>I tried to look for him but  never managed to when I returned. Often I wonder how he is and hope all is fine with him.</p>

              <p>I had a close friend who is/was a JW.. that was almost 15 years ago...</p>
              <p>He went to DB instead of NS cos of his religious beliefs. WHY he believed was something we argued over - I was a skeptic and he was , too, all along until suddenly he converted.</p>
              <p>We wrote during this time until I went overseas to study. It was hard to keep in touch when we could only snailmail and he was only allowed 1 letter every week. He used to write to one person on the top half of the letter, and another person on the bottom half. Whoever receives the letter will need to send the other half to family or friend or.. anyone else.</p>
              <p>It was hard to keep in contact and slowly we lost touch.</p>
              <p>I tried to look for him but  never managed to when I returned. Often I wonder how he is and hope all is fine with him.</p>
