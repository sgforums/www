              <p>the straits times did an article on the DB some time back, they also described the jehovah witnesses inside DB,</p>
              <p>it appears that they were housed seperately from other inmates, that they have a little compound for themselves, wear different coloured uniforms, with a kitchen for them to do their own food, do gardening, mingle among themselves, relax and do practically whatever they want, except they don't get bookouts of course. Basically they are left alone in peace to serve out their time.</p>

              <p>well, if this is for academic research, aren't you supposed to be unbiased and open minded ? from your posts and the links you put up, you appear to be seeking affirmation for what you perceive to be the mistreatment of jehovah witnesses in singapore rather than seeking info about their lives here.</p>
              <p>And why don't you ask your friend who've served 3 years in prison to link you up with his fellow cultists ? Cultists tend to stick together. Or he's since been dragged off into the night by the ISD already  ?</p>

              Many governments of the less free world despises Jehovah witness church and its members due to the fact that they discourage its members from taking part in the army of the nation. In the case of Singapore that would mean skipping the national service obligation too. They believe that the government of the nations don't most of the time follow what God wanted in effect becoming the enemy of God. It's this hostile view of the government that made them banned altogether in many countries. They are legitimate in Indonesia after Gus Dur allowed them to spread here.
              
              <br><br>
              They believe that upon dying a person soul descend to the world of the dead instead of being judged immediately and sent to heaven or hell. This is actually biblically speaking correct(ask any honest biblical scholar). But they also believe that the world is going to be around forever which is sadly not biblical at all.
              
              <br><br>
              But as long as a person admits that Jesus is His savior I welcome him as a my brother in faith notwithstanding his denomination or theological stand. I wouldn't join them but I wouldn't reject them either.

              <p>Fatum i think u misunderstand my intention. I never said they were right or that they were suffering in Singapore. I am not a JW. But I base my views on the USA state reports since there are no local sources available on JW.. I will like to hear more from local people with actual contact with them before I finalize my views and unfortunately, you are NOT one of them since you have 0 contact with them.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>It seems that much of what is posted in the web is all quite hateful against them, and some people seem to have alot of bias against JWs too. Maybe the right thing to do is to actually check out their official website to see what they actually believe. ... </p>
              <p>Have a few links here:</p>
              <p><a href="http://watchtower.org/">http://watchtower.org/</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.jw-media.org/">http://www.jw-media.org/</a></p>
              <p>oh and btw the thing about their having no pc, thats totally ridiculousy wrong, must have gotten it from some unreliable JW hate site? And i dont think anyone should label them as cult before knowing actualy what they believe. Maybe someone could share with us some reliable information from the above websites? I think those are reliable since their official websites.</p>

              <p><br>It is hard to find people from JW because of the fact they are illegal. They are not allowed to evangelise as well. If you die die also want to know anyone in JW, the devoted ones will always carry their bible with them, sometimes in their hand. keep a lookout when you walk in the mall (eg citylink ).</p>
              <p>Personally I think that if JW is allowed in singapore, everybody would want to be one, because they can chao keng.</p>

              <p>Not wanting to bear arms is not <strong>the</strong> reason for banning JW.</p>
              <p>There are other reasons.</p>
              <p>Off hand I can cite, not celebrating birthdays or expressing joy, not holding funerals, refusing certain medical treatment, and other nots that borders on anti-social behaviour, and detrimental to society.</p>
              <p>I wonder if they are agreeable to paying tax to the government, or showing allegiance to the state.</p>
              <p>Pockets of these JW would not be of a significance consequences to a society, but a large number of them would be a liability.</p>

              <p>Mancha,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after doing research from their official websites above, I would like to clarify a few things that are abit wrong- they are generally joyful people, they hold funerals, and they pay taxes to the state. It might be better if you actually verified some information from the proper sources. For example on taxes:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20031208a/article_03.htm">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20031208a/article_03.htm</a> </p>
              <p>If you want to find them i'm sure one day they will come to your door, then you can ask them some questions<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>What might be more interesting is to actually check the <em>reason</em> why they believe certain things, and how they reason from the Bible. From the official websites i checked above, they seem to quote quite alot of scriptures. Maybe must check my own bible to follow to see if it makes sense lah.</p>
