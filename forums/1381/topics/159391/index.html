In the process, they often attempt to change the more established (or traditional) ministries. More often than not, the "newer" methods fail either due to poor execution, change of leaders, or purely because they don't work. After that, everything turns back to the established ministries. In some extreme cases, people who subscribe to the newer methods may even resort to "spiritual name-calling" to those who does not agree to fall in line - I know this for a fact as I have been name-called before.<br><br>So much for claiming divine anointing or guidance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... i think the problem is becus we are acting in our own strength and wisdom which really amounts to nothing... trying to fine a human solution to spiritual problems. i think its time we really stop and seek God and hear what the Spirit says and obey...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm wondering if God still gives Christian vision today? Does God still speak to christians to do something today? If yes, how to recognise it.

            <div class='col-md body'>weeelll. some denominations do not believe in visions from God (they say that the gifts of the Holy Spirit has ceased), but then again, there are many schools of thought on this one.<br><br>but i personally believe that the gifts hasn't stopped. in the case of visions, its quite difficult to say if its REALLY from God or just ur subconciousness feeding u images u want to see, or worst, false visions by the devil. that is when we have confirmation of the vision, ie, another person has a similar vision as urself, or in the Word of God.<br><br>a good indication of a vision is when suddenly, out of nowhere, a certain image jus appears in ur mind. that could be a vision. or, for others, visions are even more vivid. i.e, they can actually SEE the vision as if their eyes were wide open, but in fact their eyes were closed. but the truth is, when God speaks, there are maaaany ways so it really depends how God wants to speak to u.<br><br>and yes, Christians today still have divine directions from God. its quite hard to really confirm whether or not it is God. that is when ur daily quiet time steps in. when u begin to know God intimately, u will be able to recognise God's voice and discern.<br><br>imagine a room fulll of people speaking, and one of them is ur father, and u are blindfolded. if i were to tell u to find ur father in the crowd, u most probably will be able to find him because u recognise his voice. in the same way, once u know God and seek him intimately, u will grow to recognise his voice.<br><br>wahaha... but i myself am still gg thru this.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not believe the school of thoughts that gifts have ceased, however neither am I among those who believe that gifts are plentiful and will be given to any who ask.<br><br>To me, gifts are for a purpose and that is solely for the furtherance of the Kingdom of God.<br><br>On the issue of "vision", I think it means different things to different people. If anyone is to come up to me and said that he has a dream and God spoke to him, I would not attempt to question or doubt that. However, if this vision has an impact on something more than the individual, I'd say that God will also speak to the other stakeholders of that issue.<br><br>In my experience in looking at such people, many of these people are also usually puffed up with self-importance. One cannot really take such people seriously. At the end of the time, it's the fruit that counts. I'd seen too many "visions" changing the course of many ministries only to also see these "vision" looking totally misguided and falling flat in its face.<br><br>Many of such "visions" is a direct cause of ego. The ego of thinking that one is really close to God. In some instances, when the "vision" fails to bear fruit, the blame then falls on those who question the "vision" in the first place. You'd think if God wanted to do something, someone can stop it?<br><br>On the question on whether does God still speak to the individual, why not! But does it have to be "visions"? Can't it be simple common sense? Can't it be merely a heart the cares that prompt the individual move?<br><br>I'd not seen a single vision in my entire life, but that does not stop me from pushing my ministry of choice to a new level each year.</div>
