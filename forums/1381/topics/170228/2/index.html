God chose you, and because you were faithful and believed, you are saved. Now the bigger plan is to get your family saved, you set the example.<br><br>Rather than focus on the negative aspect, which is what sa tan would want you to do, focus on the positive aspects.<br><br>Your job is to live your life as a living testimony to God, if your loved ones can see the changes in you, they will listen. I went through this myself when I first came to the Lord many years ago. Now my brother is saved, my mother is saved and my dad has gone from being anti to very open minded and listening whenever I share with him. Also had a grandmother who was not a Christian, I prayed for her for 10 years and she got saved!<br><br>One solid answer... pray and ask God to change their hearts and He will. Also have faith... time and time again in the NT, faith accomplishes much. Even in the OT, faith accomplishes much. There are so many stories, have faith!<br><br><strong>Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</strong><br><br>Just a few verses to encourage you:<br><br>James 5:16 The effectual prayer of a righteous man avails much...<br><br>Acts 16:31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, <strong>and thy house.</strong><br><br>Luke 1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible...<br><br>Mark 9:23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.<br><br>Mark 11:22-24 Pray believing that you have already received...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ro 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, <strong>who suppress the truth in unrighteousness</strong>,<br><br>19 <strong>because what may be known of God is manifest in them, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for God has shown it to them.</span></strong><br><br>20 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are CLEARLY seen [and clear it is indeed], being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,</strong></span><br><br>21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.<br><br>God has shown us through the things that He has made that He exists. The problem is not lack of evidence but the want of spiritual eyesight due to the blinding effect of sin.<br><br>If ever you look around you and you can't see God, that's sin working in you.<br>Sin has blinded the unconverted man's eyes and logic. No evidence so clear can convince such a one. Even if the Lord Jesus would perform wondrous miracles and would raise every dead people in the grave sin would always find 'loopholes' and every other thing  just to explain away the miracle.<br><br>The Pharisees witnessed Jesus raising a dead person from the dead. What did they do? They sought all the more to kill him.  The Israelites saw all the miracles during their journey to the Promise Land, they saw the sea opened for them, they witnessed the mountain of Sinai filled with God's presence, they saw all the miracles........what happened? Were they converted? No.<br><br>21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened</strong></span><br><br>There's no real atheist. Just hardened and blinded suppressors of truth through the process of hardening in time became convinced that there is no God. God gave them over to thier debased mind. What a frieghtening thought.<br><br>Ro 1:28 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind,</strong></span> to do those things which are not fitting;<br><br></div>
