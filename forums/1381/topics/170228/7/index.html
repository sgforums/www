If we told non-believers that they are going to hell means that it is a definite thing already, but as long as the non-believer have not died, this situation can change. The person has always got a choice before him/her, should this person then choose to believe, then he/she will not go to hell. Until the time of death, this situation is not a certainty.</div>

I am not the final judge. I believe only in the sovereignty of God. While I understand where you are coming from MC, there are more important things at hand than debating differing points of theology. Theology is man made, all the arguments that come from the arminian's or the calvinist's are all flawed because they stem from human understanding. My question to you then is this, since we all know that Jesus is also the word become flesh among us, then what does Jesus say? If you can answer this question, you then will have your answer.</div>
