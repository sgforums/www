I cannot doubt their intentions because other than having been a Missionary as a job, it is a calling, ordained by God. They have their lives just to call people back to God and spreading the gospel.<br><br>They are Called by God to Evangelise. A full time ministry.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br>What i'm referring to is Christians in general.
