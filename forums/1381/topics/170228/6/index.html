The worse thing, and i dont understand, and its pretty irksome, its that you keep harping on evangelism.<br><br>Stop using the right to evangelise as your cover. There is a limit to evangelism. Sheesh, why must we stand by and ignore while standing there is somebody condemning us to hell, starting a flammable topics, inciting hate etc etc<br><br>Why must non Christians be the one tolerating it all? This doesnt fit. It doesnt make sense one party is allowed to do anything it wants under the cover of religion while the other party tolerates. If as a Buddhist, as a Hindu, as Sikh, we are told god and jesus christ is the only way, we are not supposed to feel offended?

Sheesh, why must we stand by and ignore while standing there is somebody condemning us to hell, starting a flammable topics, inciting hate etc etc<br><br>Why must non Christians be the one tolerating it all? This doesnt fit. It doesnt make sense one party is allowed to do anything it wants under the cover of religion while the other party tolerates. If as a Buddhist, as a Hindu, as Sikh, we are told god and jesus christ is the only way, we are not supposed to feel offended? You want us to respect your belief, where is your respect towards our beliefs but uttering these words?

Your intention is as doubtful as the one who post this question. If you are really here to learn abt Christ, we can share. If not, I am not interested to waste my time arguing with u.<br><br>As I have said, this is a Christian forum. If you are anti-christian and do not want to learn abt Christ, I would say this is not the place for u. You do not come here <strong>WILLINGLY </strong> and then say pple push the gospel down your throat.<br><br>I never twist your words. Let your posts prove itself. It is obvious u have an axe to grind with christians. Do it to those who tell u "GO TO HELL!".<br><br>Shady is getting personal. U are still ok.<br><br></div>
