              <p>Could God make a burrito so hot that even he couldnt eat it? thats the paradox of the god concept isnt it. either way the concept of god is not sustainable. example as almighty as god is, but could he make someone who is more powerful and almighty as he is? if he cant create, then is he still almighty? if he can, is he still almighty? thats the paradox.</p>

              <h3>The theodicé problem</h3>
              <p>We also have the theodice problem, stated by David Hume:<br>If the evil in the world is intended by god he is not good. If it violates his intentions he is not almighty. God can't be both almighty and good. There are many objections to this, but none that holds since god is ultimately responsible for the existence of evil. Besides, if only god can create he must have created evil. If somebody else (the devil) created evil, how can one know that god, and not Satan created the universe?</p>

              <h3>Omnipotence is impossible due to paradoxes</h3>
              <p>Another way to disprove the almighty god is that omnipotence leads to paradoxes. Can god make a rock that is too heavy for him to carry? Can god build a wall that even he can't tear down?</p>
              <p>Also, if god knows everything, he knows what he will do in the "future" (in any dimension, not necessary the time dimension). He must have known that from the very start of his own existence. Thus god's actions are predestined. God is tied by faith, he has no free will. If god has no free will god is not omnipotent. Another way to put it is that to be able to make plans and decisions one must act over time. If god stands above time he can not do that and has no free will. Indeed, if god stands above all dimensions god is dimensionless - a singularity, nothing, void!</p>
              <p>Besides there can exist no free wills at all if god is almighty. If you had a free will, god wouldn't know what you would do tomorrow and wouldn't be omnipotent. <a name="void"></a></p>
              <h3>The void creator</h3>
              <p>If everything must have been created, then god must have been created as well. If god is not created, then everything mustn't have a creator, so why should life or cosmos have one?</p>
              <p>Besides this argument has another leap. If everything has a source and god is that source, then god must have existed without it before he created it. So if god created time and space, he must live outside of time and space. Thus he is non-existent. If all life must come from something and that is god, god is not alive and hence non-existent. If moral must come from god, god lacks moral. If logic comes from god, god is illogic. If nature comes from god, god is unnatural. If existence comes from god, god is non-existent. <strong>If god is the cause of everything, god is void</strong></p>

              <p>Definition 1: Omnipotence means the ability to do anything which is 
              logical or otherwise.<br><br>Definition 2: Omnipotence means the 
              ability to do anything which is logically possible.<br><br>The first of 
              these definitions would make all of your arguments futile because none 
              of your premises would be able to show that it is impossible.</p>
              <p>It is also believed that God created this earth, and all the laws within
               it. The creator is not bound by the creation, nor is he controlled by 
              the logic of it, so it is logical to say that God defies logic. . .. is 
              it not? </p>
              <p>I'm flabbergasted whenever I encounter anyone who doesn't immediately 
              see the nonsense of this kind of logic. And to make it worse, its asked by the same person.</p>
              <p>Are u a rock ? Are u so dense that u cant even feel anything.  How come u never answer back  but u keep asking the same questions ?</p>
              <p>"The classic example, of course, used to be, "Can God make a rock so big 
              even he can't lift it."  Sometimes it was expressed as "What happens 
              when the irresistible force meets an immovable object?"  Of course, at 
              least the latter was a little easier because even the student who was 
              hearing it for the first time would realize, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Both terms cannot exist in
               the same universe if the words are meaningful and consistent</span>."  But the
               former was usually settled when one of the students would volunteer, 
              "Why have you arbitrarily decided that a God would be powerful enough to
               CREATE the rock but then be so weak that he can't lift it?"</p>
              <p>"Of course, word games know no limits.  Why don't you ask if God can 
              create TWO rocks where each of the rocks is heavier than the other?  Or 
              how about this one: "Can God create a black rock that is the color of a 
              yellow flower?"  Or "Can God create a human who is twice as wicked and 
              vile as any other human who ever lived and yet be Holy and perfectly 
              virtuous at the same time? He must because GOD CAN DO ANYTHING!"</p>
              <p>Maybe a more concise answer easy for your comprehension copied above for ur reading pleasure.</p>
              <p>If someone can't see through the logical flaws in these contrived 
              "profundities", then I'm glad that I am still around. To hammer that rock. Hammer it until it breaks.</p>

              <p><strong>Albert Einstein’s Views on the Concept of a Creator God</strong></p>
              <p>The concept that universe was created by a “Creator God”, had haunted the minds of human beings since many generations. When we review this concept of a “Creator God” in the light of modern science, some of the obvious questions that arise in our minds are - Who is this creator god, who had created this “Creator God” and how did he come into existence? Albert Einstein had also never accepted the principle of a “Creator God”. He had clearly expressed his views as, “I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts.</p>

              <p>A man's ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary.

              <p><span class="f12">Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by <a href="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/physics-deduce-laws-of-nature.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">laws of Nature</span></span></a>, and therefore this holds for the action of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being.<br><span class="f12">(Albert Einstein, 1936, The Human Side.

              <p><span class="f12"><span class="f12">It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated.

              <p>The idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I am unable to take seriously. (Albert Einstein, Letter to Hoffman and Dukas, 1946)</p>
              <p>The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action. (Albert Einstein)</p>
              <p>I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it. <span class="f12">(Albert Einstein, The Human Side)</span></p>
              <p>I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being. (Albert Einstein)</p>
              <p>What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of "humility." This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism. (Albert Einstein)</p>
              <p>The mystical trend of our time, which shows itself particularly in the rampant growth of the so-called Theosophy and Spiritualism, is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion. Since our inner experiences consist of reproductions, and combinations of sensory impressions, the concept of a soul without a body seem to me to be empty and devoid of meaning. (Albert Einstein)</p>
              <p>Then there are the fanatical atheists whose intolerance is the same as that of the religious fanatics, and it springs from the same source . . . They are creatures who can't hear the music of the spheres.</p>
              <p>There is nothing divine about morality; it is a purely human affair. (Albert Einstein, 1934)</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion. To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith. The situation may be expressed by an image: science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.</p>

              <p>Though I have asserted above that in truth a legitimate conflict between religion and science cannot exist, I must nevertheless qualify this assertion once again on an essential point, with reference to the actual content of historical religions. This qualification has to do with the concept of God. During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution human fantasy created gods in man's own image, who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate to influence, the phenomenal world. Man sought to alter the disposition of these gods in his own favour by means of magic and prayer. The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old concept of the gods. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, for instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes. <br>Nobody, certainly, will deny that the idea of the existence of an omnipotent, just, and omni beneficent personal God is able to accord man solace, help, and guidance; also, by virtue of its simplicity it is accessible to the most undeveloped mind. But, on the other hand, there are decisive weaknesses attached to this idea in itself, which have been painfully felt since the beginning of history. (Albert Einstein, 1941)</p>
              <p>For a doctrine which is able to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labours they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself. This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task. After religious teachers accomplish the refining process indicated they well surely recognise with joy that true religion has been ennobled and made more profound by scientific knowledge. <br>If it is one of the goals of religion to liberate mankind as far as possible from the bondage of egocentric cravings, desires and fears, scientific reasoning can aid religion in yet another sense. Although it is true that it is the goal of science to discover rules which permit the association and foretelling of facts, this is not its only aim. It also seeks to reduce the connections discovered to the smallest possible number of mutually independent conceptual elements. (Albert Einstein, 1941)</p>
              <p>By way of the understanding he achieves a far-reaching emancipation from the shackles of personal hopes and desires, and thereby attains that humble attitude of mind toward the grandeur of reason incarnate in existence, and which, in its profoundest depths, is inaccessible to man. This attitude, however, appears to me to be religious, in the highest sense of the word. And so it seems to me that science not only purifies the religious impulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism but also contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding of life. <br>The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge. (Albert Einstein, 1941)</p>

              <p class="ep">About God, I cannot accept any concept based on the authority of the Church. As long as I can remember, I have resented mass indocrination. I do not believe in the fear of life, in the fear of death, in blind faith. I cannot prove to you that there is no personal God, but if I were to speak of him, I would be a liar. I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil. My God created laws that take care of that. His universe is not ruled by wishful thinking, but by immutable laws.</p>

              <p>Why do you write to me “God should punish the English”? I have no close connection to either one or the other. I see only with deep regret that God punishes so many of His children for their numerous stupidities, for which only He Himself can be held responsible; in my opinion, only His nonexistence could excuse Him</p>

              <p>Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their conception of God. In general, only individuals of exceptional endowments, and exceptionally high-minded communities, rise to any considerable extent above this level. But there is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form: I shall call it cosmic religious feeling. It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it. <br><br>- Albert Einstein, <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, November 9, 1930</p>

              <p>The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exist as an independent cause of natural events. ... <br><br>- Albert Einstein, <em>Science and Religion</em> (1941)</p>
              <p>If this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him? <br><br>- Albert Einstein, <em>Out Of My Later Years</em></p>

              <p>The minority, the ruling class at present, has the schools and press, usually the Church as well, under its thumb. This enables it to organize and sway the emotions of the masses, and make its tool of them. <br><br>- Albert Einstein, letter to Sigmund Freud, July 30, 1932</p>
              <p>A man who is convinced of the truth of his religion is indeed never tolerant. At the least, he is to feel pity for the adherent of another religion but usually it does not stop there. The faithful adherent of a religion will try first of all to convince those that believe in another religion and usually he goes on to hatred if he is not successful. However, hatred then leads to persecution when the might of the majority is behind it. In the case of a Christian clergyman, the tragic-comical is found in this... <br><br>- Albert Einstein, Letter to Rabbi Solomon Goldman of Chicago's Anshe Emet Congregation, quoted in: <em>Einstein's God - Albert Einstein's Quest as a Scientist and as a Jew to Replace a Forsaken God</em> (1997)</p>
              <p>The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, a development continued in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily moral religions. The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples' lives. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. The truth is that all religions are a varying blend of both types, with this differentiation: that on the higher levels of social life the religion of morality predominates. <br><br>- <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, 11/9/1930</p>

              to infinity that it becomes zero?</em>" It is like saying, "<em>Is
               it possible to get so smart that you
              become even smarter than yourself?</em>" At the end of the day, the
              question is asking whether God can be more omnipotent than himself.  But
              the phrase "more omnipotent" is self-contradictory.  It is
              simply nonsense. <br> <br> Thus, trying to answer the question is so baffling, because the question
               <em><span style="font-family: Arial;">itself</span></em> is incoherent 
              and flawed, not
              because there is anything illogical about God's existence."</span></p>

              <p><strong>Albert Einstein’s Views on the Concept of a Creator
                  God</strong></p>
              <p>The concept that universe was created by a “Creator God”, had
                  haunted the minds of human beings since many generations. When
                  we review this concept of a “Creator God” in the light of modern
                  science, some of the obvious questions that arise in our minds are
                  - Who is this creator god, who had created this “Creator God” and
                  how did he come into existence? Albert Einstein had also never
                  accepted the principle of a “Creator God”. He had clearly expressed
                  his views as, “I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes
                  his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in
                  ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an
                  individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from
                  fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts.</p>

              <p>Maybe u forgot to finish reading his later experience.</p>
              <p>Einstein himself stated quite clearly that he did not believe in a 
                  personal 
                  	God:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious 
                  		convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not 
                  		believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have 
                  		expressed it clearly."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3 id="no">No personal God</h3>
              <p>So, the quick answer to the question is that Einstein did <em>not</em> believe in a personal God. It is however, interesting how he arrived at
                   that 
                  	conclusion. In developing the theory of relativity, Einstein realized 
                  that 
                  	the equations led to the conclusion that the universe had a beginning. 
                  He 
                  	didn't like the idea of a beginning, because he thought one would have 
                  to 
                  	conclude that the universe was created by God. So, he added a 
                  cosmological 
                  	constant to the equation to attempt to get rid of the beginning. He 
                  said 
                  	this was one of the worst mistakes of his life. Of course, the results 
                  of 
                  	Edwin Hubble confirmed that the universe was expanding and
                  	<a href="http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/beginning.html">had a
                   beginning</a> at some point in the past. So, 
                  	Einstein became a deist - a believer in an impersonal creator God:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly 
                  		harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates 
                  and 
                  		actions of human beings."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>However, it would also seem that Einstein was not an atheist, since 
                  he 
                  	also complained about being put into that camp:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited 
                  human 
                  	mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no 
                  God. 
                  	But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of
                   such 
                  	views."</p>
              <p>"I'm not an atheist and I don't think I can call myself a pantheist.
                   We 
                  	are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled 
                  with 
                  	books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written 
                  those 
                  	books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in 
                  which 
                  	they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the 
                  	arrangements of the books, but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems 
                  to 
                  	me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward 
                  God."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3 id="nogod">Why no personal God?</h3>
              <p>It is the second part of the quote that reveals the reason Einstein 
                  	rejected the existence of a <em>personal</em> God. Einstein compared the 
                  	remarkable design and order of the cosmos and could not reconcile those
                   
                  	characteristics with the <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/evilandsuffering.html">evil
                   and suffering</a> he found in human existence. How could an all-powerful God allow the 
                  	suffering that exists on earth?</p>
              <h3 id="error">Einstein's error</h3>
              <p>Einstein's failure to understand the motives of God are the result 
                  of his 
                  	incorrect assumption that God intended this universe as His ultimate 
                  perfect 
                  	creation. Einstein could not get past the moral problems that are 
                  present in 
                  	our universe. He assumed, as most atheists do, that a personal God 
                  would 
                  	only create a universe which is both good morally and perfect 
                  physically. 
                  	However, according to Christianity, the purpose of the universe is not 
                  to be 
                  	morally or physically perfect, but to provide a place where spiritual 
                  	creatures can choose to love or reject God - to live with Him forever 
                  in a
                  	<a href="http://www.godandscience.org/doctrine/heaven.html">new, 
                  perfect universe</a>, or reject Him 
                  	and <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/hell.html">live 
                  apart from Him for eternity</a>. It would not 
                  	be possible to make this choice in a universe in which all moral 
                  choices are 
                  	restricted to only good choices. Einstein didn't seem to understand 
                  that one 
                  	could not choose between good and bad if bad did not exist. It's 
                  amazing 
                  	that such a brilliant man could not understand such a simple logical 
                  	principle.</p>

              <p>These days, those who fail to understand the purpose of evil not 
                  only 
                  	reject the concept of a personal God, but also reject the concept of 
                  God's 
                  	existence altogether. If you are an agnostic or atheist, my goal for 
                  you 
                  	would be to recognize what Albert Einstein understood about the 
                  universe - 
                  	that its <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/index.html">amazing
                   design</a> demands the 
                  	existence of a creator God. Then, go beyond Einstein's faulty 
                  understanding 
                  	of the purpose of the universe and consider the Christian explanation 
                  for 
                  	the purpose of human life and <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/evilandsuffering.html">why
                   evil <em> must</em> exist in this world</a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Something to balance often one sided argument. I shall entertain.</p>
              <p>But whatever it is, all are still an interesting read nevertheless.</p>
