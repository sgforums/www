              <h4>I. The Development of the God-idea</h4>
              <p>To trace the origin and development of the God-idea, one must go back to the time when civilisation was still in its infancy and science was still unknown. Primitive people, out of fear and admiration towards the natural phenomena, had believed in different spirits and gods. They used their spirits and gods to form religions of their own. According to their respective circumstances and understanding capacity, different people founded different gods and different faiths.</p>
              <p>In the beginning of the God-idea, people worshipped many gods -- gods of trees, streams, lightning, storm, winds, the sun, and all other terrestrial phenomena. These gods were related to each and every act of nature. Then gradually man began to transfer to these gods, sex and form as well as the physical and mental characteristics of human beings. Human attributes were given to the gods: love, hate, jealousy, fear, pride, envy and other emotions found among human beings. From all these gods, there slowly grew a realisation that the phenomena of the Universe were not many but were One. This understanding gave rise to the monotheistic God of recent ages.</p>
              <p>In the process of developing, the God-idea went through a variety of changing social and intellectual climates. It was regarded by different men in different ways. Some idealised God as the King of heaven and earth; they had a conception of God as a person. Others thought of God as an abstract principle. Some raised the ideal of Supreme deity to the highest heaven, while others brought it down to the lowest depths of the earth. Some pictured God in a paradise while others made an idol and worshipped it. Some went so far as to say that there is no salvation without God -- no matter how much good you do, you will not receive the fruits of your actions unless you act out of a faith in God. The Theists said, 'Yes' and went on to affirm that God really did exist. The Atheists said, 'No' and went on to affirm that God did not really exist at all. The Sceptics or Agnostics said, 'We do not or we cannot know.' The positivists said that the God-idea is a meaningless problem since the idea of the term 'God' is not clear. Thus there grew a variety of ideas and beliefs and names for the God-idea: pantheism, idolatry, belief in a formless God, belief in many gods and goddesses, etc.</p>
              <p>Even the monotheistic God of recent times has gone through a variety of changes as it passed through different nations and people. The Hindu God is quite different from the Christian God. The Christian God is again different from other Gods of other faiths. Thus numerous religions came into existence; each one differed greatly from the other and each one said that 'God is One.'</p>
              <p><a id="II._The_God-idea_and_Creation" rel="nofollow" name="II._The_God-idea_and_Creation"></a></p>
              <h4>II. The God-idea and Creation</h4>
              <p>As each religion came into existence and developed around the God-idea, the religion developed its own particular explanation of creation. Thus as the God-idea evolved within different religious systems, this idea became associated with various myths. People used the God-idea as a vehicle for their explanations of the existence of man and the nature of the life.</p>
              <p>Today, intelligent men who have carefully reviewed all the available facts, have come to the conclusion that, like the God-idea, the creation myths must be regarded as an evolution of the human imagination which began by the misunderstanding of the phenomena of nature. These misunderstandings were rooted in the fear and ignorance of primitive man. Even today, man still retains his primitive interpretations of creation. In the light of recent, scientific thinking, the theological definition of God is vague and hence has no place in the recent, creation theories or myths.</p>
              <p>If man is created by an external source, then he must belong to that source and not to himself. Buddhists believe that man does belong to himself and that he is responsible for everything he does. Thus Buddhists have no reason to believe that man came into existence in the human form through any external sources. They believe that man is here today because of his own actions. He is neither punished nor rewarded by anyone but himself according to his own good and bad actions. In the process of evolution, the human being came into existence. However, there are no Buddha-words to support the belief that the world was created by anybody. The scientific discovery of gradual development of the world-system conforms with the Buddha's teachings.</p>
              <p><a id="III._Human_Weakness_and_the_God-Religions" rel="nofollow" name="III._Human_Weakness_and_the_God-Religions"></a></p>
              <h4>III. Human Weakness and the God-Religions</h4>
              <p>Both he God-idea and its associated creation myths have been protected and defended by the God-religions which need these ideas to justify their existence and usefulness to human society. All the God-religions claim to have received their respective scriptures as Revelation; in other words, they all profess to come directly from the one God. Each claims that their religion stands for Universal Peace and Universal Brotherhood and other such high ideals.</p>
              <p>However great the ideals of the religions might be, the history of the world shows that the religions up to the present day have also helped in spreading superstitions. Some have stood against science and the advancement of knowledge, leading to quarrels, ill-feelings, murders, and wars. In this respect, the God-religions have failed in their attempt to enlighten mankind. For example, in certain countries when people pray for mercy, their hands are stained with blood of the morbid sacrifices of innocent animals and, sometimes, even fellow human beings. These poor and helpless creatures are slaughtered at the desecrated altars of imaginary and imperceptible gods. It has taken a long time for people to understand the futility of such cruel practices in the name of religion. When will they realise that the path of real purification is by love and understanding?</p>
              <p>Another weakness of the God-religions is that they offer no salvation without God. Thus a man might conceivably have climbed to the highest pinnacle of virtue, and he might have led a righteous way of life, and he might even have climbed to the highest level of holiness. Yet he is to be condemned to eternal hell just because he did not believe in the existence of God. On the other hand, a man might have sinned deeply and yet, having made a late repentance, he can be forgiven and therefore 'saved' for God's sake. From the Buddhist point of view, there is no justification in this kind of doctrine.</p>
              <p>Despite the weaknesses of the God-religions, it is not deemed advisable to preach a Godless doctrine since the belief in God has also done a tremendous service to mankind especially in times of places when where the God concept was desirable. This belief in God has helped mankind to control his animal nature. And so much help has been granted to others in the name of God. At the same time, man feels insecure without the belief in God. He finds protection and inspiration when that belief is in his mind. The reality or validity of such a belief is based on man's understanding capacity and spiritual maturity.</p>
              <p>The basic cause for the failure of religion is when the people are made to look upon their religion as an object of mere worship. This means that the religion of essential living is given over to dead functions and ceremonials. When a religion allows these conditions to exist, the religion has ceased to be of value but becomes an actual hindrance.</p>
              <p>However, it is not the religion, but the people who profess the religion and who create the demand for a blind faith in their religion. This blind faith in turn creates party-feelings and other forms of partisanship within and among religions. Thus religions, in spite of their high ideals, have failed to enlighten mankind.</p>
              <p>Religion should concern our practical life. It is to be used as a guide to regulate our conduct in the world. Religion tells us what to do and what to know. If we do not do or know accordingly, religion is no good and no use to us in our daily life.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if the follower's of various religions are going to fight and to condemn other beliefs and practices -- specially to prove or disprove the existence of God -- and if they are going to spread anger and hatred towards other religions because of the different religious views, then they are creating enormous disharmony amongst the various religious communities. Whatever religious differences we have, it is our duty to practise tolerance, patience and understanding. It is our duty to respect the other man's religious belief even if we cannot accommodate it; tolerance is necessary for the sake of harmonious and peaceful living.</p>

              <p>There is no scientific evidence indicating that God exists. We all know that. For example:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>God has never left any physical evidence of his existence on earth.
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>None of Jesus' "miracles" left any physical evidence either.</li>
              <li>God has never spoken to modern man, for example by taking over all the television stations and broadcasting a rational message to everyone.
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>The resurrected Jesus has never appeared to anyone. The Bible we have is <span style="font-size: x-small;">Let's agree that there is no empirical evidence showing that God exists. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you think about it as a rational person, this lack of evidence is startling. There is not one bit of empirical evidence indicating that today's "God", nor any other contemporary god, nor any god of the past, exists. In addition we know that:</p>
              <ul>
              <li> <ol>
              <li>If we had scientific proof of God's existence, we would talk about the "science of God" rather than "faith in God".
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>If we had scientific proof of God's existence, the study of God would be a scientific endeavor rather than a theological one.
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>If we had scientific proof of God's existence, all religious people would be aligning on the God that had been scientifically proven to exist. Instead there are <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/i28.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">thousands of gods</span></span></a> and religions. </li>
              </ol></li>
              <li>The reason for this lack of evidence is easy for any <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/i7.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">unbiased observer</span></span></a> to see. The reason why there is no empirical evidence for God is because God is imaginary.provably incorrect and is obviously the work of primitive men rather than God.</li>

              <p>Because ancient men cannot explain what was a phenomena to them then, they invented a god [in his own image]. But now we know what causes earthquakes,typhoons (hurricanes) volcanic eruption, lightning and thunder, tsunamis, famine/drought, so the domain of god is getting small, and smaller, smallest and pretty soon, there won't be anywhere for the concept of god to hide.</p>
              <p>In nature matter can not be made or destroyed but it can be altered. God is beyond nature or a great mystery beyond imagination. Man creates god in his own imagination to suit his own needs in order to find a grand purpose for life. No creature comes close to human behavior if you include wars education cities industry and religion to name a few so one thing is for sure and that is this physical world that we are aware of Man is far removed from any other creature. Lets face it man created God and man wrote the bibles If God could create the universe out of no air then would it be too tough to create a book in his own words. Life is a mystery there are no answers and some need faith so we have religion of all kinds.</p>
              <p>The concept of god was created by man or I could say a group of men, wise men. I believe that this concept was generated for the good. Just that some really got into it, and some(like me understood it)...its like a movie, many watch a movie, some get involved in it and start believing everything, imagining themselves as a cast and some watch the movie for a mere enjoyment and some like me watch the movie and understand the concept behind it..so its simple for the harmony of world there exist a god, if you can be harmony without that concept its good, but if you need a strong support for you to be, believe in GOD else believe in yourself... May GOD(the concept) bless you.</p>

              <p><strong>By Marilyn Adamson</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics2/isthere1.jpg" border="0" alt="proof 
              of God" align="right">Just once 
              wouldn't you love for someone to simply show you the evidence for God's 
              existence? No arm-twisting. No statements of, "You just have to 
              believe." Well, here is an attempt to candidly offer some of the reasons
               which suggest that God exists.</p>
              <p>But first consider this. If a person opposes even the possibility of 
              there being a God, then any evidence can be rationalized or explained 
              away. It is like if someone refuses to believe that people have walked 
              on the moon, then no amount of information is going to change their 
              thinking. Photographs of astronauts walking on the moon, interviews with
               the astronauts, moon rocks...all the evidence would be worthless, 
              because the person has already concluded that people cannot go to the 
              moon.</p>
              <p>When it comes to the possibility of God's existence, the Bible says 
              that there are people who have seen sufficient evidence, but they have 
              suppressed the truth about God.<sup>1</sup> On the other hand, for those
               who want to know God if he is there, he says, "You will seek me and 
              find me; when you seek me with all your heart, I will be found by you."<sup>2</sup> Before you look at the facts surrounding God's existence, ask yourself,
               <em>If God does exist, would I want to know him?</em> Here then, are 
              some reasons to consider...</p>
              <h4>1. Does God exist? The complexity of our planet points to a 
              deliberate Designer who not only created our universe, but sustains it 
              today.</h4>
              <p>Many examples showing God's design could be given, possibly with no 
              end. But here are a few:</p>
              <p><strong>The Earth</strong>...its size is perfect. The Earth's size 
              and corresponding gravity holds a thin layer of mostly nitrogen and 
              oxygen gases, only extending about 50 miles above the Earth's surface. 
              If Earth were smaller, an atmosphere would be impossible, like the 
              planet Mercury. If Earth were larger, its atmosphere would contain free 
              hydrogen, like Jupiter.<sup>3</sup> Earth is the only known planet 
              equipped with an atmosphere of the right mixture of gases to sustain 
              plant, animal and human life.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics2/isthere2.jpg" border="0" alt="existence of God" align="right">The
               Earth is located the right distance from the sun. Consider the 
              temperature swings we encounter, roughly -30 degrees to +120 degrees. If
               the Earth were any further away from the sun, we would all freeze. Any 
              closer and we would burn up. Even a fractional variance in the Earth's 
              position to the sun would make life on Earth impossible. The Earth 
              remains this perfect distance from the sun while it rotates around the 
              sun at a speed of nearly 67,000 mph. It is also rotating on its axis, 
              allowing the entire surface of the Earth to be properly warmed and 
              cooled every day.</p>
              <p>And our moon is the perfect size and distance from the Earth for its 
              gravitational pull. The moon creates important ocean tides and movement 
              so ocean waters do not stagnate, and yet our massive oceans are 
              restrained from spilling over across the continents.<sup>4</sup></p>
              <p><strong>Water</strong>...colorless, odorless and without taste, and 
              yet no living thing can survive without it. Plants, animals and human 
              beings consist mostly of water (about two-thirds of the human body is 
              water). You'll see why the characteristics of water are uniquely suited 
              to life:</p>
              <p>It has an unusually high boiling point and freezing point. Water 
              allows us to live in an environment of fluctuating temperature changes, 
              while keeping our bodies a steady 98.6 degrees.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics2/isthere3.jpg" border="0" alt="proof 
              of God" align="right">Water is a 
              universal solvent. This property of water means that thousands of 
              chemicals, minerals and nutrients can be carried throughout our bodies 
              and into the smallest blood vessels.<sup>5</sup></p>
              <p>Water is also chemically neutral. Without affecting the makeup of the
               substances it carries, water enables food, medicines and minerals to be
               absorbed and used by the body.</p>
              <p>Water has a unique surface tension. Water in plants can therefore 
              flow upward against gravity, bringing life-giving water and nutrients to
               the top of even the tallest trees.</p>
              <p>Water freezes from the top down and floats, so fish can live in the 
              winter.</p>
              <p>Ninety-seven percent of the Earth's water is in the oceans. But on 
              our Earth, there is a system designed which removes salt from the water 
              and then distributes that water throughout the globe. Evaporation takes 
              the ocean waters, leaving the salt, and forms clouds which are easily 
              moved by the wind to disperse water over the land, for vegetation, 
              animals and people. It is a system of purification and supply that 
              sustains life on this planet, a system of recycled and reused water.<sup>6</sup></p>
              <p><strong>The human brain</strong>...simultaneously processes an 
              amazing amount of information. Your brain takes in all the colors and 
              objects you see, the temperature around you, the pressure of your feet 
              against the floor, the sounds around you, the dryness of your mouth, 
              even the texture of your keyboard. Your brain holds and processes all 
              your emotions, thoughts and memories. At the same time your brain keeps 
              track of the ongoing functions of your body like your breathing pattern,
               eyelid movement, hunger and movement of the muscles in your hands.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics2/isthere4.jpg" border="0" alt="existence of God" align="right">The
               human brain processes more than a million messages a second.<sup>7</sup> Your brain weighs the importance of all this data, filtering out the 
              relatively unimportant. This screening function is what allows you to 
              focus and operate effectively in your world. The brain functions 
              differently than other organs. There is an intelligence to it, the 
              ability to reason, to produce feelings, to dream and plan, to take 
              action, and relate to other people.</p>
              <p><strong>The eye</strong>...can distinguish among seven million 
              colors. It has automatic focusing and handles an astounding 1.5 million 
              messages -- simultaneously.<sup>8</sup> Evolution focuses on mutations 
              and changes from and within existing organisms. Yet evolution alone does
               not fully explain the initial source of the eye or the brain -- the 
              start of living organisms from nonliving matter.</p>
              <h4>2. Does God exist? The universe had a start - what caused it?</h4>
              <p>Scientists are convinced that our universe began with one enormous 
              explosion of energy and light, which we now call the Big Bang. This was 
              the singular start to everything that exists: the beginning of the 
              universe, the start of space, and even the initial start of time itself.</p>
              <p>Astrophysicist Robert Jastrow, a self-described agnostic, stated, 
              "The seed of everything that has happened in the Universe was planted in
               that first instant; every star, every planet and every living creature 
              in the Universe came into being as a result of events that were set in 
              motion in the moment of the cosmic explosion...The Universe flashed into
               being, and we cannot find out what caused that to happen."<sup>9</sup></p>
              <p>Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in Physics, said at the moment of 
              this explosion, "the universe was about a hundred thousands million 
              degrees Centigrade...and the universe was filled with light."<sup>10</sup></p>
              <p>The universe has not always existed. It had a start...what caused 
              that? Scientists have no explanation for the sudden explosion of light 
              and matter.</p>
              <h4>3. Does God exist? The universe operates by uniform laws of nature. 
              Why does it?</h4>
              <p>Much of life may seem uncertain, but look at what we can count on day
               after day: gravity remains consistent, a hot cup of coffee left on a 
              counter will get cold, the earth rotates in the same 24 hours, and the 
              speed of light doesn't change -- on earth or in galaxies far from us.</p>
              <p>How is it that we can identify laws of nature that <em>never</em> change? Why is the universe so orderly, so reliable?</p>
              <p>"The greatest scientists have been struck by how strange this is. 
              There is no logical necessity for a universe that obeys rules, let alone
               one that abides by the rules of mathematics. This astonishment springs 
              from the recognition that the universe doesn't have to behave this way. 
              It is easy to imagine a universe in which conditions change 
              unpredictably from instant to instant, or even a universe in which 
              things pop in and out of existence."<sup>11</sup></p>
              <p>Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner for quantum electrodynamics, 
              said, "Why nature is mathematical is a mystery...The fact that there are
               rules at all is a kind of miracle."<sup>12</sup></p>
              <h4>4. Does God exist? The DNA code informs, programs a cell's behavior.</h4>
              <p><img src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics2/istherecomp.jpg" border="0" alt="existence of God" align="right">All
               instruction, all teaching, all training comes with intent. Someone who 
              writes an instruction manual does so with purpose. Did you know that in 
              every cell of our bodies there exists a very detailed instruction code, 
              much like a miniature computer program? As you may know, a computer 
              program is made up of ones and zeros, like this: 110010101011000. The 
              way they are arranged tell the computer program what to do. The DNA code
               in each of our cells is very similar. It's made up of four chemicals 
              that scientists abbreviate as A, T, G, and C. These are arranged in the 
              human cell like this: CGTGTGACTCGCTCCTGAT and so on. There are three 
              billion of these letters in every human cell!!</p>
              <p>Well, just like you can program your phone to beep for specific 
              reasons, DNA instructs the cell. DNA is a three-billion-lettered program
               telling the cell to act in a certain way. It is a full instruction 
              manual.<sup>13</sup></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics2/istheredna.jpg" border="0" alt="existence of God" align="right">Why
               is this so amazing? One has to ask....how did this information program 
              wind up in each human cell? These are not just chemicals. These are 
              chemicals that instruct, that code in a very detailed way exactly how 
              the person's body should develop.</p>
              <p>Natural, biological causes are completely lacking as an explanation 
              when programmed information is involved. You cannot find instruction, 
              precise information like this, without someone intentionally 
              constructing it.</p>
              <h4>5. Does God exist? We know God exists because he pursues us. He is 
              constantly initiating and seeking for us to come to him.</h4>
              <p>I was an atheist at one time. And like many atheists, the issue of 
              people believing in God bothered me greatly. What is it about atheists 
              that we would spend so much time, attention, and energy refuting 
              something that we don't believe even exists?! What causes us to do that?
               When I was an atheist, I attributed my intentions as caring for those 
              poor, delusional people...to help them realize their hope was completely
               ill-founded. To be honest, I also had another motive. As I challenged 
              those who believed in God, I was deeply curious to see if they could 
              convince me otherwise. Part of my quest was to become free from the 
              question of God. If I could conclusively prove to believers that they 
              were wrong, then the issue is off the table, and I would be free to go 
              about my life.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics2/isthere5.jpg" border="0" alt="proof 
              of God" align="right">I didn't realize
               that the reason the topic of God weighed so heavily on my mind, was 
              because God was pressing the issue. I have come to find out that God 
              wants to be known. He created us with the intention that we would know 
              him. He has surrounded us with evidence of himself and he keeps the 
              question of his existence squarely before us. It was as if I couldn't 
              escape thinking about the possibility of God. In fact, the day I chose 
              to acknowledge God's existence, my prayer began with, "Ok, you win..." 
              It might be that the underlying reason atheists are bothered by people 
              believing in God is because God is actively pursuing them.</p>
              <p>I am not the only one who has experienced this. Malcolm Muggeridge, 
              socialist and philosophical author, wrote, "I had a notion that somehow,
               besides questing, I was being pursued." C.S. Lewis said he remembered, 
              "...night after night, feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second
               from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so 
              earnestly desired not to meet. I gave in, and admitted that God was God,
               and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and 
              reluctant convert in all of England."</p>
              <p>Lewis went on to write a book titled, "Surprised by Joy" as a result 
              of knowing God. I too had no expectations other than rightfully 
              admitting God's existence. Yet over the following several months, I 
              became amazed by his love for me.</p>
              <h4>6. Does God exist? Unlike any other revelation of God, Jesus Christ 
              is the clearest, most specific picture of God revealing himself to us.</h4>
              <p>Why Jesus? Look throughout the major world religions and you'll find 
              that Buddha, Muhammad, Confucius and Moses all identified themselves as 
              teachers or prophets. None of them ever claimed to be equal to God. 
              Surprisingly, Jesus did. That is what sets Jesus apart from all the 
              others. He said God exists and you're looking at him. Though he talked 
              about his Father in heaven, it was not from the position of separation, 
              but of very close union, unique to all humankind. Jesus said that anyone
               who had seen Him had seen the Father, anyone who believed in him, 
              believed in the Father.</p>
              <p>He said, "I am the light of the world, he who follows me will not 
              walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."<sup>14</sup> He 
              claimed attributes belonging only to God: to be able to forgive people 
              of their sin, free them from habits of sin, give people a more abundant 
              life and give them eternal life in heaven. Unlike other teachers who 
              focused people on their words, Jesus pointed people to himself. He did 
              not say, "follow my words and you will find truth." He said, "I am the 
              way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father but through 
              me."<sup>15</sup></p>
              <p><strong>What proof did Jesus give for claiming to be divine?</strong> He did what people can't do. Jesus performed miracles. He healed 
              people...blind, crippled, deaf, even raised a couple of people from the 
              dead. He had power over objects...created food out of thin air, enough 
              to feed crowds of several thousand people. He performed miracles over 
              nature...walked on top of a lake, commanding a raging storm to stop for 
              some friends. People everywhere followed Jesus, because he constantly 
              met their needs, doing the miraculous. He said if you do not want to 
              believe what I'm telling you, you should at least believe in me based on
               the miracles you're seeing.<sup>16</sup></p>
              <p>Jesus Christ showed God to be gentle, loving, aware of our 
              self-centeredness and shortcomings, yet deeply wanting a relationship 
              with us. Jesus revealed that although God views us as sinners, worthy of
               his punishment, his love for us ruled and God came up with a different 
              plan. God himself took on the form of man and accepted the punishment 
              for our sin on our behalf. Sounds ludicrous? Perhaps, but many loving 
              fathers would gladly trade places with their child in a cancer ward if 
              they could. The Bible says that the reason we would love God is because 
              he first loved us.</p>
              <p>Jesus died in our place so we could be forgiven. Of all the religions
               known to humanity, only through Jesus will you see God reaching toward 
              humanity, providing a way for us to have a relationship with him. Jesus 
              proves a divine heart of love, meeting our needs, drawing us to himself.
               Because of Jesus' death and resurrection, he offers us a new life 
              today. We can be forgiven, fully accepted by God and genuinely loved by 
              God. He says, "I have loved you with an everlasting love, therefore I 
              have continued my faithfulness to you."<sup>17</sup> This is God, in 
              action.</p>
              <p>Does God exist? If you want to know, investigate Jesus Christ. We're 
              told that "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that 
              whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."<sup>18</sup></p>
              <p>God does not force us to believe in him, though he could. Instead, he
               has provided sufficient proof of his existence for us to willingly 
              respond to him. The earth's perfect distance from the sun, the unique 
              chemical properties of water, the human brain, DNA, the number of people
               who attest to knowing God, the gnawing in our hearts and minds to 
              determine if God is there, the willingness for God to be known through 
              Jesus Christ. If you need to know more about Jesus and reasons to 
              believe in him, please see: <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/faith.html">Beyond Blind 
              Faith</a>.</p>
              <h4>If you want to begin a relationship with God now, you can.</h4>
              <p>This is your decision, no coercion here. But if you want to be 
              forgiven by God and come into a relationship with him, you can do so 
              right now by asking him to forgive you and come into your life. Jesus 
              said, "Behold, I stand at the door [of your heart] and knock. He who 
              hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him [or her]."<sup>19</sup> If you want to do this, but aren't sure how to put it into words, this 
              may help: "Jesus, thank you for dying for my sins. You know my life and 
              that I need to be forgiven. I ask you to forgive me right now and come 
              into my life. I want to know you in a real way. Come into my life now. 
              Thank you that you wanted a relationship with me. Amen."</p>
              <p>God views your relationship with him as permanent. Referring to all 
              those who believe in him, Jesus Christ said of us, "I know them, and 
              they follow me; and I give them eternal life, and they shall never 
              perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand."<sup>20</sup></p>
              <p>So, does God exist? Looking at all these facts, one can conclude that
               a loving God does exist and can be known in an intimate, personal way.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #2d2d2d; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;"><span>“ … when I used to teach philosophy to undergraduate college students, I would sometimes ask them to tell me what the number one is. They would usually reply by writing some of the many symbols we use such as ‘1’ or ‘I’. I would then explain that such symbols are not really the number we are seeking but are only convenient ways we use to refer to the real number one. No wise person should ever confuse a symbol for something with the thing itself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #2d2d2d; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;">So what then is the number one? The first step is to recognize that the number one is a concept. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">What is a concept? The short answer is that it is an idea.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #2d2d2d; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;">The next step is to ask where the concept of oneness exists. The idea of oneness, like all ideas, exists in minds.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #2d2d2d; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;">The third step is to note that the number one is eternal. If someone has trouble with this claim, ask when the number one began to exist.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #2d2d2d; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;">Not only has the number one always existed, it is impossible for the number one ever to change. If the number one were ever changed, it would cease to be the number one. After all, if the idea of oneness changed, let us say, into the number two, then it would no longer be the number one.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #2d2d2d; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;">So where are we? I believe we can show many people that the concept of oneness is an eternal and unchanging idea that exists in some mind. And, the only kind of mind in which this kind of eternal and unchanging idea could exist must be an eternal and unchanging mind. When I reach this point in my little example, some student in the back of the classroom usually raises his hand and asks if I am talking about God.”</p>

              <p>Well, instead of a personal god, Einstein believes in an impersonal god. But the gist of it is that there is someone, something out there. From nothing to something.</p>
              <p>if u read his book  Einstein and Religion, Physics and Theology, its very very clear on his views on that. Definately not Atheist as he clearly distanced himself from that view, nor does he believe in a personal god. Max Jammer did a good job interpretating the spiritual views by Einstein.</p>
              <p>In summary, man of science such as himself, until the very end, with all his limited knowledge and understanding in his lifetime on earth. Came to his own conclusion. And that is, he was not strictly an atheist, although not a theist either. His views 
              are probably more closely pantheistic, but he's even spoken against 
              pantheism. His comment about the insufficiency of the human mind 
              suggests that he was agnostic, but I think Einstein had a God all his

              <p>If u want to believe Aliens u can man. Never say u cant.</p>
              <p>But what is an Alien ? Does single cell organism count ? or anything that is Alien to this planet Alien.</p>
              <p>May God å°±æ˜¯ only created man. And see us fools trying to use probabilities to prove that there is life out there with the billions of stars available out there.</p>
              <p>But since we can use probabilities and possibilities, why cannot there be a probability and possibility that there is intelligent design going on.</p>
              <p>So it pretty much means, when a person dont want to believe, he just wont believe even with proof in your face. Really. even with proof that the woman is using and abusing u, but man is good at self-deception that sometimes, they just only want to see what they want to see.</p>

              <p>god only created man, then someone else must had created dinosaurs ! don't tell me you don't believe dinosaurs existed on earth before. earth is not the only planets in the universe and it is not special compare with the other planets, thus i also believe there are lifes in other planets. time will tell.</p>
