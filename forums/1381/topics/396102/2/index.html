              <p>No. Science is not always at odds with religions that have a creator 
              god.</p>
              <p>Like Darwinian theory, it may not be the truth, but it is 
              true in respect of the mappings and the evolution of the various species
               on this planet.</p>
              <p>It is a mising link. And there will be other 
              theories to fit into these missing links. Thats why to me science n 
              religion can stand side by side, to give us all a better understanding.</p>
              <p>Those
               of us that have a brain, and the ability to entertain possibilities 
              will continue to pursue the understanding of a Creator and how science 
              will seek to explain it to us due to our limited understanding and 
              intelligence.</p>
              <p>Why think so limited ?</p>
              <p>Why not the 
              possibilities ?</p>
              <p>If u really want to know about Adam n Eve, u can 
              always use your own brain to find the answers u want.  To research.  To 
              challange urself. To ask . To learn. To seek. Thats all. N when u die, u
               die knowing that you tried to seek understanding on this earth in such a
               limited way and time available that you are not just a sheep. Believing in a God and believing there is NO God is definately easier then people like me that believes in God AND Science.</p>
              <p>But the choice is yours. However, I will respond when there is an extremely one-sided argument presenting itself.</p>

              <p>didn't you guys ask your pastors if you don't understand. i think these questions do not need God to answer. they are very basic questions. if these questions cannot be solved how to proceed further ? i can understand non believers are unable to answer but how come you guys also can't answer.</p>

              <p>The answers in the Bible is clear. Blind faith will say I believe in every single word. Literally. And that yes, Adam and Eve were the first.</p>
              <p>However, just as much as our limited comprehension to such literal interpretations, one such as myself find somethings to our current knowledge impossible and illogical. But who am I, a man of such limited capacity to understand, fathom the workings of the impossible and the illogical ?</p>
              <p>One will be more inclined to believe in science. To satisfy our doubt. But, science too does not seem to be seeking that truth, but only its understanding of the mysteries of the universe.</p>
              <p>Put it simply, how did   bipedal primates like us become the dominant species when there are obviosly other courins of the homo sapiens around  ? Maybe God.. decided to give us particular intelligence and/or wisdom. Did we suddenly evolve ?</p>
              <p>Am I wrong to question ? Or is it simply easier to accept it instead of making it harder for oneself. But we are humans. We are creatures of autonomy. And there is a reason to such a concept of free will.</p>

              <p>one more question, like to hear your view. i have been asking many christians, no one knows the answer. instead as romanista answer me. i agree with her answer but would like to hear them from christians.  is it you all also have no idea. or you can help to ask your pastor. i am very curious.</p>
              <div><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">From: Good News Bible (Today’s English Version)</span></em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Matthew 17:12 “But I tell you that Elijah has already come and people did not recognize him, but treated him just as they pleased. In the same way they will also ill-treat the Son Of Man.”</span></em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Matthew 17:13 Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.</span></em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Matthew 11:14 and if you are willing to believe their message, John is Elijah, whose coming was predicted.</span></em></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>unfortunately, the Good News Bible is really not a very good version.</p>
              <p>this is an analogy using Elijah as an example to demonstrate the role of John the Baptist, John 11:14, in NIV reads like this: And if you are willing to accept it, he is <strong>the</strong> Elijah who was to come.</p>
              <p>funny thing is.... non-Christians expect Christians to have all the answers....all the time. Nothing can be further from the truth. Christians do not have all the answers, Christians merely have the faith to believe in Jesus.</p>
              <p>If at the end of times, it is false.... no one will be wiser.</p>
              <p>If at the end of times, it is true... also no one else knows, except for the Christian who now have eternal life.</p>

              <p>It is a very good book to understand what Einstein meant what he did. His view on a cosmic god instead of a personal god.</p>

              <p>What he meant by "Science without religion is lame, and Religion without science is blind"</p>

              <p>Checking it out.</p>
              <p>N regarding races and skin colour. There are lengthy explainations to it but are extremely long n detailed. The Tower of Babel. <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-a021.html">Here </a>n <a href="http://bible.org/question/why-are-people-different-colors%E2%80%94black-yellow-brown-etc">here </a>. I going to small read and make comparison with archeological and scientific evidence. The scientific explaination to the genepool has substantial possibility it happening.</p>

              <p>also, one thing very funny leh.............since at the time of Jesus, China has the biggest population (God don't know meh?)................but instead of sending Jesus there, he sent him to you know where..........so mah end up much more people NOT going to heaven ?</p>
              <p>and of course since God is obviously racist as well and practice favouritism....................maybe there's apartheid in heaven also don't you think ?</p>
              <p>why the favouritism towards jews when supposedly he created everyone ?</p>
              <p>i bet the christian religion would have been long gone if jesus was a black African, eh ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>makes no sense at all...............no wonder more and more Angmohs leaving for Eastern religions lah..........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>***) what about those children that were born handicapped or deformed...........? or those small kids that died in tragic accidents or were murdered ?</p>
              <p>***) or those evil people enjoying wealth and luxury while the good people suffer ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the usual ''God works in mysterious ways'' bullcrap again ?.........................makes no sense.............</p>
