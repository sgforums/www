How do you feel about it?<br><br>I think the best way to find out about Christianity or any religion is to go to their place of worship and hear and see what they are about.  It is true there are differences between churches and some christians think their own church practises the "truth".  I say, you look and observe if they make sense to you.<br><br>The bishop who spoke at my church today quoted an example.  He recounted that 46 years ago he proposed to his wife.  His then girlfriend asked him if he will love her twenty years down the road. He said he answered truthfully that he doesn't know.  But by faith they got married and stayed married.  It is with all relationships, you place yourself in a certain position of risk. But you learn to trust the other person and also honour the trust the other person placed in you.<br><br>I don't think one can fully convince you that Christianity is the truth that you need. Some people believed and stayed one their whole life.  Some believed and then chose to walk away after some period of time.<br><br>I guess miracles do help to give hope to people. The bible records many miracles Jesus performed.  But His purpose here was not to be the rainmaker.  The miracles he performed served to demonstrate His authority, His divinity.<br><br>Look at Christianity not for miracles, but for a new life in God.  It is about restoring a broken relationship with Him.  It is about living a renewed, rejeuevenated life in God.</div>
