The term is especially used in the regular media, but inaccurate and confusing. This is partly because it implies that there was a single link missing to complete the picture, which now has been discovered. In reality, the continuing discovery of more and more transitional fossils is further adding to our knowledge of evolutionary transitions. The term probably arose in the 19th century where the awaited discovery of a 'missing link' between humans and 'lower' animals was considered to be the final proof of evolution.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-evolution.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-evolution.html</a><br><br>U can find more info from here<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Today evolution is the unifying force in modern biology; it ties together fields as disparate as genetics, microbiology and palaeontology. It is an elegant and convincing explanation for the staggering diversity of Earth's five million or more living species.</span><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Evolution: The central principle of biology</strong><br>Main article: Evolution<br><br>The central organizing concept in biology is that all life has a common origin and has changed and developed through the process of evolution (see Common descent). This has led to the striking similarity of units and processes discussed in the previous section. Charles Darwin established evolution as a viable theory by articulating its driving force, natural selection (Alfred Russel Wallace is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept). Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theory.</span><br><br>a brief search with the words "introduction biology"<br><br><a href="http://www.athro.com/evo/evframe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.athro.com/evo/evframe.html</a><br><br>We do not, after all, expect to encounter a page-one story with the headline "New Experiment Proves Earth Goes Around Sun, Not Vice Versa. Galileo Vindicated." <strong>The fact of evolution has been equally well documented for more than a century</strong>.<br>- (Gould, 1997 p.60)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We have two reasons to say evolution is fact: First, all the patterns we observe in nature point towards a nearly four billion year long history of evolution of life on earth. Putting a fancy word on it, this is Consilience. Multiple independent lines of evidence (from classification, development, fossil record, molecular biology etc.) all point to a branched evolutionary tree of life. Second, the anatomy and biochemistry of organisms is filled with quirky features, things that only make sense as artifacts of history. Again, putting a fancy term on it this is Dissonance.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.accessexcellence.org/BF/bf02/scott/bf02a02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accessexcellence.org/BF/bf02/scott/bf02a02.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dobzhansky was saying that the fact that evolution occurs explains the interrelatedness of the various facts of biology, and therefore makes biology make sense<br><br>Dobzhansky said, "Seen in the light of evolution, biology is perhaps intellectually the most satisfying and inspiring science. Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry facts, some of them interesting or curious, but making no meaningful picture as a whole."</span><br><br><a href="http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/110518.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/110518.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Yet biologists, particularly those statured by the peer review and publication of substantial personal research on the subject in leading journals of science, are unanimous in concluding that evolution is a fact. The evidence they and thousands of others have adduced over 150 years falls together in intricate and interlocking detail. The multitudinous examples range from the small changes in DNA sequences observed as they occur in real time to finely graded sequences within larger evolutionary changes in the fossil record. Further, on the basis of comparably firm evidence, natural selection grows ever stronger as the prevailing explanation of evolution.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Flipping the scientific argument upside down, the intelligent designers join the strict creationists (who insist that no evolution ever occurred in the first place) by arguing that scientists resist the supernatural theory because it is counter to their own personal secular beliefs. This may have a kernel of truth; everybody suffers from some amount of bias. But in this case bias is easily overcome. <strong>The critics forget how the reward system in science works. Any researcher who can prove the existence of intelligent design within the accepted framework of science will make history and achieve eternal fame</strong>. He will prove at last that science and religious dogma are compatible! Even a combined Nobel Prize and Templeton Prize (the latter designed to encourage search for just such harmony) would fall short as proper recognition. Every scientist would like to accomplish such an epoch-making advance. <strong>But no one has even come close, because unfortunately there is no evidence, no theory, and no criteria for proof that even marginally might pass for science</strong>. There is only the residue of hoped-for default, which steadily shrinks as the science of biology expands.</span><br><br>Interesting quite from darwin<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished.<br><br>And that is a damnable doctrine.</span></strong><br><br></div>

The Fossil Record.<br>The fossil record provides evidence for a complex, instantaneous creation. Why? A: The lower geologic layers reveal a sudden proliferation of complex life forms with every phyla represented. This Cambrian Explosion or Â“Big BangÂ” of life is preceded by no simpler forms. B: TodayÂ’s living forms show no change from their supposed ancient ancestors. C: There are large and systematic gaps between the different kinds of fossils rather than gradual, evolutionary changes.<br><br>2. Irreducible Complexity<br>Prepackaged, highly engineered systems exist in our bodies that are so complex they defy evolutionary explanations. These systems involve integrated multiple parts and reactions that work together only as a whole. If you eliminate any one piece, none of the system works at all. Evolution supposedly operates by natural selection perfecting less developed systems. However, natural selection requires something working and in place to perfect! Examples in the human body are the immune system, blood clotting, and any one of hundreds of biochemical pathways.<br><br>3. Gaps in the Living World<br>If isolated members of a species change by evolutionary processes, the main population group can still continue. We should be able to read the history of the evolutionary progression right across the very top of the evolutionary branching tree. We canÂ’t! Just as the fossil record contains large systematic gaps, the living world does too. We see evidence for creation of distinct kinds Â— not one kind changing into another.<br><br>4. Laws of Probability<br>The odds are enormously great against the successful occurrence of each of the myriads of needed evolutionary changes! Even the probability of 1 small protein occurring by accident is 1 chance out of 10260. Since we have thousands of even larger proteins, it is inconceivable they all happened by chance. Coupling that with intricate structures like eyes, wings, hearts, lungs, etc., the laws of probability scream out, Â“Creation!Â”<br><br>5. Law of Cause and Effect:<br>The Law of Cause and Effect is one of the best documented principles of science and of everyday experience. Every event must have a sufficient cause. Since the origin of the universe and the origin of life are events, they too must have a cause. The physical universe consisting of time, space, energy, and matter must all have a cause outside themselves. Likewise, life must have a living Cause. Following this reasoning to its logical conclusion, leads to an infinite, eternal, powerful, intelligent, living First Cause--our awesome Creator!<br><br>6. Chicken or Egg Principle<br>Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This question has plagued philosophers for a long time. The question is even deeper, however. Chickens have many proteins. Each protein is coded for by the DNA/RNA system. However, many specific proteins are needed in order to manufacture DNA/RNA. So which came first: proteins or DNA/RNA? The logical explanation is that they were both created.<br><br>7. Intelligent Design<br>Intelligent Design demands an Intelligent Designer. The airplane, computer, and digital camera originated not by random, undirected, chance processes, but by engineering genius. Such sophisticated acheivements however, pale in comparison to the extremely complex, systematically ordered, precision regulated systems of living tissue. The superior flight of the dragonfly, the mind boggling information mega-processor of the human brain, and the eye as a self-focusing, fully-automatic, high resolution, 3-D motion picture camera are the natural prototypes for our acclaimed tech marvels. It is scientifically inconceivable, unreasonable and illogical to credit blind, brainless chance as their maker. God alone is wise without limits, and deserves the Glory.<br><br>8. The Anthropic Principle<br>The Anthropic Principle observes that the universe, including our beautiful, blue planet appears to have been specifically designed for man to inhabit (just as Isaiah 45:18 says). Without the delicate balance of multitudes of physical properties, life would be impossible. Examples include the strength of the four basic forces in the universe (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear forces), the size and shape of the earth, the distance from earth to sun, the tilt of the earthÂ’s axis, the concentration of atmospheric gases, and the presence of abundant liquid water. It couldnÂ’t just happen.<br><br>9. Information Theory<br>Information has intelligence as its source, not haphazard chaotic chance. A computer programmer instills purpose, plan, and design by implementing and organizing recognizable bits of data into an understandable language framework. In biological systems, information is encoded as DNA, the programmed software of cells. As evolutionist Dr . Micheal Denton says in his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, Â“The capacity of DNA to store information vastly exceeds that of any other known system; it is so efficient that all the information needed to specify an organism as complex as man weighs less than a few thousand millionths of a gram.Â” Since raw organic molecules have no intrinsic cognitive capacity, who injected the information into the DNA? God alone is able.<br><br>10. Extreme Complexity<br>Complexity beyond comprehension characterizes all life forms, including the so-called Â“simple cell.Â” As Dr. Micheal Denton states referring to the cell, Â“...we would find ourselves in a world of supreme technology and bewildering complexity...beyond our own creative capacities.Â” Everything, from atomic structures to cells, organs, organ systems, and living creatures speaks of incredible order, balance, and unity as a whole.<br><br>and God Said It!<br>It is really hard to argue with the only One who claims to have been there when the universe and life began. He said He created everything to reproduce Â“after its own kindÂ” Â— not one kind changing into another.<br><br></div>

Lazarus J. Salop (1983, p. v) wrote:<br><br>Â“Progress in Precambrian geology has been exceptionally great, indeed, quite striking for geologists of the older generation; only some 30-40 years ago the Precambrian appeared as an uncertain and even mystic prelude to geologic evolution.

The first red-herring to be corrected is  the false idea that virtually all phyla appear in the Cambrian.  Ray Bohlin writes:<br><br>Â“Nowhere is the problem of sudden appearance better demonstrated than in the Burgess Shale found in the Canadian Rockies. The Burgess Shale illustrates that in the Cambrian period (which evolutionists estimate as being over 540 million years ago) nearly all of the basic body plans (phyla) of animals existing on earth came into existence in a geological instant (defined as only 5 to 10 million years). No new phyla have appeared since that time (the Bryazoa [sicÂ—grm] are one possible exception, but many paleontologists believe they will eventually be found to originate in the Cambrian period)."

It is hardly surprising, then, that we have so many gaps in the evolutionary history of life, gaps in such key areas as the origin of the multicellular organisms, the origin of vertebrates, not to mention the origins of most invertebrate groups. The creationists, of course, just love to draw attention to these gaps, which they score as points against evolution.

It is further weakened by the fact that different initial conditions sometimes lead to essentially the same outcomes, as with the initial mass of stars and their formation of heavy metals (Nakamura et al. 1997), or that the tuning may not be very fine, as with the resonance window for helium fusion within the sun (Livio et al. 1989).

Fine tuning says nothing about motives or methods, which is how design is defined. (The scarcity of life and multi-billion-year delay in it appearing argue against life being a motive.) Fine-tuning, if it exists, may result from other causes, as yet unknown, or for no reason at all (Drange 2000).<br><br>In fact, the anthropic principle is an argument against an omnipotent creator.

Just that not all forumers would want to openly debate such difficult and extremely sensitve topics like these.<br><br>If you are trying to change mindsets here, it is very difficult. You can share your ideas though, but bear in mind the sensitivity of religion. Convince yes, criticise no.</div>
