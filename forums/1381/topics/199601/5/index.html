It has been tested rigourously and never found to be false. It is a scientific FACT. I repeat. a THEORY is a FACT.<br><br><strong>The word Evolution has been used to refer both to a fact and a theory. The existence of these two distinct meanings, and confusion over the relationship between and definitions of fact and theory in science, have often caused misunderstandings among laypeople about the scientific status of evolution. </strong><br><br>Dictionary: Theory<br><br><strong>A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena. </strong><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution</a><br><br>The modern synthesis, like its Mendelian and Darwinian antecedents, is a scientific theory. When speaking casually, people use the word "theory" to signify "conjecture", "speculation", or "opinion", and the word "fact" to signify true, or verifiably true, statements [39] In this sense, "theories" are opposed to "facts". In a more strict sense, though, fact and theory denote the epistemological status of knowledge; how the knowledge was obtained, what sort of knowledge it is. In science, fact tends to mean a datum, an observation, i.e., a fact is obtained by a fairly direct observation. In contrast, a theory is obtained by inference from a body of facts.<br><br>A theory is an attempt to identify and describe relationships between phenomena or things, and generates falsifiable predictions which can be tested through controlled experiments, or empirical observation. Provisional theories tend to be called hypotheses, and well tested theories, theories.<br><br>In this scientific sense, "facts" are what theories attempt to explain. So, for scientists "theory" and "fact" do not stand in opposition, but rather exist in a reciprocal relationship; for example, it is a "fact" that an apple will fall to the ground if it becomes dislodged from a branch and the "theory" which explains this is the current theory of gravitation. In the same way, heritable variation, natural selection, and response to selection (e.g. in domesticated plants and animals) are "facts", and the generalization or extrapolation beyond these phenomena, and the explanation for them, is the "theory of evolution". [40]<br><br><strong>Evolutionary theory is powerfully predictive, and biological research relies extensively on it. The Modern evolutionary synthesis has replaced earlier explanations for the origin of species, including Lamarckism, and is currently the most powerful theory explaining biology.</strong><br></div>

It has been tested rigourously and never found to be false. It is a scientific FACT. I repeat. a THEORY is a FACT.<br><br>[b]The word Evolution has been used to refer both to a fact and a theory. The existence of these two distinct meanings, and confusion over the relationship between and definitions of fact and theory in science, have often caused misunderstandings among laypeople about the scientific status of evolution. </strong><br><br>Dictionary: Theory<br><br><strong>A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena. </strong><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution</a><br><br>The modern synthesis, like its Mendelian and Darwinian antecedents, is a scientific theory. When speaking casually, people use the word "theory" to signify "conjecture", "speculation", or "opinion", and the word "fact" to signify true, or verifiably true, statements [39] In this sense, "theories" are opposed to "facts". In a more strict sense, though, fact and theory denote the epistemological status of knowledge; how the knowledge was obtained, what sort of knowledge it is. In science, fact tends to mean a datum, an observation, i.e., a fact is obtained by a fairly direct observation. In contrast, a theory is obtained by inference from a body of facts.<br><br>A theory is an attempt to identify and describe relationships between phenomena or things, and generates falsifiable predictions which can be tested through controlled experiments, or empirical observation. Provisional theories tend to be called hypotheses, and well tested theories, theories.<br><br>In this scientific sense, "facts" are what theories attempt to explain. So, for scientists "theory" and "fact" do not stand in opposition, but rather exist in a reciprocal relationship; for example, it is a "fact" that an apple will fall to the ground if it becomes dislodged from a branch and the "theory" which explains this is the current theory of gravitation. In the same way, heritable variation, natural selection, and response to selection (e.g. in domesticated plants and animals) are "facts", and the generalization or extrapolation beyond these phenomena, and the explanation for them, is the "theory of evolution". [40]<br><br><strong>Evolutionary theory is powerfully predictive, and biological research relies extensively on it. The Modern evolutionary synthesis has replaced earlier explanations for the origin of species, including Lamarckism, and is currently the most powerful theory explaining biology.</strong><br>[/b]</blockquote><strong>fact </strong><br>Knowledge or information based on real occurrences: an account based on fact; a blur of fact and fancy.<br><br>Something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed: Genetic engineering is now a fact. That Chaucer was a real person is an undisputed fact.<br><br>A real occurrence; an event: had to prove the facts of the case.<br><br>Something believed to be true or real: a document laced with mistaken facts.<br><br>A thing that has been done, especially a crime: an accessory before the fact.<br>Law.<br><br>The aspect of a case at law comprising events determined by evidence: The jury made a finding of fact.<br><br><strong>theory     </strong><br><strong>A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena</strong>, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make <strong>predictions</strong> about natural phenomena.<br><br>The branch of a science or art consisting of its explanatory statements, accepted principles, and methods of analysis, as opposed to practice: a fine musician who had never studied theory.<br><br>A set of theorems that constitute a systematic view of a branch of mathematics.<br><br><strong>Abstract reasoning; speculation: a decision based on experience rather than theory. </strong><br><br>A belief or principle that guides action or assists comprehension or judgment: staked out the house on the theory that criminals usually return to the scene of the crime.<br><br><strong>An assumption based on limited information or knowledge; a conjecture. </strong><br><br>It is obvious from your post that you only take what suits you. In the definition of theory, you convinently left out those which I have highlighted for your information, a theory is NOT fact. it is speculation or an assumption based on limited information or knowledge. Even if we did take your original definition of theory, if you read it carefully, it says that a theory is a set of statements used to make PREDICTIONS about natural phenomena. I would not call a prediction a fact. Far from the truth.<br><br>leaving aside christianity, the best case scenario that you would get is that both creationism and evolution are both theories, so you have a stalemate.<br><br>A fact my friend is a REAL occurence, one that is demonstrated to exist and be known to exist. So far evolution has demonstrated neither. There are still too many holes in the theory for it to be accepted as fact. If you want to believe that you were created from many chance mutations and that you evolved from monkies, be my guest, i will not pursue this topic any further with you. I think you should give your evolution speil a rest. We all know your stand, do we will take unker CE's stand to agree to disagree.. Shalom.</div>
