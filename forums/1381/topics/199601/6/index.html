            <div class='col-md body'>Wow...  It seem no end to such discussion.  Just wanna to make some points here.  As to whether Creationism, currently disguised as so-called "Intelligent Design" belongs in a school setting, the answer is a resounding, no! It is not scientific theory, it is religious belief. If people want to teach it to their children at home or in church, they are absolutely free to do so.  Let me repeat i think it is alright if people want to teach it to their children at home or in church.  But i think government should remain secular &amp; impartial, it must resist the insidious encroachment of religion into the public school system.  The theory of intelligent design is a relgious theory, not an empirical theory, and has no place at all in the schools.</div>

And like your post, u mentioned that ID cannot be proven because u cannot conduct experiments on it. This seems to be the main problem as there's no way anyone can fanthom how to even get started on such an experiment. i can't even start to imagine the variables u have to control.

It is afterall, a cock and bull theory to me.  Just asking, in case i miss out anything that you as its proponent know about.

I tot tis is up to the choice of students.  I think u should feedback to ur parent.  I think tat people cannot be forced to accept  faith. They cannot be persuaded to accept what they do not understand, or what they do not like. That is politics, not religion.</div>

The story of Darwin's recanting is not true. Shortly after Darwin's death, Lady Hope told a gathering that she had visited Darwin on his deathbed and that he had expressed regret over evolution and had accepted Christ. However, Darwin's daughter Henrietta, who was with him during his last days, said Lady Hope never visited during any of Darwin's illnesses, that Darwin probably never saw her at any time, and that he never recanted any of his scientific views (Clark 1984, 199; Yates 1994).<br><br>2. The story would be irrelevant even if true. The theory of evolution rests upon reams of evidence from many different sources, not upon the authority of any person or persons.<br><br></div>
