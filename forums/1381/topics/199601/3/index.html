I am more interested in the "Gate of Christianity" to the divine, than the effect itself. As discussed in skype in Christianity, Faith is one crucial factor, and there is another crucial factor... it is not another way other than Christ, for it is taught by Christ himself.<br><br><a href="http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1722" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1722</a><br><br>[b](3) Submission is at the core of manÂ’s relationship with God.</strong><br><br>In the Garden of Eden, man was to submit to God, trusting in His Word and keeping His commandment. Adam and EveÂ’s sin was a revolt against God, a refusal to submit to Him. Jesus represented the sin of IsraelÂ’s religious leaders as the sin of Â“insubmissionÂ” (see Matthew 21:33-46). They continually challenged Jesus to prove His authority (see Matthew 21:23). They refused to submit to Him, mocking His authority at the foot of His cross (see Matthew 27:37-44).<br><br>Submission and sin are almost antithetical. Each is almost the exact opposite of the other. Salvation is the solution to manÂ’s sin. When we are born again by faith in Christ, it is a submission to God, to the authority of His Word, and to Christ as His means of salvation. As manÂ’s refusal to submit to God brought about the fall of man, so manÂ’s submission to God brings about salvation (see Acts 2:36; Romans 10:9-10).<br><br>Submission is also at the heart of discipleship. Jesus called men not only to believe in Him but to follow Him. A disciple is a learner and a follower, a student who has submitted himself to his teacher. Submission is therefore one of the prominent themes in the epistles, whether the technical term for submission occurs or not.111<br><br>------------------<br><br>Ok... gtg for now.[/b]</blockquote></div>

Did u witness the 911 attack ? Did u witness the mumbai train blast ? Did u witness the triple point of water ? Did u witness the atomic bomb ? Did u witness raffles coming to singapore ? So u do not believe in all of them just because u do not witness it ?!?!?! Come on man ! There r so many incidents in tis world and surely u can't witness every single one of them ! When sufficient evidences is produced from reputable organisation, with no conflicting account from other organisation as well as logically sound with little room of doubt, then u can believe it to be true. There r tons of evidences for evolution. And it is establish and confirm by a majority of scientists as well as almost all biologist to be factual. No cofnlicting evidence is found and the theory is logically adequate. I see no ground not to believe in it</div></blockquote>typical text book answer...<br><br>where there are tons of evidences from diggings of bones, the underlying assumptions for these deductions on evolutions spam off from a single base assumption, ie. all lives on earth begins from a single cell mircobes then evolves into more complex beings.<br>One of the issue I have with the theory of evolution is that, what trigger the change? I mean a monkey does not wake up one morning and suddenly decide to evolve (like pokemon).<br><br>can you substantiate this statement of yours "confirm by a majority of scientists as well as almost all biologist" or its just a page off a textbook? the last I read, the scientific community is still quite evenly split between the theory of Evolution and Creation and so far, none of them is able to produce any conculsive evidence yet. on why the schools teach Evolution as a science subject/topic and not Creation? this is more a political issue and not really a scientific one (ie. separation of the state and religion).<br><br>pls be reminded, Evolution like Creation as at the stage of Theory, meaning there is no conclusive evidence on both, reason is because neither can be humanly repeated in anyway.<br><br>Assumption-&gt;Observation-&gt;Inference-&gt;Theory-&gt;Repeatibility-&gt;Acceptability-&gt;Conclusion/Facts<br><br>*additions:<br>on the theory of Man being evolved from Apes, last I heard, they are still looking for the 'missing link', and what is this missing link about, its the link (that is still missing) that will link the Apes to Man.<br>ie..

Living things adapt to their environment and as they try to adapt, they change, albeit very finely.
