            <div class='col-md body'>1) As much as Christians here who preach to non-christians for their salvation, non-Christians also preach to Christians to give up their beliefs for their own good, as they believe there is no such thing as salvation, so that they won't be deceived.<br><br>My take: I appreciate the non-christians here for their efforts when they write me concerning their views abt Christianity. I too, was a skeptic and can understand why they are doing this. In fact, I once boasted to my ex-gf that I am right to bring her out of church, and I was even proud of it, saying that I was the devil who brought her out of church. Eventually we broke up, but not becoz of religious issues.<br><br>The irony in life is, now that i have build up my faith (it wasn't a easy thing for a skeptic like me), my present gf who once have more faith than me had lost hers. I was too much a skeptic for her to bear, and often she avoided arguments with me and wipe her tears silently. <strong>The things I brought up to her in question is exactly what Heng@ and some others have written: whether the bible is the inerrant word of god, whether Christ was god, "ridiculous" laws in the bible, crusades, inquisitions and even whether dolphins are gay. Come to think of it...I really was boliao... </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>For the non-Christians: u may not know or understand how born-again Christians have went through, but I can assure u the experience with GOD is genuine. It is a personal experience for many of us, and it differs from individual to individuals. The reason why u are not experiencing what we have, I do not know nor I can give u the answer, but I will say GOD is faithful. His arms is forever open to u, <strong>if u can just humble urself to listen to his word.</strong> <strong>I was humbled, tat's why I believe</strong>, not becoz I believe blindly.<br><br>2) I realised there are some good non-christians here, to name a few, OF-FF, An Eternal Now, Icemoon, SIS etc who are nice gentleman. Especially SIS, I think he talked sense more than a lot of pple I have met. I have saw how some non-christians in other forums ridicule christians and I think the non-christians here are already very mild compared to them.<br><br>For the Christians here, I thank Mcsquare/Chin Eng/Breyton/Sgmacross for their encouragement and teachings. All of u have been very encouraging for a new Christian like me, and I thank u for opening my eyes and not limit GOD to my own understanding.<br><br>3) Non-Christians may think Christians are hard-selling in preaching, but think about it, <strong>is it really hard-selling by standing firm to our beliefs in a Christian forum like EH? I think not. </strong><br><br>I believe many non-christians here have bones to grind with christians as they have had bad experiences. Like me when I was a non-believer, many may have been offended by Christians by their stand, but coming here to bring down the faith of the Christians, doesn't it shows that u are arrogant too?<br><br>Christians are pple too, we too are sinners even though our salvation has been guaranteed by believing in the lord. Like the non-christians, we are still subjected to our human pride and ego. Sometimes we get worked up also, not because of our own pride, but also becoz of how pple taunt us.<br><br>It's true that pple are hard to accept pple, and are resistant to change. What I really want to do as a Christian is to encourage other Christians to worship the lord. For those non-christians who want to listen, u are most welcomed. Sometimes I feel my efforts are futile, but even if there is one person who want to listen, I feel I have succeeded. And so far, I think I have succeeded.<br><br><strong>I personally will not go to other religious forums and bring down the faith of others. I appeal to all the non-christians: I believe u come here to discuss, not to argue or fight with the Christians. Let's make EH a better place for discussion, not flaming.<br><br>For the Christians (including Catholics), regardless of denominations, belief in how many sacraments, we are one united body of Christ. Let's show the non-believers the positive side of our faith and stop squabbling over what is not the essense in our faith. Like I said last time, Consubstantion, Transubstantion or Symbolic, we are one unified body of Christ.</strong><br><br>For some issues which are sensitive, I will start to PM instead of writing on the forums. Like I said last time, u may not agree with me, but at the end of the day, should there be an outing, we can still have a cup of tea together.<br><br>Thank you for reading.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"At the same time, not in order to justify, but simply in order to explain my lack of consistency, I say:"Look at my present life and then at my former life, and you will see that i do attempt to carry them out. It is true that I have not fulfilled one thousandth part of them (Christian Precepts), and I am ashamed of this, but I failed to fulfill them not becoz I did not wish to, but because I was unable to. Teach me how to escape from the net of temptations that surrounds me, help me and I will fulfill them; even without help I wish and hope to fulfill them."<br><br>"Attack me, I do this myself, but attack me rather than the path I follow and which I point out to anyone who asks me where I think it lies. If I know the way home and am walking along it drunkenly, is it any less the right way because I am staggering from side to side? If it is not the right way, then show me another way; but if I stagger and lose the way, you must help me, you must keep me on the true path, just as I am ready to support you. Do not mislead me, do not be glad that I have got lost, do not shout out joyfully: "look at him! he said he was going home, but there he is crawling into a bog!" No, do not gloat, butgive me your help and support."<br><br>- Leo Tolstoy (taken from Philip Yancey's "The Jesus I never knew" )</div>
