            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I am new here. I thank God for the chance to discover this forum where Christianity is not a banned topic. I believe all of you have heard about City Harvest Church and I knew that most are not good reports. I myself have heard it too, I have been to those stage Â– stumbled, shaken (but thank God not fallen), upset and suffer resentment and bitterness.<br><br>I am from City Harvest. Reached out by one of my classmates, I was introduced to this church, full of curiosity and eagerness to explore what Christianity is all about.<br><br>When I was not saved, I easily believed in deities or immortally becoz of TV media and those seems to sub-consciously made me believe in the tales and fairy, legend storyline. What we see, we believe. What we donÂ’t see, we donÂ’t believe. These statements are only proved false when I knew God. It explains the temptation of idolatry in todayÂ’s society as well.<br><br>I was rooted in City Harvest, since the day I accept Christ during Easter day April2001. My life changed from a girl with low self-esteem and self-confidence to a woman with growing maturity and God-confidence. I began to see myself as a different creation, one who is created so uniquely that gradually I began to stop comparing myself with other people and to grow in character and my attitude of God and life. It is amazing.  Sad to say, Christian life is always full of ups and downs, it is never a smooth journey up to now. Other than my own individual self, I have faced lots of test and trials in the church I am rooted in as well. I faced problem with leadership, church politics and the people way of doing things. I donÂ’t understand, like the Pharisees, start to criticize, condemn, judge. I was easily shaken when I witness how others in the same church said or did some things, I canÂ’t accept, I even get angry.<br><br>Ok. So this is City Harvest, u would say. I canÂ’t tell u that we are perfect. (Too good to be true.. no it is not meant this way at all.) AND I canÂ’t tell u that we are all part-takers of what some others are doing. One cannot represent all. I have met some leaders and members who are so glued to GodÂ’s business that whatever they do, I have to lift up my hands and respect them for what they are doing in the Kingdom of God. We have grown a lot. As church becomes bigger, naturally we become the focus point Â– either in attraction or criticism. I canÂ’t believe that we have more bad reports than good ones from other churches and non-believers. As the Bible says, if the people who joined the church join because of the excitement, one day you will see them leaving, after they have had their filled.  I canÂ’t say anything about this Â– time will tell, God will tell.<br><br>About Pastor Sun Â– initially I too, donÂ’t understand. i again act like the others, playing a part in the Â“criticismÂ” community. I am shamed, because if me who is in the church still donÂ’t understand, how can I expect others who are looking from outside into our church say anything good.  I respect other peopleÂ’s comments, I also knew that further arguing will only make things worst. I was there, at the same place, having the same attitude, pointing the same finger and judging like I was at the throne as well. But have I see with my physical naked eyes as to how she had gone through all those criticism and yet still stand up for what she believe. Do u think itÂ’s easy and do u think itÂ’s really about money?<br><br>First, let me say something about todayÂ’s society. The influence that singers or pop band groups like Linkin Park, Christina, 50cents, blue, evanescence etc  have on todayÂ’s youth?? Do you also know that the devil lucifier is an expert in music? TodayÂ’s youngsters is the generation of tomorrow, we have to count on them. Or rather sooner or later if we as this generation follower of Christ donÂ’t get stronger, it will be overtaken tomorrow. If the devil is so powerful in this area, what can we do? We will not lose. This is the vision and dream that Pastor Sun and City Harvest is sharing. We have to use music.. or rather pop songs, even fast tracks. Maybe you donÂ’t know, we have testimonials from other countries or other religions sharing how Pastor SunÂ’s songs touched their heart and slowly they start to view Christianity from different perspective. Amazingly, it open up doors and soften peopleÂ’s harden hearts. If you wanna look and commentÂ… look from this perspective, not on person. We are here to touch peopleÂ’s life and preach the gospel, sharing the good news. And it takes blessed person to tell another person what is Christianity. I hope you understand what this means.<br><br>I agree that when I saw her acting or talking, I get all goosepimples, but that is not the point. I must understand in detailed where she is heading and why is she doing it for? As humans do you think we will be so thick-skined even when facing so many criticisms? I doubt so, I say it takes a lot of courage to do it.. a lot.. a lotÂ… but she keep believing what she is doing, is it wrong? Only time will tell, God will tell. I believe in God, who is just and faithful, He will never shortchange us.<br><br>I am proud of my conscious self tat I know who am I following and what I am doing. I have no clue of the future but I trust in Him. I really donÂ’t know at the end of this long Â“essayÂ”, what your comments areÂ… u might scold me or maybe said that I have wrote well, I am willing to take risk. At the end of the day, I know we are only accountable to God. I am just placing my faith on this forum so that you guys may change at least the perspective of City Harvest Church. If  not, itÂ’s okÂ… I have said what I wish to express all these while.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thank you SoliDeoGloriaGal for sharing your view <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>it's certainly good to hear your side of the story.. it's true that the Christian walk is never easy.. what Jesus went through was not easy.. and we are told to walk His path.. but that itself is a delight, because it's no an path that was not troddened..<br><br>and as kopi pointed out, our focus is God and will always be.. we'll certainly be beaten down from all sides.. we will be distracted from time to time.. but we should never lose sight of God.. in whatever things or circumstance we go through, as true Christians, we should always ask how it can bring glory to God <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.........well, here we goes again............i was born in a heavily christ influence family(my mum is a preacher, dad's a pastor), and yes, i myself believe that the only person(lets just use person) who could bring my butt thru pearls gate is Jesus Christ, but i use to think that all music that have drums in it is evil(sad ah?) and that linkin park is satanic. well, i was a joke in church, as i follow strictly to my guilds and only listen to christian music. well, i soon notice(the soon is 3 years) that what the world need is not guys like me that is so anti-world, yes, we got to drop to their standards(cautionly) to see things from their eyes, so i hope all of us would seriously stop this condemation of normal non-christian music(well, if we are talking about marlyn marison, ok, condem him, he is to be condem).<br><br>and on to city harvest. ok, this church is no doubt one of the churches i admires, and also one of the churchs which have methods that can cause my parents and their colleges to twitch.<br><br>having a worship leader were something that is so, errm, revealing is no doubt a no with me, although i must say this is a good way to approch non-believers. but advertising her albums in times considered to be part of worship is seriously commercialise. and that you guys actually kinda make non-believers a little uneasy with your charismatic manners(this part is from my friend, who went there once.). as in bursting into speaking touges, this makes people feel out of place and uneasy, and that you guys did't explain thithing and giving clearly, till my friend have an impression that you guys are forcing people to give.<br><br>all this are just my one cent, hope no one take offence. peace and God bless.</div>
