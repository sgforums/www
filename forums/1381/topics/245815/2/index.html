However, this number includes those working in fields not related to life origins (such as computer scientists, mechanical engineers, etc.). Taking into account only those working in the relevant fields of earth and life sciences, there are about 480,000 scientists, but only about 700 believe in "creation-science" or consider it a valid theory (Robinson 1995). This means that less than <strong>0.15 percent of relevant scientists believe in creationism</strong>. And that is just in the United States, which has more creationists than any other industrialized country. In other countries, the number of relevant scientists who accept creationism drops to less than one tenth of 1 percent.</span><br><br><a href="http://books.nap.edu/html/creationism/" rel="nofollow">http://books.nap.edu/html/creationism/</a><br><br>From the national academy of science<br><br><a href="http://www.natcenscied.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.natcenscied.org/</a><br><br>The National Center for Science Education (NCSE) defends the teaching of evolution in public schools.<br><br><a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution/</a><br><br>The world's largest general scientific society<br><br>U claim most scientist reject evolution.
