            <div class='col-md body'>hi cooleo <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>glad to answer these questions to the best of my abilities..<br><br><strong>1) Why do people believe in God even though they have not seen him? After all seeing is believing.</strong>I believe in Him because He has made a difference in my life.  There are moments in my life where I saw he evidently making my life work.<br>Some use the bible as evidence of His existence, some use history, some use the creation around us. But I believe because I see in walking with me.<br><br><strong>2) There is no mention of who created God or where he came from. So who created God?</strong><br>God is the creator, an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent being.  He is the beginning and He existed since beginning of time. Noone created Him, because if He is created, then the one who created Him would be more powerful than Him.<br><br><strong>3) Why do Christians think it is alright to ask other people to convert from their religions to Christianity?</strong>No one has the right to make you believe in things you do not believe in.  Some do it out of good intention, but sometimes they do it wrongly to the point of putting people off.<br><br><strong>4) If a person converts to Christianity, he/she will go to heaven? Hm...doesn't that encourage many people to convert at the very last min?</strong>It may sound that it's a good choice isn't it? To play as hard as you can, then when the time comes.. just accept Him.  But who knows when God is coming back to judge? When the time comes, it may all be too late.<br>Also, if one lives a certain lifestyle without God.. sometimes we enjoy the 'freedom' too much to want to give up.. it's like an addiction.. though a heroin addict may know that quitting the vice is good for him, but he still lives a life of being bonded by it.<br><br><strong>5) Why did Jesus show his face freely in the past as mentioned in the bible, but not now?</strong><br>Jesus came in flesh for a reason.  To be human and show us how to live. And primarily He came to carry out the plan of salvation.  But when He died, and ressurected and went back to heaven, He did not leave us alone.  The door is now open and He gave us the Holy Spirit to be an active partner in our lives.<br>I'm not sure why, but even if one day someone appears in flesh and declares he is Jesus.  Who would believe him? They'll instantly declare him a nut.<br><br>Hope it helps.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I can't understand even from the bible. Maybe I am not mature enough. Pastors always say to believe by faith, but they don't know it's difficult sometimes. I guess he allowed 911 to show that the world is ending soon and to wake people from their stupor. He is not showing up as frequently I think bcos we are a faithless and perverted generation. There are many more godly people in ancient times. Cooleo, you have to seek Him to find Him. He just doesn't appear like this although He can. I think He is listening to all the prayers bcos things on earth really change when we pray. Sometimes disabilities in babies are caused by neglect from the parents when they are in their wombs. The mother doesn't eat well or eats something wrong or there is a genetic defect or disease the mother got or whatever. We can't blame God totally for this. Adam sinned initially, so I guess this sin was propagated down and caused the birth defects you mentioned. We are living in a sinful world with satan destroying everything and everyone whenever he can but God is still in control. We need to pray for God's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. We need to know we are forgiven of our sins and death and disease have no hold on us. We need Jesus Christ. He is our answer! Ask Him yourself these questions and I believe He will tell you one day.<br><br>God loves you dearly like a precious son or daughter. He loves everyone very much. It breaks His heart whenever a deformed baby is born. It's not supposed to be this way originally. Cooleo, we will know the full answer when we get to heaven one day.</div>
