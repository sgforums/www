Man has tried that with women. In the past (and even now), most societies were male-dominated, and when differences between male and female arise, females are expected to defer to the males. But it has not worked, because there was never any meeting of differences, only hiding of the differences that arise. In the future, the opposite will be tried, but it is still the same result.<br><br>When there is no meeting, there cannot be any understanding. When there is no understanding, whatever is unconforming will be avoided, whatever is unacceptable will be denounced. Then there will be even less meeting, and the vicious cycle starts again.<br></div>

I do not know the context and reason of that word in the question and since it is untaught in the bible, I can only guess. The ingredients that conveyed such a feeling could be many, for instance, zealousness mingled with urgency could send a wrong message with resemblance.<br><br>What if we remove that word, so why do christians preach, proclaim or deliver? <span style="font-style: italic;">Principally</span>, to carry out what is known as The Great Commission, last words of Christ to His disciples as recorded in the gospel of matthew. Here in The Message translation, verse 19 &amp; 20, "Go out and train everyone you meet, far and near, in this way of life, marking them by baptism in the threefold name: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Then instruct them in the practice of all I have commanded you. I'll be with you as you do this, day after day after day, right up to the end of the age." And I might add, they care and are burdened to tell because with that step, they share the crux of their faith, a message they believe is important enough to consider which is but respectfully left to the audience.<br><br>Then to try answer the 'over others' part, core of it are teachings (which purportedly taint alternatives yet actually the notion is that it is complete on its' own) resident in the Bible and individual experiences.<br><br>Do pardon any inaccuracies, it's time to crawl back to work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi lawrence.. it falls back on the teachings... In buddhism you can attain a state of nirvana on your own. and there is a buddha in everyone of us. The net statement i make might be a bit contrevesial so bear with me.. Buddha taught a way of life not religion and he taught how to bring out the inner buddha in every person. btw.. pls correct me if i said anything wrong.. because i took buddhist studies when i did my psychology degree. so wad i just said might be the western perspective and pls dun take offnse if i got it wrong.<br><br>anyhow for Christians.. it was taught that man had only 1 chance to be saved. n that chance ocurs during our life time.. if u miss this.. then u must be prepared to face judgement. thats why there is such a great urgency in evangelisation. in our beliefs it is only thru Christ that we r made righteous and our sins r cleansed.<br><br>therefore being a Christian, if u confess and repent on ur wrong doings u r cleared from ur sins.. it will be erased and you r made righteous once again.<br><br>Y some evangelist say that non-believers r sinful??<br><br>ok.. because humans at 1 time or another sin. thus, if u dun have Jesus in ur life and u dun confess.. how do such sins get erased? it doesn't.. thats y they make such statements.<br><br>for myself i dun like to make such strong statements.. i prefer to just share my experiencees with others.<br><br>hope no offene is taken for my reply<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think too much on it unless you want to convert!<br><br>I know there are questions that need to be answered but some questons tends to answer themselves over time. Just be patience!<br><br>And lastly there is no right or wrong!!! It all boils down to what you believe in and whether you regrets it or not.<br><br>Some may ask why no right or wrong??? Just like magnet, you got the "N" &amp; the "S" ,right? If you believe in "N", then "S" will disappear. What will happen to the balance then. I don't think mother earth will function well if one of the poles is missing. Same goes for the other pole. Balance is the key.<br><br>Trust in your own faith and what you think is right for yourself. Never regret whatever decisions you make cause it will make you miserable for a period of time.<br><br>Just 3 cents worth!!! No more or less!!!<br><br></div>

Making no such statement doesn't hide the fact that humans without Jesus are beyond redemption, no amount of good works and no sacrifice other than the blood of Christ can save them.<br><br>Feel like quoting what pastor like to say during service, "Do you know how wretched you are, before knowing Christ?"</div>
