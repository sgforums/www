            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cooleo:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi i am a free thinker and i have a few questions that i wish to ask all Christians. These questions are not meant to be offensive, but are asked because i am puzzled by them.<br><br>1) Why do people believe in God even though they have not seen him? After all seeing is believing.<br><br>2) There is no mention of who created God or where he came from. So who created God?<br><br>3) Why do Christians think it is alright to ask other people to convert from their religions to Christianity?<br><br>4) If a person converts to Christianity, he/she will go to heaven? Hm...doesn't that encourage many people to convert at the very last min?<br><br>5) Why did Jesus show his face freely in the past as mentioned in the bible, but not now?<br><br></div></blockquote>1) Seeing isn't believing. you see the work of His hands, miracles, healing, and even ressurections. but u dun believe the source. the isrealites also saw God's power, but they still rebelled and sinned against God.<br><br>you may see your lover, but you also sometimes take her/him for granted tio bo?<br><br>thats what it takes faith, not blind faith. faith backed up with facts.<br><br>2) We can only partially comprehend the notion of God's existence.  To do so, we must use human concepts to speak of God:  "without beginning or end"; "eternal"; "infinite", etc.   The Bible says that He has always existed:  " . . . even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God" (Psalm 90:2).  And, "Your throne is established from of old; Thou art from everlasting" (Psalm 93:2).  Quite simply, God has no beginning and no end.  So, where did God come from?  He didn't.  He always was.<br>To us, the notion of time is linear.  One second follows the next, one minute is after another.  We get older, not younger and we cannot repeat the minutes that have passed us by.  We have all seen the time lines on charts:   early time is on the left and later time is on the right.  We see nations, people's lives, and plans mapped out on straight lines from left to right.  We see a beginning and an end.  But God is "beyond the chart."  He has no beginning or end.  He simply has always been.<br>Also, physics has shown that time is a property that is the result of the existence of matter.  Time exists when matter exists.  Time has even been called the fourth dimension.  But God is not matter.  In fact, God created matter.  He created the universe.  So, time began when God created the universe.  Before that, God was simply existing and time had no meaning (except conceptually), no relation to Him.  Therefore, to ask where God came from is to ask a question that cannot really be applied to God in the first place.  Because time has no meaning with God in relation to who He is, eternity is also not something that can be absolutely related to God.  God is even beyond eternity.<br>Eternity is a term that we finite creatures use to express the concept of something that has no end -- and/or no beginning.  Since God has no beginning or end, He has no beginning.  This is because He is outside of time.<br><br>3) i don't know and i don't care abt other ppl. for me, i share what i believe to be good. its like i stumbled upon a cave of gold, and there is enough gold for everyone. and i really do want to share it out. i can't be bothered to share with a person who has no respect for what i say, its just a waste of time. if you refuse, its ok with me. but i share, is because i care. and i know whats going on. the end is coming, and the there are many signs. one of which is plague. just look at the past 10 years. and look and the new desease just suddenly sprung up. its all predicted by Jesus 2000 years ago. its still your choice. but truth is truth. unless u can tell me why i shouldn't believe in the truth?<br><br>4) heh. how many ppl just suddenly die like that, a snap of a finger, just suddenly keena run down by a bus, or heart attack. there is no such thing as last minute. for all u know.. u might die tonight. who can tell when they will die, and be prepared to receive? God is not a brainless twit. He cannot be taken advantaged of.<br><br>5) You sure want to see Jesus? let me ask u something. how prepared are you to see Jesus? cause if you see Him, it might be too late for you. even myself i dun dare to say i want to see Him.<br></div>

Is seeing really believing?  Certainly not.  Most of the time, when we see something, we assume something and then we believe it.  Its like when we see Guy A lying on the ground with a stab wound and Guy B with a knife in his hand beside Guy A, we assume that Guy B stabbed him.  The saying that "Seeing is believing" is a sweeping statement. It should never be used in ALL situations, shouldnt it?<br><br>Would really seeing Jesus make you believe? I do not think so.  Just like in Luke 16<br><br>"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' " 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' "He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' "<br><br>Even if Jesus were to appear right before everyone, would everyone believe immediately? There would still be people who doubt and question. Isnt it the same now?  And its not just non christians who doubted, even believers during Jesus was on earth DOUBTED when HE appeared. Luke 24 highlights an instance where 2 of his disciples could not recognise Him in verses 13-18.  Then later in verses 38 onwards,<br><br>"While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have." When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?" They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence."<br><br>Is SEEING REALLY BELIEVING? The bible told us NO. [color=red]</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">2.  When we use the world God, most dictionaries would give the meaning as "creator of universe".  To explain that God is uncreated, it is not easy. But in short, if GOD is the creator of the 'UNIVERSE' which in broad, matter and space, we have to believe that God created time because even EINSTEIN in his general relativity links time to matter and space.  A God who created space, time and matter are not restricted by them. How then can He be created?  I would find it incredible if anyone chooses to believe otherwise, but well its personal.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">3.  Why isnt it alright?  Firstly I would have to clarify that it is the commands of GOD in the bible for us to bring His word to the ends of the earth. However, I think you may have meant that when christians FORCED it down people's throats without regards to their feelings.  This I have nothing to say and I admit that this is a major fault that christians have.  But then, who is perfect? Not even christians.  We must also be clear about the fact that just because some christians are no good, it does not mean the GOD or JESUS is no good.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">4. Jesus only appeared for around 33 years on earth. Can we say that He showed His face 'freely' ? 33 years is hardly FREELY considering how many thousands years the earth and us existed.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hihi... i'm not a pastor nor a super duper stero typed kind of believer. but i just want to share just my personal thoughts, hope it helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>1) Why do people believe in God even though they have not seen him? After all seeing is believing.<br><br>there are many things in life that are not seen but people believe in them. example: air. i don't see air but i know there is air becos i experience the movement of my lungs, the breeze that passes me and the fact that if my lungs stop moving, i turn purple.<br><br>i've personally experienced many things in my life that i credit it to God cos there is absolutely no other way to explain them. they are not earth shattering experiences but just little stuff that happens that reminds me that my God is there. a little too long to share everything here if u wanna know u can PM me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>2) There is no mention of who created God or where he came from. So who created God?<br><br>my answer is the same as sillyme's. no one created God, he has always been around.<br><br>3) Why do Christians think it is alright to ask other people to convert from their religions to Christianity?<br><br>personally, i have done wat some call "street-witnessing" which means going up to strangers and talking to them about God and also trying to talk to loved ones about my God. the reason why i did that was not becos i want to force pple to accept a religion but becos i believe i want to share with others something that has been good in my life.<br><br>it is as simple as this: i have a wonderful cheesecake that i absolutely love and i want to share it with those around me, especially those i love. not becos i want to force them to eat cheesecake, but becos i hope they will also experience the yumminess of the cheesecake. if they don't like cheesecake, then i will not force it upon them and respect their decision, but if they do like cheesecake, then i'm happy that they are also happy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>4) If a person converts to Christianity, he/she will go to heaven? Hm...doesn't that encourage many people to convert at the very last min?<br><br>erhmz.. wat is defined as convert to christianity? seriously i got no idea lah...<br><br>for me all i know is i believe Chirst die on the cross for me, he rose from the dead, he is the only God.<br><br>well, last min or first min, to me it does not really matter when, it is does he or does he not. of cos if someone believes in chirst and lives a life according to God's will, his life would be very different (and i know it would be different in a good way, too long to explain here). but if someone decides to only believe in Christ only at his very last breathe, then i would rejoice too.<br><br>back to cheesecake, if my loved one decides only at his deathbed he wants to try the cheesecake that i love, i would gladly offer it to him. if he likes it and is happy, i am still happy for him loh. the only difference is that he could have had enjoyed many cheesecakes if only he tried it earlier.<br><br>5) Why did Jesus show his face freely in the past as mentioned in the bible, but not now?<br><br>my answer same as sillyme's <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Yes, so if Mother Theresa REALLY did not believe in Jesus as SAvior and Lord, yes she is going to hell.<br><br>I think it would be unfair to ask so many 'WHAT IF'. WHAT IF she has had heard but refused to believe? WHAT IF she had heard but she did not understand? WHAT IF? I believe, you of all people, should know that, 'WHAT IFs' are never gonna be answered adequately, because I can ask a 'WHAT IF' to practically EVERYTHING in this world.  And in this case, Mother Theresa is a Catholic, she has more than enough access to the scriptures and bible.<br><br>Ignorance is not innocence. Try telling the judge that you did not know that you are committing a crime. They would not judge you not guilty just because you DID NOT KNOW there is such a law.  And again when people asked me what if these people never heard of Christ? I would asked, how do you know?</div>
