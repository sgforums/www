            <div class='col-md body'>I would consider myself a free thinker.. so maybe just to offer some things that i do think about when it comes to religion.<br><br>1. In general, i believe religion and the belief in a supreme being offers a certain psychological comfort. To know that when all else fails, there is this higher being that we can pray to. Besides this, it also serves as a moral beacon for humanity. But as much as it is so, it is often abused and the minds of believers are twisted by "preachers of their faith".. and so we have extremist factions in Islam and even Christianity. Much of the world's conflicts have religion as one of the agenda.. whether it is a hidden one or whether it is a declared one..<br><br>2. I would feel that at the end of it, I won't discredit religion as I cannot thnk of a world without it, when a few groups of lost souls become a few biliion lost individuals. Maybe lost is not a right word.. But hmmm.. I could be lost too.. Still i believe ultimately, we live for our own conscience and we answer to ourselves, personally i will do good but not for lusting for the eternal reward but just so that i feel better as a person. I don't answer to God.. only to myself and those I love..</div>

Of cos we sin, most of the times everyday.  But the difference between a disciple and a mere christian is one who takes up his cross daily and live the life God wants us to live.  We are not condemned but as I said, if you know you sin and as a christian, sees no need to repent, then all I can say, God is a fair and holy God, He will stand no sin.</div>

If Man was not created, there will be no sin. And if he did manage to foresee that Man will sin, it goes to show that he probably created Mankind for amusement sake rite?<br><br>Q2) How come we do not have the choice of whether we wish to be created? Isn't God's creation of Man against free will? Isn't it ironic that we can choose what to eat, what to be, what to believe in, but we do not have the choice to choose whether we wish to be brought into this world?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well this two question actually share a common answer.<br><br>God created us so that He can love us, so that we can be part of His creation (He gave Man the authority over His creation).  Would He have created us if He knew we would sin?  Don't be mistaken, He knew it for sure.  But ask any parents whose child has gone into prison or done something wrong if they regret giving birth to them.  I would dare say they'd say no.<br><br>But if He did not create us just because we'd sin, then where would free will be?  In the first place, how would free will be given to something that is not created?  You can't give vaccuum free will.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a believer of Christ here so i'll try to answer your questions as best that i can alrite? Hope u get the answers u want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>Q1) Why did God have to create Man? If Man was not created, there will be no sin. And if he did manage to foresee that Man will sin, it goes to show that he probably created Mankind for amusement sake rite?</strong><br><br>God did not have to create man, but He did so bcos He loves us and He wants to give us the gift of life. He knew us even before we were born, meaning He knows that we are all going to sin, and besides, He knows that man has a sinful nature. The Bible says that God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.<br><br>If man were not created then the people that He loves would not have been created and He would be very sad, because He knew us already before we were even born, so therefore we were born so that He could love us. Amusement sake? I don't think its amusing to God to watch His creation sin against Him, but still he gives us life because He loves us so so much.<br><br><strong>Q2) How come we do not have the choice of whether we wish to be created? Isn't God's creation of Man against free will? Isn't it ironic that we can choose what to eat, what to be, what to believe in, but we do not have the choice to choose whether we wish to be brought into this world?</strong><br><br>Same reason why a baby cannot choose to be born or not. But whatever God does, He has a reason for it. Take our lives for example, He has a divine plan for each and every one of us. It says in the Bible (Jeremiah 29:11) that God knows the plans He has for us, plans to prosper us and not to harm us, plans to give us hope and a future. The reason we were born like i said in the above answer is because God loves us so much, that's why He gave us the gift of life. And with this life that He gave us, He gave us the choice on how we want to live it, eg. the food we eat, the clothes we wear.<br><br>And here's one thing that i would like to add, i hope you won't be offended by it in any way.<br><br>The penalty of sin is death. Man is sinful by nature. There is no hope for man because of that. But God gave us Jesus who is without sin or a sinful nature to die in our place, so that we may not die. The only obligation is to believe in Jesus and walk daily with Him as He is alive today (He resurrected from the dead on Easter Sunday).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Question:</strong> Why did God allow 911 to happen? Why didn't He perform a miracle to stop it?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> (1 Corinthians 10:23) "Everything is permissible - But not everything is beneficial."<br><br>Therefore, if man has the choice to do such attrocity, he is able to do it, but it is not beneficial. Its just like why didn't God stop me from knocking into a lamppost in my own absent-mindedness? So that through this, i can learn to be more careful. For it says in James chapter 1 that through trials that happen in our lives, it tests our faith and develops our perseverence, so that we may mature and not lack wisdom. We learn from everything that happens to us.<br><br>However, upon saying this, it is promised in the Bible that God will not let us go through something we can't handle. Exact words of that verse are "No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it." 1 Corinthians 10:13</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by cooleo:<br><strong>Hi i am a free thinker and i have a few questions that i wish to ask all Christians. These questions are not meant to be offensive, but are asked because i am puzzled by them.<br>1) Why do people believe in God even though they have not seen him? After all seeing is believing.</strong><br><br>Seeing is not believing, you go to watch a movie with special effects, the special effects are spectacular, but is seeing really believing? Believing is not seeing either, you can believe that tomorrow is the end of the world, but you may not see it either. For those not prepared to take a blind leap of faith, a scientific approach should be taken to test assumptions made. (Read carefully, I do not mean Science, I mean the scientific approach)<br><br><strong>2) There is no mention of who created God or where he came from. So who created God?</strong><br>The problem with a Creator is who created the Creater, and then who created the Creater who created the Creater, and so on.  It goes into an infinite loop that never ends.  You can say that there is a Creator but how do you know he is the original Creator?<br><br><strong>3) Why do Christians think it is alright to ask other people to convert from their religions to Christianity?</strong><br>If one has understood what is meant by conversion, then one will see that it is totally unnecessary. Jews do not convert, when a Jew is born, he is a Jew, if he falls out with his religion and converts to Christianity, then he is a Jew who became a Christian.  Whatever he converts to, he is foremost a Jew because God was there first. Christians keep saying to do GodÂ’s will, but what is GodÂ’s will?  To reject what God has planned and to do your own will can hardly be called to do GodÂ’s will, isnÂ’t it? And that is what conversion is all about.<br><br>So for a Taoist who had converted to Christianity, if he were to claim that he is doing GodÂ’s will, then he should say he is a Taoist who became a Christian, if he were to say he is not a Taoist, then he should also say he is not a Christian, because Â“TaoistÂ” and Â“ChristianÂ” to him is just a phase, who knows he may again become a Buddhist in the future, because God decides that it is apt for him.<br><br><strong>4) If a person converts to Christianity, he/she will go to heaven? Hm...doesn't that encourage many people to convert at the very last min?</strong><br>Where is Heaven? This is the oldest trick in the world, promise you a future. Politicians often use it. Â“Vote for me! The best is yet to comeÂ”. And the thing is, the future never arrives, because when it finally comes, it comes as the present; there is always some other future. Non-converting religions say be content in the present, and if you are contented in the present, heaven is meaningless. You think of food because you are hungry, if you are already full, what is the meaning of more food? Hilter targeted the Jews, Oda Nobanga set himself himself against Zen monks, and Mao Zedong burned Taoist temples. All these people wanted to shape the world for their own aims, and to do that, they must make people miserable. If all are contented, what is there to revolt? If you are really contented, heaven can be on Earth; so what need is there for Heaven?<br><br><strong>5) Why did Jesus show his face freely in the past as mentioned in the bible, but not now?</strong><br>You see the form but do not see the formless, for the sake of those who seeks the formless, the formless takes a form.<br></blockquote></div>

Christianity can be in Tao, Taoism can be in Tao. However, Taoism is not so big, it is very small in fact. Tao cannot be in Taoism, Tao cannot be in Christianity.

            <div class='col-md body'>Question!<br><br>I am a Buddhist, and believe in the teachings of Buddha, I have seen people being preached to accept Christ into their life. Some evangelists went so far as to call non believers sinful. <strong>Why does Christianity evolve to the stage where many, although not all, Christians began to preach the superiority of teachings of Christ over others very strongly?</strong><br><br>I mean, there are many evangelists in other beliefs. But Christians have already made large impact on others with their beliefs. Just pick up this month Reader Digests and one can see the thoughts of the evangelists in Brazil, on the tribes in the jungles. There are many numerous examples like this since time immemorable, till topic like this one will come up, and people use Christianity as a punching bag.<br><br></div>
