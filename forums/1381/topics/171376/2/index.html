Unless we look into the profile of any given forumites, we will not know the background. It is fortunate (dumb?) that this mod had given some info in his profile.<br><br>Say, in another similar situation, but no info, an outside reading into this thread will have the distinct impression of an egocentric bigot using the name of Christianity to serve his goals. What kind of impression will it display?<br><br>To add to this: will "turning the other cheek" work? or ignoring him? I like to look at it from the angle that I (some of us) are giving him the "baptism of fire". I like to gauge him by the response he will take. Apparently some forumites already had communicated with this individual through PMs, the response from this individual is not very encouraging from the standpoint of Christian maturity.<br><br>Have I been harsher on Christians than non-Christians? The obvious answer is YES.<br><br>I do not want to give the impression that Christians protect Christians (especially when the latter is wrong). This is the same principle I have in everything I do. I am also teaching my son in my SS class - the expectation I have for him is much, much higher than I have on the other children. When they play with my friends' kids my expectation for my boys are higher than I have the other kids. In my world, I have no room for rude children. A girl in my class decided to be rude to me one day - I gave her a dressing down in front of the other kids, chased her out of the class, wrote a note to her parents.<br>She eventually apologised and we got on fine after that.<br><br>So Huaqing is still learning? How? His last post: 29 Dec 10:35 pm<br><blockquote><strong><br>...<br>lots of dots...<br>read ur Bible lor...<br>u ppl are crazy...i have already mentioned many many times before and u ppl still post crap...nvm go ahead post wadever u like....<br>this thread is ignored.</strong></blockquote>This is learning? He has yet to answer my queries, but I am not hopeful....<br><br>Yes YCF is a new forum - I left it alone when it came up. I do not want it to go the way of Apocalyptic Prophecies. I cannot leave it alone when the mod decides to go the ego trip and make declarations amounting to - I have power, I am the moderator.<br><br>Still... if you wish to close this thread, please do so.<br><br>Yes Vince, you are right, my calculation's off... should be 14 yrs old.<br></div>

I didn't know you were Catholic...<br><br>Babyys, sorry to hear that, hope that you future experience with Catholics will be more pleasant.<br><br>I'm a Catholic, have been for many years and have experience many negative response from non catholic. The worst of it comes from ignorant christians of course. They tend to get overzealous and start their whole "worshippers of Mary" thing with me.<br><br>Glad to hear that many christian denominations have greater understanding of Catholism now (or maybe my friends became more matured).<br><br>Anyway, just in case elements like huaqing still haven't gotten the message, Catholics ARE really christians...</div>
