Snake, Scorpion, Black color or Weird Images become a representation of something that is Satanic/Evil.<br><br>Well in my perspective, irregardless what Cross you wear, you must have Faith. Without Faith is meaningless to wear any Cross, Cross work only by Faith. Wearing a Cross doesn't mean you are Christian if you are not in your heart.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ is telling us here that our entrance into the family of God is based upon the work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross, because Jesus Christ is both the object of our faith (that is, the one in whom we believe; that is why we are "selected ... for the obedience in the blood of Jesus Christ": so that we might believe in Him) and also the purchaser of our salvation (that is, the one who made it possible for us to be saved; that is why we are "selected ... for the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ": so that when we do believe in Him, we are redeemed from the bondage of sin). The words "for obedience", therefore, refer to our faith in Jesus Christ and His work on the Cross in our behalf, while the words "for sprinkling" refer to our redemption, the "washing away" of our sin when we accept Him as our Savior.</span><br><br>Be open minded as Cross of Christ must never be ignored or minimized in its centrality to God's saving work. Only by the Cross can man be reconciled and brought in the family of God.<br><br>If you are worried whether some "Fashionable" cross can be something that is Satanic/Evil then you should just hang on to the conventional, traditional, simple cross. In this 21st century, wearing Cross are quite widely accepted as a Fashion Statement rather than just a Religious Symbol.

I hope you are not being dogmatic &amp; narrow-minded now? Assumption is roots of all evil. It is by universal misunderstanding that all agree. For if, by ill luck, people understood each other, they would never agree. Sarcasm is the language of the devil, for which reason I have long since as good as renounced it, Perhaps having an open mind is inadequate to having an open heart.

Precisely, A Cross or whatever is useless without Faith. Do not be a preaching Christian if you are not a Christian in your heart &amp; action. Disillusion comes only to the illusioned. One cannot be disillusioned of what one never put faith in.
