            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">The story of Santa Marta and the Dragon<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Sgforums/SantaMarta01.jpg"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The small town of Nerluc, situated in France near the Rhone River, was pestered by a creature of great evil. The forests surrounding the town had become a death trap for any who entered. Woodcutters never returned from a day of chopping, friends and relatives who went in search of those missing also were never seen. The people of the town, unsure of the source of these disappearances began to worry.<br><br>One day, travellers from another town trudged through the woods, on the road to Nerluc. They came to a darkened part of the forest, near the river. The air was gloomy, the thick tree leaves formed a canopy, blocking out all sunlight. A high, rocky cliff rose on one side of the road. Without warning a huge, terrible form blocked their path. They saw glowing eyes, a huge mouth filled with large, sharp teeth, and a great, scaly body-a dragon!<br><br>The dragon made short work of the travellers, all except one, who escaped, and stumbled into Nerluc, frightened and weary. He told of the fate of the others in his group, and the people despaired.<br><br>A town meeting was held, and it was forbidden for anyone to enter the forest, for any reason. Word was sent to other towns discouraging travel through the woods. They hoped that, starved out, the dragon would leave.<br><br>A week passed, half starved the dragon appeared in the town one night. It smashed down the walls of a house, devouring its inhabitants, then vanished back into the forest.<br><br>The next morning the town held another meeting, fearing the dragon would return again that night. They tacked up notices, asking for volunteers to slay the dragon. Sixteen men agreed. Armed with axes, swords, and spears they went into the forest. They found the dragon asleep, and bravely attacked. But their weapons broke on the hard scales of the beast. The creature awoke, enraged, and devoured eight of the men.<br><br>Again the town council met, this time desperate. It was decided that word would be sent to the holy lady, Martha, in the town of Saint Marie de la Mer.<br><br>Martha, upon hearing of the town's plight, agreed to help. She knew of the dragon, for he had caused much trouble in the Holy Land. His name was Tarasque. And so Martha sailed with the messenger to Nerluc.<br><br>The townspeople were overjoyed to see her. But soon became mortified while the Mayor spoke with her.<br><br>Martha had no plan to conquer the beast, she simply planned to walk into the forest and look for it. She refused to take any men with her for protection, prefering to go alone, as soon as possible.<br><br>The townspeople followed her to the edge of the forest, and watched her vanish into the trees, feeling sure they would never see her again. She took nothing with her but a small bottle of holy water and her prayer book.<br><br>Martha knew she was in perile, and peered from side to side, hoping to catch the beast unawares. The forest was sunny, birds singing in the trees. Feeling sure birds would not stay close to Tarasque she walked farther. Slowly the forest grew gloomier and quiet. Peering under a bush she found human bones, with huge teeth marks on them, and knew she was close.<br><br>She saw a huge scaly body ahead, and stole carefully towards it on tiptoes. When she was close enough to touch the beast she unstopped the small bottle of holy water.<br><br>The beast turned and looked straight at her. Its eyes glared at her, and its terrible mouth opened wide. Martha uttered a quick prayer and flung the contents of the bottle at Tarasque.<br><br>For a moment time stood still, nothing happened. The beast froze, then closed its mouth and lowered its head, in a mock bow.<br><br>Martha sighed in relief. The creature had been made tame and helpless by the holy water. She ordered it to follow her, and led it back to the town, back to the crowd of amazed townspeople.<br><br>Though the beast was tame, it was decided that it must be killed as punishment for its wickedness. No weapons could harm it, but it could be killed by a strong man hitting it over the head with a club.<br><br>The Tarasque was killed, and years later the town of Nerluc was renamed Tarascon so no one would forget the story of Martha and the Dragon.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>I would like to share the Story above about "Santa Marta and the Dragon".

Seeing a Gryphon is a sign of powerful new beginnings. I believe your Gryphon-dragon is also known as " Griffin-Demons ", with head of a Falcon &amp; snake tail. Henry the Lion, Duke of Brunswick, brought from the Palestine a Griffin's claw which is now said to be in the Brunswick Cathedral.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
