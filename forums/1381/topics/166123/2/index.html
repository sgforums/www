Their number, origin, and actual time of arrival are not given. The term "Magi" originates from Iran, suggesting that the wise men may have come from Persia or Media. Others believe the men came from Babylon or southern Arabia. The men were most likely scholars and not kings as has become a popular idea.<br><br>What we know about their time of arrival is that it was sometime between when He was born and the time He was two years old (Mat 2:7, 16).<br></div>

Coz if there were indeed wise men from India who came to pay homage to worship Jesus when he was a child, then it would contradict the claims of some New-Agers who said that Jesus went to India to study under some guru. It was the 'gurus' who actually bow and worship Jesus, not the other way round.</div>
