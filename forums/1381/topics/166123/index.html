Asia in the Bible, I believe wasnt refering to Asia as a continent, rather it was refering to Asia Minor modern day Turkey I think. Secondly, have you read Heavenly Man by Brother Yun? The point you stated in 4b MIGHT be happening. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No proof lah, only deduction:<br><br>1. Who is wise?<br>2  Who come from east?<br><br>In AD 1, the only wise people in the east were Chinese and Indians-the others followed either India or China.<br><br>The Wise men can't be Indians because the Jews can recognise them, and the Bible would have recorded that wise men from India came to see baby Jesus. Note the book of Esther Chp1 verse 1- mentioned India......this means Indians were not strangers.....<br><br>But Chinese-wah-lau never seen these Eastern chaps.......donno how to call them......never heard of Han Empire.......OK Lah,  call them Wise Men from the East...........so.........like that lor ! Deduction...............unless you think Funan or Champa or some hill tribe produced wise men  2,000 years ago</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Long before jesus was born, the Han Chinese has already begun trading with the Romans<br><br>'The Roman historian Florus describes the visit of numerous envoys, included Seres (Chinese), to the first Roman Emperor Augustus, who reigned between 27 BC and 14 AD:<br><br>"Even the rest of the nations of the world which were not subject to the imperial sway were sensible of its grandeur, and looked with reverence to the Roman people, the great conqueror of nations. Thus even Scythians and Sarmatians sent envoys to seek the friendship of Rome. Nay, the Seres came likewise, and the Indians who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years. In truth it needed but to look at their complexion to see that they were people of another world than ours." ("Cathey and the way thither", Henry Yule).
