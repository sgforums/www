Read again. I said religion don't sell, or at least orthodox religion don't sell. Only conspiracy theories like Da Vinci Code sells. </blockquote>COm'on, the previous reply u r using lord of the rings etc and u r comparing with "pop culture" without a word on whether does religion sell. U think religion don't sell, then why does Hill songs get to sell so much record, da vinci code get so much attention and even the cds from HYS get to sell so fast.<br><br><blockquote>Also .. you conveniently forgot one thing - the documentary is in chinese. Use your brain. Can a chinese documentary with no conspiracy no famous actor and actresses and director sell? </blockquote>U forgot one thing. There r a lot of chinese who r christians in canada, china, singapore, malaysia, hong kong and taiwan. In fact they made up a big market out there. On comparing with chinese films with leading actresses etc r again another weak comparison. U heard of fahrenheit 911 ?<br><br><blockquote>All secret meh? Cannot be lah. I said the public do not have readily access, unless the govt grants permission.<br><br>The mountain the film says the people cannot access readily. At least this was true when the film was made. </blockquote>However they do not go to wat u described as great depth where the army camp cannot be filmed even with the guidance of its own people. In fact it was label as a national park now really shows tat there is really little or perhaps nothing about military secrets on the mountians. Otherwise why make it become a national park almost after a few weeks ? In tis sense u r still wrong. Whether the people can access it easily it already become a matter of, well, one sided story.<br><br><blockquote>When they tried to apply for permission, the evidence wasn't found yet (obviously right?). Now they have some evidence. The govt knows they are not there to dig out military secrets. So the place is open? wahahha </blockquote>Why do u think tat the opening up of mount ararat has anything tyo do with the documentary ? IMO I think they don't even know anything about the documentary at all. It is now a national park. If there r so many secret bases there then u wouldn't expect them to change their stand completely and allowing any tom dick and harry over.

So whatever I said was correct 'cos the govt haven't opened up during the expedition. </blockquote>Lets put it tis way. If the gov wanna open it as a national park, we expect the preparation for such a launch to take perhaps months before it finalized. The claims tat they were stopped from bringing more people because of closely guarded military secrets do not hold much water especially now perhaps anyone with money can go over for a holiday or to find their "ark".<br><br><blockquote>Muslims and Jews are not interested in evangelism. At most those evidence affirm their own faith only. </blockquote>And they loved to have a chance to affirm their own faith. As said if it is there the muslim people and gov there would have done a conclusive search to affirm their faith<br><br><blockquote>Well .. since u so sure can u just throw me some muslim and jewish websites that support your argument?

At least it won't sell better than Lord of the Rings and pop culture. Hill songs sell so much record .. maybe a lot of xtians buy them? But not surprising since they have a large fan base and charismatic churches like to use their songs for worship. Da Vinci Code gets so much attention 'cos of the conspiracy theories inside, not religion. CDs from HYS sell 'cos pple support her and like her song?

Soon, the mission itself was put on ice .. McGivern may have been more interested in generating publicity than mounting a serious search, critics now suggest. By making an early announcement, he may have tried to persuade the Turkish government into granting him a permit. <strong>Few expeditions have actually obtained clearance to climb Mount Ararat, which is located in a military zone</strong>.<br><br><blockquote>And they loved to have a chance to affirm their own faith. As said if it is there the muslim people and gov there would have done a conclusive search to affirm their faith </blockquote>Dunno .. were Muslims ever interested in Noah's Ark? Christians seem to be interested in everything - holy grail, ark of the covenant, noah's ark etc. Muslims bah .. I dunno. Dunno lah .. maybe they did send their secret team to search for Noah's Ark .. who knows?<br><br><blockquote>For judaism, well they do speak tat non-believers get a chance to go to heaven.</blockquote>Islam is a funny religion. Your Malay frens know we non Muslims are all going to hell (Quran quite explicit on this?) yet they stand by do nothing. Never even preach their gospel to us. Na bei .. they are worse than xtians .. I'm not ashamed to say that.</div>
