            <div class='col-md body'>China's secret pyramids - <a href="http://www.atlantisrising.com/issue11/ar11chinapyr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlantisrising.com/issue11/ar11chinapyr.html</a><br><br><blockquote>In investigating what the Chinese authorities will reveal about the pyramids, Hausdorf was told the story of an emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, who lived between 259 and 210 B.C. Prior to his reign, bitter feuding between rival states for dominance over a splintered China went on from 475 to 221 B.C. It was Emperor Huangdi who ended the fighting. <strong>And thanks to the commentaries of historian Sima Qian, who lived from 145 to 86 B.C., we know the existence and location of the emperor's grave, beneath a hill 150 feet tall, planted with grass and trees. The hill, apparently, is man-made. According to Sima, beneath this hill is a 140-foot-tall pyramid with five terraces.</strong> The historian's chronicles state that almost 700,000 workers worked on this tomb. The earth was removed down to ground water level. This floor was then poured with molten bronze. On this platform a stone sarcophagus was laid. When the structure was completed, those who knew where the entrance was were silenced; they were entombed alive. To further disguise it, the pyramid was carefully covered with earth and grass to give the impression of a natural hill.<br><br>The pyramid's interior was quite elaborate. Sima wrote of an artificial universe painted with stars impressed upon the ceiling of the chamber in which the emperor lies. There was an entire landscape with rivers made out of mercury, somehow held in constant motion. The tomb is well protected against grave robbers, utilizing quite an ingenious security system. Crossbows with mechanical triggers make up an automatic shooting gallery, with a hail of arrows targeting intruders. For a long time, these historical commentaries were considered as mere legends. But new excavations around the outer perimeter of this hill seemed to confirm Sima's chronicles, an analysis of the earth from the immediate area of the great pyramid revealed an exceptionally high concentration of mercury. It would seem the archeologists are taking the stories seriously, as they are reticent to work around this ancient emperor's high-security tomb. We are leaving this tomb under the hill to the future, so the next generation has something to work on, says one of the leading archeologists.</blockquote></div>

Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism all started out as some kind of philosophy. We can listen to those faiths - why not?

They assume tat science is wrong without giving any evidences why they think of it tis way. They can even come out and claim tat light does not travel at the same speed when it was never observed to be changing. If they claim tat light changes speed, prove it then the arguments made sense. Otheriwse if any claims can be made without justifications, then stories like snow white etc can be made believable as well.<br><br><blockquote>I would guess that God did all these because He loves His creations. And according to His pure justice, character, will, and plan, these things required to happen. Yes, He could simply destroy everything BUT the bible tells us, "For God so love the world....." </blockquote>God had already decided to destroy the world in a great flood. If he had already decided to destroy the world, might as well erase them in an easier fashion by flicking his figners and made them dissappeared etc. Is tis justice, character and plan ? Sound like really no planning...<br><br><blockquote>"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. "(Isaiah 55:9)<br><br>The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law. (Deuteronomy 29:29) </blockquote>From these statement, it can be deduced tat u never really understand god, and it might as well be either hoax, devil in disguise or maybe even an alien. It really is an excuse tat conveniently forget all the things they cannot explain.<br><br><blockquote>The Parable of the Weeds<br>24Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. 26When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.<br><br>27"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'<br><br>28" 'An enemy did this,' he replied.<br>"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'<br><br>29" 'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. 30Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.' " </blockquote>If god is omnipotent, he coul have easily remove the weeds without uprooting the wheat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>It has indeed been found! The exact location has been found. I watched the documentary film already. They have photos as proof. Actually they want to go down the ark which is buried under snow, but because the ark is filled with water, and the ark or the "cave" that leads inside the ark is too wide and perhaps deep, it will be too dangerous to enter. They said that they would have to wait for the water to dry off before they can enter the ark to take photographs. </blockquote>There have been some number of expedition to mount ararat and it was found not to be there. Up till now it is still simply a claim without any verification. In the past there have been many incredible claims before and it all end up to be over optimistic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Lets put it tis way... scientifically noah ark should be totally eroded to nothingness after so many years. tat is probably why many people think tat noah ark is a wild goose chase over a ship tat either never exists or even if it do, shouldn't be around after so long<br><br><blockquote>the actual expedition which claimed to find the ark .. no historians or archaeologists on the team. not that they dun want ..

Tis had been done in the past before u know<br><br><blockquote>If Noah's ark is proven to be true, then we can prove the truthfulness of the bible.</blockquote>It do help in making the bible more credible, but it is never proven. So conversely if noah ark is proven to be false, does it make the bible the biggest lie in mankind ?<br><br><blockquote>The world says that it is not found and you believe? Didn't the world say that the earth was square in the past?! </blockquote>Christians say tat the earth is square in the past for the longest of time because the bible suggest the world is flat...<br><br><blockquote>To prove their finds, they have to revisit the site again with an international team of experts. But this is almost impossible, given the government reluctance for more activities on their "secret military base" and the foul weather</blockquote>Why don't ask Turkey to form a team to search the ark themselves ? They r a muslim country and muslim also believe in Noah ark themselves. If it is so credible, believe me turkey will have already sent a huge team over and be the one tat made tis discovery first<br><br><blockquote>I think many non-believers have the wrong expectation of Christianity.

Finding spiritual development ? Wat if it is wrong and they should be believers of Islam instead ? One need to be convinced it is real before believing in it isn't it ?</div>

I think xtians too much morals liao. Cannot do this cannot do that. Cannot even abort the baby, cannot even waste sperms. Cannot gamble and rather let other countries overtake us.
