I think xtians too much morals liao. Cannot do this cannot do that. Cannot even abort the baby, cannot even waste sperms. Cannot gamble and rather let other countries overtake us.

Your head! I bet Titanic or Lord of the Rings sells better. Heh. Pop culture sells better. Well, at least having Mel Gibson as Director sells better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Well, at least Passion of Christ with all the promotion sells better than Gospel of John .. lol<br><br><blockquote>I do see movies made in singapore jails and visit in the army bases of singapore from documentary and shows</blockquote>Chin chye lah .. army bases no big deal .. the public can access SAFTI, BMTC, the air force and navy open house and even some of the camps (like clementi camp for 2PDF Open House). But the mountain supposedly their own people also cannot access. The guide secretly climbed the mountain - that was why he could discover the Ark.<br><br><blockquote>As said before, if there r really evidences tat Noah ark is found, I bet tat even the mullah/ pope or the president of turkey himself will visit the place. <strong>It can even earn money from increases tourism as well </strong></blockquote>As mentioned in the film, the govt tried to stop people from climbing the mountain. They even blacklisted people. The ang moh team that wanted to climb the mountain got refused too.<br><br>From secret mountain base to tourist site - you stupid or what? Can't believe this came from someone who is stupid and yet smart. Ok, maybe you are just plain dumb.<br><br>Use your brain use your brain .. if ark is found more pple will convert to Christianity .. maybe the whole of Turkey will convert since they can go there and verify easily .. then gradually whole world will convert .. you think the mullah wants that? The pope is so old .. you want him to climb mountain .. have a heart do you?!<br><br>The pope need not visit the mountain. For what? He already believe the ark exists. The Catholics has many miracle sites .. like the spring at Lourdes. He rather go there right? Better than freeze in the cold on the mountain.<br><br><blockquote>Com'on lah ! be truthful here.
