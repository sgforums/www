What makes you think they have not shown?? Religious leaders? You mean christian leaders? The chinese evangelists are told not to take any stuffs from the ark and so they can only take photographs and videos.<br><br>They have their strategy in evangelising. Perhaps you would like to write him an e-mail to ask him why he choose to do it this way. He must have his reasons. Surely he have think of all alternatives.<br><br>But, I would think that through public broadcasting, the masses can be reached more effectively. Moreover, it required funds to distribute free CDs to the world. And so what if they show it to the religious leaders? There are rules and regulations to evangelising to the world. Do you think all people would flock to churches to watch the film or listen to the semon on the ark? Look at the response of the show? How many people have known about it or very interested to find out more? So few in Singapore compared to Hong Kong. So showing it in public cinemas, I would think it is the best way to tell the world.</div>

I think the film was a combinations of all sources (which occur in the past. They must have sourced for all these and make a collections for proofs.) from the past to the present and the joined everything together.</div>

So isn't it a pot calling a kettle black? The concept of Gods exist in many many beliefs from the ancient world, from various civilisations (different civilisations have different Gods), so do not think that the concept of God was man-made? If there's only one single God, why would they only communicate with the Israelis?<br><br>Sigh... Didn't mean to challenge your religious belief, just hope that you can be sensitive of others' beliefs too. Indians believe in Karma, and Israelis believe in God. A claim that Buddhism is a copy-cat is a hint that Christianity is not original too. [b]</blockquote>No. Christianity is just an extension of the old testament. Christianity does not borrow the concept from Judasim. Judasim has its basis from the old testment too.<br><br>Oh dear... speechless.. Too many questions to answer. Maybe anyone can answer it.

Christianity is also about how we should lead our daily life .... Oh dear, your reasonings are ...
