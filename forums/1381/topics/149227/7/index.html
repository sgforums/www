Then we must examine what's the documentary for? Just to concreate current Christian's faith with the religion? If this is the case, then it still won't help to spread God's words to the non-believers isn't it?

This is a Christian forum... we are not anti other faiths... we speak from what we know is right and true, if you bring up another "faith" or religions view points in EH, I think that the believers here have a right to defend that... but at the same time like I have stressed so many times... I think you need to chill a bit here because our view point will never change. You don't expect to go to a muslim or buddhist forum and have them preach something they don't believe in right? So why come here an antagonise yourself all the time? </div></blockquote>Since when have i spoke from other faiths point of view?<br><br>I am speaking from a person who do not wish to see members of any faith at all meddling with any scriptures, interpreting it in their own way as to lead its members to consequences they do not want to see, or choose to ignore possible negative effects of taking hardline stance in their faith.<br><br>I agree with what Chicks says in an article, altho now that article link is now unclickable, but the gist is that the Singapore's Religious Harmony Act is tantamount to limiting Christians ability to evangelise. In a way, it act against Chirstianity.<br><br>Guess which side i would have chosen as a Singapore citizen.<br><br>Stop acting as the injured party and using defend as your defence, pardon the pun. You are defending acts that will be slanderous and injurious to other faiths. I think u just admit this point. because christianity is totally intolerant of any other faiths. that is the point u have to defend, and that is the point i have to act against.<br><br>Never be exasperated.

It's not easy. Although guided treks up Mount Ararat were allowed during the 1970s, after several grim incidents the government forbade them because of very real danger from smugglers and other outlaws, Kurdish terrorists, severe weather and wild beasts.</span><br><br><blockquote>From secret mountain base to tourist site - you stupid or what?

There it rises from the valley elevation of about 760 meters above sea level. In that area the Araxes River is the border demarcation between Turkey and Russia. The top of the mountain is only about 30 kilometers from the border. For some years both the Turkish and the Soviet governments have been touchy about foreigners exploring on Ararat because of military security precautions. Therefore it was difficult to get permission to climb it for sports fans. <strong>On 1st of November 2004 Ararat Mountain and surroundings were declared as the 35th National Park of Turkey by the Government so it's believed that it will attract more visitors and help to the local economy as well</strong>. So far there are no ski resorts on the mountain but you never know, maybe one day... The nearest one is on Bubi Mountain which is open from December till April. </span><br><br><a href="http://www.allaboutturkey.com/millipark.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutturkey.com/millipark.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lately in 2004, with the addition of <strong>Ararat mountain</strong> in Agri and AllahÃ¼ekber mountains in Kars, today there are 35 National Parks all around Turkey,</span><br><br><a href="http://www.adiyamanli.org/agri.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adiyamanli.org/agri.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rising up to a height of 5165 m, Mount Agri is the main peak of Turkey and the symbol of the city. This snowcapped volcano is the famous biblical Mount Ararat, the legendary site of the second beginning of the world. It is  believed that Noah's ark came to rest in the mountains of eastern Turkey, and the wide plain of Igdir at the foot of the mountain is the first place where Noah set foot after the disaster. <strong>A geological hollow near Uzungil village has the shape allegedly of the ark, and it is a place often visited by tourists, being also a beautiful resting spot. Mount Ararat, besides offering magnificent scenery, also provides opportunities for hunting, skiing and mountaineering</strong>. Climbing is also possible once you get the necessary permission from the authorities.</span><br><br><blockquote>Use your brain use your brain .. if ark is found more pple will convert to Christianity .. maybe the whole of Turkey will convert since they can go there and verify easily .. then gradually whole world will convert .. you think the mullah wants that?
