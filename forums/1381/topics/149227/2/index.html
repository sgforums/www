            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>you are going to start our discussion about evolution and mutation again</blockquote>But u r the one tat start talking about changes of animals after a period of time. Isn't tat already evolution ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  If u believe in evolution, then it states tat animals changes very very gradually, over millions of years to be wat we see today. Tis is really unlike the changes describe in your explanation tat these major changes occur in a mere 5000 years<br><br><blockquote>you must note that the ark didnt require a broiler room, engine room, fuselage, etc.<br><br>even if it's just a medium size ship, technically it still can hold all the animals in there.</blockquote>Even so, it is again as stated tat the whole species of beetles already need an ark 10 times the size described. It can't hold all the animals in there. Tis is especially true since it says tat some species need 7 animals instead of 2 and also for it to float it need a lot of empty space.<br><br><blockquote>Noah's Ark isnt really an ordinary Ark. Perhaps God Bless it and made it float real good.</blockquote>There is really nothing tat says tat god make the ship real good tat it defy physics principles  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I mean if u totally disregard physics principles and actual scenario, u might as well just make ultra incredible claims such as food dropping from the sky, animals suddenly shrink to become germs size, or better still send the ark to holiday in wonderland before sending back to earth after the rain. I mean u can just become totally irrational and come out with anything your imagination can fetch. If u wanna say tat way, then u r really giving circular arguments  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If u say tat way, then why don't god make things simple with his infinite powers by just erasing the creatures he do not want instead of trying so many stunts such as asking someone to build an ark, making the animals go to tat ark, finding such a big amount of water, raining for so long, making the ship float when it should sink etc<br><br><blockquote>Also, although it rained for 40 days. the flood subsided only after 150 days. </blockquote>Doesn't tat make the story more unbelievable...<br><br><blockquote>if half of the animals in there hibernate like what polar bears and other animals do today, there may just be enough food. Possible eh?</blockquote>Lets face it. Most animals don't hibernate.<br><br>Anyway u also bring about an interesting question on how does a creature tat need a cold climate such as polar bear survive with creatures tat live in hot climate stay together in a ship. Animals do die if u put them in the wrong environment and climate</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I quoted an interesting article written by atheist or freethinker.<br><br><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1993/2/2noah93.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1993/2/2noah93.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Yes, if we concede the existence of an omniscient, omnipotent deity who personally engineered every phase of the flood, then presumably that would make anything possible. If we are going to do that, however, we will have to give this deity another characteristic. In addition to being omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, omnibeneficent, etc., etc., etc., we will also have to make him omnisilly. He could have just said the word or waved his hand or whatever omnipotent deities do to perform miracles, and thus caused all human life on earth to die except for Noah's family, and if he had also wanted to include dumb animals in his carnage, he could have spoken and caused all animal life, except replenishment stock, to die too. Instead, he chose to have a man build a boat that had to be miraculously stocked with animal life and then miraculously sustained through a miraculous flood of thousands of inches of miraculously produced rain supplemented by miraculously emptied "fountains of the deep."<br><br>If one wants to believe that, then the story makes perfectly good sense. If, however, anyone puts any premium at all on common sense, he will have to consider the story a myth from prescientific times</span><br><br>In short, the story defies all common sense  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I watched the documentary film already. They have photos as proof. Actually they want to go down the ark which is buried under snow, but because the ark is filled with water, and the ark or the "cave" that leads inside the ark is too wide and perhaps deep, it will be too dangerous to enter.
