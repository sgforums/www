              <p>I found some interesting moral on glory of God towards his beloved creatures of his creation that ought to be loved through vegetarianism - <em>by Rondi Elliott</em>.</p>
              <p>The Old Testament is very specific when it comes to what "God said" that we should eat. In the first chapter of the Bible, Genesis I, there is a clear mandate in 1:29: "Behold, I have given you every tree with seed in its fruit; this you shall have for food." This was God's intent in the Garden of Eden, but, humans being imperfect, things changed.</p>
              <p>"for the shedding of lifeblood, I will surely require a reckoning" (Genesis 9:2-5). What seems to be the point is that if we unnecessarily kill an animal, we will be accountable to our Creator. Of course, we now know that eating flesh is by no means necessary for human health; in fact, there is much evidence that it is, in fact, unhealthy to stray from a plant-based diet!</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>From The Gospel of the Holy Twelve, trans. by G.J. Ouseley:</strong></p>
              <em>
              <p>"The fruit of the trees and the seeds and of the herbs alone do I partake, and these are changed by the spirit into my flesh and blood. Of these alone and their like shall ye eat who believe in me and are my disciples; for of these, in the spirit, come life and health and healing unto man."</p>
              <p>"Not by shedding innocent blood, but by living a righteous life shall ye find the peace of God .... Blessed are they who keep this law; for God is manifested in all creatures. All creatures live in God, and God is hid in them..."</p>
              </em></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this Gospel, God is called Abba-Amma, which means Father-Mother; Jesus is spoken of as Jesu-Maria. The Angel tells Mary: "Ye shall eat no flesh nor drink strong drink, for the child shall be consecrated unto God from his mother's womb, and neither flesh nor strong drink shall he take."The wise men who came from the East " had purified themselves and tasted not of flesh nor of strong drink that they might find the Christ whom they sought." As they followed the star "they forgot for a little their weary beasts who had borne the burden and the heat of the day, and were thirsty and fainting; and the star was hidden from their sight.</p>
              <p>He protects a lion that men mere pursuing with stones and javelins.</p>
              <p>': But Jesus rebuked them, saying 'Why hunt ye these creatures of God, which are more noble than you? By the cruelties of many generations, those were made the enemies of man which should have been his friends.</p>
              <p>" ' If the power of God is shown in them so also are shown his long suffering and compassion. Cease ye to persecute this creature who desireth not to harm you; see ye not how he fleeth from you, and is terrified by your violence ? ' "</p>
              <p>The food of John was the fruit of the locust tree and wild honey. And to all he spake, saying: " Keep yourselves from blood and things strangled, and from dead bodies of birds and beasts, and from all deeds of cruelty and from all that is gotten of wrong.</p>
              <p>The disciples mere forbidden to eat flesh food. "Eat that which is set before you, but of that which is gotten by taking life, touch not, for it is not lawful to you.</p>
              <p>Jesus bids us to be considerate of all creatures, and not of man alone. "Be ye therefore considerate, be tender, be pitiful, are to them as gods, to whom they look in their needs."</p>
              <p>Jesus states definitely that He came to end the blood sacrifices and feasts of blood; He also said: "I am come to end the sacrifices and feasts of blood; and if ye cease not offering and eating of flesh and blood, the math of God shall not cease from you; even as it came to your fathers in the wilderness, who lusted for flesh, and did sat to their content, and were filled with rottenness, and the plague consumed them.?</p>
              <p>Jesus straightly charged all who believe in him to eat only of the fruit of the tree and the herbs. "For of the fruit of the trees and the seeds of the herbs alone do I partake, and these are changed by the spirit into my flesh and blood. Of these alone and their like shall ye eat who believe in Me and are My disciples ; for of these, in the spirit, come life and health and healing unto man. ... ..</p>
              <p>"Verily I say unto you. in the beginning all creatures of God did find their sustenance in the herbs and the fruits of the earth alone, till the ignorance and selfishness of man turneth many of them to that which was contrary to their original use : but even these shall yet return to their natural food ; as it is written in the Prophets, and their words shall not fail." (Re-printed from "MIRA" Poona)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May God bless all, Amen</p>

              <p><span>Extracts from 'Guide for the Perplexed' as quoted in <em>The Extended Circle</em> by Jon Wynne-Tyson:</span></p>
              <p>It should not be believed that all beings exist for the sake of the existence of man. On the contrary, all the other beings too have been intended for their own sakes and not for the sake of anything else.</p>
              <p>[Regarding animals and their offspring], there is no difference between the pain of humans and the pain of other living beings, since the love and tenderness of the mother for the young are not produced by reasoning, but by feeling, and this faculty exists not only in humans but in most living beings.</p>
              <p><span>a note from a visitor to this site:<br></span>I believe Maimonides argued that the consumption of meat is necessary for health, ordained by G-d, and made acceptable by following the laws of shechita, or ritual slaughter. While Maimonides was definitely concerned about the unnecessary suffering of animals the notion that he generally advocated or practiced vegetarainism is probably incorrect.</p>

              <p>Every year on that PARTICULAR DAY, thousands of sheeps / goats are slaughtered to commemorate the sacrifice of sheep offered by God in the place of that bullshit prophet's son.</p>
              <p>It really makes me sad. Can't they commemorate this bullshit event by ENACTING with MOCK SHEEP. I don't think using MOCK SHEEP as substitute would in any way undermine the religious significance of the ritual.</p>
              <p>I don't buy the arguement that the mutton from this ritual are donated to the poor as a justification for the sacrifice. The mutton donation is just a SECONDARY "BY-PRODUCT" objective. There are many ways to feed the poor. Do you really need to kill thousands of sheep on that particular day to help the poor??????</p>
              <p>I can't accept the fact that animal lives must be sacrifice to satisfy one's religious ego.</p>
              <p>I advice buddhist leaders to refrain from participating in this annual event. Their attendance is seen as an endorsement of such animal sacrifice. Don't worry that buddhist will be seen as not supportive of inter-faith integration. Don't attend just one event does not mean anything.</p>

              <p>I'm find with animal killing for meat, because I eat meat myself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I think it's the way they kill the sheep that is not advisable. They slit the throat and let it bleed to death. This is not according to worldwide slaughtering standards which require stunning the animal into shock first before killing.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Al Shaddad Bin Aous has quoted this
              tradition of the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H.) "God calls for mercy in everything,
              so be merciful when you kill and when you slaughter, sharpen your blade
              to relieve its pain".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Many allegations have been made that
              Islamic slaughter is not humane to animals. However, Professor Schultz
              and his colleague Dr. Hazim of the Hanover University, Germany, proved
              through an experiment, using an electroencephalograph (EEG) and electrocardiogram
              (ECG) that *Islamic slaughter is THE humane method of slaughter* and captive
              bolt stunning, practiced by the Western method, causes severe pain to the
              animal. The results surprised many.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Experimental
              Details:</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">1. Several electrodes were surgically
              implanted at various points of the skull of all animals, touching the surface
              of thebrain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">2. The animals were allowed to recover
              for several weeks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">3. Some animals were slaughtered
              by making a swift, deep incision with a sharp knife on the neck cutting
              the jugular veins and carotid Arteries of both sides; as also the trachea
              and esophagusHalal Method.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">4. Some animals were stunned using
              a captive bolt pistol humane slaughter by the western method.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">5. During the experiment, EEG and
              ECG were recorded on all animals to record the condition of the brain and
              heart during the course of slaughter and stunning.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Results
              and Discussion:</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">I - Halal
              Method</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">1. The first three seconds from the
              time of Islamic slaughter as recorded on the EEG did not show any change
              from the graph before slaughter, thus indicating that the animal did not
              feel any pain during or immediately after the incision.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">2. For the following 3 seconds, the
              EEG recorded a condition of deep sleep - unconsciousness. This is due to
              a large quantity of blood gushing out from the body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">3. After the above mentioned 6 seconds,
              the EEG recorded zero level, showing no feeling of pain at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">4. As the brain message (EEG) dropped
              to zero level, the heart was still pounding and the body convulsing vigorously
              (a reflex action of the spinal cord) driving maximum blood from the body:
              resulting in hygienic meat for the consumer.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">II - Western
              method by C.B.P. Stunning</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">1. The animals were apparently unconscious
              soon after stunning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">2. EEG showed severe pain immediately
              after stunning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">3. The hearts of the animal stunned
              by C.B.P. stopped beating earlier as compared to those of the animals slaughtered
              according to the Halal method resulting in the retention of more blood
              inthe meat. This in turn is unhygienic for the consumer.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>@Tcmc - Allow me to ask you this question. Was stunning an alternative thousands of years ago or even a hundred years ago? Even with all the technology we have now, Islamic way of slaughtering is proven to be the most humane method of slaughtering an animal. This "halal" method was a direct commandment from God himself to our prophet and not some method our prophet decided to invent himself.</p></div>
