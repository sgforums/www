            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>It begins here.......<br>Recently there have been many signs in the heavens such as Comet Lee's rendezvous with earth's orbit, the sun starting to go into Solar max at about the same time, and a couple of rare planetary alignments. There is a Biblical concept that there are 7000 years of time; 6000 years of man's rule followed by 1000 years of Christ's rule on earth. Let's explore this hypothesis.<br><br>The Genesis account says creation took six days and on the seventh day God rested. The ancient Jewish prophets and scholars often equated this seventh day of rest to the Day of the Lord. It was believed that the ``Day of the Lord'', as well as the previous six days, would each last for one thousand years. They based this teaching on Psalm 90:4, which says: ''for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.'' This seventh day is commonly referred to as the ``Millennium'' or ``Messianic Kingdom''.<br><br>Genesis 1:1 says: ``In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.'' Genesis 1:2-2:1 describes the seven days of creation from the earth's perspective. Some scholars say Genesis 1:1 took place in the dateless past and then, at some future point in time God completed creation over six days, with the seventh day being a day of rest. Irrespective of this view, it is important to realize that the seven days of creation were seven literal 24-hour days.<br><br>However, it appears that the seven days of creation could also be prophetic, with each day (based on Psalm 90:4) representing a thousand years of human history.<br><br>We need to determine how many years of human history have passed since Adam's birth date. This can be done by carefully following the genealogy of Adam, considering the time the Jews spent in Egypt, the reigns of the kings of Judah, the Babylonian captivity, etc. Many scholars have done these calculations. Archbishop Usher in 1650 AD calculated back from the birth of Christ, based on the dates and chronological data given in the scriptures, and arrived at the date 4004 B.C for Adam's creation. Thus Christ was born approximately 4000 years after the birth of Adam (which would be the end of the forth "Day"). If we know Jesus' exact birth date, then going forward 2000 years will tell us when 6000 years will have passed and the ``Day of the Lord'' begins. Jesus should come again to redeem the earth, according to the law of redemption, after six days or 6000 years. Based on Bishop Usher's analysis, a simple calculation would mark the fall of 1997 as the end of 6,000 years. Having said that, we must recognize that calandar changes over the years has made an exact calculation impossible. In addition, there is an ancient Levitical book of Jubilees which indicates that Adam and Eve did not transgress God's law until seven years from the time of creation and one could conjecture that we need to count from the time of the fall which would indicate the fall 0f 2004 as a possible completion of man's<br>6,000 year rule over the earth (Prophecy Flash, Vol 15, No. 2).<br><br>Calandar differences aside, recent data from the field of astronomy gives us September 29, 2 BC as the birth date of Jesus (3). It is 2 BC based on today's calendars, because of the Gregorian Calendar reform and other calander adjustments that have occurred over the years. Also, note that there is only one year between 1 BC and 1 AD therefore, if this is correct, as the fall of 1999 may have started the 2000th year since Christ's birth and the 6000th year since Adam's creation. The 6,000 years would end on Rosh Ha'Shannah 2000. This daye could have marked the time of "Jacob's Trouble" leading up to the return of Jesus. If consider that Adam and Eve may not have sinned until seven years in the garden, then counting from there would mark 2007 as the end of man's 6000th year of reign of planet earth. Or it could be several years [some have calculated as late as 2012] later due to the calandar reforms and modifications that have taken place over the years). Biut the point is that we are getting close.<br><br>We know from the book of Daniel that Christ's return is preceded by a seven-year period commonly known as the Tribulation period. The Tribulation is broken into two parts, the first half of relative peace, followed by the worst three and one-half years in the history of mankind. Therefore, if Christ is returning to redeem the world by the year 2012 at the latest, we could be in or on the the verge of entering the Tribulation and our countdown to eternity is about to begin.<br><br>To better understand the requirements of redemption, we need to understand Jewish law. Under Jewish law, if you lost your property by forfeit (as Adam lost the title deed to the earth), it remained with the new owner for a period of six years. In the seventh year, you had the right to purchase your property back as long as you could fulfill the requirements that were written down on a scroll and then sealed. If you couldn't redeem your own property, then a relative or near-of- kin (called a ``Kinsman Redeemer'' or in Hebrew a ``Goel'') could step in and redeem it. In the seventh year, if no one were able to redeem the property, then it would remain with the<br>new owner permanently.<br><br>If you could redeem it, you would call for the elders of the city to meet with you before the city gates. You would bring out the scroll that had the requirements on it. You would break the first seal and show your ability to meet the requirements or pay the price recorded therein. You could purchase the property back for yourself in the seventh year, the year of redemption. Similarly, if you were sold into slavery, you would remain a slave for six years, but in the seventh year you would be set free. This was the Jewish law of redemption; being set free. (2)<br><br>Jesus came to redeem mankind and the world back to God after 4000 years. He paid the price of redemption on the cross; ``we are redeemed not with corruptible things such as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ''. Through His sacrifice Jesus bought the world, but He has yet to take possession of it. As we approach the end of the sixth millennium, the time of redemption is almost over. ``God has placed all things in subjection under Him, but we do not yet see all things in subjection to Him.''<br><br>Soon that will change, as that familiar scene in the fifth chapter of the Book of the Revelation takes place. Jesus was found worthy to take the scroll from the Father and open its seals, allowing the four horsemen of the Apocalypse to gallop forth bringing judgment upon the earth. As the seals are loosed, judgment begins, and we will have either been redeemed or face the judgment of the tribulation period based upon the choices we have made. Shall we receive from God the free gift of salvation available through Jesus Christ, or shall we choose to have nothing to do with spiritual things? Once we die, our eternal destiny is fixed. Jesus says ``I put before you life or death; choose life.''<br><br>Jesus wants to be our ``Kinsman Redeemer''. But this is only possible if we make Him our ``near-of-kin'' by being adopted into the family of God. God is spirit; therefore, to be adopted requires a spiritual rebirth. This is what Jesus was talking about when he told Nicodemus that he must be born again (born from above [John 3:3]). If we're not born into the family of God, Jesus can't redeem us. But if we'll just ask God to forgive our sins and ask Jesus to become Lord of our lives, then He will also become our Kinsman Redeemer. We will be spiritually regenerated (reborn) into God's family. God will seal us with the Holy Spirit, the guarantee of our redemption when Jesus comes again. (Eph 4:30).<br><br>So if you now recognize that man was sold into slavery through Adam's sin 6000 years ago, you must also recognize that the period of the right to redemption is almost up.<br>Many people have difficulty trying to reconcile the six days of creation with Science's calculation that the universe is 16 billion years old.<br><br>Jeffrey Schroeder, a world-class Jewish physicist has recently written a book, called "Genesis and the Big Bang", that helps reconcile these two views. In this book he documents, through application of Einstein's general theory of relativity, an incredible discovery. (4)<br><br>Einstein's theory tells us that time is not a constant, but varies with speed and mass. NASA has proven Einstein's work to be true -- the faster we travel, the slower time goes. Through the use of two atomic clocks, one on the earth and one on a satellite, they demonstrated that the clock on the satellite went slower. This is the theme we've seen dealt with on science fiction programs where a space traveler travels to a distant world at a significant fraction of the speed of light. When he returns, his brother is an old man, but the traveler has hardly aged at all.<br><br>Physicists have recently determined the mass of the universe and the speed at which it is expanding. Therefore it is now possible to apply Einstein's theory and determine how much time has passed from the perspective of the space traveler 16 billion light years away from earth.<br><br>Well, Schroeder did the calculations and, as incredible as it might sound, from the perspective of an imaginary space traveler on the expanding wave front of the universe, only six DAYS had passed on earth -- an incredible coincidence! The Jewish Rabbis have a quaint saying: "Coincidence is not a kosher word".<br><br>In other words, everything is by supernatural design. There were six days of creation and yet, based on Psalm 90:4, the six days also seem to represent 6000 years of human history. Creation took six days, but God, according to Isaiah 57:15, inhabits eternity and is therefore outside of our time domain. God is outside of time; thus He could have completed creation in zero days. This is documented in Psalm 33, which tells us that ``By the word of the Lord, the heavens were made........For He spoke and it was done''.<br>He spoke and it was done; no time was required. Yet the Bible records that God did, in fact, create the universe and everything that dwells in it in six 24-hour days. From Schroeder's work, it appears that this is literally true.<br><br>The Genesis account also records that on the seventh day God rested and instituted the Sabbath (meaning rest). Without a doubt, God was not tired. So why the chronology of the seven days of creation when God could have done it in a moment of time? Perhaps He was revealing to us His plan of redemption, which was to be carried out over 7000 years. ``I am God, and there is none like Me, Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure,.." (Isaiah 46:9b-10).<br><br>Let's look at the concept of 7,000 years of time a little closer.<br>The Rabbi's taught that there were 7,000 years of time. They divided time into a 6000-year segment followed be the 1,000-year Messianic kingdom. They based this on Psalm 90:4, which says that to God a thousand years, is as a day. What the Rabbi's taught was that as the week of creation was 7 days, that is seven 24- hour days, and each day stood for a thousand years with the seventh day as a day of rest -- the day of the messianic kingdom.<br>2 Peter 3:8 - Peter confirms that the "Day" of the Lord, the messianic kingdom of 1,000 years, which will come as a thief in the night.<br><br>Clearly, God has set apart the 7th day as the day of rest, the day of the Messianic kingdom. We see it has that definition in Hebrews chapter 4..."there is yet a seventh day of the Lord to come; a day of rest."<br><br>There are lots of meanings of the Sabbath; a rest of God in the literal weekly Sabbath day; in Jesus the Messiah who gives peace that surpasses all human understanding. We can all look forward to the day of rest, yet to come, which is a 1000 years long<br>There are several pictures or allusions of the 7000-year plan of God throughout the Scriptures. Let's look at a few of them:<br><br>Allusion 1:<br>Genesis account of creation:<br>First Day -<br>GEN 1:1-5 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<br><br>Forth Day-<br>Gen 1:14-19 "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.<br>Notice, that light was created on the first day, but the Sun and Moon (lights) were not created until the fourth day. This is a clue as light should have been a result of the creation of the Sun and Moon on the forth day.<br><br>"Seven" in the Bible, it is a number of completeness or spiritual perfection. It also represents a menorah. The servant candle in the center represents Messiah Jesus. Counting from left to right we find out that the servant candle is the forth from either end. As it turns out, after four days (4,000 years) we should see the Sun of<br>Righteousness arise with healing in His wings.<br><br>The Hebrew name for "Sun of Righteousness" is spelled the same as Shamash, the word for the servant candle (except for certain vowel pointings) which is a clue to Jesus being the servant candle. It is a clue to when the Messiah will appear with Healing in His Wings. To fully understand the concept of the menorah and Jesus as the servant candle, order the video "The Mystery of the Menorah", from J. R. Church's ministry "Prophecy in the News" -- you will nor be disappointed (http://www.prophecyinthenews.com) 1-800-475-1111.<br><br>MAL 4:1-2 "Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and that day that is coming will set them on fire," says the LORD Almighty. "Not a root or a branch will be left to them. But for you, who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall.<br>Menorah - Jesus is on the center light, the shamesh, the servant candle...it is the forth light of the 7 lights. After 4000 years, Messiah will appear. The Hebrew word for sun and servant candle is identical except for certain vowel pointings. Did Jesus appear after 4,000 years with healing in his wings? .<br><br>Allusion 2: (5)<br>In John 1 we have seven days described -- it is an allusion to the 7,000-year plan of God.<br>In John 1:19-28 - Priests sent messengers to ask John who he was and he quoted Isaiah Chapter 40...this is day one.<br>John 1:29- - day 2 behold the Lamb of God who takes away... John 1:35 - day 3 next day John "behold the Lamb of God" John 1:43 - day 4 we should see Jesus and in fact we find Jesus wanted to go to Galilee and he found Phillip and said follow me.<br>Now Galilee in Hebrew means a circle or circuit and circle in Hebrew is a synonym or idiom for heaven.<br><br>So in this account, we see Jesus came down to the earth after 4000 years, at the end of the forth day. He will then disappear for two days, or two thousand years, when He will appear again with the shout of the Archangel and the trump of God. But before Jesus left the earth He told his disciples to spread the Good news.<br><br>In our account in John chapter 1 we find Philip spreading the word that Messiah has come. Again, we don't see Jesus anymore in this account on the 5th or 6th day, until the 7th day (the 3rd day after the 4th day). It is the 7th day and then we see will the messianic kingdom; which starts with the coronation of Messiah followed by the wedding of Messiah. In the scriptural account, on the 3rd day we find there was in fact a wedding in Canaan and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were at the wedding. They ran out of wine, Jesus turned the water into the wine, etc.<br><br>This is a clear picture of the 7000 years plan of God to redeem mankind after 6 days.<br><br>Allusion 3:<br>Another allusion is found in 2 Chronicles 9: The temple of King Solomon is picture of the Messiah - in fact his name means peace; he is full of Wisdom. There has never been a kingdom like His kingdom, as people came from all over the world to see the majesty of his kingdom.<br><br>On his throne there were 6 steps (2 Chron. 9:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> with a footstool of Gold which were fastened to the throne with an armrest on either side of the seat with two lions stood before the armrest. To the left and right of the six steps were 12 lions. Nothing like this had ever been made for any other kingdom. The picture is six steps and then the throne itself just as we are climbing up a stairway of time to the kingship of the Messiah after 6 steps or 6,000 years.<br><br>Allusion 4: -<br>Matthew 16:28 Jesus said something in this account that seems like a contradiction, "some of you shall not see death until you see Jesus coming in His kingdom." As far as I know, they are all dead; and Jesus has not come in the fullness of His kingdom. Is this a contradiction?<br><br>Look at the next verse. After 6 days (6000 years), Jesus took Peter, James and John to His transfiguration. Jesus face shown as the sun and His clothes became as white as the light...Moses and Elijah were there. These are the two witnesses - part of the Jewish wedding - friends of the bridegroom.<br><br>Eschatologically speaking, Moses is seen as the friend of the bridegroom. The other friend is assigned to the bride whose responsibility to take care of the needs of the bride and to escort the bride to the wedding.<br><br>The "friend" assigned to the groom is seen as Elijah - his job is to stand at the door and when the wedding is consummated and they become one, the groom will cry out to Elijah and he will inform all those assembled that their is a marriage. In John 1:21, John says he is not Elijah, but in Luke 1:17, we find that John went forth in the Sprit of Elijah. Remember that John was of the spirit of Elijah.<br>In Matthew 111:14, Jesus tells us John is Elijah. God does not do reincarnation. So what is going on? John was not Elijah, God had carried Elijah away to heaven, but according to Luke 1, he was of the spirit or commissioning of Elijah.<br><br>John makes a statement in John 3:26, and following, that he is the friend of the bridegroom.<br><br>Go to Matt 17, Peter, James and John had seen Jesus in His Glory and heard the Father say, this is my Son and in him I am well pleased. They know he is the Messiah, but in verse 10 they ask for clarification about Elijah, who they had been taught will preceed the Messiah.<br><br>This is a Jewish expectation, waiting for Elijah the prophet to come.<br>Every Passover the children are sent to the door to see if Elijah is coming.<br><br>Jesus tells them in verse 11 - that Elijah WILL come and WILL restore all things (future tense), then Jesus tells them that Elijah did come already, but was not recognized...and the Disciples then understood Jesus was talking of John the Baptist. It is a requirement that Elijah preceed the appearance of the Messiah.<br>MAL 3:1 "See, I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come," says the LORD Almighty.<br><br>Mal 4:5-6 "See, I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the LORD comes. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers; or else I will come and strike the land with a curse."<br><br>There will be an Elijah who preceeds Jesus at His Second Coming.<br>In Rev 11:3 we see the 2 witnesses.<br><br>REV 11:3-6 "And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth." These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands that stand before the Lord of the earth. (This is a reference from Zach 4) If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. These men have power to shut up the sky so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want."<br><br>Historically, it was Elijah who called down fire from heaven (2 Kings chapter 1). It was Elijah when it did not rain for 3 1/2 years. (1 Kings 17-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Allusion 5:<br>Genesis 7:6 We are going to have a Judgement after 600 years. Noah was 600 years old when the flood of waters was on the earth. Isaac is 40 years old (4000) when He gets married, just as Jesus comes forth and pays for a bride (us) at 4000 years. Isaac is 60 years old when he has Jacob (Israel) just like Israel will be assume its God ordained place after 6000 years during the millenium.<br><br>Allusion 6:<br>Genesis 29: Children of Leah (seven children are prophecies of the 7000 year period). Leah was not loved. Asks God for a son.<br>1) Rueben - "Seed" or "Son". 2) Simeon - "Hearing" 3) Levy - "To be Joined" - prophetic, commissioning of the tribe of Levi -- to join to God the people of Israel.<br>With the 4th son, we should see an allusion to the appearance of Jesus the Messiah.<br>4) Judah was born- Judah means "Praise". Jesus was born at the end of the fourth day (after 4,000 years) into the tribe of Judah. He is the Lion of the tribe of Judah.<br>Now Leah's womb is closed, she has no more children. Just like Israel is put to the side, so to speak. Now there is this contest between Rebecca and Leah to have babies that they are buying time to spend with Jacob.<br>5) Ishacar - "My Hiring" Perhaps indicative of the Jews in Diaspora.<br>6) Zebulum - "Dwelling with" We will dwell with God at the end of 6000 years. Then at the sound of the last trump, so we will remain with God forever.<br>7) Girl - Dena - "Judge" We will sit in judgement during the Millenium - to rule and reign with Messiah.<br><br>Allusion 7:<br>Hosea 6:1-2 Come, and let us return to the LORD; for He has torn, but He will heal us; He has stricken, but He will bind us up. After two days (after 2000 years) He will revive us; on the third day (1000 years - the messianic kingdom) He will raise us up, that we may live in His sight.<br><br>Hosea tells us that after 2 days, or two thousand years, at the end of the sixth day - the beginning of the seventh day will be Messiah's coming and the beginning of the "Day of the Lord."<br><br>Allusion 8:<br>ESTER 5:1-2 "Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, across from the king's house, while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance of the house. So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, that she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter."<br><br>This is clearly a picture of the Bride of Christ, the glorious church, coming to Messiah the King on the third day, when He holds out the scepter (symbolic of His rule) and takes the bride unto Himself.<br>There many of these illusions throughout the Bible, however, the subset above should be sufficient to give you understanding that this is a valid concept and Jesus is in fact coming soon!<br>But for this to be a valid possibility, we do have to ask, did in fact Jesus appear after 4,000 years? If he did, then we can expect him again after 6,000 years.<br><br>YES! THE BIBLE CHRONOLOGY FROM ADAM TO CHRIST is 4000 YEARS. If you will go to Genesis chapter 5 you can determine this. Start with Adam and then add up the years when Adam had Seth (130 years), and then note hat Seth was 105 when he begat Enosh, etc down to Noah. Continue to add the age of each descendant of Adam when they had their first son. (130+105, etc.) Then when Noah comes off the ark we are given the genealogies of His children and we continue to add up the age of each father when he had his son and we can do this all the way to Abraham, Abraham was 100 when He had Isaac who was 60 when he had Jacob, Jacob was 135 when he came into the land of Egypt were they stayed a certain amount of years. We are told when they crossed the Jordan River to when King Solomon built the temple is 430 years. Then add up the reigns of the kings of Judah, for example Reaboim reigned for 42 years, etc. to the point where they spent 70 years in Babylonian captivity, etc. We will find it was 4000 years or 4 days.<br><br>It turns out that from Adam to Messiah is 4000 years or 4 days. The Jews were dispersed for 2000 years or 2 days. Therefore, Messiah's Second Coming is to be at end of 6th day and the beginning of 7th day.<br><br>Jesus' birthday, based on today's calendar, is generally accepted as 4 BC, However, there calculations utilize Josephus' recording of an eclipse and assume it to be the one on March 13, 4 BC which was just before Herod's death, but the eclipse of December 29, 1 BC may have been the one Josephus was speaking of since Herod, according to some writings, died on January 14, 1 BC.<br><br>Tertullian, born around 160 AD) stated that Augustus began to rule 41 years before the birth Jesus and died 15 years after that event. Since Augustus died on August 19, 14 A.D., we have Jesus' birth consistent with the 2 B.C. birth date hypothesis. Tertullian also notes that Jesus was born 28 years after the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC, which is also consistent with the 2 BC birth date.<br><br>Irenaeus, born about a century after Jesus, notes that the Lord was born in the 41st year of the reign of Augustus. Since Augustus began his reign in the autumn of 43 BC, this also appears to substantiate the birth of Jesus in 2 BC.<br><br>There are many other "proofs" of the September 29, 2 B.C. date. It should be noted that this date was Rosh Ha'shana in 1999. It is also interesting that if you back up 280 days from this date, the normal gestation period for a human being, that this means Jesus as conceived on December 25. For more information on the September 29, 2 BC birth date for Jesus see "Personal Update", August/September 1992 and "Prophecy in the News", December 1992 edition.<br><br>It is interesting that the Hebrew Calandar year that starts with the Feast of Trumpets in September, 1999 is the Hebrew year 5760 and not 6000. There are many conjectures as to why it is not 6000, but apparently God knew the Hebrew year would be 5760. Consider the following:<br><br>The Hebrew letters for the phrase "six days" in the Hebrew is comprised of the following Hebrew Letters: "Tav", "Shin", "Shin", "Mem", "Yod", "Mem", "Yod". (7) Each Hebrew Letter has a numeric equivalent similar to Roman Numerals. Multiplying the numeric equivalent of "six days" yields a multiple of 5760 (Specifically 400*300*300*40*10*40*10 or 5760000000000).<br><br>In addition, if you take the term "third day" as is found in Hosea 6:1-2 ("Come, and let us return to the LORD; for He has torn, but He will heal us; He has stricken, but He will bind us up. After two days (after 2000 years) He will revive us; on the third day (1000 years - the messianic kingdom, the 7th Milleniam) He will raise us up, that we may live in His sight.") you get the following Hebrew letters: "Heh", "Tav", "Lamed", "Tav", "Mem", "Vav", "Yod" Again, adding up the numeric equivalent of "third day" yields a multiple of 5760 (Specifically 5*400*30*400*40*6*10 or 5760000000000).<br>The point is that possibly on some Rosh Ha'shanna between 1999 and 2012 or shortly thereafter might be the completion of the 6,000 years of man and the start of the Millenium. This begs the question, where does the seven-year tribulation period in all of this.<br><br>If the Millenium is a 1,000 year reign of peace by Jesus physically upon the earth, how can the tribulation period be part of the Millenium. Some believe that the rapture will occur, and for the saints of God, the millenium begins in heaven while on the earth the seven-year tribulation rages. To me, this makes no sense as the Millenium is a 1,000 year reign of peace physically upon the earth. One other posibility is that the tribulation period is parenthetical. If the 70th week of Daniel was an interruption in time as layed out by Gabriel in Daniel 9:27, then perhaps the Tribulation (the 70th week of Daniel) resumes on Rosh Ha'shanna this September with the conclusion of the 6,000 years and then the 1,000 year Millenium begins. This is only conjecture, however, the point is there may be precious little time until the Tribulation period begins. Are you prepared to meet your God?<br><br>We are now in 2004. Will Messiah's return for His children this year or soon thereafter? We'll soon find out. It's just a matter of time.<br><br>HOW TO PREPARE FOR CHRIST'S RETURN<br><br>The Bible indicates that there will be two groups of people on the earth when Jesus suddenly returns. The first group consists of those individuals that have received Jesus Christ's free gift of Salvation. These are the Children of Light. They know the signs of His return and are anxiously awaiting Him (1 Thes 5:1-4). The other group will consist of those whose love for the Lord has grown cold and the Unbelievers who want nothing to do with Jesus' free gift of salvation.<br><br>This latter group is like the people who lived in Noah's time. In that day, the people were completely caught up with the affairs of everyday living and wanted nothing to do with spiritual things until the flood came. By then, it was too late. For this group, it will be ``as in the days of Noah"; judgement will suddenly come, and they will be totally surprised and unprepared (Matt 24:37-39).<br>We are living in the period of history that the Jewish rabbis call the ``Footsteps of the Messiah''. We can hear His approaching footsteps as the time of Jesus' return draws near. Soon we will rise to meet Jesus in the air or be left behind to face judgment, having hardened our hearts to the call of God.<br><br>Is Christ's returning really close? People, in their zeal and love for the Lord, often jump the gun when they see a specific prophecy fulfilled by trying to set dates for His return. However, there is something different going on at this time in history that has not occurred since the Messiah came 2000 years ago. Every major theme of biblical prophecy is coming together at the same time.<br>Jesus is coming soon. Those individuals who have not received Jesus into their life as Lord and Savior and those whose love for Him has grown cold (Rev 3:16) will face God's judgement.<br><br>"I will shake all nations, and the desired of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD Almighty." (Hag 2.7)<br><br>"Watch and pray, therefore, that you would be counted worthy to escape the judgment that is coming upon the earth and be able to stand before the Son of Man" (Luke 21:36).</blockquote>comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed a very long post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I have taken some time to read through it all and is indeed impressed by the way the writer presented his ideas and thoughts. As a matter of fact, I assume the person who wrote this study theology or read some books concerning eschatology. I do not know how to comment on this article nor to be able to give approval because of the followings :<br><br>1. No doubt numerals play an important role in the Bible. Many of the numbers stated in the Scriptures are not merely literal in meaning but at times do have other meanings behind them. for eg. 40 is the number of tribulations as seen in 40 days of Noah's Flood and 40 days in the wilderness experienced by Jesus. 7 being the divine number of perfection while 6 is the number of man. But to study the Bible and attempt to look out for a chronological trend and thereby 'predict' the year in which Christ will return is definitely not the intention of the Bible in its general context.<br><br>2. I have not studied the Bible in that manner before and indeed I'm impressed he link both Old and New Testament together. One referring to the other. As the majority of the article seems to look at biblical contents bearing in mind numbers, we cannot possible see every number revealed in the Bible as potential prophecies carriers. Some numbers are there for comparison purposes while some are to explain how large a quantity.<br><br>3. The article works in such a way it believed 7 days equal 7000 yrs and from some calculations seems like we are living in the '6000th' or sixth day era. I do not have the audacity to give credit to that assumption because I believe in the whole counsel of God's Word. Our God does not tell things by numbers and figures alone. We mujst also take into account other revelations which are equally important. The signs of end of age as spoken by Jesus Himself in Mark 13 as well as in the gospel according to Luke and Matthew concerning the signs of end times which are far more clearer and easier to understand as compared to 'maths' interpretations of scriptures.<br><br>4. The bottom-line is 'the day and hour unknown' as seen also in Mark 13. Jesus Himself warns "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.  Be on guard! Be alert ! You do not know when that time will come." (v32,33)<br>and that is one thing that we should not even venture into figuring out. My point is this..when someone is able to provide a date for the 'end of world'...i am certain that that date is wrong!<br><br>5. There is no mentioning of Revelation in the article. The things pertaining apocalypse is found in Revelation. The millenial rule of Christ on earth, the great tribulation and other details do give us a glimpse of what is to come. I need to emphasise that Revelation though no doubt is abt end times..is again not to be used as a chronological tool to see when exact will Christ return. The signs stated in Mark 13 and Revelation are merely 'signs' to tells us the time is coming. Not for us to study it, plot a chart and then calculate.<br><br>6. Biblical prophecies serves as warnings before the event takes place. They are there as God revealed to His prophets and so prepare His people for the events which follows. Noah was given almost a century to do that before the great flood covered the whole earth. Prophecies are not meant to condemn. So based on this mindset, to me numbers or not I am not concerned. Whether the 7 days do imply something more than that, whether or not the millenium rule of Christ here on earth is really 1000 yrs or 999 yrs is not important because when we study the Word of God as if trying to dig out some clues here and there to persue our so-called prophetic agenda...we have completely missed out the whole big picture -Jesus Christ Himself.<br><br>7. I would like to end with this remarks though. I do hold the Bible authoritative and divine inspired. However I am not in favour of people reading the Bible in the manner of 'Bible-Code' or likewise. Mere playing with alphabets and numbers and hopefully from that scramble of letters and numerals some 'prophecies' can be discovered. God made His Word into the format of a Book and not crossword puzzle, so read it like a book with understanding. The things we need to know, God has already provided plainly. Infact the gospel of salvation is very plain and the assurance of salvation that follows. When our faithh anchors it self onto Jesus Christ. The rest of the details are there to show fufilment and further signs so that the people of God are prepared. They are not meant to scare us to that extent we simply tremble in fear and do nothing else. If ther prophetic words concerning end of world should have any effects....the effects must not put people into a sense of hopelessness but rather point people towards the Redeemer of our souls.  So have you wonder how come i listed 7 points...does it have any implications that my comments are perfect? Surely not  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
