            <div class='col-md body'>3 And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 4 <strong>God saw that the light was good</strong>, and He separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morningÂ—the first day.<br><br>6 And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water." 7 So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. <strong>And it was so.</strong> 8 God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morningÂ—the second day.<br><br>9 And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so. 10 God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." <strong>And God saw that it was good</strong>.<br><br>11 Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. <strong>And God saw that it was good</strong>. 13 And there was evening, and there was morningÂ—the third day.<br><br>14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so. 16 God made two great lightsÂ—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. <strong>And God saw that it was good</strong>. 19 And there was evening, and there was morningÂ—the fourth day.<br><br>20 And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky." 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. <strong>And God saw that it was good.</strong> 22 God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth." 23 And there was evening, and there was morningÂ—the fifth day.<br><br>24 And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. <strong>And God saw that it was good</strong>.<br><br>31 God saw all that he had made, <strong>and it was very good</strong>.

Extrapolating, the alleviation of the bad things of hell could not affect earth? or something around that lines.</div></blockquote>This is the Jewish midrashic tradition. Did you ask for the source of what you were taught?<br><br><blockquote>'How is it,' asked an inquisitive matron of Rabbi JosÃ©, 'that your Scriptures crown every day of creation with the words: "And God saw that it was good," but the second day is deprived of this phrase?' The Rabbi sought to satisfy her by pointing out that at the end of the creation it is said: 'And God saw all that He had made, and it was exceedingly good,' so that the second day shares in this commendation. 'But,' insisted the matron, 'there is still an unequal division, since every day has an additional sixth part of the praise, whilst the second day has only the sixth part without the whole one, which the others have. for themselves.' The sage then mentioned the opinion of Rabbi Samuel, that the reason for the omission is to be found in the fact that the work begun on the second day was not finished before the following (the third) day; hence we find the expression 'it was good' twice on that day.--Gen. Rabba 4.<br><br>http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tmm/tmm07.htm</blockquote>The part about hell came from Jewish Tradition also, but I can't find it in the source, so no quotes on this.<br><br>Looks like the Catholic Church really has the Tradition passed down from Sinai!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

I don't want to get into another round of debate regarding the Genesis again. Let me first define mistakes as things that either never happened or was wrongly written.<br><br>1. Just take a look at the sequence of creation. Light before creation of stars.<br><br>2. A 30 cubic (137m) ark that carries a pair of all the animals in the world + 49 days of food - physical impossibility.<br><br>3. Stoning your children to death when they are disobedient - what the hell?<br><br>4. The tower of Babel - the fact we've reached the moon shows that either God overreacted to a miserable tower or that story is false.<br><br>All these are mythical tales or false morals that should have never be in the holy book in the first place.<br><br>I can go on and on... but I guess I'll stop here.<br><br>Edit: Oops. Number 3 is not in Genesis.</div>

I remember breytonhartge mentioning something about the Babylonian towers and how they also had a tale about their God punishing them for building a tower.<br><br>Could it be that the bible today had already incorporated things from other cultures and religions?</div>
