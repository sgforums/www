              <p>Like I've told an ex-christian before, maybe it lies in your own personal experience as well. Sometimes like expanding the circle of Christians you know. It may even be that you don't know certain people are Christians.</p>
              <p>I had a friend who knew me for 5 years before he found out I was a Christian. Because I never exhibited the 'qualities' he thought a Christian would have.</p>

              <p>Like I've told an ex-christian before, maybe it lies in your own personal experience as well. Sometimes like expanding the circle of Christians you know. It may even be that you don't know certain people are Christians.</p>
              <p>I had a friend who knew me for 5 years before he found out I was a Christian. Because I never exhibited the 'qualities' he thought a Christian would have.</p>

              <p>Hard to say, I sometimes imagine as a Christian God would be angrier with some people who call themselves Christians than the non-Christian.</p>
              <p>Whatever your faith is, in terms of divine judgement we may never be able to fully grasp it at all. And if you don't believe in any God or Gods, then it comes down to your sense of morality and humanity I guess.</p>
