              <p>"Why do you say that?" asked the man. "Well, it's so
              easy, you just have to go out in the street to realize that God does
              not exist. Tell me, if God existed, would there be so many sick people?

              want to respond so as to cause an argument. The barber finished his job
              and the man went out of the shop. Just after heleft the barber shop he
              saw a man in the street with long hair and beard. It seemed that it had
              been a long time since he had his hair cut and he looked so untidy.</p>
              <p>Then the first man again entered the barber shop and he said to the barber: "You know what? Barbers do not exist!"</p>
              <p>"How can you say they don't exist?" asked the barber. I am here and I am a barber."</p>
              <p> "No!" the man exclaimed. "You don't exist because if
              you did there would be no people with long hair and beard like that man

              <p>"But, I do exist, and that is what happens when people do not come to me."</p>
              <p>"Exactly!" - affirmed the man. "That's the point. God
              does exist, and see what happens when so many people don't go to Him
              and do not look for Him? That's why there's so much pain and suffering

              <p>You get it to the core. Only people who has faith and truly believe in God would understand that doing good and keep doing and being good is not to get praise from other people but to honor God and to please God. It's not even to make us feel good.</p>
              <p>Every sin is actually a transgression to the person we sinned to(which may be ourself)  and to God. So it's actually possible for people to lead a live of insult to God by sinful living.</p>
              <p>And yes for people who want to follow the way of this world they would do anything to be successful.</p>
              <p>But for people who believe in God, they(at least I) believe that even when they do good and keep on being good and doing good they can still be successful. For everything came from the Lord. Faith gives you hope. And that hope would not be in vain because the Lord is a living God. So your faith in God would never be in vain.</p>

              <p>i just simply chose to believe that God is above my circumstances, and He did.</p>
              <p>My testimony's floating somewhere in this forum. Hope you find it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is my take, everyone in this world, suffer la. it's an imperfect world, there's no denying that. and God does bless us in this world, we, as christians believe that this world is not our final home. it's imperfect.</p>
              <p>God blesses us, definitely, you look at all the testimonies around. But God also allows suffering, because if you notice, that people who went through certain hardship in life, they're the best ppl around to help you through your sufferng. they're the most patient, most loving people, and you trust them.</p>
              <p>God allows suffering, for christians, to a certain degree, but He promises that He won't let it kill our spirit, so long as we hold fast to Him. And trust in the perfect love.</p>

              <p>and just a note.</p>
              <p>it also depends on what kind of suffering you're going through. some suffering, are you yourself look for.</p>
              <p>say... you purposely walk against God's plan for you, or disobey God's law, go geylang, take drugs etc.</p>
              <p>you yourself suffer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i think we're talking about the unfairness of life, things we cannot control. why some ppl born blind, why some ppl born poor etc.</p>
              <p>And my answer is this.. this is a fallen world, it belongs to the devil. of course it's chaotic. but my hope is not in this world, but the perfect world to come. and God gives me hope in the blessings he blessed me with. a loving family, a gentle gf, good grades in school (i used to be a horrible student)..</p>
              <p>I can't answer for everyone, but with the blessing that God gave me, I try to pass that blessing on to. =)</p>
              <p>but more imptly.. for yourself.. turn to God. He loves you, definitely. He will strengthen us in times of trouble. i don't intend to boast, cause i dunno if i can stand in suffering, but i also believe that God won't test me beyond what i can bear. slowly la. =)</p>

              <p>Dumbdumb mentioned suffering. Wow you took a bold step converting. My sympathy to you.</p>
              <p>I too have had my share of sufferings. Bad it was real bad. But after I persevere in my sufferings God gave me quite many kind of blessings. I'd love to think of them as God's way of showing I'm not really alone. But if I share them to you(and I already have actually) I don't think most people would believe me.</p>
              <p>My message is no matter how bad your situation is now, no matter how painful you are in right now do not give up on your faith. Persevere and God will let you know He is with you all the time. If it hadn't been for all the pain I would not have been what I am now today. A much stronger person that is. I wouldn't witness God's companion in my life too. He shook the earth for me I wouldn't forget that LOL.</p>
              <p>When God is with you even the whole word cannot beat you. Even if I have to die I already know where I'm going now to await my savior. God corrected my understanding on death. He that sees through men's heart.</p>

              man went to a barber shop to have his hair cut as usual. He
              started<br> to have a good conversation with the barber who was cutting his
              hair. They<br> talked about many things and various subjects. Suddenly, they
              touched<br> the subject of God. <br>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-size: 10px;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial Narrow;">The barber said,
              "Look man, I don't believe that God
              exists!"</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Why do you say that?" asked the
              man. "Well, it's so easy, you just have to go out in the street to
              realize that God does not exist. Tell me, if God existed, would
              there be so many sick people? Would there be abandoned children? If
              God existed, there would be no suffering nor pain? I can't think of
              loving a God who permits all of these things."<br>  <br> The man thought for the moment, but he didn't want to respond so as
              to cause an argument. The barber finished his job and the man went
              out of the shop. Just after heleft the barber shop he saw a man in
              the street with long hair and beard. It seemed that it had been a
              long time since he had his hair cut and he looked so
              untidy.</span></p>
              <p>Then the first man again entered the barber shop and he said to
              the barber: "You know what? Barbers do not exist!"</p>
              <p>"How can you say they don't exist?" asked the barber. I am here
              and I am a barber."</p>
              <p> "No!" the man exclaimed. "You don't exist because if you
              did there would be no people with long hair and beard like that man
              who walks the streets."</p>
              <p>"But, I do exist, and that is what happens when people do not
              come to me."</p>
              <p>"Exactly!" - affirmed the man. "That's the point. God does
              exist, and see what happens when so many people don't go to Him and
              do not look for Him? That's why there's so much pain and suffering
              in the world."</p>

It could answer any request posed by any person. To consult the Hypercomputer, all you need is to pay the elders a voluntary donation.<br><br>It gives only three answers - Yes, No or Wait.<br><br>But because it did not have a display screen or motors of any type, you cannot determine what its response is when you first ask. You can only tell after the actual event has occurred.<br><br>For example, if a person requests for good health from the Hypercomputer and he recovers, then he knows the answer is Yes.<br><br>If his health worsens, he knows the answer is No. If his health doesn't change, then the answer is Wait.<br><br>For thousands of years the Hypercomputer served the planet well. The people believed that whether war or peace, whether poverty or riches, for better or worse the Hypercomputer has predicted them all. If you have a request, no matter how big or how small you can approach the elders to access the Hypercomputer.<br><br>Then one day a young man who specializes in making microcomputers was tasked with cleaning the exterior of the Hypercomputer. Curious, he sneaked into the Hypercomputer interior and realized that there is nothing inside the Hypercomputer at all.<br><br>It was an empty statue made of wood.<br><br>He went on the streets screaming, "we've all been fooled! The Hypercomputer is only an empty statue! It can't reply to anything that we can't reply ourselves!"<br><br>The elders were not amused. They clarified that the mechanism of the Hypercomputer is invisible, because it extends into another dimension. The young man was brutally punished in the public square for his transgression. People hurled abuses and objects at the accused.<br><br>As he laid dying, he kept repeating these words, "Yes, No or Wait...Yes, No or Wait..."</p></div>

              <p>know that Ish6:3 says God is holy meaning he is pure n clean with no trace of evil so we can trust him completely.</p>
              <p>Job34:10-12 points that God is never the source of wickedness.</p>
              <p>james 1:13 answers that when under trial, let none says he is being tried by God. for with evil things God cant be tried nor does he himself trys any.which is not what certain religious teachers teach.</p>
              <p>world conditions now is not caused by God but rather allowed by him.jus like a caring dad who infm all the good and bad things in life to his grown son n the son decides to do only the bad stuff..is it the dad's fault?</p>
