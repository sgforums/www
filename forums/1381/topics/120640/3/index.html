From reading the bible, we get the following impression:<br><br>1. Peter was never in Rome.<br>2. Paul was there before Peter.<br><br>Peter, to me, is like a hijacker. The first church was not the Vatican but the Jerusalem Church headed by James. In Acts and elsewhere, Peter did not assume any position other than the honorary 'chief disciple'. There were already bishops in Alexandria, Antioch before Peter became the bishop of Rome. Ok, the part about him becoming the bishop of Rome is quite dubious.<br><br>You may say Peter is indeed the Rock of the faith. But I don't see it in the bible. What I see is his pathetic authorship (also dubious, don't think this fisherman is so educated <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) and his tendency to slide into unchristian practices.<br><br>IMHO, Paul is a better candidate to the Rock of the faith. Luckily he never started any church. He just pointed us back to God.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>You can distort the interpretion of the bible, which most church teachers do for fear that their members will find out which is the original church.  But there is no way to distort history.<br><br>Who are we to say Paul is a better candidate than Peter when Jesus has already appointed Peter.<br><br><strong>Matthew 16:18</strong>: "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church."<br><br>After the resurrection, Jesus appeared to his disciples and asked Peter three times, "Do you love me?" (John 21:15-17). In repentance for his threefold denial, Peter gave a threefold affirmation of love. Then Christ, the Good Shepherd (John 10:11, 14), gave Peter the authority he earlier had promised: "Feed my sheep" (John 21:17).<br><br>There is ample evidence in the New Testament that Peter was first in authority among the apostles. Whenever they were named, Peter headed the list (Matt. 10:1-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:14-16, Acts 1:13); sometimes the apostles were referred to as "Peter and those who were with him" (Luke 9:32). Peter was the one who generally spoke for the apostles (Matt. 18:21, Mark 8:29, Luke 12:41, John 6:68-69), and he figured in many of the most dramatic scenes (Matt. 14:28-32, Matt. 17:24-27, Mark 10:23-2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. On Pentecost it was Peter who first preached to the crowds (Acts 2:14-40), and he worked the first healing in the Church age (Acts 3:6-7). It is PeterÂ’s faith that will strengthen his brethren (Luke 22:32) and Peter is given ChristÂ’s flock to shepherd (John 21:17). An angel was sent to announce the resurrection to Peter (Mark 16:7), and the risen Christ first appeared to Peter (Luke 24:34). He headed the meeting that elected Matthias to replace Judas (Acts 1:13-26), and he received the first converts (Acts 2:41). He inflicted the first punishment (Acts 5:1-11), and excommunicated the first heretic (Acts 8:18-23). He led the first council in Jerusalem (Acts 15), and announced the first dogmatic decision (Acts 15:7-11). It was to Peter that the revelation came that Gentiles were to be baptized and accepted as Christians (Acts 10:46-4<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br><strong>St Augustine said this</strong>: "If the very order of episcopal succession is to be considered, how much more surely, truly, and safely do we number them [the bishops of Rome] from Peter himself, to whom, as to one representing the whole Church, the Lord said, Â‘Upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not conquer it.Â’ Peter was succeeded by Linus, Linus by Clement. ... In this order of succession a Donatist bishop is not to be found" (Letters 53:1:2 [A.D. 412]).<br><br><strong>Apostolic Succession</strong><br>The first Christians had no doubts about how to determine which was the true Church and which doctrines the true teachings of Christ. The test was simple: Just trace the apostolic succession of the claimants.<br><br>Apostolic succession is the line of bishops stretching back to the apostles. All over the world, all Catholic are part of a lineage that goes back to the time of the apostles, something that is impossible in Protestant denominations (most of which do not even claim to have bishops).<br><br>The role of apostolic succession in preserving true doctrine is illustrated in the Bible. To make sure that the apostlesÂ’ teachings would be passed down after the deaths of the apostles, Paul told Timothy, "[W]hat you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also" (2 Tim. 2:2). In this passage he refers to the first three generations of apostolic successionÂ—his own generation, TimothyÂ’s generation, and the generation Timothy will teach.<br><br>The Church Fathers, who were links in that chain of succession, regularly appealed to apostolic succession as a test for whether Catholics or heretics had correct doctrine. This was necessary because heretics simply put their own interpretations, even bizarre ones, on Scripture. Clearly, something other than Scripture had to be used as an ultimate test of doctrine in these cases.<br><br>Thus the early Church historian J. N. D. Kelly, a Protestant, writes, "[W]here in practice was [the] apostolic testimony or tradition to be found? . . . The most obvious answer was that the apostles had committed it orally to the Church, where it had been handed down from generation to generation. . . . Unlike the alleged secret tradition of the Gnostics, it was entirely public and open, having been entrusted by the apostles to their successors, and by these in turn to those who followed them, and was visible in the Church for all who cared to look for it" (Early Christian Doctrines, 37).<br><br>For the early Fathers, "the identity of the oral tradition with the original revelation is guaranteed by the unbroken succession of bishops in the great sees going back lineally to the apostles. . . . [A]n additional safeguard is supplied by the Holy Spirit, for the message committed was to the Church, and the Church is the home of the Spirit. Indeed, the ChurchÂ’s bishops are . . . Spirit-endowed men who have been vouchsafed Â‘an infallible charism of truthÂ’" (ibid.).<br><br>Thus on the basis of experience the Fathers could be "profoundly convinced of the futility of arguing with heretics merely on the basis of Scripture. The skill and success with which they twisted its plain meaning made it impossible to reach any decisive conclusion in that field" (ibid., 41).<br><br>I wonder if you can prove that you come from the original church like the way I did it.<br><br>Since you insist that St James was the first Head of the church, where in the bible says that?  And show me/us the line of successors after St James and I will show you the name of Catholic's Popes after St Peter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To counter FrustMom:<br><br>http://www.isaiah58.com/clark/clark10_10_00.html<br><br>Is Peter Head of the Church?<br><br>Recently, a young lady in our meetings was told by Christians that Peter was the head of the Church (and therefore the first pope.) This is one example of an idea that sounds "honorable" (it lifts Peter up), but must be forsaken by those looking for the truth. I would like to discuss this so we might help our Catholic readers (the ones who are willing to forsake error when truth comes); and to help those who are in the various "Christian" denominations which sprang from Catholicism (if you are a Christian - you are have the same "roots" as the Catholics, and this will be discussed further later in this article.) The Spirit of God is telling the obedient to "come out of Christianity", and this wrong idea about Peter being the head of the Church is another of the many reasons why.<br>First, Peter was never the head of any Church. The Church only has one head, and that is Jesus (Eph.1:22, Eph 5:23,Col.1:18.)<br><br>But that may be too argumentative a point. So, let me start again and stick with simple things such as:<br><br>First, Peter, James, John, and the other disciples (as with Jesus--Mat. 15:24) were sent by God only to the Jews (Mat. 10:1-6), not to the Gentiles (Galatians 2:7-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Paul was sent to the Gentiles. <strong>It would make much more sense for Catholics to claim Paul as the first Pope instead of Peter. Peter was never sent as a minister to the uncircumcised nations. Paul was.</strong><br><br>Second, Catholics claim that Peter and Paul established the Church in Rome. That is nonsense. In Paul's letter to the Roman Church, the first chapter, he tells the Church in Rome that their faith has been heard of around the world--and this is long before Paul ever went there! And other than what Catholics claim, there is no proof anywhere that Peter was ever in Rome, and the Biblical evidence would lead us to believe Peter was NEVER in Rome.<br><br>Third, the word Pope means "father", and Jesus commanded his followers to "call no man your father on earth [this is in a religious sense], for one is your Father, who is in heaven" (Mat. 23:9). Catholics also call their priests "father." When Cornelius fell at Peter's feet (Acts 10), Peter did not receive reverence as the Pope does. He told Cornelius to get up, for he was a man just as Cornelius was. So Peter did not consider himself a "father."<br><br>Fourth, Catholics claim that the Pope is the "vicar" of Christ. This is a horrible error. A vicar is THE representative of a ruler. The holy Ghost is the vicar of Christ. It was sent "in Jesus name" to be here instead of him. It is blasphemous for any man to claim to be what the holy Ghost really is.<br><br><strong>Fifth, Jesus never told Peter he was the rock that the Church would be built upon. When Jesus told Peter, "upon this rock I will build my Church" (Mat. 16:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, he did not mean he would build the Church on Peter, as Catholics teach. I mean, good grief - Peter died! Nor was Jesus referring to Peter's confession of Jesus as Christ, as Protestants teach. Jesus was referring to what Peter had experienced. In the verse just before Jesus mentioned the rock, he told Peter that God Himself had revealed truth to him (Peter). THAT is the rock that the Church is built upon.</strong> What God in His mercy does for men is what builds up the Church, not Peter, nor Peter's words.<br><br>Sixth, the idea that transfer of highest authority in the Church on earth was passed from an original apostle (Peter), and only from him does highest authority come is absurd. Peter held no preeminence over the other apostles. He did not rule over any man of God. <strong>By all appearances, James (if anyone) was considered the leader of the Church in Jerusalem (Acts 12:17, 15:13) while Peter was still alive. He announced the verdict of the earliest Church council (Acts 15) and alone is mentioned by name as an elder in Acts 21:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Paul rebuked Peter in public one time (Gal. 2:11). The pillars of the Church in Jerusalem, according to Paul, were James, Peter and John (Gal. 2:9), not just Peter.</strong><br><br>What is the point? Peter was not the head of the Church, nor was he the head of Catholicism. <strong>Catholicism is the beginning of the religion that started AFTER the time that we read about in the book of Acts.</strong> The Pope is Christianity's head. The denominations and sects of Christianity are those, who like their "mother" have gone astray. The underlying, uniting foundation of all Christian sects is that one may become a member of the church by his own choice instead of simply repenting and being baptized by Jesus into God's holy family. My friend, how did you become a member of the church to which you belong? If you became a member of your church by joining it, you are in the wrong one. If you have joined any of the churches of Christianity, then you have become it's member, and the Pope is your father--even if you hate him. And many of his children do. My brother, my dear sister, do you know what the Spirit is saying to the church RIGHT NOW? If not, get alone with God and seek Him and you will hear in the deepest recesses of your soul a still, small voice crying out in most earnest tones, "Come out of her, My people!" And when you hear it, obey.</div>

I know you want proof, and only Biblical proof, so take a look at the other uses of the word Babylon in the New Testament. One example:<br><br>Revelation 14:8. A second angel followed, who cried out, Babylon, great Babylon is fallen; she who made all the nations drunk with the maddening wine of her fornication.<br><br>Other examples include Rev 16:19, Rev 17:5, Rev 18:2, Rev 18:10, and Rev 18:21. In these verses, Babylon is repeatedly referred to as a Â“great city,Â” which immediately removes ancient Babylon from the running. But why would the Apostles not simply use the word Â“RomeÂ” when talking about Rome? Rome was the chief persecutor of the early Church and martyred more than its share of early Christians. I have personally stood in the catacombs in Rome where the bodies of martyred Christians are piled in small graves along the walls. They used the word Babylon to hide their presence, their location, from those looking to kill them. A simple study of Roman history will illuminate the wisdom of this choice.<br><br>What fascinates me about this is that the very people who suggest Peter was never in Rome will immediately refer to the verses in Revelation as pertaining to Rome, particularly to the Catholic Church. In other words, they agree the Apostles used Â“BabylonÂ” to refer to Rome when it suits their purposes, and disagree when it doesnÂ’t. There are numerous protestant scholars that also agree with this:<br><br>The key to the problem, in the view of most critics, lies in the fact that in the 1st century Â‘BabylonÂ’ was becoming in Jewish and Christian circles a symbolic title for Rome. For the prophets (e.g. Is 13; 43:14; Jer 50:29; 51:1-58 ) the name had denoted the proud, immoral, godless city that dominated their world, and it was natural for later Jews to see this as the type of the Rome they knew and which embodied these very characteristics. So we find Rome referred to as Â‘BabylonÂ’ in the rabbinical literature . . . Â‘She who is at BabylonÂ’ simply means Â‘the church in RomeÂ’ . . . So the church in Rome is in Babylon because Rome is its place of exile.<br>- - J.N.D. Anderson A Commentary on the Epistles of Peter and Jude<br><br>Several extra-Biblical sources (as Anderson alluded to above) also refer to Rome as Â“Babylon,Â” for example the Sibylline Oracles and the Apocalypse of Baruch do so. Virtually all serious protestant scholars in modern times agree with this (IÂ’m not aware of any that donÂ’t), mainly due to the vast evidence which has come out more recently through archeology (weÂ’ll get there).<br><br>This is pretty clear Biblical evidence, but like all infallible books, without an infallible interpreter they can be misused. So there are those who argue that the Â“great cityÂ” of Babylon isnÂ’t Rome. But, thereÂ’s more evidence.<br></div>

To start, IÂ’ll refer to a writing from approximately 80 A.D., just about 4 years after PeterÂ’s martyrdom:<br><br>But, to leave the examples of antiquity, let us come to the athletes who are closest to our own time. Consider the noble examples of our own generation. Through jealousy and envy the greatest and most righteous pillars were persecuted, and they persevered even to death. Let us set before our eyes the good Apostles: Peter, who through unwarranted jealousy suffered not one or two buy many toils, and having thus given testimony went to the place of glory that was his due. Through jealousy and strife Paul showed the way to the prize for endurance . . . Thus he became our greatest example of perseverance. To these men who lived such holy lives there must be added a multitude of the elect, who suffered terrible indignities and tortures on account of jealousy, and who became shining examples in our midst.<br>- - St. Clement of Rome Letter to the Corinthians<br><br>St. Clement, who everyone agrees was writing from Rome, notes that Peter and Paul were Â“in their midstÂ” Â– the way he uses the phrase indicates they were at Rome. Typically, in writings so close to the historical facts, authors donÂ’t feel the need to point out the obvious. In other words, St. Clement puts Peter in Rome, but never imagines that 1,500 years later others would even suggest that Peter wasnÂ’t there. Other texts are more explicit:<br><br>It is recorded that Paul was beheaded in Rome itself, and Peter, likewise, was crucified during the reign [of Nero]. The account is confirmed by the names of Peter and Paul over the cemeteries there, which remain to the present time. And it is confirmed also by a stalwart man of the Church, Gaius by name, who lived in the time of Zephyrinus, Bishop of Rome. This Gaius, in a written disputation with Proclus, the leader of the sect of Cataphyrygians, says this of the places in which the remains of the afore-mentioned Apostles were deposited: Â“I can point out the trophies of the Apostles. For if you are willing to go to the Vatican or to the Ostian Way, you will find the trophies of those who founded this Church.Â”<br>- - Fragment in Eusebius, History of the Church<br><br>Eusebius, however, was attempting to write an early history of the Church, so his information is more direct. He notes that Peter was crucified in Rome (which indicates he was there) and that he is buried there, but more on that later.<br><br>A little later on, around 200 A.D., we have more confirmation:<br><br>Come now, if you would indulge a better curiosity in the business of your salvation, run through the apostolic churches in which the very thrones of the Apostles remain still in place; in which their own authentic writings are read, giving sound to the voice and recalling the faces of each. Achaia is near you, so you have Corinth. If you are not far from Macedonia, you have Philippi. If you can cross into Asia, you have Ephesus. But if you are near to Italy, you have Rome, whence also our authority derives. How happy is that Church, on which the Apostles poured out their whole doctrine along with their blood, where Peter endured a passion like that of the Lord, where Paul was crowned in a death like JohnÂ’s, where the Apostle John, after being immersed in boiling oil and suffering no hurt, was exiled to an island.<br>- - Tertullian The Demurrer Against the Heretics<br><br>Note first that the Bible wasnÂ’t compiled in this time, so he points out that in some churches Â“their own authentic writings are read.Â” But also he puts Rome as the city where Peter Â“poured out [his] doctrine along with [his] blood.Â”<br><br>There are many more references like this, but these are just a few early ones. But there is also the Â“other sideÂ” of history. For example, who first suggested Peter was never at Rome? Was it someone from the early Church? Perhaps a priest in the Dark Ages? Suprisingly no, it was much, much later. In fact, there are exactly zero manuscripts from the early Church that suggest Peter was never at Rome. Zero. Even though there are numerous (and I do mean numerous) non-Christian and Christian writings about Peter, none place his martyrdom outside of Rome. Then where does this idea come from? Naturally it comes from those with an agenda in the Sixteenth century (again: Zero until the Sixteenth century).<br><br>But most of the push behind todayÂ’s amateur exegetes that push this theory rests on one book, Roman Catholicism by Loraine Boettner where he makes the claim that there is no evidence to suggest Peter was ever at Rome (I think you can read through the previous sections of this article and realize that many errors exist in BoettnerÂ’s book). This brings us to the Archeological evidence and an odd decision by Boettner.</div>

This is important because tradition held that Peter was buried beneath an altar in specific place in Rome. In 324 A.D., still before the Bible was compiled, but well after the death of Peter, Constantine ordered a church be built on St. PeterÂ’s tomb. The church was called St. PeterÂ’s Basilica and was completed around 349 A.D.<br><br>Twelve centuries later, Pope Julius II began rebuilding St. PeterÂ’s Basilica. Michelangelo was famously hired to finish it in 1546 and included a beautiful dome over the central altar in the church. This dome, it was said, was directly above St. PeterÂ’s grave. But some still had their doubts.<br><br>In 1939, Pope Pius XII commissioned some addition excavations (called Â“scaviÂ”) below St. PeterÂ’s Cathedral when an odd wall was found. The excavations first found a large graveyard and eventually a red wall. The red wall featured Christian Â“graffitiÂ” that included Â“Peter is [here]Â” as well as a secret compartment holding bones wrapped in a purple cloth. Once studied, the bones were of a man who died around 70 A.D., was around 60 to 70 years old, and was short and very stocky. Oddly enough, the set of bones included everything but the feet. Why? Peter was crucified upside down and it was believed that he was removed from the crucifix by simply chopping his feet off.<br><br>The archeologists themselves were surprised to find the bones of Peter almost directly under the main altar in St. PeterÂ’s Basilica. The evidence surrounding the tomb of Peter continued to mount (for example, Gaius also described PeterÂ’s Â“trophyÂ” or tomb in detail, and it matched his description). For more information, read articles here by George Weigel and here by EWTN (I couldnÂ’t find the final report by the archeologists online).<br><br>The Vatican still offers the Â“Scavi TourÂ” that takes you through the excavation step-by-step and points out the early pictures of Mary and the places where the early Church celebrated Mass. Here is more information on the tour. Personally, IÂ’ve done the tour twice and have a good friend who leads it while studying to be a priest. It is a great tour.<br><br>By the way, the odd decision by Boettner? He has updated his less-than-scholarly work multiple times and continued to ignore all of the archeological evidence offered by these excavations. In my mind, this is a clear sign that truth is not something Boettner cares much about (this is also obvious by his outright errors of Catholicism that could be corrected in five minutes with the Catechism. Of course, Boettner probably wouldnÂ’t sell as many books if he did that).</div>

When Catholics call the Pope "holy father", this is nothing more than a man-made title distinguishing the pope as our spiritual father.
