And no matter how many good  deeds you do, will not be good enough because your sins will outnumber your good deeds.That is why faith in Jesus is required(and of course if you believe in Jesus acts inspired by faith will follow), but for people who do not believe, <strong>they still love Jesus when they do good deeds and acts of love for God is love.</strong><br><br><blockquote><br>what the hell is the catholic way of life? going to church? going to confession? if you don't believe in Jesus and only in Jesus, all that = bullshit<br></blockquote>It is clearly obvious that you never did any research at all about the catholic way of life. Catholics   believe in Jesus. Who ever told you that the catholic way of life is only going to church and confession?<br><br><blockquote><br>if going to church makes me a christian, then going to macdonald makes me a big mac. and if u believe u can be a freethinker and buy your way in by doing "good deeds" then u're a bigger big mac than i am.<br></blockquote>Going to church does not make a person christian,only <strong>when you live a christian life you become a christian</strong>. If, person does not know that Jesus is the salvation can he be held accountable for not being a christian?<br><br>I do not think God would be so cruel to turn away a good person just because he's not christian.<br><br><blockquote><br>not that we shouldn't do good, but doing good is after salvation, salvation is salvation, good works are good works, different issues, and shouldn't be brought together.<br><br>good works don't give u salvation, only Jesus can, but good works comes and counts after salvation, because God will reward u for every little nice mushy thing you do for others when u go to heaven after u get knocked down by a bus or smth. kidding abt the knocked down part.<br></blockquote>Again I'll give a repeated answer:<br>If, person does not that Jesus is the salvation can he be held accountable for not being a christian?<br><br>I do not think God would be so cruel to turn away a good person just because he's not christian.<br><br><blockquote><br>catholics don't really believe anyone goes to heaven, i think they believe even if u receive Jesus, u still hv to pay for your sins, in pugatory. Not that i believe that la. haha.<br></blockquote>I apolgize to Jworld for shamelessly copying your material:<br><br><blockquote><br>Why do Catholics believe in a place between Heaven and Hell called Purgatory? Where is Purgatory mentioned in the Bible?<br>The main body of Christians have always believed in the existence of a place between Heaven and Hell where souls go to be punished for lesser sins and to repay the debt of temporal punishment for sins which have been forgiven. Even after Moses was forgiven by God, he was still punished for his sin. (2 Kg. or 2 Sam. 12:13-14). The primitive Church Fathers regarded the doctrine of Purgatory as one of the basic tenets of the Christian faith. St. Augustine, one of the greatest doctors of the Church, said the doctrine of Purgatory "has been received from the Fathers and it is observed by the Universal Church." True, the word "purgatory" does not appear in the Bible, but a place where lesser sins are purged away and the soul is saved "yet so as by fire, "is mentioned. (1 Cor. 3:15). Also, the Bible distinguishes between those who enter Heaven straightaway, calling them "the church of the firstborn"(Heb. 12:23), and those who enter after having undergone a purgation, calling them "the spirits of the just made perfect." (Heb. 12:23). Christ Himself stated: "Amen I say to thee, thou shall not go out from thence till thou repay the last farthing." (Matt. 5:26). And: "Every idle word that men shall speak, thou shall not go out from thence till thou repay the last farthing." (Matt 5:26). And: "Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment." (Matt. 12:36). These are obviously references to Purgatory. Further, the Second Book of Maccabees (which was dropped from the Scriptures by the Protestant reformers) says: "It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins." (2 Mach. 12:46). Ancient Christian tomb inscriptions from the second and third centuries frequently contain and appeal for prayers for the dead. In fact, the custom of praying for the dead, which is meaningless if there is no Purgatory, was universal among Christians for the fifteen centuries preceding the Protestant Reformation.<br><br>Furthermore, ordinary justice calls for a place of purgation between Heaven and Hell. Take our own courts of justice, for example. For major crimes a person is executed or sentenced to life imprisonment (Hell); for minor crimes a person is sentenced to temporary imprisonment for punishment and rehabilitation (Purgatory); for no crime at all a person is rewarded with the blessing for free citizenship (Heaven). If a thief steals some money, then regrets his deed and asks the victim for forgiveness, it is quite just for the victim to forgive him yet still insist on restitution. God, who is infinitely just, insists on holy restitution. This is made either in this life, by doing penance (Matt. 3:2; Luke 3:8, 13:3; Apoc. 3:2-3, 19), or in Purgatory.<br><br>Also, what Christian is there who, despite his faith in Christ and his sincere attempts to be Christ-like, does not find sin and worldliness still in his heart? "For in many things we all offend." (James 3:2). Yet "there shall not enter into it (the new Jerusalem, Heaven) anything defiled." (Apoc. or Rev. 21:27). In Purgatory the soul is mercifully purified of all sins; there God carries out the work of spiritual purification which most Christians neglected and resisted on earth. It is important to remember that Catholics do not believe that Christ simply covers over their sinful souls, like covering a manure heap with a blanket of snow (Martin Luther's description of God's forgiveness). Rather, Christ insists that we be truly holy and sinless to the core of our souls. "Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect." ( Matt. 5:48 ). This growth in sinlessness, in Christian virtue and holiness, is of course the work of an entire lifetime (and is possible only through the grace of God). With many this cleansing is completed only in Purgatory. If there is no Purgatory, but only Heaven for the perfect and Hell for the imperfect, then the vast majority of us are hoping in vain for life eternal in Heaven.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My first question is this:<br>Does this mean mean people <strong>who are not christians but do good deeds and acts of love are condemmed?</strong><br><br><blockquote><br>can u show me the verse in the new international bible that God is ok with<br>good works alone?<br></blockquote>Now lets look at it from the Catholic point of view and you will notice catholics also state that faith is required, I will once again shamelessly plagarize from JWorld:<br><br><blockquote><br>Why do Catholics believe that good works are necessary for salvation? Does not Paul say in Romans 3:28 that faith alone justifies?<br>Catholics believe that faith and good works are both necessary for salvation, because such is the teaching of Jesus Christ. What our Lord demands is "faith that worketh by charity." (Gal. 5:6). Read Matthew 25:31-46, which describes the Last Judgment as being based on works of charity. The first and greatest commandment, as given by Our Lord Himself, is to love the Lord God with all one's heart, mind, soul, and strength; and the second great commandment is to love one's neighbor as oneself. (Mark 12:30-31). When the rich young man asked Our Lord what he must do to gain eternal life, our Lord answered: "Keep the commandments." (Matt. 19:17). Thus, although faith is the beginning, it is not the complete fulfilment of the will of God. Nowhere in the Bible is it written that faith alone justifies. When St. Paul wrote, "For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law," he was referring to works peculiar to the old Jewish Law, and he cited circumcision as an example.<br><br>The Catholic Church does not teach that purely human good works are meritorious for salvation; such works are not meritorious for salvation, according to her teaching. Only those good works performed when a person is in the state of grace, that is, as a branch drawing its spiritual life from the Vine which is Christ (John 15:4-6), only these good deeds work toward our salvation, and they do so only by the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ. These good works, offered to God by a soul in the state of grace (i.e., free of mortal sin, with the Blessed Trinity dwelling in the soul), are thereby supernaturally meritorious because they share in the work and in the merits of Christ. Such supernatural good works will not only be rewarded by God, but are necessary for salvation.<br><br>St. Paul shows how the neglect of certain good works will send even a Christian believer to damnation: "But if any man have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel." (1 Tim. 5:8 ). Our Lord tells us that if the Master (God) returns and finds His servant sinning, rather than performing works of obedience, He "shall separate him, and shall appoint him his portion with unbelievers."; (Luke 12:46).<br><br>Furthermore, Catholics know they will be rewarded in Heaven for their good works. Our Lord Himself said: "For the Son of man...will render to every man according to his works." (Matt. 16:27). "And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward." (Matt. 10:42). Catholics believe, following the Apostle Paul, that "every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour." (1 Cor. 3:8 ). "For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shown in his name, you who have ministered, and do minister to the saints." (Heb. 6:10). "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day; and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming." (2 Tim. 4:7-8 ).<br><br>Still, Catholics know that, strictly speaking, God never owes us anything. Even after obeying all God's commandments, we must still say: "We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do." (Luke 17:10). As St. Augustine (5th century) stated: All our good merits are wrought through grace, so that God, in crowning our merits, is crowning nothing but His gifts."<br><br>Had St. Paul meant that faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, he would not have written: "...and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." (1 Cor. 13:2). If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the Apostle James would not have written: "Do you see by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?...For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead." (James 2:24-26). Or: "What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?" (James 2:14). If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the Apostle Peter would not have written: "Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make sure you calling and election. For doing these things, you shall not sin at any time. For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." (2 Peter 1:10-11). If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the primitive Christian Fathers would not have advocated good works in such powerful words. Wrote St. Irenaeus, one of the most illustrious of the primitive Christian Fathers: "For what is the use of knowing the truth in word, while defiling the body and accomplishing the works of evil? Or what real good at all can bodily holiness do, if truth be not in the soul? For these two, faith and good works, rejoice in each other's company, and agree together and fight side by side to sen man in the Presence of God." (Proof of the Apostolic Preaching). Justification by faith alone is a new doctrine; it was unheard of in the Christian community before the sixteenth century.<br><br></blockquote>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have issues with these practices of the catholics: Did Peter authorized such practices?<br><br>Prayer to Mary<br><br>Whenever i ask why they pray to mary, most of the catholics usually deny that they do, and insist that they only ask mary to intercede in the same manner that we protestants would ask a friend to pray for them. but yet, prayers are addressed <span style="font-style: italic;">to</span> mary for everything from safety to forgiveness of sins and salvation, official prayers to mary are found in booklets like devotions in honour of our mother of perpetual help.<br><br>This is a typical prayer and praise to mary found in such booklets.<br><br>O mother of perpetual help, thou art the dispenser of all goods which god grants to us miserable sinners.... come then, to my aid, dearest mother...<br><br>in thy hands i place my eternal salvation and to thee do i entrust my soul... for if thou protect me, dear mother, i fear nothing, not from my sins, because thou wilt obtain for me the parton of them, nor from the devils, because thou art more powerful than all hell together, nor even from Jesus, my judge himself, because by one prayer from thee, he will be appeased.<br><br>you look to mary for your source of partdon of sins and salvation that Christ obtained with His own blood. and which He freely gives by grace to all who would believe in Him. Here, Jesus is protrayed as a freaking adversarial judge who would comdemn us were it not for mary's intercession.. is this practice commissioned by peter, the saint you claim started your religion? peter himself knew Jesus was the source of salvation, is this practice found in the bible? or in the first church in the book of acts?<br><br>the position of mary has been exalted far above Jesus, I quote a catholic newspaper late in the 1990<br><br>"Mary, is the refuge of sinners, and the gate of heaven, for the poor souls in purgatory, surely we should pray to her for them"<br><br>the roman catholic church prays<br><br>"through the virgin mother of God, may the lord grant us salvation and peace, we should pray daily to the queen of peace for peace in our strife-torn world... we need her hand to guide us along the dark road of life"<br><br>is this what the bible says? I believe the bible says, Jesus is the prince of peace, he is the source of peace. trade in your yoke of slavery for His yoke, for his yoke is easy, and his burden light!<br><br>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.<br><br>Peace comes from God, and no one else, unless you are saying mary's a god too?<br><br>While compared to the catholic's mary, jesus christ is a subordinate figure, He's always shown as a helpless babe by his mother's side, or a dead lifeless victim of the cross being held across her knees. Ok, this part, I have to agree at some point, True, Jesus Christ was a baby once, ONCE! as in the PAST! but catholics always seem to treat it like the PRESENT!.<br><br>this false presentation of Christ is not just found in your churches, but in alleged "appearences"<br><br>My aunt told me once about the visions of "mary" at fatima. that she appeared with a child jesus by her side.<br><br>This is the account of the apparition<br><br>"On the 10th december 1925, most holy virgin mary appeared to lucia, with the CHILD  jesus by her side, elevated on a cloud of light<br><br>our lady rested on hand on lucia's shoulder, while in the other hand she held a heart surrounded with sharp thorns, at the same time, the CHILD jesus spoke<br><br>"Have pity on the heart of your most holy mother, it is covered with thorns with which ungrateful men pierce it at every moment, and there is no one to remove them with an act of reparation" [emphasis added]"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>can you explain to me how can you actually believe that the child figure is the real Jesus in the first place?!<br><br>Jesus died at the age of 33 years old, crucified on the cross, when He revealed himself to his diciples, they saw him as a 33 years old man, not a 3 years old kid!<br><br>even when john, who wrote the book of revelations, saw Jesus as a man, in all his glory and power. A MAN, NOT A KID!<br><br>yet.. the catholics still persists in depicting Jesus as a helpless baby, dependent on its mother mary, who is now the "queen of heaven"<br><br>I'd like to add something, in the bible, it tells us that satans sometimes dresses as an angel of light, as in not a real angel, but parades around as a force of good, to deceive the people. i think you were deceived. use your head and think at this point. If Jesus was gonna pass you a message, why isn't Jesus a 33 years old man, but a kid giving you instructions which isn't from the bible?<br><br>What about that brown rope thing you wear around your neck? I attended the course with my aunt at saint joseph secondary, I was briefly told about its history, correct me if i'm wrong.<br><br>if i remember correctly, lady mary appeared to this monk with the actual brown coat, and told him something about if anyone wears it, and dies wearing it, he can immediately go to heaven and escape purgatory. and the speaker added that anyone of any religion can wear it, be it buddhists or hindus or whatever. In that case, what's the point of Jesus dying on the cross? It totally defeats the purpose of the cross and removal of sins. is this another practice commissioned by peter, your rock?<br><br>there are plenty other issues too.. but i'm getting tired from typing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
