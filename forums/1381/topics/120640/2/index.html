            <div class='col-md body'>I will show you an excerpt from the Church's document, entitled Lumen Gentium.<br><br>60. There is but one Mediator as we know from the words of the apostle, "for there is one God and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a redemption for all." (29<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> The maternal duty of Mary toward men in no wise obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of Christ, but rather shows his power. For all the salvific influence of the Blessed Virgin on men originates, not from some inner necessity, but from the divine pleasure. It flows forth from the superabundance of the merits of Christ, rests on his mediation, depends entirely on it and draws all its power from it. In no way does it impede, but rather does it foster the immediate union of the faithful with Christ. (298 1 Tim. 2, 5-6).<br><br>62. ...For no creature could ever be counted as equal with the Incarnate Word and Redeemer. Just as the priesthood of Christ is shared in various ways both by the ministers and by the faithful, and as the one goodness of God is really communicated in different ways to his creatures, so also the unique mediation of the Redeemer does not exclude but rather gives rise to a manifold cooperation which is but a sharing in this one source. The Church does not hesitate to profess this subordinate role of Mary. It knows it through unfailing experience of it and commends it to the hearts of the faithful, so that encouraged by this maternal help they may the more intimately adhere to the Mediator and Redeemer. [Jesus Christ]<br><br>66. ... according to her own prophetic words: "All generations shall call me blessed, because He that is mighty hath done great things to me." (301) ...while the Mother is honored, the Son, through whom all things have their being (302) and in whom it has pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell,(303) is rightly known, loved and glorified and that all his commands are observed. 301 Lk. 1, 48. 302 Cf. Col. 1, 15-16. 303 Col 1, 19.<br><br>67. .. But it exhorts theologians and preachers of the divine word to abstain zealously both from all gross exaggerations as well as from petty narrow-mindedness in considering the singular dignity of the Mother of God.(23*) Following the study of Sacred Scripture, the Holy Fathers, the doctors and liturgy of the Church, and under the guidance of the Church's magisterium, let them rightly illustrate the duties and privileges of the Blessed Virgin which always look to Christ, the source of all truth, sanctity and piety.<br>(23) Cfr.

How do you explain that?<br><br>Even Jesus told us to ask and pray to the Father in His name. Protocol here, ask God, the Father, pray to who? God the Father. not Mary the Mother, or Joseph the Father *how many father we have now?*<br><br>When the topic went to something about marraige, the speaker was giving a testimony about how he met his wife, the wife proudly exhalted "see? isn't mother mary the best matchmaker in the world?"<br><br>u hv to admit la, there are plenty of questionable practices, which u need to think and pray for wisdom and compare it with God's word in the bible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why do Catholics worship Mary as though she were a goddess, when it is clear in Scripture that she was not a supernatural being?</strong><br>Catholics do not worship Mary, the Mother of Christ, as though she were a deity. Of all the misconceptions about Catholic belief and practice, this one is the most absurd. Catholics are just as aware as Protestants that Mary was a human creature, and therefore not entitled to the honours which are reserved to God alone. What many non-Catholics mistake for adoration is a very profound love and veneration, nothing more. Mary is not adored, first because God forbids it, and secondly because the Canon Law of the Catholic Church, which is based on Divine Law, forbids it. Canon Law 1255 of the 1918 Codex strictly forbids adoration of anyone other than the Holy Trinity. However, Catholics do feel that Mary is entitled to a great measure of exaltation because, in choosing her as the Mother of Redemption, God Himself exalted her, exalted her more than any other human person before or since. Catholics heap tribute and honour on Mary because they earnestly desire to be "followers of God, as a most dear children." (Eph. 5:1). Mary herself prophesied: "For behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me: and holy is his name." (Luke 1:48-49). Catholics know that every bit of the glory they give to Mary redounds to the glory of her divine Son, just as Mary magnified God, not herself, when Elizabeth blessed her. (Luke 1:41-55). They know that the closer they draw to her, the closer they draw to Him who was born of her. In the year 434 St. Vincent of Lerins defended Christian devotion to Mary this way: "Therefore, may God forbid that anyone should attempt to defraud Holy Mary of her privilege of divine grace and her special glory. For by a unique favour of our Lord and God she is confessed to be the most true and most blessed Mother of God." Today 75% of all Christians still hold to this same view.<br><br><strong>Why do Catholics pray to Mary and the saints when Sacred Scripture states that there is one Mediator between God and manÂ—Christ Jesus? (1 Tim. 2:5). </strong><br>When Catholics pray to Mary and the other saints in Heaven they are not bypassing Christ, whom they acknowledge as the sole Mediator between God and man. They are going to Christ through Mary and the other saints. They are asking Mary and other saints to intercede for them before the throne of Christ in Heaven. "For the continual prayer of a just man avail much." (James 5:16). How much more availing is the unceasing prayer of the sinless Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ! St. Paul asked his fellow Christians to intercede for him: "Brethren, pray for us." (2 Thess. 3:1). And again: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God..." (Rom. 15:30). Christ must particularly approve of our going to Him through Mary, His Blessed Mother, because He chose to come to us through her. And at Cana, He performed His first miracle after a word from His Mother. (John 2:2-11).<br><br>It is clear in Sacred Scripture that the saints in Heaven will intercede for us before the throne of Christ if they are petitioned in prayer (Apoc. Or Rev. 8:3-4), and it is clear in the records of primitive Christianity that the first Christians eagerly sought their intercession. Wrote St. John Chrysostom in the fourth century: "When thou perceives that God is chastening thee, fly not to His enemies, but to His friends, the martyrs the saints, and those who were pleasing to Him, and who have great power." If the saints have such power with God, how much more His own Mother.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Why do Catholics try to earn their own salvation, despite the fact that salvation can only come as a free gift from Jesus Christ?<br><br>Catholics fully recognize that Jesus Christ died on the Cross for their sins and thus "opened the gates of Heaven," and that salvation is a free gift which no amount of human good deeds could ever earn. Catholics receive Christ's saving sanctifying grace, and Christ himself, into their souls when they are baptized. Yet they also know that Christ has established certain conditions for entry into eternal happiness in Heaven, for example, receiving His true Flesh and Blood (John 6:54) and keeping the commandments (Matt. 19:17). If a Christian refuses or neglects to obey Our Lord's commands in a grave matter (that is, if he commits a mortal sin), Our Lord will not remain dwelling in his soul; and if a Christian dies in that state, having driven his Lord from his soul by serious sin, he will not be saved. As St. Paul warned the Galatians with regard to certain sins: "They who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God." (Gal. 5:21). It must be added that Christ will always forgive and turn to a sinner who approaches Him with sincerity in the Sacrament of Penance.<br><br>Catholics follow St. Paul, who did not think that his salvation was guaranteed once and for all at the moment he first received Christ into his soul; for he wrote: "I chastise my body, and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway." (1 Cor. 9:27). Also: "With fear and trembling work our your salvation. For it is God who worketh in you..." (Phil. 2:12-13). "He that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved." (Matt. 10:22). Nevertheless, Catholics realize that even the fulfilling of Our Lord's requirements for salvation is impossible without the free gift of His grace.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Why do Catholics believe that good works are necessary for salvation? Does not Paul say in Romans 3:28 that faith alone justifies?<br><br>Catholics believe that faith and good works are both necessary for salvation, because such is the teaching of Jesus Christ. What our Lord demands is "faith that worketh by charity." (Gal. 5:6). Read Matthew 25:31-46, which describes the Last Judgment as being based on works of charity. The first and greatest commandment, as given by Our Lord Himself, is to love the Lord God with all one's heart, mind, soul, and strength; and the second great commandment is to love one's neighbor as oneself. (Mark 12:30-31). When the rich young man asked Our Lord what he must do to gain eternal life, our Lord answered: "Keep the commandments." (Matt. 19:17). Thus, although faith is the beginning, it is not the complete fulfilment of the will of God. Nowhere in the Bible is it written that faith alone justifies. When St. Paul wrote, "For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law," he was referring to works peculiar to the old Jewish Law, and he cited circumcision as an example.<br><br>The Catholic Church does not teach that purely human good works are meritorious for salvation; such works are not meritorious for salvation, according to her teaching. Only those good works performed when a person is in the state of grace, that is, as a branch drawing its spiritual life from the Vine which is Christ (John 15:4-6), only these good deeds work toward our salvation, and they do so only by the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ. These good works, offered to God by a soul in the state of grace (i.e., free of mortal sin, with the Blessed Trinity dwelling in the soul), are thereby supernaturally meritorious because they share in the work and in the merits of Christ. Such supernatural good works will not only be rewarded by God, but are necessary for salvation.<br><br>St. Paul shows how the neglect of certain good works will send even a Christian believer to damnation: "But if any man have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel." (1 Tim. 5:8 ). Our Lord tells us that if the Master (God) returns and finds His servant sinning, rather than performing works of obedience, He "shall separate him, and shall appoint him his portion with unbelievers."; (Luke 12:46).<br><br>Furthermore, Catholics know they will be rewarded in Heaven for their good works. Our Lord Himself said: "For the Son of man...will render to every man according to his works." (Matt. 16:27). "And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward." (Matt. 10:42). Catholics believe, following the Apostle Paul, that "every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour." (1 Cor. 3:8 ). "For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shown in his name, you who have ministered, and do minister to the saints." (Heb. 6:10). "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day; and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming." (2 Tim. 4:7-8 ).<br><br>Still, Catholics know that, strictly speaking, God never owes us anything. Even after obeying all God's commandments, we must still say: "We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do." (Luke 17:10). As St. Augustine (5th century) stated: All our good merits are wrought through grace, so that God, in crowning our merits, is crowning nothing but His gifts."<br><br>Had St. Paul meant that faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, he would not have written: "...and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." (1 Cor. 13:2). If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the Apostle James would not have written: "Do you see by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?...For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead." (James 2:24-26). Or: "What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?" (James 2:14). If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the Apostle Peter would not have written: "Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make sure you calling and election. For doing these things, you shall not sin at any time. For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." (2 Peter 1:10-11). If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the primitive Christian Fathers would not have advocated good works in such powerful words. Wrote St. Irenaeus, one of the most illustrious of the primitive Christian Fathers: "For what is the use of knowing the truth in word, while defiling the body and accomplishing the works of evil? Or what real good at all can bodily holiness do, if truth be not in the soul? For these two, faith and good works, rejoice in each other's company, and agree together and fight side by side to sen man in the Presence of God." (Proof of the Apostolic Preaching). Justification by faith alone is a new doctrine; it was unheard of in the Christian community before the sixteenth century.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>exactly. a christian should always be bible based, not tradion based<br></blockquote>Here's the catholic point of view:<br><blockquote><br>Why does the Catholic Church base some of her doctrines on tradition instead of basing them all on the Bible? Did Christ not tell the Pharisees that in holding to tradition they were transgressing the commandment of God? (Matt. 15:3, Mark 7:9).<br>Observe that in the Bible there are two kinds of religious tradition, human and divine. Observe that when Christ accused the Pharisees He was referring to "precepts of men"(Mark 7:7), to their human traditions. Christ wanted divine tradition preserved and honoured because He made it part and parcel of the Christian deposit of faith, as the Apostle Paul affirmed: "Stand fast; and hold the traditions which you have learned, whether by word, or by our epistles." (2 Thess. 2:14. Also see 2 Thes. 3:6). This divine tradition to which Paul refers, this revealed truth which was handed down by word rather than by letter, is the tradition upon which, along with Sacred Scripture, the Catholic Church bases her tenets of faith, as the primitive Christian Fathers affirmed. Wrote St. Augustine: "These traditions of the Christian name, therefore, so numerous, so powerful, and most dear, justly keep a believing man in the Catholic Church." The New Testament itself is a product of Christian tradition. Nowhere in the New Testament is there any mention of a New Testament. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Ah ha. hahahha!! sorry, the catholic church was NOT the first church before the protestants. the church consisting of the 12 diciples were the first. the roman catholic church only started after the king constantine accepted Christ to win the hearts of the people but mixed in the roman religion. </blockquote>Ok.  Can you show us how you trace your church back to Jesus' time using timeline?  Anybody who has visited Vatican City would see traces of the Church history which links the Catholic Church to St Peter.<br><br><blockquote>i know i didn't come from the line of the protestants, i am from the brethren denomination, straight from apostle paul. u should know peter and paul went diff paths in an argument or smth haha. </blockquote>Ok.  Can you show us the evidence of your root, how your church is linked to St Paul?<br><br>There are only three mainline of Christian : Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants.  You will only belong to one of them or none at all (ie. not a Christian).  You can read up any ecyclopedia.  They will tell you that.  Don't check with any church people as their information may not be fair and neutral.<br><br><blockquote>and no, in the first church, Christ was preached, and Christ was revered. i'm not sure if mother mary was honoured or not, but what you all are doing is not just honour. its reverence already, u look at my posts above, if thats called honour, i dunno what to say. looking to her for protection? looking to her for blessings? looking to her for instructions?</blockquote>Maybe you want to check back how the "Reformation Heroes" like Martin Luther, John Calvin has honoured Mother Mary, even after the Reformation.  The early Protestants had done that too.  In Europe these days, Protestants are less enthusiastic on practising this.  But they are not against it.  Neither do they question the teaching on Mother Mary.<br><br>You don't know that right?  Why?  Cuz the original teachings have been lost in here already.<br><br><blockquote>exactly. a christian should always be bible based, not tradion based. after all, the word of God is the bible, where all instructions are complete. it isn't a bad thing. it is the right thing. the first church, not the roman catholic church were very bible based. everything they taught were from there, not added on by "apparations and visions" </blockquote>What I was trying to point out is : Martin Luther, John Calvins, all these people have venerated Mother Mary the way Catholics do.  But over the years, everybody focus only on the bible that they lost the root and the teachings on why Mother Mary is honoured.<br><br>There was no bible before AD300.  So what do the Christians base their beliefs on in during those time?  Before that, the books in the bible were not even compiled and definitely not given out to Christians.  So where do the Christians get their teachings from?<br><br>Let me ask you : What do you think of putting a Crucifix (a cross with a Jesus on it) in your church?  Do you think it's ok or not?  If yes, why?  If no, why not?</div>

I hope I don't have to spell this out, but Protestants who kenna stumped by this 'classical' Catholic question should be ashamed.<br><br>During the early days, the epistles of Paul were already in circulation. This is not important, actually. What is important is how close we are today to the *original* form of christianity.</div>

From reading the bible, we get the following impression:<br><br>1. Peter was never in Rome.<br>2. Paul was there before Peter.<br><br>Peter, to me, is like a hijacker. The first church was not the Vatican but the Jerusalem Church headed by James. In Acts and elsewhere, Peter did not assume any position other than the honorary 'chief disciple'. There were already bishops in Alexandria, Antioch before Peter became the bishop of Rome. Ok, the part about him becoming the bishop of Rome is quite dubious.<br><br>You may say Peter is indeed the Rock of the faith. But I don't see it in the bible. What I see is his pathetic authorship (also dubious, don't think this fisherman is so educated <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) and his tendency to slide into unchristian practices.<br><br>IMHO, Paul is a better candidate to the Rock of the faith. Luckily he never started any church. He just pointed us back to God.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
