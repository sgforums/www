              <p>I am not a Christian or Roman-Catholic myself, so I can't see or feel like one. Thus, I have written my queries here, hoping a true believer could enlighten me.</p>
              <p>1) Christians always said, as long as you believe in god, or the holy father, your sins shall be cleansed when the time comes, and he shall bring you to his holy kingdom. </p>
              <p>I understand that this is to say god, or the holy father, loves us as their children, and is willing to forgive our mistakes, and will give us a chance to change. He also lead us by setting an example of showing us his benevolence. However, what good is it if his children do not see their mistakes, continuously making the same, with the believe that he shall be forgiven?</p>
              <p>2) I was guided by a Roman-Catholic who explained, who are we to judge a person right or wrong, we are not god. </p>
              <p>However, in reality, many people, regardless of races or religions, including the one who taught me, still have his own perceptions or opinions of people. Doesn't this oppose what the religion is trying to bring forth to his believer? </p>
              <p>3) When I am doing some research on the teachings of the respective religions, I read an article that stated that marriage is the utmost sacred form of relationships recognized in Roman-Catholic. The relationships between husband and wife, and spiritually with god, is to be considered above all other relationships. </p>
              <p>If so, how can a wife let her husband suffers in hunger, or threaten to get a divorce, because her husband fails to bring back money because of losing a job. Despite so, the said husband continues to love her with all his heart and his trying to give them the best while suffering alone, yet she, the wife, brings her mother out to enjoy the materialistic enjoyment of life, not considering the hardships and burden they are in. Isn't marriage an holistic commitment that bind both parties to love each other, to be loyal to, and to support each other irregardless good times or bad?</p>
              <p>If god is so generous to forgive everyone, what will it be should a believer believes in god only because they believe that they shall be forgiven, yet committing actions that are not in accordance to what are being taught. If so, shouldn't they be damned? </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>BEKASI (Indonesia) - An Indonesian city government demolished a church in front of its weeping congregation, as Muslim protesters egged on workers and branded the Christians "infidels".</p>
              <p>   Dozens in the 100-strong congregation wailed as a digger tore down the brick walls yesterday, with worshippers accusing the government of "criminalising our religion", in a sign of increasing intolerance in the world's largest Muslim-majority nation.</p>
              <p>   "My heart is aching and I feel numb watching my church collapse," Ms Megarenta Sihite, 46, said, "Our church can collapse but not our faith."</p>
              <p>   As the walls of the Taman Sari Batak Christian Protestant Church - at the centre of a planning row - crumbled, police in Bekasi city, near Jakarta, dispersed 200 Muslim women who sneaked onto the church land chanting Quranic verses.</p>
              <p>   Police said the partially built church did not have a legal building permit, while the congregation argued that the church had obtained 82 signatures of support from the community before building started, above the 60 required by law.</p>
              <p>   The Setara Insitute of Peace and Democracy says cases of intolerance in Indonesia are on the rise. Christians are among the main targets, along with worshippers who follow the Ahmadiyah and Shi'ite Islamic minority sects.</p>

              <p>1) This is probably one of the biggest misunderstood concepts of Christianity, even by many Christians themselves. Definitely believing in the Lord will grant the salvation promised to us, <strong>but we can lose that salvation if we do not demonstrate His love in our actions.</strong> As you said, the Lord has shown by example several times how we should help others, so if someone who believes in the Lord does not bother to follow His commands, then he or she is not being sincere to the Lord.</p>
              <p>2) I think it is ok to have opinions of others, as long as we don't impose our values or religious views on them. We should recognise that there is goodness in other religions, races and cultures.</p>
              <p>3) Yes, you are correct in your understanding of marriage. I don't have all the answers to a happy and enduring marriage, but safe to say that if a husband and wife gives themselves to each other completely in love, chances are that they will stay together even in times of great difficulty. They will also know what to do when faced with different situations. </p>

              <p>i like this attitude.   All religions exist for a

              <p>Yes, I'm a Catholic Christian. For me, it's quite sad when I hear how some Christians say "believe in Jesus or you will go to hell". The church has never believed this for the last 2,000 years - this only started appearing in the last few hundred years or so among some Christians.  </p>

              <p>The 10% income tithe that you are referring to was never a 'compulsory' thing to do by Christians throughout history, and only became a fairly recent practice in some churches today. If I'm not mistaken, this practice was more common in Judaism, along with sacrifice of animals like a lamb. </p>

              <p>I don't think it's possible to have a complete list as there are more than 30,000 Christian denominations worldwide. Having said this, they can be broadly categorised into 3 groups - Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants. </p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">The Catholic Christians are led by the Pope in the Vatican City, who are decendants of the original apostles from the time of Jesus Christ more than 2,000 years ago (Peter being the first Pope) . The Orthodox Christians are led by the Patriach of Constantinople in Turkey (I think), but are otherwise very similar to the Catholics in terms of beliefs and practice. The Protestant Christians include all the other Christians (Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists, megachurches, etc) and have their own independent structures and leaderships. </p>

              It is those false religions turning people away from God due to giving a very heavy burden to the lost sinners by requiring them to stop sinning and turn over a new leaf.

              <p>We all astral project unconiously when we sleep. </p>
              <p>basically there is no such thing as forbidden. astral projection related stuff like siliver cord is being served etc are mention in the bible </p>
              <p>why do u think buddist talk about meditation? why do u think the hindos mediate? </p>
              <p>mediation leads to astral projection if done right where many get a higher insight of what is really going on.</p>
              <p>you rather take instruction from someone leading the church rather then finding the answer from yourself? this someone u listen to is most likely afraid of losing power therefore forbiddening such act as they know as more people become awake the lesser power they have. which i assume is mostly tie down to reasons of money as well. </p>
              <p>who really wrote the bible? what state of mind are these people in when they wrote the bible?</p>
              <p>Astral projection lets u experience the truth yourself. you can even travel back to those time to witness the event unfold to have your doze of what really happened.</p>
              <p>I known people who are astral projector who are also very commited to their religion and to me, they are those who are truely having a real spirtual experience.</p>
              <p>for me i chose to stay labled as "free thinker" but i'm an astral projector myself.</p>

              <p>well is ok to dream but do you know anything about the mind split effect? whereby upon sleep and while in astral projection state you would end up having more then one mind? sometimes event that occur while dreaming isnt dreams at all. (i can go into deep details if asked)  </p>
              <p>There are also other aspect of dream like lucid dreaming </p>

              <p>The last thing i want to see is blind sheep advising blind sheeps. </p>
              <p>Reamember you are never forbidden of anything in life.</p>
              <p>What you do with your life and your soul is your very own right.</p>
              <p>However Karma do play a part in everything that is done. ( it does not mean i kill you mean next time you kill me) it's heavyily mixed with intention (accidentally kill?) and lesson that is needed to be learn and experienced. (choices of lessons is normally chose by your soul "the very you")</p>
