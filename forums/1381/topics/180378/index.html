The mark was to protect Cain against other people (strongly hinted, since the bible uses "anyone", "whoever" etc .. why didn't the bible use "anything" to include animals?).<br><br>Also Cain found a wife after the exile. I don't think Eve bore daughters and exiled them for Cain to find later right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>I think Eve did bear daughters. I dont know where Cain got his wife. Maybe have to check the lost books of Eden.<br><br>The mark might be to protect against descendants of Seth?</div>
