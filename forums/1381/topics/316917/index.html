I know most Christians have this desire, including those who are reading this now. What I want to emphasis is that we must have a schedule or a plan for it . Example, you can give tracts, write to others (testimony), give CDs (sermons or testimony). Take opportunity to include these materials when you send greeting cards on special occasions ( Birthdays, Christmas or Get Well Card ). Start Something.<br><br>Some years ago, I did asked the LORD what I will regret when I leave this earth. I want to quickly repent before it's too late. Immediately, after I asked the LORD...a collection of thoughts came to me. Thoughts of people going the other way (Hell) It was like telling me to treasure every opportunity to invite people around me to Christ.<br><br>Since then, I started giving out tracts and gradually friends joined me. After that, I tried to do it own a daily basis by giving it out to strangers along my journey to different places.<br><br>Proverbs 11:30 "He that winneth souls is wise."<br>Proverbs 10:1 "A wise son makes his father glad"<br><br>Even the book "Heaven is so real" emphasis on witnessing, spending time with the LORD, giving tithes, etc<br><br>Do encourage other Christians to invite others to JESUS. Don't be a silence Christian.<br><br>2.) Also, I want to encourage you on Proverbs 18:21 "Death and life are in the power of the tongue."<br><br>Recommended booklets<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.harrisonhouse.com/BookDetails.aspx?ISBN=0892740248">http://www.harrisonhouse.com/BookDetails.aspx?ISBN=0892740248</a><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.harrisonhouse.com/BookDetails.aspx?ISBN=1577943619">http://www.harrisonhouse.com/BookDetails.aspx?ISBN=1577943619</a><br><br>Be Blessed !   <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"><br></span></span></p></div>

              <p>Hi eternity thx for sharing.</p>
              <p>I'm a Christian who has been plagued with some anger and hatred over some people in power in Singapore whose lives are an insult to God(and no I'm perfectly functioning and not and never had hallucination before). I thought I was a man of God so I would be silent over the matter but I found that my silence is interpreted by them as a sign of more 'torture' and persecution to come my way.</p>
              <p>After a few year of being defamed, tortured(psychologically though it's taking toll on my physical health) and persecuted, God sometimes though not very often allow me to feel what other people feel literally. So I felt what other people felt though not often, though I never knew what they were thinking at all. Other times God allow me to know what's going to happen in the future mostly about me or member of my family but there was also about a fate of a nation at a war in 2006. And no I'm not delusional at all or mentally ill whatsoever. I just want to say to all Christians out there:<strong> When you follow Jesus Christ and put your faith in Him you should not break or disavowed your faith for other things or for people in power just for the sake of your safety.</strong></p>
              <p>And I don't think I'm psychic too because I know why but don't think anyone would believe me.</p>
              <p>May God who shone His face over the people of Israel, sons of Abraham, shine His face upon you, bless your live and protect you.</p>

              <p>Hi Breyton to me He is Christ, the Messiah who is also God. He is the faultless one too.</p>
              <p>I had a wake vision of Jesus Christ when I was in my 7th grade. I will not forget what I saw of Jesus. His face radiates immense white light so powerful that in the end of my trying to get a glimplse of what His face looked like hurted both of my eyeballs. The light that was coming from His face was so powerful that it enveloped His whole body so nothing but the light could be seen...</p>
              <p>I testify that my story is true.</p>
              <p>How do I know that it was Jesus that I saw? Well after God gave me powerful love for Him(Jesus), I asked to be allowed to see Jesus' face and straight away right then was given the vision (while I was laying on bed at night).<br> Too bad the love for Jesus didn't stay with me because I was given great love for Jesus only before I was given the vision. I was willing to give anything anything anything at all for Jesus because I felt that I loved Him very much.</p>
              <p>Now I know if you want anything on this life anything at all, LOVE GOD FIRST WITH ALL YOUR HEART. I never felt love for anyone that big than the love for my Jesus then. I realised that it was given rather than my own true feeling.</p>

              <p>Hi, i consider my understanding of Jesus as Christian and i try to keep it that way. But some facets of it are so different from modern day evangelical christianity. When u mention Jesus is GOD in flesh, not too different from mine too right?</p>
              <p>When i hear people saying GOD loves you, GOD loves the sinner but hates the sin, etc, my gut reaction is that of curiosity. Because GOD didnt say directly he loved sinners and hated the sin in them, but it was like Gandhi who said that.</p>
              <p>WIthin the Bible itself, over 600 verses describing GOD's wrath, much much much more than those that talk about His love. I find that today, people are asking too much of "How can a loving God send anyone to hell" but rather should start asking "Why does a holy God take anyone to heaven?" I think modern christianity has really misrepresented GOD, not that He is totally angry, but just that the less favourable aspect is conveniently left out.</p>

              <p>Hi there, my understanding of who Yeshua is has definitely
              deviated from christianity and the churches understanding of who He
              is. Yeshua is Yahweh in the flesh.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, it is definitely deviated. Just try to entertain my curiousity... may I know how do you derive your understanding? Is it based on the teaching of any religion?</p>
              <p>I am not going to say anything about it as M&amp;P put it, I am theologically moron too. In fact the concept of Trinity is quite beyond the little wisdom I have. But I do try my best to understand and belive it.</p>

              <p> I find
                      that today, people are asking too much of "How can a loving God
                      send anyone to hell" but rather should start asking "Why does a
                      holy God take anyone to heaven?" I think modern christianity has
                      really misrepresented GOD, not that He is totally angry, but just
                      that the less favourable aspect is conveniently left out.</p>

              <p>I agree with you. Why do Christians think that they will all go to Heaven? Because in the bible, it says we are saved by faith and faith alone - no works. Also, they believed that all sins (past, present and future) are forgiven and they are auto righteous in front of God and there is no more condemnation. Otherwise it is an insult to Jesus who die on the cross for us.</p>
              <p>Well, all above is true except what is faith to you? Read JAS 2:14-26 which I think will give you an answer.</p>
              <p>Read MT 7:21-27 (the True Disciple) and LK 6:46-49 and you know that Jesus is warning that not all will go Heaven automatically.</p>
              <p>Jesus gave us a very clear picture in MT
                                              25:31-46 and notice He never says Christians / Non-Christians or Believers / Non-Believers instead, He says Goat and Sheeps. WHY?</p>
              <p>As you said, "the less favourable aspect is conveniently left out".</p>

              <p>obviously many do not know who is yeshua or they will not say...nvm</p>
              <p>many who claims they know him will be denined by the christ himself.many who claims to have visions of "God" re read the bible and understand that the bible is something like an instruction manual and the manufactuerer is away for the moment. also at this point do recall that satan even changes himself into an angel of LIGHT in order that he might deceive.</p>
              <p>Know that Yodh Heh Wah Heh is your God and his only begotten SON the christ is your bridge to Yodh Heh Wah Heh.</p>
