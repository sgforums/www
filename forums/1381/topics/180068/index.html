            <div class='col-md body'>God seems unfair to many many people. More than what Christians would think. I am not targeting Christians but since Christians believe in a God, I write in this forum. I find that the Christian explanation of suffering is a bit inadequate. God is in control right? Then how come God allow people to suffer? Even allow good Christians to suffer?<br><br>What's worse is the attitude of some Christians to people who suffer. They think that the person is a sinner so he suffers. They think that the person has no faith so he suffers. They think that Christians must be rich &amp; prosperous &amp; healed. Sometimes a Christian can be so under pressure also not to mention non Christian. In this world there is so much suffering but why God still allow it?<br><br>Sometimes i have so much anger towards God. I feel that why can't i have anger at Him? Is He going to send me to hell for this? Then He must be an unfeeling God! Why worship such a God? What's the need for sin cleansing when i am already suffering so much thru no fault of my own? What sin have i committed to go thru all these? Why must God pick on people like me? What have i done that others have not done?<br><br>Can anyone pls explain the problem of suffering? Are Christians lying to themselves? Is God a liar? Is God only caring about His Ownself? At least Buddhism has a good explanation abt suffering. What we sow in our past lives is what we reap now. I can better identify with it. Bcos no explanation by God as to why i suffer! Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For a start, Who says God is fair?<br><br>In the Bible,<br>God is righteous,<br>God is perfect,<br>God is good,<br>God is able<br><br>But did not say God is fair.<br><br>I mean, If God is fair, should Jesus who knew no sin, go about doing good deeds, healing the sicks, suffered those many toture and died on the cross (one of the worst, if not the worst form of dealth penalty at that time)?<br><br>If the daddy prepares the food, called out to his children to come and eat, if the children decided not to and feels hungry, cna he/she blame the father for it?<br>The same, God loves us and want to give us good things, things that are good for us, may not be what we want, but nevertheless good things. If we refused to accept them, can we blame God? (ok, at least the person who blame God beleived He exist, don't think anyone can blame someone he don't believed to exist, right?)<br><br>Having said all these, here is what God is, God loves us, but God is righteous and perfect, we had all fallen and therefore by ourselves cannot approach God.<br>That's why He had to paid for our debts of sins, Jesus at the cross fully and completely satisfied the requirement demanded by a righteous and perfect God in the area of sins, that now we can have full confidence and assurance that after we, being purified by the blood of Christ, can approached the loving Father God. And God can now righteously declared, their sins and lawless deeds I remember no more.<br><br>God had paid the penalty of our sins, he had freely given us the gift of salvation, do you want to receive it? I had, you need to make your choice.<br><br><blockquote><br>Hebrew 10:10-23<br>10And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<br>11And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.<br>12But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,<br>13then to wait until his enemies should be made a stool for his feet.<br>14For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.<br>15And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,<br>16"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds,"<br>17then he adds, "I will remember their sins and their misdeeds no more."<br>18Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.19Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,<br>20by the new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh,<br>21and since we have a great priest over the house of God,<br>22let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.<br>23Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful;Since our confidence is in Christ (and not in goats and calves), let us now draw near to God with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To ICanOnlyHope:<br><br>The response that I will give you may sound harsh, but I pray you read it with an open mind because God loves you and wants to do great wonders in your life if YOU will let Him.<br><br>First from your post, I gather that you do not believe in God, then you move on to saying that you are angry with God. Stop this hypocrisy, either you believe God is real or you don't. Please. Why do you bring God into the picture when most of the time you deny His existence. When things are going well with you, do you praise God and thank Him for your provision? Many people who deny the existence of God are quick to acknowledge His existence when tragedy strikes them.<br><br>My next question to you is this, you who complain about a supposed irrational or malevolent God: "Which God are you talking about? The actual God who reveals Himself in the Bible? Or a god of your own un-biblical teaching or human imagination?"<br><br>What does the Bible actually say about our modern society and human suffering? First, it tells us that our world today is not "GodÂ’s world," Notice: "But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them" (2 Corinthians 4:3Â–4). So the "god" of this world is Satan the devil!<br><br>From the book of Job, we see that God sometimes allows satan to afflict human beings. Only after he had suffered and was deeply humbled did Job say: "I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees You. Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:5Â–6).<br><br>Realise this: Human life apart from the true God is futile. This may seem "cruel" or "unfair" to those who lack understanding of the awesome power and glory that God has in mind for those who truly serve and obey Him. But it is often the only way human beings are willing and able to learn. Another thing that is often overlooked is in the bible is that God specifically mentions time and time again that He will intervene and bring about punishments to nations and people who refuse to OBEY Him, but if we do, He promises blessings. (Leviticus 26:1Â–13).<br><br>Why? You might ask. Simple, because God deals with nations and people to teach us needed lessons. "For whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives" (Hebrews 12:6). God will intervene so that we will learn the lessons to finally fulfill His great purpose. He does not do this in spite, but in genuine outflowing concern to help a people who have been totally obsessed with "me-ism" and materialism. He wants us to wake up and be willing to genuinely seek our Creator and fulfill the supreme purpose for which we are drawing breath.<br><br>There is a cause for every effect. The breaking of GodÂ’s great spiritual law is the basic cause of all human suffering. Once we have that one fact straight, and live by it, the amount of human suffering will become minuscule!<br><br>Note that God does not specifically pick on you. Do you think that as Christians God does not also chasten us and pull us up from time to time when He sees that we are going in the wrong direction? Suffering is not limited to the unbeliever only. God is no respecter of men, but it is your attitude to suffering that will determine your outcome.<br><br>But you claim not to have sinned? Are you sure? It is strange that you should mention about sowing and reaping because the bible also talks about this:<br><br>Galatians6:7<br>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.<br><br>Have a good think about your past and things you have done, what you sow, you are now reaping. It is a law of the earth. You may think that you have not done anything wrong, but have you really been righteous? If not come before the Lord and repent.<br><br>You call God a liar, I would leave you with this verse:<br><br>Romans 3:3-5<br>3 For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect? 4 Certainly not! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar. As it is written:<br><br>Â“ That You may be justified in Your words,<br>And may overcome when You are judged.Â”[a]<br><br>5 But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust who inflicts wrath? (I speak as a man.)<br><br>Also see Numbers 23:19 Â“God is not a man, that He should lie,Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?<br><br>God tells us in Romans 6:23: "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Sin automatically brings sorrow, suffering and, eventually, the second death in the Lake of Fire, unless it is bitterly repented of (Revelation 21:8 ). As we read in 1 John 3:4: "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law" (KJV).  For GodÂ’s lawÂ—the Ten CommandmentsÂ—is like the law of gravity. GodÂ’s spiritual law "works" whether you believe in it or not!<br></div>

(like a wake-up call) so just have faith that something good will come out of it.<br><br>Our God is a God of love and he definately does not want to see anyone of us suffer. It pains him to see us in agony. However because we were given free will to choose our paths, sometimes we just take the short-cut and decide to stray away from the light. But never forget that God will always be there for us. All he needs from us is the faith as small as a mustard seed to believe in him. We ourselves have to do some soul-searching to identify our faults. Its so simple to start pointing fingers but have we actually looked at ourselves?<br><br>No father in his right mind will feed poison to his own flesh &amp; blood right?

Is God unjust who inflicts wrath? (I speak as a man.)<br><br>Also see Numbers 23:19 Â“God is not a man, that He should lie,Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?<br><br>God tells us in Romans 6:23: "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Sin automatically brings sorrow, suffering and, eventually, the second death in the Lake of Fire, unless it is bitterly repented of (Revelation 21:8 ). As we read in 1 John 3:4: "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law" (KJV).  For GodÂ’s lawÂ—the Ten CommandmentsÂ—is like the law of gravity. GodÂ’s spiritual law "works" whether you believe in it or not!<br></div></blockquote>I believe in God. I find the believe then have blessings part ridiculous. It doesnt mean when one believes, one is spared all trouble or even death. I find contradictions here. You also said Christians suffer, so why believe in a good God? Why always point to whether people have sinned or not? It's like Job being accused of sin when ALL have sinned. So why single out me for sin? Am i a bigger sinner than you? You have not sinned? If God treats you well, why can't He treat me well also since we are all sinners? This i cannot reconcile. Grace i cannot reconcile. Why grace shown to some &amp; not to others?</div>

Each of us have our tests. But know this, though He slay me, YET I WILL STILL PRAISE HIM. What about all those who have gone before you? Who have faced persection, trials, torments, who have even died for their faith, are you any more than them? The hope that I have in the LORD is of the Kingdom to come, not in this world. This is the faith that we are called to have. Like Sadrach, Meshach and Abed_Nego when they were to be put to death for not bowing down to the idol of King Nebuchadnezzar, they said this "but if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the image you have set up..."<br>Daniel 3:18.<br><br>Are you much better than Job of whom God says : "Have you considered My servant Job, that there is not like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?" Job 1:8. Can God say this of you? Yet even in all his affliction, Job did not speak against God.<br><br>You want the blessing, but you do not want to give God the appropriate reverance. Like I said before, what you sow, you will also reap, can you answer that you have not sown bad things, not just in deed, but in your speech. For in proverbs 18:21 Is says this: Death and life are in the power of the tongue. Have you been speaking death in your own life?<br><br>You find the believe then the blessings part ridiculous, then you do not have understanding of God's ways and His ordanances. Every blessing that God has every given to man has been conditional, if you obey Him and follow His commandments and keep His ways will you be blessed. Can you say you are like Job and have kept all His ways and His commandments?<br><br>God has every right to judge everyone of us, in the way He sees fit, if you know who God is, then you will know what He is about. But ask yourself this, is your heart right with the Lord? Grace is there for all, but you have to reach out and receive it for yourself. Which necesscitates you reaching out to God in repentance to receive the grace. It is like GOd has given you a gift, but you refuse to unwrap it and use it.<br><br>To say that i have not sinned would be a lie, but when I sin, I repent so that I keep my relationship close with God. To God sin is sin, there is no big sin and no small sin, all sin is sin.<br><br>Read proverbs and consider the ways of the Lord, scour the bible for your answer and come before the Lord and repent. Rend your heart and come before the Lord with a contrite heart. Are you more than Job? Who in his humility dare not speak out against God?<br><br>Never is it said that if you believe, that you will not have any troubles what so ever, but God did say that He will be with you through all your troubles.<br><br></div>

Perhaps bcos we are an affluent country with plenty of stuffs &amp; food. Nowadays teachings tend to focus on motivational, prosperity, healing types. We are not worrying abt persecution or suffering. People who are suffering seem to be rejected by the society as a whole not just in church. Maybe not so bad as wolves in sheep's clothing but the general environment is like America, a first world country, so people tend to look up to status, enjoyment, money, health, luxuries etc. So the church also have to preach that to attract followers maybe.</div>

When Jesus came, you realise those people he healed, were beggers, blind,handicapped people,adultress. He came to the "sickly", the social rejects. He didn't come to serve those who are "healthy", but to bring righteousness and the gifts of no condamnation to the sinners.<br><br>Now Jesus can heal just because He is Christ? God's Son?<br><br>in John 14:12<br><strong>The truth is, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works</strong>, because I am going to be with the Father. <strong>You can ask for anything in my name, and I will do it, because the work of the Son brings glory to the Father. Yes, ask anything in my name, and I will do it!</strong><br><br>Far greater things! But what are we lacking even as Christians? The faith. The world tells us today, Don't put your hopes up, don't hold your hopes high, or you'll suffer a greater fall. So where is the faith?<br><br>In Mark 5:36;<br>But Jesus ignored their comments and said to Jairus,<strong>"Don't be afraid. Just trust me.</strong><br><br>In Mark 5:34;<br>Jesus said to the woman in the crowd who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years: <strong>"Daughter, your faith has made you well.</strong> Go in peace. You have been healed."<br><br>Again the main ingrediant here is faith. Jesus did not say "Woman, your good works have made you well." or "Your constant tithing to the church and charitable acts have made you well." But its her faith! Faith and hope is the essence of good things to come. Abraham had faith and a child, Issac was borne unto his wife, whose womb was barren since young. Our Father does not do just natural things, but He is good with things that are supernatural, things people called "Miracle". But we need to believe and hope for like a child.<br><br>I myself am praying everyday for my gal, over a condition she suffers now and then. We've been to hospitals and clinics, apparently, they think it's not serious enough for medical attention, saying that its only mild now. Its causing her great pain sometimes. So I've given up on doctors, but my faith is with the Lord. Because I know He will never fail. ; )<br><br><span style="color: blue;"></span><span style="color: blue;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We must recognise that in life we cannot avoid adversity. We can grow stronger through adversity. We will never figure out the right way to do things until we learn how not to do it in the first place. Adversity or 'sufferings' exists will be here to stay.<br><br>The key to the problem is our attitude towards it. Many times we are quick to put the blame others for the situation we find ourselves in. We blame others for the misfortunes in life we face. The first step to our problems is to take responsibility of our own actions. We must learn to bear the consequences of our decisions.<br><br>We should also look at 'sufferings' as an opportunity to grow. But we must be careful to handle adversity well. Anne Morrow Lindbergh said of suffering.<br><blockquote>I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught, all the world would be wise, since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning, understanding, patience, love, openness and the willingness to remain vulnerable. - Anne Morrow Lindbergh</blockquote>It is natural to react in anger to the frustrations in life.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ICanOnlyHope:</div><div class="quote_body">There are many many who are going thru difficult times now. My suffering is minute compared to what some are facing, but even so, it's so painful, how much more those who are suffering worse? Where is God?<br><br>Sometimes life can be very lonely without anyone for support. You won't understand till you face the same situation. There are many many who are facing loneliness &amp; rejection &amp; sickness &amp; pain. Maybe on their sick bed. Maybe in their wheelchairs. Maybe incapacitated. So many lonely scenarios. Where is God then in their situations?</div></blockquote>__________<br><br>Hi there.<br><br>Indeed, this world is so full of deceit and suffering.  "But God is everywhere."<br><br>Tsk...Contradiction isnt it ? God is everywhere but even Christians are not spared to suffer.  I remembered the time i first came to Christ, my goodie old friend told me this sentence : "In Christ, you will find things contradictory to what you previously believed". I didnt get it then - what in the world he means ?<br><br>Then slowly, i learned.<br><br>Through a very hard way though. I suffered in pain as many times, if not much more than when i was not in Christ.  Yes, i also asked many times....where are you, Abba Father ??!<br><br>Sufferings. So painful.....yes, its true....brought me on my knees at times. Cried, no one answered.  Hammered the door of my heart...no one...so alone. Disease of the heart, yes i have - spiritually and physically. It happened so many times, i lost count.<br><br>But it also dawn to me one day, that when i am in pain. I did not seek God.  I wasnt still and know He is God. I didnt even "want" to know because all i care about is whether He is THERE when He is actually always HERE.  So... as i crawled, i sit still and prayed. cannot remember what i prayed, but remembered clearly the comfort words of "Here i am".<br><br>Does He need to do more ? Nope....my tears just flowed uncontrollably and my pain is gone.  Whatever sufferings i had or anticipated to have seems so dense compared to the suffering of His Only Son.  Seeking Him when i am in pain seems to give me more strength to deal with similar sufferings. Over the years, such sufferings turned to happiness in return. Why is that so ? Because He wants us to be happy out of this suffering domain through a journey we learn. To know what is the truth. Salvation does not guarantee the end of suffering in this world. On the contrary, the evil one attacks relentlessly as you put your foot forward for more of His kingdom.<br><br>But the truth you learned in the process is priceless, nothing can buy, and the evil one cannot steal.  If the Lord gives you instant solution all the time, we will never learn.<br><br>Suffering ? Seek Him. Tell Him about your suffering. He is faithful. He always listens. On the contrary, we are impatient seekers and listeners.<br><br>He is Here. All the time.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What exactly may I ask is so <span style="font-style: italic;">bad</span> about suffering?<br><br>I don't this as a person who belittles pain or has never experience pain and loss, pain hurts and that's what it is.<br><br>But I need to wonder, what exactly makes it so unfair and bad. It's only unfair and bad if this world <span style="font-style: italic;">is all that is</span>. And if this world is all that is and ever will be then we don't need God in the picture at all. But somehow I don't think so.<br><br>It seems to me that only if a God exists then suffering should ever make any good sense. And why should suffering pass over good people if it was a bad thing? We would expect it to hit good people as well.<br><br>But in the end it will make sense, to the point that nobody can really say anything about it. But I wonder, is all suffering really that bad? Or do some people turn out stronger and more then before. What about Teresa Chan, the blind and deaf lady who is probably far more of a braver, compassionate and living person then so many of us who don't have her kind of suffering. I don't know. I know I don't like to suffer but it is precisely because there is suffering that I believe that God is fair.<br><br>If the world is so messed up and there is no suffering when we are far away from who we are supposed to be... now that seems to me to be something very wrong. It is precisely because now is a state that we should not be that we suffer... but this suffering is never without purpose.</div>
