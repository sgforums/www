              <p>I've actually noticed that most people with exceptional wisdom or intelligence have trouble accepting god.

In so many cases, these great minds have either been persecuted for their alleged "heresy" or silently acquiesced in fear. I've seen it too, in my professors, teachers and colleagues, many of whom grew up in fully religious families but strayed away as they matured cognitively. Other exceptional personalities like Mother Teresa (as seen in another article on this forum) had profound doubts about god. Even numerous stars in Hollywood (the true theatrical talents, not attention whores like paris hilton) have turned to other religions. </p>
              <p>I speak through personal experience because I was once christian but i felt that something was inherently wrong with the fundamentals of the religion.

              <p>This is an extremely good point and it will take alot of time just to disseminate the points accurately.</p>
              <p>I think u are viewing it in a very "simplistic" manner.</p>
              <p>Does your statement  to take account
              of a complex range of social, economic and historical factors?<br> <br> Linking religious belief and intelligence in this way could reflect a 
              dangerous trend, developing a simplistic characterisation of religion as
              primitive, which - while we are trying to deal with very complex issues 
              of religious and cultural pluralism - is perhaps not the most helpful
              response.</p>
              <p>I personally share the views of this man, who was, they say, a fairly 
              smart guy: <br> <br> "A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the 
              manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty - 
              it is
              this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious 
              attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man.
               (Albert
              Einstein) "<br> <br> "I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have
               expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called 
              religious
              then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so 
              far as our science can reveal it. (Albert Einstein, 1954) "<br> <br> "I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of
               what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and 
              actions of
              human beings. (Albert Einstein) "</p>
              <p>And all must remember that "with faith comes hope, and with facts 
              comes knowledge."</p>
              <p>I think its not about believing in God as in christianity's god per se, but believing that there is something of higher being or intelligence.  =)</p>

              <p>thanks for the much appreciated excerpts! What einstein (and I assume you) espouses perfectly encapsulates my agnostic views on religion and spirituality. There is certainly the omnipotent marvel that is nature, or what einstein calls "the orderly harmony of what exists" and its sheer scale.</p>
