              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Firstly, thank you for the comment! Yup, you make a good point, and i almost thought i had been caught(in my own logic), until i re-read my original post. --&gt;<br><br>Not to argue semantics with you, but let me re-cap. I do believe i said that:<br>~Basically we don't know enough to say "god doesn't exist", AND "god does exist".<br>Both. What did i base that on?<br>~Personally i feel that since we haven't even travelled to Mars yet (which is the nearest planet by FAR), or even discovered any TRACE of extraterrestrial life(not to mention actual aliens),<br><br>therefore, we cannot yet affirmatively say "There is no god" or "There is a god".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">--------NOW, i definitely see the point of your disastisfaction with my comment. Your reading of my meaning is basically correct, but perhaps your logic to reach your conclusion is a little too.. absolute. There is not just ONE way to take what i said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br>==&gt; Although it may certainly seem like I'm implying that Religion is misguided, I haven't actually gone that far.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I'm saying, "nobody can be 100% sure". And that THUS, we should all be tolerant of what others believe in. (I.E: NOBODY CAN/SHOULD SAY THAT THE OTHER IS WRONG, catch my drift?)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br>And in the first place, i don't think that any religion is about proving to the rest of the world that "Our religion is correct, is absolute, you must believe"...<br><br>~~~~~~~~~IN A NUTSHELL,<br>-Yes, i said we know too little to confirm ANY side.<br>-However, my saying that (E.G.) "Christians or Non-christians both cannot be 100% sure that christ/god exists or not", IS NOT EQUAL TO saying Christians are "misguided"!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-In fact, if you want to take an extreme reading of my words(as you have), you could even say that I'm taking Christianity's side, by telling the Evolutionists: "Hey, you can't be sure either!" (that there is not some supreme being looking over/guiding us.)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">To dispute your use of the [Elephant Analogy] in this case,</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">i believe that i would actually be ANOTHER blind man, telling the other 3 that "Hey guys, we ALL can't see, we ALL can't be 100% sure, so why don't we just leave it at that for now?" :)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Come on, mate, since when is saying "We all don't know enough", equal to implying "Hehe, actually i know everything", or "Hehe, Side B is actually foolish?" Isn't that your own suspicion or defensiveness, showing through?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br>Again, i hope this makes sense to you and others. I am not arguing for the sake of picking a fight, i simply explain myself more clearly so nobody will misinterpret my words, and think that I am taking sides or belittling any side.<br>I'M NOT.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">hi mate, </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">don't take me too seriously on this account. It was tongue in cheek as i responded to your original post, any malice detected was totally unintended. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">your position is a novel one to me, or at least the name was. But upon further reflection, it seems that you argue for a middle ground, that seeks to remain politically correct as much as possible. Principally speaking, I've no problems with this position but philosophically speaking, it lapses into trivialism (well, eventually anyway). Arguable, but well it seems that's where most middle grounds usually go. </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">no denial about that after all, truth is absolute isn't it? Any denial of truth being absolute ends up refuting itself. Perhaps there's not just one way, but in positing more than one ways, or maybe too many ways, one ends up saying nothing (or again, trivialism). </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">hmm... truth by definition is exclusive. The logical implication of religion A claiming to be the truth would be implying that other religions (worldviews) are not true, especially when they make no pretensions to mask that claim and on certain tenets that contradict one another. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Secondly, would you not think that your view which advocates tolerance strives to be the absolutist one in promoting tolerance or neutrality as the way to go? </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">if it seems extreme, i do apologize. I try not to obfuscate things here and to reason simply but this is where simple reasoning leads matters to. I try not to argue semantics, but that might be where the key to sussing out the truth lies, not in meaningless semantic debates, but in using language to construct meaning and to reason. The postmodern rejects reasoning but employs his reasoning ability in doing so (self refuting). </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">not trying to be funny cuz God knows i can't be funny to save my life but if you were blind (as in the analogy), how would you be sure that the other 3 guys (or 1 of them) are actually blind too? Could they (or one of them) not be duping you by claiming to blind but actually possesses sight? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Even if my point doesn't make sense to you (and i hope it does), the point i hope to make would be NOT to milk an analogy to death because they're mere representations of the real thing (the point / argument) and not the thing itself. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But back to the Elephant analogy itself, the thing is, by claiming to be blind yourself (your view), you have lost all grasp on truth (because you don't see and can't be sure others don't see. In fact, if others see and you can't, you'll be doing yourself a disservice by not choosing to believe them), which is why agnosticism and skepticism (again, arguably) is self refuting. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In trying to be neutral, your view has just shot itself in the foot and can't even lift off the ground to begin with. Am i promoting intolerance? Absolutely not, don't get me wrong. But i suspect the issues go deeper than that. </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">think you might have some problematic elements in your statements -
              how would you define exceptional? Does Einstein count? Even if
              these people who are intelligent have trouble believing in the
              existence of God, does that indicate the presence of a causative
              relationship between belief and intelligence? Could it not be
              possible that there are other extraneous reasons that
              perpetuate the absence of belief? E.g. pride? Moral? Self desire /
              whim/ fancy? Immense desire for self autonomy? Lack of
              exposure? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For that matter, i'm not sure what qualifies as intelligent in your
              case but I would remind one of the modern day examples of Francis
              Collins (current director of the National Institute of Health in
              the US and previous head of the Human Genome Project), John Lennox
              (maths prof at Oxford), John Polkinghorne (Cambridge prof), Richard
              Swinburne, Alister McGrath, the many creation scientists and
               who hold PhDs (if those are indicators of intelligence),
              etc... I mean, there's no lack of intelligent people who also
              believe in God. So what's your point? Argument from numbers - that
              there are MORE people who don't believe in God than those who do?
              Argument from authority - that because these more intelligent
              individuals don't believe, therefore unlikely to be true? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Christianity has always been counter cultural. Then and now. Maybe
              some thing is inherently wrong, or maybe you don't understand the
              "religion" well enough, maybe you weren't taught
              properly. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Christianity is not egocentric, it's being concerned primarily
              about God, followed by the welfare of others, e.g. other-centred.
              You see this teaching peppered throughout Scriptures. Being saved
              is nothing one should boast about (Ephesians 2:8-9), One of the
              characteristics of a member of the kingdom of God, a true believer
              not a cultural Christian, is that found in Matthew 5:3 where he
              realizes that if not for God, he would remain spiritually bankrupt.
              Thus the "assuredness" that is derived from this state, does not
              come from the self but rightfully from God, for being found in
              Christ, - "if not for the grace of God, I would not be saved at
              all. Therefore i should not congratulate myself too much but live
              out the result of my saving faith" </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It's also not the comforting words or the companionship that make
              one truly love God. There are people who do not enjoy such
              privileges and in fact, suffer much for the cause of Christ - think
              of the early Christians (thrown into lions' den for not renouncing
              their faith, where is the comfort in that??), Paul the Apostle, the
              nameless missionaries who tread into unknown territory away from
              the comfort of their church, or the countless martyrs who are
              gunned down for holding onto their profession of the faith in
              conflict situations, myself, etc... so how? At any rate, your
              question will only filter out cultural Christians from true
              believers (1 Corinthians 11:19).</p>

              <p>second, i've also demonstrated contrary to your argument that there are people who are sufficiently educated (intelligent?) and have no problem believing in God. </p>
              <p>third, intelligence has been also found to co exist with pride. Thus my hypothesis isn't demonstrably misguided as well. </p>
              <p>fourth, IF (and it's a huge one) intelligence is observed in non believers, does that indicate the presence of a causative relationship for non belief? For sure, it wouldn't contradict the Christian worldview that God dispenses talents and abilities freely for everyone, including those who don't believe. </p>

              <p>1st qn - impossible by definition, true believers don't hold to any delusion and the God who begins their salvation will see it right thru to the end.</p>
              <p> 2nd statement - your assertion to prove. </p>
              <p>3rd qn - you might be reading too much. my simple answer to you here is both a priori and a posteriori - in that before one can truly bank the whole thrust of their faith in the atoning work of Christ on the cross, one has to come to assent that he is spiritually and morally bankrupt and this can only happen through a revelation from the Holy Spirit. </p>
              <p>In continuing from my point earlier in my reply, it is from this reservoir of gratefulness for the work of Christ that the true believer lives out the result of his saving faith as demonstrated by the good works for which he had been prepared to do (Ephesians). </p>

              <p>Brilliance not questioned. But what's your point? forgive my
              denseness, but a wealth of things can also be inferred...</p>
              <p>Yeah well, other common denominators that could emerge are their
              skin color, gender and their heritage, among many other
              commonalities. So what else would you like to propose as your
              hypothesis? </p>
              <p>So, first of all, it hasnt been conclusively proven or argued
              validly by your kind self that intelligence is the primary factor,
              as suggested in the thesis statement of your thread
              title. </p>
              <p>second, i've also demonstrated contrary to your argument that
              there are people who are sufficiently educated (intelligent?) and
              have no problem believing in God. </p>
              <p>third, intelligence has been also found to co exist with pride.
              Thus my hypothesis isn't demonstrably misguided as well. </p>
              <p>fourth, IF (and it's a huge one) intelligence is observed in non
              believers, does that indicate the presence of a causative
              relationship for non belief? For sure, it wouldn't contradict the
              Christian worldview that God dispenses talents and abilities freely
              for everyone, including those who don't believe. </p>
              <p>Because all the abovementioned names i've chosen are all
              prolific published authors who have written on their personal
              beliefs and opened them up for scholastic and ecclesiastical
              scrutiny. </p>
              <p>so who (or what) is the final arbiter of truth? </p>
              <p>on this point, it remains to be seen, but how is this question
              not applicable to whichever worldview you profess? </p>
              <p>my take is that as far as i can tell, i find the Christianity i
              profess to be sound and rational and able to be understood, thus I
              would argue I've been taught properly (which is not entirely
              accurate too cuz i haven't been taught in the commonly understood
              didactic sense). </p>
              <p>1st qn - impossible by definition, true believers don't hold to
              any delusion and the God who begins their salvation will see it
              right thru to the end.</p>
              <p> 2nd statement - your assertion to prove. </p>
              <p>3rd qn - you might be reading too much. my simple answer to you
              here is both a priori and a posteriori - in that before one can
              truly bank the whole thrust of their faith in the atoning work of
              Christ on the cross, one has to come to assent that he is
              spiritually and morally bankrupt and this can only happen through a
              revelation from the Holy Spirit. </p>
              <p>In continuing from my point earlier in my reply, it is from this
              reservoir of gratefulness for the work of Christ that the true
              believer lives out the result of his saving faith as demonstrated
              by the good works for which he had been prepared to do
              (Ephesians). </p>
              <p>yes, mental instability is a problem that is not specific to any
              religion type or the lack of it ... consider Hitler, Stalin and Pol
              Pot. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">"Its not
              difficult to see how people who are sufficiently fearful of
              Christianity's famous threat of eternal hell to the point of
              hysteria would martyr themselves." </span></p>
              <p>Contrary to this statement, i don't think there's any teaching
              in Christianity that encourages martyrdom (short of misquotes e.g.

              <p>Its foolhardy to posit skin color and heritage as bases for rejection of christianity. Religion is after all a major tenet of culture. The Tibetans would certainly find it harder to believe than say, Singaporeans. Lets not digress, the hypothesis after all was the relationship between intelligence and faith.</p>

              <p>Do not confuse the title of the thread with my thesis statement. I never gave a thesis statement. What I had, in my opening entry, was the hypothesis that intelligence cannot coexist with faith derived from the extraordinary propensity for exceptional personalities to renounce their beliefs.

"</em></span></span></p>
              <p>You have given possibilities, not demonstrations. Like what i said about mother teresa, who knew? The shortfall on your side is that belief can never be proven, whereas doubt is unquestionable. </p>

              <p>And has all the scrutiny sympathised with their views? I'm sure richard dawkins would have much to say. Do not appeal to the authority of mere academic writing.</p>

              <p>Sound and rational only to you perhaps? Surely you wont make the ridiculous mistake of argument from something as subjective as personal rationalism on a topic such as religion?</p>
