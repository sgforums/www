              <p>I've actually noticed that most people with exceptional wisdom
              or intelligence have trouble accepting god. I'm sure most of you
              will have read about tensions between the Church and brilliant
              scientists, mathematicians, philosophers and thinkers throughout
              history. In so many cases, these great minds have either been
              persecuted for their alleged "heresy" or silently acquiesced in
              fear. I've seen it too, in my professors, teachers and colleagues,
              many of whom grew up in fully religious families but strayed away
              as they matured cognitively. Other exceptional personalities like
              Mother Teresa (as seen in another article on this forum) had
              profound doubts about god. Even numerous stars in Hollywood (the
              true theatrical talents, not attention whores like paris hilton)
              have turned to other religions. </p>
              <p>I speak through personal experience because I was once christian
              but i felt that something was inherently wrong with the
              fundamentals of the religion. Truthfully ask yourself, take away
              the comforting words of your church mates and pastors, take away
              the companionship of the congregation, take away the egocentric
              self-assuredness of "being saved". Now do you still TRULY love your
              God?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>(to all my christian friends out there, I sincerely
              apologise if you are offended, these are genuine contemplations of
              mine and I want to seek your opinions with absolutely no
              ill-intent)</em></p>

              <p>In my humble personal opinion,</p>
              <p>A religion is a meaningful, significant, and important medium to transmit values and philosophies.</p>
              <p>A religious community also serves as a focal point and a key node for the culture, heritage, and belonging, of a person.</p>
              <p>Therefore,</p>
              <p>Until the day that we as human beings can find something else which can serve these purposes better, we need accept, and in fact, cherish and encourage this form of spirituality and culture.</p>
              <p>Whether someone believes in Abrahamaic religion, or believes in Amazonian traditional jungle religion, the main basic points and substance is the same.</p>
              <p>Thusly,</p>
              <p>I do not see a chance that religion can be replaced.</p>
              <p>It is true that certain aspects of religious teachings contradict rationality.</p>
              <p>However, the human spirit, human emotion, human flesh, and human heart, does not consist of rationality alone.</p>
              <p>If you notice in some parts of the world, some people may abandon their "old religion" but they pick up new ones such as, Scientology, or even Buddhism.</p>
              <p>This is because people seek and search.</p>
              <p>For me personally,</p>
              <p>My understanding and my relationship with my religion is this,</p>
              <p>It is to help me to become a better person.</p>
              <p>This is not much different with doing Yoga, going to gym, taking up music, and so on. Religion is something to me that can do something to my mind, to my personality, and to my character. I know I have many faults and flaws, and I need the thousand-year-old philosophies to help me to become a better person.</p>

              <p>In my humble personal opinion,</p>
              <p>A religion is a meaningful, significant, and important medium to
              transmit values and philosophies.</p>
              <p>A religious community also serves as a focal point and a key
              node for the culture, heritage, and belonging, of a person.</p>
              <p>Therefore,</p>
              <p>Until the day that we as human beings can find something else
              which can serve these purposes better, we need accept, and in fact,
              cherish and encourage this form of spirituality and culture.</p>
              <p>Whether someone believes in Abrahamaic religion, or believes in
              Amazonian traditional jungle religion, the main basic points and
              substance is the same.</p>
              <p>Thusly,</p>
              <p>I do not see a chance that religion can be replaced.</p>
              <p>It is true that certain aspects of religious teachings
              contradict rationality.</p>
              <p>However, the human spirit, human emotion, human flesh, and human
              heart, does not consist of rationality alone.</p>
              <p>If you notice in some parts of the world, some people may
              abandon their "old religion" but they pick up new ones such as,
              Scientology, or even Buddhism.</p>
              <p>This is because people seek and search.</p>
              <p>For me personally,</p>
              <p>My understanding and my relationship with my religion is
              this,</p>
              <p>It is to help me to become a better person.</p>
              <p>This is not much different with doing Yoga, going to gym, taking
              up music, and so on. Religion is something to me that can do
              something to my mind, to my personality, and to my character. I
              know I have many faults and flaws, and I need the thousand-year-old
              philosophies to help me to become a better person.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Completely agree with you. That religion is a cornerstone of spirituality, morality and culture is unequivocal and only a fool would challenge that notion. I take issue only with the notion of a 'one true omnipotent God' that demands unquestionable loyalty with the threat of eternal suffering. Nothing against with religion in general.</p>

              <p>Im not one to suffer fools. So i'll put this as simply as I can, and rip your troglodytic narrow minded argument apart in the process. Applying economics to discourse (what more one on religion and spirituality), you're just saying a lot about yourself.</p>

              <p>2. I dont even have to put up a rebuttal here, I'll just use your words against yourself. Didnt you say that "<span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;">O/c for spiritual commitment: Secular commitment" ? And as i said earlier, should secular commitments be the single most important aspect of one's life, there will be an immense price to pay to "go to heaven". Unless you're five years old and think that "price" only refers to currency, which appears to be the case. </span></p>

              <p>To 24/7,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, thank you for the comment! Yup, you make a good point, and i almost thought i had been caught(in my own logic), until i re-read my original post. --&gt;<br><br>Not to argue semantics with you, but let me re-cap. I do believe i said that:<br>~Basically we don't know enough to say "god doesn't exist", AND "god does exist".<br>Both. What did i base that on?<br>~Personally i feel that since we haven't even travelled to Mars yet (which is the nearest planet by FAR), or even discovered any TRACE of extraterrestrial life(not to mention actual aliens),<br><br>therefore, we cannot yet affirmatively say "There is no god" or "There is a god".</p>
              <p>--------NOW, i definitely see the point of your disastisfaction with my comment. Your reading of my meaning is basically correct, but perhaps your logic to reach your conclusion is a little too.. absolute. There is not just ONE way to take what i said.</p>
              <p><br>==&gt; Although it may certainly seem like I'm implying that Religion is misguided, I haven't actually gone that far.</p>
              <p>I'm saying, "nobody can be 100% sure". And that THUS, we should all be tolerant of what others believe in. (I.E: NOBODY CAN/SHOULD SAY THAT THE OTHER IS WRONG, catch my drift?)</p>
              <p><br>And in the first place, i don't think that any religion is about proving to the rest of the world that "Our religion is correct, is absolute, you must believe"...<br><br>~~~~~~~~~IN A NUTSHELL,<br>-Yes, i said we know too little to confirm ANY side.<br>-However, my saying that (E.G.) "Christians or Non-christians both cannot be 100% sure that christ/god exists or not", IS NOT EQUAL TO saying Christians are "misguided"!</p>
              <p>-In fact, if you want to take an extreme reading of my words(as you have), you could even say that I'm taking Christianity's side, by telling the Evolutionists: "Hey, you can't be sure either!" (that there is not some supreme being looking over/guiding us.)<br></p>
              <p>To dispute your use of the [Elephant Analogy] in this case,</p>
              <p>i believe that i would actually be ANOTHER blind man, telling the other 3 that "Hey guys, we ALL can't see, we ALL can't be 100% sure, so why don't we just leave it at that for now?" :)</p>
              <p>Come on, mate, since when is saying "We all don't know enough", equal to implying "Hehe, actually i know everything", or "Hehe, Side B is actually foolish?" Isn't that your own suspicion or defensiveness, showing through?</p>
              <p><br>Again, i hope this makes sense to you and others. I am not arguing for the sake of picking a fight, i simply explain myself more clearly so nobody will misinterpret my words, and think that I am taking sides or belittling any side.<br>I'M NOT.</p>

              <p>I've actually noticed that most people with exceptional wisdom
              or intelligence have trouble accepting god. I'm sure most of you
              will have read about tensions between the Church and brilliant
              scientists, mathematicians, philosophers and thinkers throughout
              history. In so many cases, these great minds have either been
              persecuted for their alleged "heresy" or silently acquiesced in
              fear. I've seen it too, in my professors, teachers and colleagues,
              many of whom grew up in fully religious families but strayed away
              as they matured cognitively. Other exceptional personalities like
              Mother Teresa (as seen in another article on this forum) had
              profound doubts about god. Even numerous stars in Hollywood (the
              true theatrical talents, not attention whores like paris hilton)
              have turned to other religions. </p>
              <p>I speak through personal experience because I was once christian
              but i felt that something was inherently wrong with the
              fundamentals of the religion. Truthfully ask yourself, take away
              the comforting words of your church mates and pastors, take away
              the companionship of the congregation, take away the egocentric
              self-assuredness of "being saved". Now do you still TRULY love your
              God?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">think you might have some problematic elements in your statements - how would you define exceptional? Does Einstein count? Even if these people who are intelligent have trouble believing in the existence of God, does that indicate the presence of a causative relationship between belief and intelligence? Could it not be possible that there are other extraneous reasons that perpetuate the absence of belief? E.g. pride? Moral? Self desire / whim/ fancy? Immense desire for self autonomy? Lack of exposure? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For that matter, i'm not sure what qualifies as intelligent in your case but I would remind one of the modern day examples of Francis Collins (current director of the National Institute of Health in the US and previous head of the Human Genome Project), John Lennox (maths prof at Oxford), John Polkinghorne (Cambridge prof), Richard Swinburne, Alister McGrath, the many creation scientists and  who hold PhDs (if those are indicators of intelligence), etc... I mean, there's no lack of intelligent people who also believe in God. So what's your point? Argument from numbers - that there are MORE people who don't believe in God than those who do? Argument from authority - that because these more intelligent individuals don't believe, therefore unlikely to be true? </p>

Maybe some thing is inherently wrong, or maybe you don't understand the "religion" well enough, maybe you weren't taught properly. </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Christianity is not egocentric, it's being concerned primarily about God, followed by the welfare of others, e.g. other-centred. You see this teaching peppered throughout Scriptures. Being saved is nothing one should boast about (Ephesians 2:8-9), One of the characteristics of a member of the kingdom of God, a true believer not a cultural Christian, is that found in Matthew 5:3 where he realizes that if not for God, he would remain spiritually bankrupt. Thus the "assuredness" that is derived from this state, does not come from the self but rightfully from God, for being found in Christ, - "if not for the grace of God, I would not be saved at all. Therefore i should not congratulate myself too much but live out the result of my saving faith" </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It's also not the comforting words or the companionship that make one truly love God. There are people who do not enjoy such privileges and in fact, suffer much for the cause of Christ - think of the early Christians (thrown into lions' den for not renouncing their faith, where is the comfort in that??), Paul the Apostle, the nameless missionaries who tread into unknown territory away from the comfort of their church, or the countless martyrs who are gunned down for holding onto their profession of the faith in conflict situations, myself, etc... so how? At any rate, your question will only filter out cultural Christians from true believers (1 Corinthians 11:19).</p>
