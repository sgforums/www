              <p>Dear All:</p>
              <p>I've been thinking about a few things recently and would like to share with all of us here in this sub-forum.</p>
              <p>Been thinking about how have people been perceiving Christians [in singapore context mainly]. Maybe i would like to make a distinction between a Christian and a mere Fanboy.</p>
              <p>A fanboy, or a fan, is someone who everyday puts the name of God or Jesus on their mouth, they can sing songs about God or Jesus in lunchtime. [what's so different then replacing the name of Jesus with some star or singer?in this sense?] Besides this they like to say that this is wrong that is sin etc etc.</p>
              <p>But seldom people are reminded of what Christians should be like. While the things that i mentioned on top is not wrong, there should be more than that, that could come out from Christians. People have long since felt or see grace overflowing from Christians. Or at least when is the last time any of us here have heard a kind word from the so-called Christian forumers here? When is the last time that the actual impression of Christians is that of one that helps the poor and needy? When is the last time we see solid Bible Preaching and not something flimsy and lovey-dovey? When will we see people such as Mother Theresa [and i'm even quoting a roman Catholic], John Calvin, John Wesley or Bishop Desmond Tutu?</p>
              <p>May we all remember that Jesus said "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of
              heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."</p>
              <p>Dear Christians, may we all actually be transformed inwardly, so strongly by the Grace of God, that what flows out from us, is grace, and not some ya-ya kind of attitute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>regards,</p>
