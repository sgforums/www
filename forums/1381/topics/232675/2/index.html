I will quote from Martin Luther to prove to you that the Reformers believe in Perpetual Viginity.<br><br>Well some Protestants today hold many doctrines which contradict luther's belief that the Catholic Church was founded by Christ, the Real Presence etc etc.<br><br><blockquote>In his sermon of August 15, 1522, the last time Martin Luther preached on the Feast of the Assumption, he stated:<br><br>There can be no doubt that the <strong>Virgin Mary is in heaven</strong>. How it happened we do not know. And since the Holy Spirit has told us nothing about it, we can make of it no article of faith . . . It is enough to know that she lives in Christ.<br><br>The <strong>veneration of Mary </strong>is inscribed in the very depths of the human heart. (Sermon, September 1, 1522).<br><br>[She is the] <strong>highest woman and the noblest gem in Christianity </strong>after Christ . . . She is nobility, wisdom, and holiness personified. <strong>We can never honor her enough</strong>. Still honor and praise must be given to her in such a way as to injure neither Christ nor the Scriptures. (Sermon, Christmas, 1531).<br><br>No woman is like you. You are more than Eve or Sarah, blessed above all nobility, wisdom, and sanctity. (Sermon, Feast of the Visitation, 1537).<br><br>One should honor Mary as she herself wished and as she expressed it in the Magnificat. She praised God for his deeds. How then can we praise her? <strong>The true honor of Mary is the honor of God, the praise of God's grace </strong>. . . Mary is nothing for the sake of herself, but for the sake of Christ . . . Mary does not wish that <strong>we come to her, but through her to God.</strong> (Explanation of the Magnificat, 1521).<br><br>Luther gives the Blessed Virgin the exalted position of "Spiritual Mother" for Christians:<br><br>It is the consolation and the superabundant goodness of God, that man is able to exult in such a treasure. <strong>Mary is his true Mother </strong>.. (Sermon, Christmas, 1522)<br><br>Mary is the Mother of Jesus and the<strong> Mother of all of us even though it was Christ alone who reposed on her knees </strong>. . . If he is ours, we ought to be in his situation; there where he is, we ought also to be and all that he has ought to be ours, and <strong>his mother is also our mother</strong>. (Sermon, Christmas, 1529).<br><br>Martin Luther had the belief of Mary's Immaculate Conception, Luther's words follow:<br><br>It is a sweet and pious belief that the infusion of <strong>Mary's soul was effected without original sin;</strong> so that in the very infusion of her soul she was also purified from original sin and adorned with God's gifts, receiving a pure soul infused by God; thus from the <strong>first moment she began to live she was free from all sin"</strong> (Sermon: "On the Day of the Conception of the Mother of God," 1527).<br><br>She is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin- something exceedingly great. <strong>For God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil</strong>. (Personal {"Little"} Prayer Book, 1522).<br><br>Martin Luther on Mary's Perpetual Virginity<br>Here are some of the founders of refom commenting on Mary:<br><br>Christ, our Savior, was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb . . . This was without the cooperation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that.<br>{Luther's Works, eds. Jaroslav Pelikan (vols. 1-30) &amp; Helmut T. Lehmann (vols. 31-55), St. Louis: Concordia Pub.

I am supposed to have preached and written that Mary, the mother of God, was not a virgin either before or after the birth of Christ . . .<br>{Pelikan, ibid.,v.45:199 / That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew (1523) }<br><strong>Scripture does not say or indicate that she later lost her virginity </strong>. . .<br>When Matthew [1:25] says that Joseph did not know Mary carnally until she had brought forth her son, it does not follow that he knew her subsequently; on the contrary, it means that he never did know her . . . This babble . . . is without justification . . . <strong>he has neither noticed nor paid any attention to either Scripture or the common idiom.</strong><br><br>{Pelikan, ibid.,v.45:206,212-3 / That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew (1523) }<br><br>". . . she is rightly called not only the mother of the man, but also the Mother of God. . . . <strong>it is certain that Mary is the Mother of the real and true God</strong>."<br>Ref: Sermon on John 14. 16: Luther's Works (St. Louis, ed.

Apologist John Salza uses Greek to explain why.<br><br><blockquote>Matt. 1:25 - this verse says Joseph knew her "not until ("heos", in Greek)" she bore a son. Some Protestants argue that this proves Joseph had relations with Mary after she bore a son. This is an erroneous reading of the text because "not until" does not mean "did not...until after." "Heos" references the past, never the future. Instead, "not until" she bore a son means "not up to the point that" she bore a son. This confirms that Mary was a virgin when she bore Jesus. Here are other texts that prove "not until" means "not up to the point that":<br><br>Matt. 28:29 - I am with you "until the end of the world." This does not mean Jesus is not with us after the end of the world.<br><br>Luke 1:80 - John was in the desert "up to the point of his manifestation to Israel." Not John "was in the desert until after" his manifestation.<br><br>Luke 2:37 - Anna was a widow "up to the point that" she was eighty-four years old. She was not a widow after eighty-four years old.<br><br>Luke 20:43 - Jesus says, "take your seat at my hand until I have made your enemies your footstool." Jesus is not going to require the apostles to sit at His left hand after their enemies are their footstool.<br><br>1 Tim. 4:13 - "up to the point that I come," attend to teaching and preaching. It does not mean do nothing "until after" I come.<br><br>Gen. 8:7 - the raven flew back and forth "up to the point that" [until] the waters dried from the earth. The raven did not start flying after the waters dried.<br><br>Gen. 28:15 - the Lord won't leave Jacob "up to the point that" he does His promise. This does not mean the Lord will leave Jacob afterward.<br><br>Deut. 34:6 - but "up to the point of today" no one knows Moses' burial place. This does not mean that "they did not know place until today."<br><br>2 Sam. 6:23 - Saul's daughter Micah was childless "up to the point" [until] her death.

You are picking bones with translation theory. Are you saying formal equivalence is always better than functional equivalence?<br><br>The bible, ultimately, is not for scholars.
