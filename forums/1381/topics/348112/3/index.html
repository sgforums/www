              <p>It appears that the discussion has shifted from "going church to become rich" to "going chruch to make the pastor rich". Since have shifted to this platform of being rich, how much 'so-called salary' do you think the senior pastor of a church is entitled to? We must bear in mind that in a protestan environment, the pastor also have a life or family life of his own and that he does need 'money' to maintain his family and lifestyle.</p>

              <p>In my personal view, the senior pastor of a church holds great responsibility and should not be treated badly to the extend that he has to suffer in poverty or worry for his family well being that he is not able to concentrate in doing his role as a senior pastor for the church and serving God.</p>

              <p>that's why i said, it's a question of mathematics. the congregation isn't giving more than what they are supposed to (it depends again), if everyone is just obeying God and giving a tenth, it comes down to the size of the church.</p>
              <p>so how does one "pamper" appropriately? if the church is big, don't give 10%, give 2%?</p>

              <p>to do that, means everyone has to give lesser isn't it. but God says give a tenth.</p>
              <p>so how does one give 10% without "over pampering" the pastor?</p>
              <p>should the church should reduce its population (which is self-defeating, because churches should grow)?</p>
