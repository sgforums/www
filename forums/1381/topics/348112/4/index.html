              <p>i definitely get what you mean, what i don't get is the solution to it.</p>
              <p>the mathematic is simple. everyone gives 10% as a tithe. if you don't want the pastor to have so much money, either everyone gives lesser tithe, maybe from 10% to 2% (which is disobeying God), or get everyone to leave the church so that the population is smaller (which is self defeating)</p>
              <p>most christians tithe according to the same rule. whether a pastor is rich or not, solely depends on his church population. a pastor of a small church obviously gathers lesser tithe, compared to a pastor from a really big church. </p>
              <p>these are the only 2 solutions i can see, care to give a better solution?</p>

              <p>no. but the pastor is entitled to take a portion for his usage, i believe. how much i guess is his own judgement call already. </p>
              <p>of course there will be cases of abuses definitely. you see that all the time. but, it's too quick to point fingers la. if you're not happy about it, then write in to that church and ask for an audit and stuff lor.</p>

              <p>i definitely get what you mean, what i don't get is the solution
              to it.</p>
              <p>the mathematic is simple. everyone gives 10% as a tithe. if you
              don't want the pastor to have so much money, either everyone gives
              lesser tithe, maybe from 10% to 2% (which is disobeying God), or
              get everyone to leave the church so that the population is smaller
              (which is self defeating)</p>
              <p>most christians tithe according to the same rule. whether a
              pastor is rich or not, solely depends on his church population. a
              pastor of a small church obviously gathers lesser tithe, compared
              to a pastor from a really big church. </p>
              <p>these are the only 2 solutions i can see, care to give a better
              solution?</p>
