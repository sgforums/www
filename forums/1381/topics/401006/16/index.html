              <p>objectively speaking, during the days of the reformation, all
              these breakaway churches, which later became the Anglicans,
              Methodist..etc are also considered not preaching Jesus's teaching
              as the main stream churches (ie. the Catholic
              Church) understood it.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>pushing back further, this same accusation was also spoken about
              the Apostles, Christianity was describe as a Nazarene sect (Acts
              26:5-8), divant from the main stream teaching of those days.</p>
              <p>so different from "main stream" still christians???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I must be insane... talking about this at this hour of the

              <p>That's the problem which really started with this so-called reformation movement. No more "governement" and each will interpret the scriputres as they like and claimed the other as inaccurate etc...and when don't like, break away and start a new church etc.. So I guess we will have to include mega churches as christians in your opinion.</p>

              <p>Churches that do not collect tithes only ask for offering and no one is forced to give and not giving does not affect one's association with the church.</p>
              <p>Mega churches focus on the teaching of tithes and offerings and tithes is 10% although people are encourage to give more.....some will not consider you to be a "voting member" when it comes to church meetings if you do not tithe.</p>

              <h4 style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Kong paid tribute to 'a glorious 20 years of church building' in the 11-paragraph statement entitled Reflections. -- PHOTO: CITY HARVEST CHURCH</span></span></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">AFTER weeks of silence and dodging the media, City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee yesterday gave his first public comments via his blog about the ongoing probe involving his church.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In a post entitled Reflections, Mr Kong said he and the church's management board were helping the police with investigations, and that he and his family were 'doing well'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He also thanked church members for their support.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The 11-paragraph statement did not add details to the case, which got off to a dramatic start last month when Commercial Affairs Department officers raided the church's offices at Suntec City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'Because we're in the midst of the investigation, I am unable to provide any details about the progress besides what already has been released by the Singapore Police in their statement to the press,' Mr Kong wrote in his message.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He could not be reached yesterday for comment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; color: black; ">A church spokesman said that Mr Kong</span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; color: maroon; "> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; color: black; ">and his wife were being represented by law firm Allen &amp; Gledhill.</span></strong><strong><span style="color: black;"></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Questions remain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Weeks after the raid, it is still not known exactly how many organisations and individuals are being investigated, or who they are.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What has been made public is that the investigations have to do with misuse of church funds and financial transactions involving 'several individuals and companies, related or connected' to the church.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The police on Wednesday said the number of persons assisting them with the inquiry had increased from an initial 17 to more than 20 now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Known persons so far comprise Mr Kong, 46; his wife Ho Yeow Sun, 38, better known as Sun Ho; and the church's 10-member management council.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">No one has been arrested.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Kong, who is also the church's senior pastor, yesterday described the investigation as a turning point for the church, which, since its founding in 1989, has grown to become Singapore's largest independent Christian church, with a congregation of more than 33,000 followers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Recalling that the police raid took place only a day after the church had concluded an international conference featuring more than 25,000 participants, Mr Kong said on the blog: 'What a difference a day makes... The page had turned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'The celebration had abruptly ended.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Since the raid, Mr Kong has stayed largely out of sight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He made a brief appearance last week during services at Singapore Expo but did not address the congregation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">By yesterday evening, Mr Kong's post had attracted more than 90 responses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A handful of readers said he was insincere; the majority, however, expressed gratitude for the positive influence the church has had on their lives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the last paragraph of his message, Mr Kong said: 'It has been a glorious 20 years of church building filled with tears and triumph, brokenness as well as breakthroughs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'I believe that the City Harvest story will continue to unfold.'</span></p>
