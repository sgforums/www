It is true nobody has the right to question how the money was spent EXCEPT for the exact people who contributed to those funds. CAD all these stepped in because there must have been a serious complaint from someone or a collective group coming internally. Whether Kong Hee is guilty or not, lets wait and see. I am a christian but not from CHC, and my advice to my friends from CHC is, if he is indeed guilty, let see that Justics is done but if he is not, then let us move on and Justice will be done. For those who are not christians, I think while it is fine to criticise the persons involved and offer your opinions on those persons but lets keep it civil and we do not have to drag the whole religion thing in.</p></div>

              <p>To the 2nd question, the point is christianity, the fact that is about to engage our culture and be excellent in our fields, finding needs to be meet them and sharing the gospel of Christ.  There maybe "so-called christians" who left and hated the fact that christians can be rich in money and health and all aspects of life and fear christians turned celebrities I don't understand their logics. But that's EXACTLY how the people lived in bible times put into context: how they invested into building buildings for people and to bring hope. There are times when they made huge mistakes but God continues to bring hope.</p>
              <p>However greater responsibilities and accountability has to be taken place in our church to continue to serve and help more people. Finances is one of the significant aspects our church needs to be tighter on.</p>
              <p>The investigations are still ongoing for a number of days already, hopefully things will be better thereafter allowing more space for positive encouragements.</p>
