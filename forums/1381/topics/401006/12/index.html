              <p><br>New Creation Church and Joseph Prince. I wonder whether FCBC is preaching the prosperity gospel  since it is able to attract a strong congregation of about 9000+ members?Last time, I got one'' friend ''who was originally from  CHC but switched  to FCBC later on  and he kept pestering me to go to his fcbc church even though I was attending mass at a catholic church.</p>
              <p>This ''friend ''damn CB one....got one time I met him for lunch  after his FCBC service and he insisted on going to botak jones  to eat. After he had ordered the food, he said that he got no money to pay for the food cos he donated the $$$ to church... so I bo bian had to lend him some $$$. Sometimes, I find that ''lost sheeps'' tend to flock to megachurches since megachurches only preach about the positive things and these gong kia will then donate most of their $$ to their church.</p>
              <p>I laughed at my stupid ''friend'' for donating of all his $$$ to his pastor and while the pastor is dining at a restaurant in a 5 star hotel, he got no money to eat at botak jones. LOL</p>

              <p>NCC is another disgrace. I think the pastor  insulted  other religions because he wanted to attract more  innocent buddhists or taoists teenagers to the church so that more people will donate to him and the church. But in the end, he kena caught . Epic  failed. LOL.</p>
