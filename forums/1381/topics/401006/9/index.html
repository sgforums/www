              <p>There seems to be blatanly more obvious "Trolls" out there, but unfortunately I seem to be preferably labeled as such as a troublemaker.</p>
              <p>Well, I can see your sense of "justice".</p>
              <p>But well, I am not here to tell u who to bust up.</p>
              <p><strong>Anyways,</strong></p>
              <p>If you seem to think my statement</p>
              <p>""If results not to ur liking... its a conspiracy right ? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">""  is to flame and looking for trouble,</p>
              <p>I am sorry to somehow hurt ur feelings. Unfortunately , I cant please everyone. I am already highly hypocritical to my ownself already.</p>
              <p>Maybe I suggest you dont ever post in sgforums again? Or perhaps Eternal Hope at least since u spposedly say I am a "Troll" and a "Troublemaker" . Because I am here to stay. I worry, you may mistake my replies as another attempt to specifically FLAME YOU.</p>
              <p>So I say SORRY first . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>Let me just give u an example. An analogy. But you of course can say my analogy is crap, shit  and doesnt make sense. Here goes.</p>
              <p>If you were a midget, short and fat, and offended by my remark on you being fat short and a midget unknowly to me that in reality you are, then you have all the right to be angry and deserve an apology and I deserve to be brought down due to my remarks.</p>
              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>If you are NOT a midget, NOT short, and NOT fat, and my remark towards you as being fat, short and a midget, there is NO reason for you to be angry. NO reason for u to react strongly to you self-perception of this captivity of negativty. Because its NOT TRUE. And NO reason for you to feel insecure, self-depressed and upset over my statement. Thats why the nutshell personality. Unless you are defending another, I do not see why one needs to react strongly to it.</p>
              <p>So I apologise. I am sorry.</p>
              <p>You can accept it as a genuine apology .. or it being sarcastic, or plain non-thoughtful. It is entirely up to you. Because whatever U think I mean, I dont think I can use constructive reasoning to persuade you otherwise of my actual genuinity.</p>
              <p> </p>
