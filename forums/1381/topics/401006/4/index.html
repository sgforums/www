              <p>I doubt the govt will be afraid or anything.  If they are, then it is no good.  What if one fine day Kong Hee decides to take over the parliament or at least a few seats?  Govt is going to give way too, just cuz they have ten over thousand members.</p>
              <p>I have not heard of the affiliated church though.  But I must say our Govt is making it too easy for such mega church to build.  What do you need to be a head of such organisation?  Register as a society.  That's all you need.  A stringent control must be put in place to control such occurence.  After all, every religious group whether christian or nonchristian has an extensive level of influence on their followers. </p>

              <p>This came after the COC received complaints of misuse of church funds against City Harvest Church.</p>
              <p>Police have confirmed that <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Reverend+Kong+Hee+City+Harvest&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Reverend Kong Hee</span></a>, the leader of the mega-church with over 33,000 members, is among those assisting in an on-going investigation.</p>
              <p>Kong Hee’s wife, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Sun+Ho+Reverend+Kong+Hee&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Sun Ho</span></a>, is a pop music singer, who currently resides in the United States. They have a son, Dayan Kong</p>
              <p>A joint statement issued Monday by the COC and police said CAD officers visited the offices of the individuals and the companies under investigation on Monday morning.</p>
              <p>According to a <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_533481.html"><em><span style="color: #334499;">Straits Times</span></em></a> report, seven individuals were detained in a raid at 6.30am and by noon, 12 people were said to be assisting in investigations involving charges of falsification of accounts and criminal breach of trust.</p>
              <p>The charges are said to be unrelated to previous investigations into City Harvest’s purchase of a S$310 million stake in <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Suntec+City+Convention+Centre&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Suntec City Convention Centre</span></a>.</p>
              <p>City Harvest members Yahoo! Singapore spoke to, however, are unperturbed by the ongoing investigations.</p>
              <p>One of them, who wanted to be known as John, “I think its normal for big organisations to be ‘audited’. We will just have to wait and see what the outcome is from all this.”</p>
              <p>Another member from the same church who preferred to remain anonymous thought otherwise.</p>
              <p>“I think this is just another case of  ‘cry wolf’, out to stir up trouble for Pastor Kong Hee, Sun and City Harvest,” she said.</p>
              <p>The COC and CAD have given assurances that despite the ongoing investigations, services and religious activities of City Harvest Church will continue for its congregation.</p>

              <div class="chapter">Starting on the first day of Asia Conference, as usual we have offerings. Then second day Pastor Kong Hee was appealing the attendee to pledge S$300 if they can to help the charity organisation. <br>My thought was, already I had pledge quite a sum in the Arise and Build. So the offering of S$10 or $S20 would be enough. Then next day the amount increased to S$500. Deep inside me, I felt the Holy Spirit is telling to fulfill the offering. By the way, the pledge of Arise and Build had overshoot the target of S$24,000,000 at S$25,000,000 and Pastor Kong Hee announce with great joy that we had done it. Praise the Lord!<br><br>Then on Saturday service with Pastor Benny Hinn. He challenged everyone to pledge US$1,000 for the charity. And he said that everytime he get people to do that miracle happened. The money will return to you within 12 days. This time the Holy Spirit within me spoke even more audible "Go, Stanley. Do it." So, I could not escape this time and I am among the 1st few to reach the Hall 7 stage. Then Pastor Benny Hinn ask all to come to Hall 8 for the Prayer blessing. Wow, first time in my life in EXPO, I ran like a marathon champion. I reached there in double quick time, standing behind those who were already at the side of the stage. I had never forget Pastor Casey Treat's sermon. <strong>"Say things that are not and speak with your mouth as though they were in Prayer."</strong><br>Then in a while the night is over and I got home to prepare for Sunday Service.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surprised telephone call from AIA on Tuesday 28th Nov 2008 </span></strong><br><br><img src="/forums/1381/topics/stories/1/images/st_cheque1.jpg" alt=""><br><br>Call Center "Hello, hi are you Mr Tan?"<br>(I can hear her accent, she is a Philiphine lady)<br><br>I replied "Yes, I am. What is it regarding?"<br><br>Call Center "You have a cheque issued for your matured policy and I need to verify your home address, so that we can sent it to you."<br><br>I replied "Okay sure."<br><br>Call Center "Is your address Blk 320, Yishun Central...."<br><br>I replied "No that is no right, that was my old address. How could the office not knowing my address. My new policies are all sent to my current address."<br><br>Call Center "Okay, Sir. Apologised for that. Can you provide your current address so that we can mail this cheque to you."<br><br>I replied "Okay, my address is........ By the way, how much is the cheque?'<br><br>Call Center "The amount is S$1,638..."<br><br>I replied "Oh thank you."<br><br>After I had put down the phone, I thanks our Lord Jesus many times, because I have no idea where this cheque come from. Moreover I am currently a Financial Services Consultant with AIA, I had checked with the office and computer system; there was no record of any old policy in my account. So I presumed that I had redeemed all for cash, and thrown all the old policies away. In fact, there are 2 web design jobs on handl in the process of negotiation. So, I thought I would have to spent some effort to seal the web design deal at $1,500 and I can take it that this is the blessing of return of the pledged money, but that would means that I had spent some effort to justify the price to be $1,500. But, look at what our Lord Jesus had done for me, I don't have to spent any effort to receive the return of the money! I really thanks Abba Father Lord Jesus for this surprise anointing. It was such a PERFECT timing. The date of cheque issue was 10th Sept 2008. I could have received in October, then there is not much for me to thank God for. But the amazing invisible hand of God works wonderfully. He arranged such that it fulfilled the prophency of the pledge money facilitated by Pastor Benny Hinn within 12 days and I recieved it the cheque 7 days! Praise the Lord. Hallelujah!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey "Bored" why pray for downfall of CFC? you should instead pray that God will raise up godly leaders who fear Him and do the right things. if u feel that the present leaders are not doing the right things then intercede for God to transform them and to guide them back on the right track. The members of the church are innocent. If u pray for their downfall many lives will be affected. They sincerely believe that their leaders are trustworthy and righteous.</p></div>
