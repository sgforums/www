              <p>It is very sad that whenever people look at the church, they can't see beyond a certain pastor and his wife. It is sad and really shouldn't be the way. Obviously something has gone very wrong somewhere for it to become like this.</p>
              <p>A church obviously should be more than just about two particular members of the church.</p>

              <p>I don't understand whats wrong with a church having money to invest in stuff FOR the church?  If an individual, whether a leader or pastor has attempted to dishonestly appropriate the money, then there is a cause for criticism and concern.  However, if the church spends the money according to how its entire leadership has concluded it should, then what is wrong?  Its not like the church goers are in the dark about how the church spends the money right?</p>
              <p>The same for any other organization.  How the organization decides to spend the money is their own affair.  If the entire management or board of directors it should spend money that way, then so be it.  As long as its accountable to its shareholders.</p>
              <p>To bring this to a slight extreme.  Who can tell another guy's family how the family spends the money is wrong?  Its their affair, not anyone else's to critique.</p>
              <p>I think what needs to be looked at here is not whether a church,  or non-profit organization, should be taxed for its profit-making ventures.  That is an entirely different matter.</p>
