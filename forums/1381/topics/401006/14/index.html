              <p>if u like, please go to St Stephen which is somewhere in Aljunied area. The population for that church is small which results in very low level of contributions received. As such, they had to seek help from other catholic churches to fund the renovation works.</p>

              <p>This is truly humility.  Humility very much taught in the bible.    With regard to CHC humility is missing leh, the kong hee does not believe to be poor to preach God's word.   He is more like a cult.   </p>

              <p>actually every religion also has it fair share of problems. Even the catholic church where priests overseas are commiting grave sins.</p>
              <p>Priests are also asking fellow catholics to pray for them, the only mortal who des not commit sins are infants &amp; young children. And again, Jesus did mention....for anyone to enter the kingdom of God, he must be like a child.....</p>

              <p>from what i know, catholics are christians.....how did it change, i'm not sure.</p>
              <p>Anyway, catholics have always been branded non-christians coz people think catholics "pray" to Mother Mary.....catholics "pray" to the other saints....actualyy they do not pray to Saits or Mother Mary....they ask for intercessions.</p>
              <p>Only Jesus can lead us to the Father....that is the truth....they are the Holy Trinity.</p>
              <p>Catholics are also told to evangelize &amp; spread the word, but how they do it is very subtle. Only when someone is facing a situation, we encourage them to go &amp; pray.....u ask me, I have done that &amp; i feel a voice speak....i survived many downward times in my life becoz of that....i prayed &amp; my prayers were answered....and so I believe.....</p>
