              <p>Where money is concerned I wonder how Catholics get it without going round preaching prosperity sermon to "con" believers for money.     All i know from a catholic friend is the money is from a central pool, is this true, any Catholics here to verify?</p>

              <p><br>Yes , this true. We also  don't go  around asking people to donate $$$. During mass, the priest will usually talk about issues which are related to our lives and teach us on how to live gracefully without sins. There is no mention about $$$ at all even during offering time. During offering time, the priest will sit down while collectors walk around the church collecting  $ from those who want to donate. The only time when a  catholic church talks about $ is when they want to raise funds to renovate the church or when they want us to donate to the Catholic Welfare Service which offers financial help to the poor and this only happens once a year during Easter.</p>
              <p>Contrary to CHC's Kong Hee , Catholic priests tell us that Jesus was born poor not RICH and they always tell us to live humbly like God and advise us not to be obsesed with material wealth  . This is why I feel very comfortable in a Catholic Church although I must admit that  I find most of the masses to be very boring and they  have failed to create a youth group to retain more youths in the church . That is why some Catholic youths have joined CHC and other megachurches.</p>

              <p><br> New Creation Church and Joseph Prince. I wonder whether FCBC is
              preaching the prosperity gospel  since it is able to
              attract a strong congregation of about 9000+ members?Last
              time, I got one'' friend ''who was originally from  CHC but
              switched  to FCBC later on  and he kept pestering me to
              go to his fcbc church even though I was attending mass at a
              catholic church.</p>
              <p>This ''friend ''damn CB one....got one time I met him for lunch
               after his FCBC service and he insisted on going to botak
              jones  to eat. After he had ordered the food, he said
              that he got no money to pay for the food cos he donated the $$$ to
              church... so I bo bian had to lend him some $$$. Sometimes, I find
              that ''lost sheeps'' tend to flock to megachurches since
              megachurches only preach about the positive things and these gong
              kia will then donate most of their $$ to their church.</p>
              <p>I laughed at my stupid ''friend'' for donating of all his $$$ to
              his pastor and while the pastor is dining at a restaurant in a
              5 star hotel, he got no money to eat at botak jones. LOL</p>

              <p>I know the link among the catholic, anglican and methodist churchs.   Anglicans broken away from Catholicism and Methodists broken away from Anglican.    That explains some of their practices are the same.    Methodists do practise infant baptism and observe advent, Ash Wednesday and so on.    There is archbishop in methodist denomination.   </p>
              <p>CHC is modern church.    I am not sure who they are accountable to.</p>

              <p><br>Catholics, Protestants and Eastern Orthodox are all Christians.</p>
              <p>The "Christians" that we normally talk about especially in local context are actually the Protestants whose "ancestors" (I'm talking only about the main stream ones) broke away from the Catholics because they "protested" against the Catholic Church and her Pope. </p>
              <p>The Protestants never like to be called protestants.  They are never seem to be proud of this name.  I guess that's why they only want to be called Christians. </p>
              <p>Frankly, I dunno why forming "mega-churches" is never discouraged by the mainstreamers.  There is no reason to create a new church organisation unless one wants to have his own followers (wants to be a Jesus). </p>

              <p>Maybe, these "mega-churches" are not christians churches after all? They do not preach the Gospel according to the main stream churches and most (if not all) main streams churches seems to reject their teachings.

              <p>Also, most (if not all) main stream churches do not ask for tithes like these mega churches do.....and most main streams churches' priests and pastors are certainly not rich like those from "mega-churches".

              <p>Basically there are 2 kinds of donations in the catholic church. One is for funds that are required to help the church maintain its expenses. These funds can also be used if the church requires major restoration works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If these funds are not enough, they might have to do a donation drive if there is a major restoration work or even building a new church like Divine Mercy....i do know that when St Stephen had their restoration, they were so short of funds that contribution had to come from other churches as well....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other donation that happens only on every 1st sunday of the month goes to helping the poor staying in the vicinity of the church. In the catholic church, there is no compelling force in donating. Give if you can &amp; somewhere in the bible...Jesus did say this "the least you do unto my brothers, you do unto me"</p>

              <p>if u like, please go to St Stephen which is somewhere in Aljunied area. The population for that church is small which results in very low level of contributions received. As such, they had to seek help from other catholic churches to fund the renovation works.</p>
              <p>priests receives only an allowance &amp; anything extra normally comes from solemnizing weddings or during chinese new year where fellow catholics will give them ang pows....</p>
              <p>they are nothing like pastors, with no fancy cars or houses....its total giving having to spend 7 or more years studying to be a priest &amp; spending rest of their lives giving service to the catholic community...</p>
