              <p>Yes of course you could be jailed now for sure for incest. If you are planning to do it tell your neighbors when you are going to do it so the police would arrive right on time before.</p>
              <p>Actualy the Pharaohs have been known to marry his own sisters. You could tell that for your defense in the court. Of course you are thousands of year late and you are not  born a Pharaoh.</p>

              <p>not only is this dilemma limited to Adam and Eve, it affects even creatures that developed from single-celled organisms and between apes as well. Technically, everyone's having incest, doesnt matter if you're religious or not.</p>

              <p>thats what i keep saying to you people, to have incest, you need to have sex with another family member but if look at Adam and Eve, it is not incest.</p>

              <p>as for adam and eve exists or not and have met them before or not. its just like does God exists? have anyone seen him before?</p>
              <p>since it is stated in the bible, they do exist.</p>
              <p>incest was the original plan for humans to populate the earth when they were perfect. since adam/eve became imperfect later, it spreads to the 2nd and the rest of the humans generation.</p>
              <p>den came noah. the imperfection spreads through his family incest. but by moses, God sees( he already knows) that incest cant make it liao. so say incest cannot go on..</p>

              <p>Neither does the bible states that Cain married a relative. Incest between siblings is an assumption.</p>
              <p>If incest did take place, there's an answer to that too.. Incest did not cause problem then unlike today  because God's creation was pefect. Again, this is only an assumption.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Cmon stop thinking this way. Even if Adam and Eve really do exist, their descendants would have mated and then this goes on and on until the family tree gets so bloody wide. When this happens, it doesnt really matter anymore. Imagine u marry ur 567th cousin. No one will say anything abt incest cos u all are so bloody far away from the family tree that u are almost unrelated alr. Things would only go wrong if u marry ur direct cousin. From wat I heard, some Malay Muslims do this, though I'm not sure how true this rumour is.</p></div>

              <p>Neither does the bible states that Cain married a relative.
              Incest between siblings is an assumption.</p>
              <p>If incest did take place, there's an answer to that too.. Incest
              did not cause problem then unlike today  because God's
              creation was pefect. Again, this is only an assumption.</p>

              <p><br>i didnt realize there was a continuation here..no1 knows how old cain was when he married ya? mayb the wife is a direct spawn from adam and eve or adam and one of the daughters,grand daughters or so on. it may also be frm eve and sons or grandsons or so on.</p>
              <p>in any case, it is still incest.it wasnt so much of a problem then was not because God's creation is perfect, God's creation is perfect until adam and eve imperfected themselves. thus when incest takes place, the spawns will become problematic. an it seems the more it continue,the worse it becomes.</p>

              <p>thats what i keep saying to you people, to have incest, you need
              to have sex with another family member but if look at Adam and Eve,
              it is not incest.</p>
              <p>Eve is made from Adam's rib so basically, Adam is just screwing
              himself and the human race is created from Adam's masterbation.</p>
              <p>how to incest if the human race is basically having sex with
              him/herself? its just masterbation.</p>
              <p>if adam was to screw satan/GOD/angels, then it would be
              incest cos he would then be screwing other family members</p>
