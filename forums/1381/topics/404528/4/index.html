              <p>don't you find the chc preaching something very wrong. especially the one that pastor kong hee said "jesus and his disciples distinguish themselves from the poor' and 'give and return is not going to make you very rich'. these preachings are putting christianity in very bad shape. if you have not watched them, watch them now (below). if you don't find them anything wrong, then something must be wrong with you (pardon me for saying that)</p>
