              <p>true or not also don't show yourself. you are going to face 30,000 of them, i worry for you. anyway, i know you are smart enough on what to do. as long as is not our money, don't care so much about them. there is a chinese saying : one is willing to beat, the other is willing to be beaten, let them be lor. we just standby and watch the show. 10% is definitely true. you just come here to warn us about the 10%, right ?</p>

              <p>just to clarify for you that having faith in Christ means following His teachings which is to love i.e. by doing good.</p>
              <p>Christ is not looking for lip service and one can say anything he wants of how much he loved God etc.....but it is one's action and how they lived their lives that counts.</p>
              <p>again, I quote you (which i think i did before) - "So you can see that his faith 
              was working together with his deeds; his faith 
              became perfect by what he did."</p>
              <p>don't look for articles that "support" your doubts, seek the truth that will clear your doubts......and watch your source.</p>

              <div>Before you people go on and on based on some ridiculous rumour, let me tell you guys what is the truth as an ex-CHC member and CGL.</div>
              <div>In my 5 yrs serving as a CGL in CHC, I can vouch fully that this is the most ridiculous lie and scandal I have heard so far ! I myself have tithed regularly but before God and man, I tell you the truth. The tithes and offerings of CHC are strictly controlled. Proper receipts are sent out as soon as possible as long as the giver fills in fully the information printed on every offering envelope.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The weekly offerings are immediately taken into a secure room with CCTV cameras actively monitoring the counting and there are even CISCO guards standing around while the offerings are counted to ensure there's no pilfering or dishonest moves carried out. Several leaders and pastors are on duty every week to supervise the movement and counting and recording of money because it is a very big church with several thousand members every week giving several thousands of dollars and in tithes and offerings.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>If I as a CGL have been receiving "commissions " for bringing in new members into the church, I would not be able to stand up with my head held up because I would be in a great ponsi scheme or MLMS as rumoured by this blogger Gracehp.</div>
              <div>She or he starts by typing ... <br></div>
              <div>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"Today I met with a long lost secondary school friend who is working at city harvest now.</em></span></p>

              <p>which homes or charity are build by chc and operated by them

              <p>or is it just about "i am rich" so these "dirty jobs" should be

              <div>Before you people go on and on based on some ridiculous
              rumour, let me tell you guys what is the truth as an ex-CHC member
              and CGL.</div>
              <div>In my 5 yrs serving as a CGL in CHC, I can vouch fully that
              this is the most ridiculous lie and scandal I have heard so far ! I
              myself have tithed regularly but before God and man, I tell you the
              truth. The tithes and offerings of CHC are strictly controlled.
              Proper receipts are sent out as soon as possible as long as the
              giver fills in fully the information printed on every offering
              envelope.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The weekly offerings are immediately taken into a secure room
              with CCTV cameras actively monitoring the counting and there are
              even CISCO guards standing around while the offerings are counted
              to ensure there's no pilfering or dishonest moves carried out.
              Several leaders and pastors are on duty every week to supervise the
              movement and counting and recording of money because it is a very
              big church with several thousand members every week giving several
              thousands of dollars and in tithes and offerings.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>If I as a CGL have been receiving "commissions " for bringing
              in new members into the church, I would not be able to stand up
              with my head held up because I would be in a great ponsi scheme or
              MLMS as rumoured by this blogger Gracehp.</div>
              <div>She or he starts by typing ... <br></div>

              full time worker in CHC now. She is directly in charge of the

              are given to the poor and needy in Singapore Children Society ,
              School Pocket Money Fund, 5 Orphanages in India, 7 Old Folks Homes
              in China, 3 Organisations helping HIV patients and many more. Not a
              single cent of tithes and offerings are used as payment of
              commissions to members and leaders and pastors of CHC. Gracehp is a
              liar and rumour monger. Do not believe a word she /he typed into

              before God if there is any once of truth in this silly

              besides, she will be cut off from the MLM scheme immediately and
              her commission income amounting to several thousands or a million a
              month  will be cut off . Why do such silly things eh ??

              ungracious and they are taking this opportunity to</div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">bash CHC with the most <strong>ridonkulous</strong> ( my own
              invented new word to mean ridiculous to the extreme ) rumors
              involving money. In the process , they drag in ALL Christians and
              call all Christians  fools for giving 10% or more of our
              salary to the church to finance various MLM schemes in various
              churches.</div>

              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">Just imagine if this were true, ALL CHC leaders  and pastors
              would be hypocrites and cheats and liars and how can such people go
              to church week after week and not feel a thing wrong with what they
              are doing ????</div>

              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">If
              that is true, where then would CHC get the money to finance other
              projects or building fund and missions that costs several millions
              if almost all the tithes go into the payment of commissions to
              Pastors and CGLs ? <span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>Maybe CHC
              members and leaders also secretly collect "investment $$" and
              promise their innocent friends a 100-fold return if they further
              give 5% more in addition to the 10% which goes into paying
              commissions to pastors and CGLs. ( Just in case you people
              who  love to listen to rumors think the forgoing statement is

              and leaders called up for investigations by COC and CPIB but I can
              straightaway tell you if the rubbish written by people who are not
              even Christians in the first place and do not understand why many
              churches practice tithing, are true or  just ridonkoulous
              nonsence passed on by people who want take this opportunity to bash
              CHC and Christianity in general.</div>

              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">really want to know the truth and not just hide behind cyberspace

              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">I
              hope Gracehp replies to me because you strike me as someone who is
              fascinated playing with numbers based on imaginary scenarios. You'd
              do better to check out the truth and go hear from the 'horses'
              mouth' before circulating such ridonkulous stories to provide more
              ammunition to God-haters and CHC-haters to vent their hatred.</div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">Humans make mistakes sometimes but it is sad to see that some other
              people love to rub salt on other people's wounds.  Do any of
              you who curse and swear dare to say you are infallable, you never
              made a mistake in your life that you sit behind your computers and
              judge Pst Kong and CHC as if you are greater than God who is the
              Supreme Judge of all ?</div>

              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;"><em>Anyone can claim to have met a long lost friend working in CHC
              now. It is easy for me to type into my</em></div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;"><em>laptop something like this .....</em></div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;"><em> </em></div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;"><em> " Hey guys,  just half an hour ago, I met
              another full time worker in CHC now. She is directly in charge of
              the finances of CHC. According to her, 20 % of the full titihes of
              CHC are given to the poor and needy in Singapore Children Society ,
              School Pocket Money Fund, 5 Orphanages in India, 7 Old Folks Homes
              in China, 3 Organisations helping HIV patients and many more. Not a
              single cent of tithes and offerings are used as payment of
              commissions to members and leaders and pastors of CHC. Gracehp is a
              liar and rumour monger. Do not believe a word she /he typed into
              her computer as she /he hides herself behind the invisible walls of
              cyberspace."</em></div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">I
              was just trying to prove my point that anyone can spread any kind
              of nonsense, whether positive or negative. What I mentioned in the
              para above are fictitious. You see how seriously some of you take
              everything that is circulated in cyberspace ? </div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">That's why you are being sucked in by Gracehp who just wants to
              slander Pst Kong and CHC by spreading malicious rumours which are
              so ridiculous and nonsensical.</div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">I
              take offence at Gracehp who started this thread because she is also
              talking about me who happend to be once a CGL in CHC.  I can
              vouch for Pst Kong that there is not an ounce of truth about the
              allegations made by Gracehp. She is lying and talking nonsense and
              I want to meet her/him personally with some witnesses to challenge
              her lies and false allegations .</div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">Gracehp, I am still awaiting your reply. Don't keep quiet . Take
              responsibility in what you say and do, or else remain silent about
              things you do not know or have not verified correctly in
              advance.</div>
              <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">Let
              him who has no sin cast the first stone.</div>

              <p>In that case tell us how Kong Hee became so rich if he did not take the tithes for his own personal use</p>

              <p>To reply to Fairyfairy86's question on why I left CHC, it was
              due to some personal problems I was facing which affected my
              family and I felt it was better for me to go to another church
              nearer home. It has nothing to do with tithing or disagreement with
              Pst Kong.</p>

              <p>reasons enough why these people should stop thinking about making money using "building funds" as an excuse....</p>
              <p>instead, they should think about spreading the True Gospel and thinking for people like you.....by building churches in various parts of the island so that they can reach out to more people......</p>
              <p>then poor guy like you would not need to "leave" the church and go some where else.... and going to church should not be creating any "personal problems"</p>
