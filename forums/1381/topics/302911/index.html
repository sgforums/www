Atheists do not feel dehumanized when creationists say that people were created in the image and likeness of God.

And I totally do not agree to label someone foolish. I also see there is another thread that says 'top 10 signs of foolish christians'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Calling someone foolish does not really reflect well on yourself, christian or not.<br><br>We are just people who have different beliefs. I will not call another who differs from me in beliefs as foolish.<br><br>BUt I guess without people like you all who like to call each other names....the world would be so boring  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>U are foolish<br><br></div>
