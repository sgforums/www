              <p><br>We need to be clear as to what we mean when we deem something as satanic. The members of Eagles had already stated clearly that the meaning to "Hotel California" is a reflection of the decadent lifestyle of that period. So we can choose to accept that explanation or attempt to read in between the lines and ascribe meanings that are not there in the first place.</p>
              <p>When we say that there are hidden messages, is this a statement of truth or a statement of assumptions? Just do some research on "back masking" and you will probably find an experiment done sometime back that had Psalms 23 also having "satanic" messages. It all goes back to the <strong>speed</strong> on the reverse play. At some given speed, I am sure something "satanic" can be heard.</p>
              <p>On the assumption of hidden messages, do they affect those who don't understand English, or do these messages affect every single person - the answer is obvious - NO. It doesn't even affect 99% of the listeners.</p>
              <p>If the only reason to be careful about what one listens to is: does it change your value system? If it does, satanic or not, it is harmful.</p>
              <p>I love Hotel California for the unplugged, raw guitar sounds.</p>

              <p><br>why is it spooky?? afterall you've had it for the longest time.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>.... unless, of course, the music had done something to your head.</p>
              <p>.... i am repeating myself here: to say that something that disagrees with one's theological belief is NOT THE SAME as calling this thing satanic.</p>
              <p>.... but to each his own. I enjoy Eagles very much, even their latest album. They have already given their explanation of the lyrics but there will always be some who'd believe whatever they choose to believe. I have never heard of a SINGLE person that's influenced by Hotel California one way or another.</p>

              <p>So, say, I give you (and youtube) the benefit of doubt....that Hotel California IS SATANIC....</p>
              <p>I come up to you and shout in your face:</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Do you hear, subliminally:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Yeh, Satan hears this</span></p>

              </p><p> </p>
              <p><strong>This is important</strong>.... because it will determine if backmasking is<strong> INTENTIONAL</strong> - ie, the artistes (and their record producers) put in the sound themselves,</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>It is a <strong>PHENOMENAL</strong> of the English language... meaning, whether it's Glen Frey singing those words or Chin Eng saying it in front of you, the sound is the same.</p>
              <p>Again, assuming if all these are true..... how does it affect the individual...? We all need to consider the practical aspect of "brain washing"... how does it work???? How many known responsible individuals were affected by these lyrics.... I like Hotel California..... but I like J-pop more.... not kidding here... not to mention Sam Hui and Adam Cheng... whose concerts I attended recently.</p>
              <p>Beyond that, are we now saying that the brain is able to filter through the sound and automatically play the message backwards....?</p>
              <p>And that the message will cause us to do things that we don't normally do....???</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>If this is true.... I'd not attend the NATAS fair.... play it backward it's Satan all over again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">
              </p><p>If this be possible, I'd like for our media to insert the message: "I want to do well my mother tongue" so that my children can score well in their second language.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>....but back to your inconsistency.... Jimmy Page is your guitar hero inspite of all these??? gimme a break!</p>

              <p>err.... all mainstream songs only talk about love n s3x. JJ lin
              included.</p>
              <p>and pop music is pretty old already.</p>
              <p>and hip hop(or Rap as it should be called) has like mainly two kinds. Gangsta rap n  South
              coast hip hop. Gansta rap usually talks about cars, girls and
              bling. South coast rap, on the other hand, usually rap about social
              issues, like social commentaries.</p>
              <p>and besides, i have heard hip hop-ish christian music.</p>
              <p>so please get your things right. fyi, i am freethinker.</p>

              <p>It's up to the individuals read up and decide whether to believe in Wiki, the Christian Pastors' warning or the pschologists' views on sublimation and backmasking.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>i think you've provided enough information.... only from one side of the fence.</p>
              <p>as responsible Christians, we need to be objective.</p>
              <p>i am not at all saying that wiki, or the internet is a good source.... neither am i saying that Christian pastors or psychologists are good sources either. more often than not, warnings that come from such people are based on their current opinion of a given issue. such opinions are often ill-informed or bias.</p>
