              You obviously do not know what you are talking about, even if not from a relegious point of view.
              
              If I'm vegetarian and my friends are not, does it mean my friends are against me?

              <p>o Ongsoosiang Jesus is not vegetarian Jesus is God <img alt="tongue.png" width="20" height="20">He is one without taint and
              sin and He is God. Well by the way His face radiated immense light so He is
              God.</p>
              <p>I'm a witness to that.</p>
              <p>u gotta be kidding right??Moses face radited immense light that he had to scarf his face eventually..based on your above example, Jesus's face readiated much less light for many saw his face. so that made moses more of a god than jesus..</p>
              <p>Jesus wasnt a vegetarian.hes a humantarian.hmm vegetarian means eat only veggies,that makes humantarian eats only humans? lets try again.. jesus followed what God has allowed which is to eat meat too.</p>
              <p>However, human biological make up and God's original purpose was for human to eat veggie.read genesis..he said to adam and eve to eat from all fruit trees..not a thing was mentioned about killing that delicious looking deer over the bushes or deep frying that noisy chicken running around.</p>
              <p>eventually we will be veggie eaters again in the paradise earth. just tahan til then lor.</p>
