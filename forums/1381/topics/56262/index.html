            <div class='col-md body'>Living Life from Accomplishment to Zeal<br>David Jeremiah<br><br>If someone looked at your life, what would they see? An attitude of hope, enthusiasm, and energy, or a chin perpetually on your chest in a posture of resignation and defeat? Are you the kind of person who spells "life," p-a-s-s-i-o-n, or the person who, when asked to define "apathy," says, "I don't know, and I don't care?"<br><br>No verse in the Bible better expresses the passion we should have for life than Colossians 3:23-24: <strong>"And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ."</strong> In these two verses we find four handles by which passion may be seized on a daily basis: <strong>the scope, strength, secret, and source of passion.</strong> This passage can become a Passion Principle for you as you go "from Accomplishment to Zeal" every day.<br><br>The Scope of Your Passion Note that Paul says, "whatever you do...." I don't think Paul meant whatever only in a spiritual sense, such as praying, singing, studying the Bible, and witnessing. Do you know what the word "whatever" means in the Greek? It means "whatever!" <strong>Everything we do in life should be done heartily as if we were doing it for the Lord.</strong><br><br>Are you that excited about your life? Don't make the mistake of dividing your life as a Christian into a "sacred" part and a "secular" part. All of the Christian's life is sacred-your spiritual life, your work, your hobbies, your entertainment-and should be done heartily as unto the Lord.<br><br>The Strength of Your Passion Do you have a sense of God's pleasure in all you do in life? Paul says that whatever we do-teaching, running, plumbing, "lawyering," preaching, parenting, "businessing," - we should do it "heartily." Do it with heart! <strong>We ought to be lion-hearted about life, attacking every day with the strength and vigor which comes only from the Lion of Judah, the Son of God Himself.</strong> That is the strength we have been given.<br><br>The Secret of Your Passion The secret of the Christian's passion is simple: <strong>Everything we do in life we do it "as to the Lord and not to men."</strong> The passion we put into any project or activity in life is a good reflection of how we esteem the One for whom we work.<br><br>Paul said, "For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ" (Galatians 1:10). Knowing that we serve a Savior who gave His all for us should ignite in us a passion to give our all for Him-whatever we do.<br><br>The Source of Your Passion <strong>The source of the Christian's passion is "the Lord Christ" whom we serve.</strong> All great developmental leaders say that it's impossible to impart passion to anyone. Instead, the challenge is to discover the passion that is already within and build on it-fan it into flame and make it come alive!<br><br>You've probably seen the popular slogan, ,Carpe diem, on posters and bumper stickers. It's the Latin phrase, "Seize the day," or "Make the most of the day." It's not bad advice, but seizing the day without seizing the Source of the day is like grabbing for air. Instead of Carpe diem, try Carpe deum - <strong>"Seize God" - and don't let go! He alone is the source of true passion for all you do in life.</strong><br><br>People are trying everything from A to Z to find reasons to get excited about life today. But if you are a Christian, you can live from "Accomplishment to Zeal" with genuine passion every day. Make Colossians 3:23-24 your Passion Principle for the coming year and see if it doesn't change your life-and your world as well.<br><br>This article was excerpted from Turning Points, Dr. David Jeremiah's Devotional Magazine.
