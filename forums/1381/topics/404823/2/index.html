              <p>toward the end of the article, there is an interesting article that captured my eyes :</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #ff0000; font-size: medium;"><strong>Religious Insights Concerning Jesus</strong></span></p>

              <p>are you acknowledging that jesus taught reincarnation and reincarnation is real ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;"> Jesus constantly taught the importance of good works of love to achieve spiritual growth. The idea that people achieve at-one-ment merely by giving verbal assent to Jesus, or by worshipping Jesus, or by merely believing in his name, or by believing in his work on the cross, is a gross distortion of his teachings. Having faith <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> Christ alone</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor.+13%3A2&amp;amp;NIV_version=yes&amp;amp;language=english"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;">means nothing</span></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;">.

              <p>are you acknowledging that faith alone is not good enough to enter heaven. from the above sentence, it says by good works and not just faith. if yes, i think there are many christians here have the wrong concept of christianity.</p>
              <p>so, in christianity :</p>
              <p>1) believe in reincarnation or no ?</p>
              <p>2) by good works or by faith alone can gain entry to heaven ?</p>
              <p>can TS clarify ?</p>

              <p>One more example, True christians obey and take the commandments seriously. But we are not saved by obeying the commandments but obeying commandements are still important.</p>
              <p>After all we are saved by faith not by obeying or observing the law.</p>
              <p>If u want to use the method of obeying commandments to save urselves, just breaking one commandment once in ur life are u are a law breaker and that's it. U go to hell.</p>

              <p>christianity has had its fair share of corrupted teachings...catholics have acknowledged that some of their early popes were corrupted in their teachings...to noe wad christianity realli teaches, we need to searchthe sacred text which is the bible...the bible has no records of reincarnation, rebirth or that heaven has many different levels...like i said before, although christians may be divided in certain doctrines, we agree on the fundamental teachings...the teachings of salvation by grace and not good works, virgin birth, Holy Trinity and having only one life(in other words no reincarnation) are some of the fundamentals christians across the world will agree upon...</p>

              <p>moreover fairyfairy, i have said this in my previous post that the source and reliability of the information you read has to be questioned...juz as how non-christians question christians on the reliability and source of their faith/information...</p>
