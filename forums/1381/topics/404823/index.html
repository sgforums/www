              <p>toward the end of the article, there is an interesting article that captured my eyes :</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium; color: #ff0000; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Religious Insights Concerning Jesus</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;"><img src="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1381/images/webmaster/icons/blue_dot.gif" border="0" alt="" width="6" height="6" align="middle">  Jesus teaching his disciples about the reincarnation of Elijah as John the Baptist:</span></p>
              <p>are you acknowledging that jesus taught reincarnation and reincarnation is real ?</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000;"> Jesus constantly taught the importance of good works of love to achieve spiritual growth. The idea that people achieve at-one-ment merely by giving verbal assent to Jesus, or by worshipping Jesus, or by merely believing in his name, or by believing in his work on the cross, is a gross distortion of his teachings. Having faith <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> Christ alone </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Cor.+13%3A2&amp;NIV_version=yes&amp;language=english"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000;">means nothing</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000;">. Having the faith <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> Christ means to become like Jesus through </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=luke+10%3A25-28&amp;NIV_version=yes&amp;language=english"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000;">living a life of love and good works</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000;"> toward everyone.</span></p>
              <p>are you acknowledging that faith alone is not good enough to enter heaven. from the above sentence, it says by good works and not just faith. if yes, i think there are many christians here have the wrong concept of christianity.</p>
              <p>so, in christianity :</p>
              <p>1) believe in reincarnation or no ?</p>
              <p>2) by good works or by faith alone can gain entry to heaven ?</p>
              <p>can TS clarify ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> I saw the Christian heaven. We expect it to be a beautiful place, and you stand in front of the throne, worshipping forever. I tried it. It is boring!  This is all we are going to do? It is childlike. I do not mean to offend anyone. Some heavens are very interesting, and some are very boring. I found the ancient ones to be more interesting, like the Native American ones, the Happy Hunting Grounds. The Egyptians have fantastic ones. It goes on and on. There are so many of them. In each of them there is a fractal that is your particular interpretation, unless you are part of the group soul that believes in only the God of a particular religion. Then you are very close, in the same ball park together. But even then, each is a little bit different. That is a part of yourself that you leave there. Death is about life, not about heaven.</span></p>
              <p>this guy said there are many heavens, it tallies with what the buddbism said ! it said there are 34 heavens (if i remebered the number correctly). i'm not saying christianity is wrong and buddhism is right. i'm just trying to say what a buddhist told me before, all the religions are pointing to the same route, it is we human beings who distort everything to suit our benefits. after reading this guy's article, it think what that buddhist said was correct.</p>

              <p>if this link is just merely talking about meeting jesus minus other "non-christianity" stuffs, i think many christians will wish to acknowledge that it is real. again, this just got to show humans are trying to pick and choose what they like to hear or believe. if you see this clip positively, it is not trying to prove christianity is wrong, it is trying to prove jesus is real.</p>
              <p>touch wood, if one day, you meet jesus and jesus tell you the same "non-christianity" stuffs like reincarnation, ghosts path and many heavens etc. i wonder what is your reaction. may be you will think that person is not the jesus that you are worshipping. anyway, all these are just assumptions. </p>

              Hi all, :) truth is truth after all. Not wat you think or thought, not wat your belief is. 
              
              The world presents to u or when u landed there, is cause by the state of mind. Hell is created by state of mind too. The example above shows him netural and is able to observe all creations of heaven.
              
              The link contains alot of answers that we want to know veri much. Sometimes it take years to understand. If certain things present to yourself may not have an answer, put aside this question. Remember tis question which u really wanna know the answers. Maybe someday the answer will show itself to u. God bless us All :)
