              <p><sup id="en-NIV-26036" class="versenum">1</sup>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word <strong><em>was with</em></strong> God, and<em><strong> the Word was God</strong></em>. <sup id="en-NIV-26037" class="versenum">2</sup><em><strong>He was with God</strong></em> in the beginning.  <sup id="en-NIV-26038" class="versenum">3</sup>Through him all things were made; without him <em><strong>nothing was made that has been made</strong></em>.</p>
              <p>The doctrine of the Trinity means that there is one God who eternally
              exists as three distinct Persons--the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
              Stated differently, God is one in essence and three in person.</p>

              <p>To truly grow in spirituality and goodness of heart and spirit/soul, we need to grow in understanding beyond pure words and text. Too much emphasis, debate and energy go into written words, while the spirit/soul still remains the same, waiting to grow and see true Light.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, whether a person believes that Jesus was son of God, or was God himself, is not as important as the person who aims to have a heart and spirit/soul like Jesus or God. God/Creator/Source and Jesus wanted to teach Man to be like them in spirit/soul. Instead it has been interpreted as they wanted to teach Man to worship them as untouchable holies that we feel we cannot be.</p>

              <p>Always remember the Bible is written by someone long ago, in another language, and then some of it translated into Hebrew, and re-translated into English, and edited.</p>

              <p>Always remember the Bible is written by someone long ago, in
              another language, and then some of it translated into Hebrew, and
              re-translated into English, and edited.</p>
              <p>Therefore when you read it, you must try to figure out
              what  just what the passage is trying to tell you.</p>

              <p>Wasn't the Hebrew Bible (OT) originally written in Biblical Hebrew?</p>
              <p>So do you agree that in the process of translating, there is the possibility of words being mistranslated or edited to serve other purposes?</p>
              <p>When you ask a group of people to figure out what a passage is about, I'm sure you will get different interpretations maybe not all of them but some, so who can say others' interpretations are wrong? Should the majority rule be evoked?</p>

              <p>Note that 2 of the 3 diff forms you mention are of the different time periods, and the word to describe such a personality would be capricious. Anyone can choose to believe something, like those who may somehow think that we live in a matrix-like world. While you are able to believe it, common sense dictates that you should be discerning as to whether or not you do.</p>

              <p>Concepts of man-gods have been around for centuries before the supposed time of jesus, aka demigods in the greek religion. Virgin births, resurrections etc are all typical stories repeated in mythology, why should I choose to disregard what the greeks, romans etc believe and assert that christianity is correct?</p>
              <p>Another point that i would like to raise is that; even if christianity and judaism were the first monotheistic religions with original sets of teachings and principals (which they do and are not), it provides no basis for belief. It would be assuming that every original idea is correct</p>
