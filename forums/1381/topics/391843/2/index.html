              <p>It ORIGINALLY MEANS that Adam lived 930 years. LITERALLY. How can you say number unknown when it is clearly stated he lived till 930?? What else would this verse be trying to say other than how long Adam lived. What do you have to back what you have just posted. Me thinks you have over thought the issue here.</p>

              <p>if i dun get this thing wrong, the reason why he said it cannot be taken literally is cos living in the AD years makes it illogical to believe tat humans could actually live tat long...i mean the world record for mortality is abt 150years old???tats a far cry from adam's age when he died...</p>

              <p>What other logic would one use? There is hardly any other systems that can be counted upon to actually produce results. When something exists outside the realm of logic and evidence, it most likely is a fairytale. One may try to justify reasons about how god <span style="text-decoration: underline;">might</span> exist, but if the explanation is illogical, how can the reasons actually be considered justified?</p>

              <p>Well you're still human, and I feel that to follow such "religiously inspired" logic is undoubtedly dangerous. Logically what kind of person would strap bombs around his chest and blow himself up in a subway? Only one with a sub-par logic standard would attempt something like that. Of course I am not saying that everyone is going to become a terrorist, but to point out that religious standard logic would be said to be very foolish indeed</p>

              <p>your logic is the same as the buddhism. i read about buddha pointed to a cup of water and told his disciples that there were 840,000 (i think is this number) of micro organisms in it. it said it was not exactly this number but to denote many or countless. so i agree with your logic that 930 years is to denote adam lived to ripe old age.</p>

              <p>think of tis...if the essence of christianity is salvation by grace while the essnece of most other religions(buddhism in this case) is salvation/enlightenment thru good karma/works, then can u still view christianity in the light of buddhism? the reverse is also true...which is why when i view buddhism, i dun use christianity as a gauge...this is the last time i am going to tok abt viewing christianity diff. if u still insist on ur way, then all the best...</p>

              <p>dun say i didnt help u...christianity teaches salvation by grace while most other religions teach salvation by gd works...buddhism teaches getting enlightened also thru accumulating of gd karma...one pt to note is that the emphasis of buddhism is not to get to heaven...reaching nirvana is diff from getting to heaven...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>think of tis...if the essence of christianity is salvation by grace while the essnece of most other religions(buddhism in this case) is salvation/enlightenment thru good karma/works, then can u still view christianity in the light of buddhism? the reverse is also true...which is why when i view buddhism, i dun use christianity as a gauge...this is the last time i am going to tok abt viewing christianity diff. if u still insist on ur way, then all the best...</p>

              <p>may be you can explain why there is a need for jesus to preach the 10 commandments. did he say it is good if you follow the 10 commandments and it is absolutely fine if you don't as long as you believe in him and you will be saved.</p>
              <p>if jesus did not preach the 10 commandments, i will agree with you that salvation by grace.</p>

              <p>like i said, i approached buddhism not on the basis on grace since it doesnt teach salvation by grace...i approached it from the perspective of good works...do i agree wif buddhism? mostly not...but tat doesnt mean i refuse to try understanding it based on its essence...if i had tried understanding it based on grace, i would nvr have grasped even its fundamentals...</p>

              <p>Chrisitianity may have some difference in its teachings, yet majority of it can be said to have been interpolated from other sources, down to the very story of Jesus. How many can claim that good works don't play any role in chrisitianity, and afterall, Christianity is essentially highly simillar to the thousands of religions over the ages that have floated around. One may choose to see it differently, but in the end, Christianity is still a religion.</p>
