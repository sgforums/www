Because if you look at history, the Israelites and later the Jews are constantly falling into idolatory!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So what now? Jeer at God for His failed experiment in cultivating righteous human?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There are reasons why the law was given. In Judaism, nothing is taken for granted, no one is told to suspend his or her belief. In fact, there are reasons why the 10 statements (which Christians call the 10 commandments) are given. If you understand it, it is actually very beautiful. Well, obviously Christians don't understand it. That's why they think the law is a curse, since no one can fulfill even the 10 commandments.<br><br>Anyway, one reason why the law was given is that God wanted to set aside a group of people to be the light of the world. During the Messianic age, they will be the people gentiles will turn to. Before that, they will be a witness to God. For example, the observance of Sabbath, one of the "10 commandments", is to commemorate the creation of the world. Are they successful? I'd say so. Now most people associate Sabbath with "they rest because God rested on the seventh day of creation".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Historically the law is what kept the Jewish people alive. The law is their identity. It doesn't matter whether you are a Jew in Spain, or a Jew in Poland, you keep the same law. If you convert to Christianity or renounce your faith, too bad for you, you are out of the league. Just think for a moment - if the Jews mass-convert to Christianity in 33AD .. will there still be Israel in 1948? Will there still be the holocaust? Most probably not .. because you can't identity who is Jewish and who is not!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>To this day, they are the only nation that has been destroyed and came back again.
