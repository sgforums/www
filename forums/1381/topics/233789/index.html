            <div class='col-md body'>I heard many catholics don't read their bibles so how many types or no of bibles also no use bcos not read at all. They depend on their priests to give interpretation. This also applies to Christians of all denominations who don't read their bibles and depend on pastors to give the interpretation. This is like the dark ages when the bible is not avail to commoners and the interpretation is subject to the church authorities who often abuse their power over the people's ignorance.</div>

U cant even agree the nature of Christ...some reject the Trinity etc. Even some protestants hold on to Once Saved Always Saved, some to Lutherans Faith Alone, others to the Catholic, Faith and Works. A Lutheran believe in the Real Presence while the Pentecostal do not. An Anglican hold fast to Apostolic Succession while the Methodost do not. Each contradict the other. For one denomination to be right, the others have to be wrong.<br><br>2) The Church does as Christ gave the Spirit to the Church and the powers of binding and loosing to the Apostles and her successors and the KEYS to Peter. The Church does is the pillar of truth and not Scripture in 1 Tim 3:15. Furthermore, the Church will not hold on to Sola Scriptura as it is not explicitly mentioned in Scripture, it cannot explains the New Testament Canon, it was not held by any Christian till the Reformation. I dont think Christ would have left us in darkness till 1500s.<br><br>3) Catholics do not worship mary. We ask mary to intercede for us as u ask ur pastor to pray for you. Those dogmas still exist today. While the wolves in sheep clothings have abused those dogmas, the dogmas in essence is true. To make it clear, indulgence is correct but the man-made doctrine of indlugence being sold (not taught by the Church) was prevalent. you cannot blame the Church for these.<br><br>4) The Catholic Church existed since 33AD. I shall prove it to you.<br><br><blockquote>"See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Christ Jesus does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles. Do ye also reverence the deacons, as those that carry out the appointment of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. <strong>Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church</strong>." Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrneans, 8:2 (c. A.D. 110).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">St Ignatius was a student of the Apostle Peter and john and lived thru Apostolic Times and was a matry.</span><br><br>"[A]ll the people wondered that there should be such a difference between the unbelievers and the elect, of whom this most admirable<strong> Polycarp was one, having in our own times been an apostolic and prophetic teacher, and bishop of the Catholic Church which is in Smyrna</strong>. For every word that went out of his mouth either has been or shall yet be accomplished." Martyrdom of Polycarp, 16:2 (A.D. 155).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Polycarp was the favourite student of Apostle John.</span><br>Â“Â…to be in honour however with the<strong> Catholic Church for the ordering of ecclesiastical discipline</strong>...one to the Laodicenes, another to the Alexandrians, both <strong>forged in Paul's name to suit the heresy of Marcion, and several others, which cannot be received into the Catholic Church</strong>; for it is not fitting that gall be mixed with honey. <strong>The Epistle of Jude no doubt, and the couple bearing the name of John, are accepted by the Catholic Churc</strong>h...But of Arsinous, called also Valentinus, or of Militiades we receive nothing at all.Â” The fragment of Muratori (A.D. 177).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Catholic Church chose which books were Scripture.</span><br><br>"[N]or does it consist in this, that he should again falsely imagine, as being above this [fancied being], a Pleroma at one time supposed to contain thirty, and at another time an innumerable tribe of Aeons, as these teachers who are destitute of truly divine wisdom maintain; <strong>while the Catholic Church possesses one and the same faith throughout the whole world</strong>, as we have already said." Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1:10,3 (A.D. 180).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">St irenaus who the student of Polycarp and the hammer of the gnostics. the CC even then possesed ONE faith.</span><br><br>Â“For it is evident that those men lived not so long ago,--<strong>in the reign of Antoninus for the most part</strong>,--and that they at first were believers in the doctrine of the <strong>Catholic Church, in the church of Rome under the episcopate of the blessed Eleutherus</strong>, until on account of their ever restless curiosity, with which they even infected the brethren, they were more than once expelled.Â” Tertullian, On the Prescription Against Heretics, 22,30 (A.D. 200).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We see Church Authority.</span></blockquote>And hence it was the Church who selected which books were scripture and which books was heretic and burnt it. This also disproves Sola Scriptura,<br><br>5)The Bibles cost nearly 20yrs salary of a peasant. it took 3 yrs to copy it hand by ahnd from the monks. And the Church translated it into the many languages long before the Reformation. Show me an example where u claim the atrocity has happened. And lastly, this proves Sola Scriptura cannot work till the printing press was invented as no one had Bible.</div>
