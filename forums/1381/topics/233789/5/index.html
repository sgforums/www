Just as Isaiah said the Deliverer will Â“take away sins,Â” so Zecharaih says that Jesus would grant Â“the forgiveness of sinsÂ” (Luke 1:77). Just as Jeremiah (who Paul quotes in Romans 11:27) said that God will establish his Â“covenantÂ” with the Jews, Zechariah says that God has remembered Â“his holy covenantÂ” in Christ (Luke 1:72). All these parallels, and many more, proves Christ is the Messiah and the establishment of the New Convenant.<br><br>Paul warned the Jews that they were cut off the vine because of thier UNBELIEF....</div></blockquote>and in the same chapter, Paul also said that God could have easily graft them back, and also that Israel will be saved.</div>
