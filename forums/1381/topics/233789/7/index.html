I suppose there are two understanding to the word. One is the earthly institution, i.e. the Catholic Church with the ecclesiastical hierarchy set out in the NT. The other is the fellowship of all believers. This one is invisible, no boundary, without walls.<br><br>The early church (or should I say earliest church) is not that concerned with the church as institution. In fact it is argued that the earliest church is charismatic, with no visible hierarchy because the Apostle Paul did not address the leader in his letters to the various churches.<br><br>The reason is clear. Go read up on reputable scholarship on the early church. They should mention something called the <strong>parousia</strong>.<br><br>3.

The only thing is question we have here is not can the saints who are still alive physically to interced or pray for each other, but rather can we ask those are are physically dead (or what Paul refered to as alseep) for this purpose.<br><br>2) you can go read the history books yourself, and see what are the teachings thae had changed, what are the teachings that was ok by one pope before but outlawed by the subsequent pope.<br><br>3) you know what how teachings and writings was preseved during the early times? by manual copying. what we have today from the early church teachings are manual copies, and who copy them? the scribes. then which writtings get to be preserved? who to decide? of course, only those that was taken as the norm by the authorities got to be preserved and emphasised on? don't blame anyone about this, we are all human, and human biased.<br>The doctrine never exist, a counter position never preach OR the church authorities don't allow questionings or contridictions?<br><br>4) I have not said, lets discard the church fathers writings or teachings, questioning them does not means discarding them, condictory to your understanding, questioning them only allow us to understand them better. Just like the Breans honor Paul by checking if his teaching is according to the Scriptures and was commented for their act, we honor the church fathers by questioning and checking on their teachings.<br><br>5) Doctrines that was not teach before, as long as its inline with the Scripture (check and double check required) does not means it wrong, its called pregressive revelations. by the way, there are doctrines in taught in the Catholic Church today that was not even taught during the days of the Apostles, so how?<br><br>ok... I shall slap myself for posting this, this shall be my last discussion with you, since you had already concluded that I am not into discussion...<br>Let the rest of the brethens here be the judge...</div>
