In other words, they are interceding.<br><br>-If u disagree, explain to me what the Saints are doing exactly in rev 5.<br><br><strong>Secondly, why must Christians pray for another if they can easily intercede to the Father?</strong><br><br>- You have conceded that it is a must for Christian to intercede for another by quoting the Scripture,<br><br><blockquote>1 Timothy 2:1-7 (NRSV)<br>1 <strong>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone</strong>, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity. 3 <strong>This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God</strong> our Savior, 4 who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and humankind, Christ Jesus, himself human, 6 who gave himself a ransom for all ?this was attested at the right time. 7 For this I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. </blockquote>- Isnt the act of interceding running counter to your argument of one intercessor and that is Christ. So hence, the principle behind the Catholic position is sound.<br><br>- Therefore, although Jesus Christ is the sole mediator between God and man, there are many intercessors (subordinate mediators).<br><br>- Clearly, then, intercessory prayers offered by Christians (and the Saints who are glorified Christians) on behalf of others is something "good and pleasing to God," not something infringing on ChristÂ’s role as mediator.<br><br><strong>The next argument you brought out was the fact that there is a distinction beween Saints and Christians.</strong><br><br>- Clearly the Saints are Christians and are part of the Catholic Church through the Communion of the Saints. They are Christians and are part of the Holy Apostolic Church. Have u not recited the Apostles Creed which clearly states it. The Saints are Christians and since Christians according to Scripture should be praying for another, there is nothing wrong with intercession to the Saints.<br><br><strong>Fourthly, you claim the Apostles never interceded to the Saints and why shoudl we.</strong><br><br>- Why would they need to ask glorified christians for intercession when they are walking with God.<br><br>- Do we not see in Scripture that the Apostles ask for intercession by their fellow Christians. Doesnt this destroy your heresy?<br><br><strong>Why should we ask any Christian, in heaven or on earth, to pray for us when we can ask Jesus directly?</strong><br><br>- If the mere fact that we can go straight to Jesus proved that we should ask no Christian in heaven to pray for us then it would also prove that we should ask no Christian on earth to pray for us.<br><br>- Praying for each other is simply part of what Christians do<br><br>- The New Testament would not recommend it if there were not benefits coming from it. One such benefit is that the faith and devotion of the saints can support our own weaknesees and supply what is lacking in our own faith and devotion.<br><br>- Aren't the prayers of the  rightoues poweerful? Those Christians in heaven are more righteous, (since they have been made perfect to stand in GodÂ’s presence) than anyone on earth, meaning their prayers would be even more efficacious.<br><br><strong>Lastly, have the Church Fathers been living a lie?</strong><br><br>"Thus might you console us; but what of the flock? Would you first promise the oversight and leadership of yourself, a man under whose wings we all would gladly repose, and for whose words we thirst more eagerly than men suffering from thirst for the purest fountain? Secondly, persuade us that the good shepherd who laid down his life for the sheep has not even now left us; but is present, and tends and guides, and knows his own, and is known of his own, and, though bodily invisible, is spiritually recognized, and defends his flock against the wolves, and allows no one to climb over into the fold as a robber and traitor; to pervert and steal away, by the voice of strangers, souls under the fair guidance of the truth. <strong>Aye, I am well assured that his intercession is of more avail now than was his instruction in former days, since he is closer to God, now that he has shaken off his bodily fetters, and freed his mind from the clay which obscured it, and holds intercourse naked with the nakedness of the prime and purest Mind; being promoted, if it be not rash to say so, to the rank and confidence of an angel." </strong>John Chrysostom, On the Death of his Father, Oration 18:4 (A.D. 374).<br><br>"Furthermore, as to mentioning the names of the dead, how is there anything very useful in that? What is more timely or more excellent than that those who are still here should believe that the departed do live, and that they have not retreated into nothingness, <strong>but that they exist and are alive with the Master...Useful too is the prayer fashioned on their behalf...For we make commemoration of the just and of sinners: of sinners, begging God's mercy for them</strong>; of the just and the Fathers and Patriarchs and Prophets and Apostles and Evangelists and martyrs and confessors, and of bishops and solitaries, and of the whole list of them..." Epiphanius, Panarion, 75:8 (A.D. 377).<br><br><strong>Catholic vs. the Protestant approach to relationship with Jesus</strong><br><br>Scenario 1: If someone falls in love and they say:<br>I love you so much. I love you so much that I want to spend all my time with you. I never want to talk to your mother. I never want to see your family or friends. I want you to banish them when they come around, I just want to spend my whole life with you and love you.<br><br>That's how I understand the Protestant take on a relationship to Jesus.<br><br>Scenario 2: On the other hand he could say:<br>I love you so much. I love you so much that I want to spend my time with you. Your mom is welcome to visit our home. Your family is my family, your friends are my friends. The people you love, I will love. We are one flesh and I welcome everyone you welcome.<br><br>I think the second one sounds like a more authentic love. I think this is the Catholic approach to a relationship with Jesus.<br></div>

So hence, the principle behind the Catholic position is sound.<br><br>- Therefore, although Jesus Christ is the sole mediator between God and man, there are many intercessors (subordinate mediators).<br><br>- Clearly, then, intercessory prayers offered by Christians (and the Saints who are glorified Christians) on behalf of others is something "good and pleasing to God," not something infringing on ChristÂ’s role as mediator.<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>1 Timothy 2:1-7 (NRSV)<br>1 First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity. 3 This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. <strong>5 For there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and humankind, Christ Jesus, himself human, 6 who gave himself a ransom for all ?this was attested at the right time. </strong> 7 For this I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.<br></blockquote>you quote me here,<br>ok,<br>1) read the verses probably, it says <strong> one mediator between God and humankind, Christ Jesus</strong>, it did not says one intercessor.<br><br>Nic, you are confused with your thoughts, in Protestants practices, there is no dispute about praying for each other, or asking someone else you trust to pray for you.<br><br>Here is the differences...<br>the dispute is, can one who is alive, ask someone who is dead to pray or interceed? to some of us, this is not possible and should not be done.<br>of course, to a catholic, its ok to pray to the dead saints to pray to Christ to pray to the Father...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So the ONE SOLE difference in our position is whether the DEAD SAINTS can intercede for us...<br><br>My answer to that is that God is God of the living and hence those who have gained eternal life are far more ALIVE than us.<br><br><strong>Objection 1: The Saints are dead and are hence separated from us both physically and spiritually.</strong><br><br>Rebuttal: Saints are alive and glorified Christians. They have eternal life and are nearer to God and hence can intercede for us as other Christians on Earth do. Scripture clearly shows that those in heaven who offer to God our prayers arenÂ’t just angels, but humans as well. John sees that "the twenty-four elders [the leaders of the people of God in heaven] fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints" (Rev. 5:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. The simple fact is, as this passage shows: The saints in heaven offer to God the prayers of the saints on earth. Saints are hence not separated from the Church but are part of it. And they will continue to help and pray for the Church Militant on Earth. It is most repulsive to say Saints are separated from us when we are ONE in christ.<br><br>Clearly Scripture shows that the angels and saints experience joy in heaven over our repentance, then they are still connected to us and are aware of our behavior.<br><br><blockquote>Luke 15:7,10<br>I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance...In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</blockquote><strong>Objection 2: Its not the saints that is offering the prayers, its the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders, eventhough its called prayers of the saints.</strong><br><br>Rebuttal: On the contrary, Scripture clearly points that is the Saints who offers and give those prayers.<br><br><blockquote>Rev 8:3<br>Another angel came and stood at the altar,  holding a gold censer. He was given a great quantity of incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the saints, on the gold altar that was before the throne. The smoke of the incense along with the prayers of the saints went up before God from the hand of the angel.<br><br>Rev 5:8<br>When he took it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each of the elders held a harp and gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints. </blockquote>2 separate verses clearly proves that it is the Saints who are offering and giving up prayers to God. These prayers Â“rise upÂ” before God and elicit various kinds of earthly activity. God responds to his childrenÂ’s requests, whether made by his children on earth or in heaven. Logically, there is no denying that it is the Saints who makes the prayers.<br><br><strong>Objection 3: The Saints are merely praying for themselves.</strong><br><br>Rebuttal: The Saints will not be praying for themselves or any heavenly being as they are already glorified. There is no need to pray for any other glorifed christian. Hence they must be praying for someone. There is only 2 possible areas to pray for:<br><br>The Damned - But the damned are already punished and its impossible to save them<br><br>The Church Militant - Possible to pray for them as they are fighting of Satan and are in need of heaven's help<br><br>It is hence clear that they must be praying for us, the Chuch Militant. Their prayers and intercession can benefit the Church Militant by helping us grow stronger in faith. It is hence impossible for them to pray for either the damned or those in heaven.<br><br><strong>Objection 4: We can go to Jesus directly and still obtain it.</strong><br><br>Rebuttal: Of course one should pray directly to Jesus! But that does not mean it is not also a good thing to ask others to pray for one as well. Ultimately, the "go-directly-to-Jesus" objection boomerangs back on the one who makes it: Why should we ask any Christian, in heaven or on earth, to pray for us when we can ask Jesus directly? If the mere fact that we can go straight to Jesus proved that we should ask no Christian in heaven to pray for us then it would also prove that we should ask no Christian on earth to pray for us. Do you see the ironies of your position...the contradictory nature of your stance.<br><br>If your position is true, there will be no need to ask others to pray for you hence making St Paul's continous asking for prayer merely superficious. Instead we are told by James that prayers of the righteous are powerful. Why would he say that is the 'go directly to Jesus' school of thought is true? So how much more powerful is the prayer of one who is already Glorified in heaven and closer to God.<br><br><strong>Objection 5: It is possible for the Church Fathers to err.</strong><br><br>I totally agree with this. The Church Fathers are not infallible. However, what i seek to prove is to show that the Church has held such a position and taught it since the first few centuriess. Christ has promised to be with his Church and not leave us orphan nor let the gates of hell prevail against it. Surely if the doctrine is false, then every Christian was being taught a lie and are material heretics. Such a stance is accusing the Apostle Paul of being a liar when he called the Church the pinnacle of Truth. Ultimately, are u accusing the One and Only Church at that time to be teaching heresy?<br><br>In conclusion, our key difference is that the Catholic beleive in the communion of the saints and those on Earth wheras the Protestant condemns them as dead and death and naturally, mute.<br><br></div>
