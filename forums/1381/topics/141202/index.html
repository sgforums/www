            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Are you trying out God, or<br>are you SOLD OUT TO GOD?<br>The difference is faith<br>instead of hope so.</strong><br><br>No unbelief or distrust made him waver (doubtingly<br>question) concerning the promise of God, but he<br>grew strong and was empowered by faith as he gave<br>praise and glory to God, fully satisfied and assured that<br>God was able and mighty to keep His word<br>and to do what He had promised.<br>ROMANS 4:20, 21<br><br>IF YOU HAVE not surrendered your heart completely to God your faith will not stand up to what life brings your way.You can't try God out to see whether you like Him in your life or not. Faith, to be real, must totally rely or lean on God. Abraham had God's promise that he would bear a son but his physical disabilities made it seem impossible.Yet, "He did not weaken in faith when he considered the [utter] impotence of his own body, which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old, or [when he considered] the barrenness of Sarah's [deadened] womb" (Romans 4:19). He looked through the difficulty and believed that the word from God was greater. Join Abraham and know that because you believe your faith is reckoned to you as righteousness, a right standing with God!<br></div>

Now I decided enuff was enuff. I can't be forever angry with GOD. I think having faith and a positive attitude to wanting to know GOD helps. I may not have a lot of faith, but if i keep positive it can grow. I think GOD is very patient with all of us. One may not have faith but GOD's faith is always with u. He will never forsake u.<br><br></div>
