If that pastor wasnt listening to God who was he listening to? U can say personal failing but i always suspect some demonic interference as well. Well i didnt say all was possessed but some might be seduced that's all.<br><br>As i said, i didnt just say possession but also seduction or temptation. David was definitely tempted by the devil using Bathsheba. He listened to him &amp; he fell. He cannot tell God :" God ah! The devil made me do it leh! I am not at fault what!" He is to blame himself that's why he fasted &amp; mourned &amp; prayed but still his baby died.<br><br>As u said, the devil can contort our desires, even healthy desires like eating, sleeping or sex. So can i presume without the devil, we wont have so much problems with our desires bcos some are healthy anyway?<br><br>I didnt blame devil for every prob but look at book of Job &amp; u know he may just be involved anyway somehow whether direct or indirect.</div></blockquote>These are the 3 guidelines of MC's theology. (re-enforced)<br>Anything other than that, it would be cause of other reasons and that affect the Leaders which went beyond the guidelines.<br>The 3 Guidelines are to give Spiritual Leaders the benefit of doubt, otherwise, there will have lots of Spiritual Leaders in church being seduced, possessed or tempted...whatever you want to phrase it.<br><br>There are some point of Leader's life when they did things by their own strength or over-emphaised or form doctrines thru their own personal revelations.<br><br>1)To Err in teaching DOES NOT mean Possessed (possession = completely control by demons and minimal self will)<br>2)They might be possibly be seduced by wrong spirits.<br>3)Yes Leaders and Pastor are also prone to mistakes and taking wrong steps. Because humans are falliable afterall.<br><br>You're not totally wrong. I do have some points which i can agree with you on.<br>If you're interested to discuss on Works of Spiritual Realm. We can have another topic discussing on it.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
