NO ONE ever can... all religions have their bibles, scriptures, quran, whatever ... but if someone claims to belong to one religion but is a really evil person, i dont believe that religion can protect him from any thing... in christianity, i think they believe in GOD, their punishment is burning in eternal hell... as a buddhist, i believe in something called karma... meaning for every action, there is an outcome... and i guess thats life, doesnt matter which religion you are from, no point arguing, as long as in your heart, you try your very best to be a well being... thats my point of view...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></span></div>

They may be equally likely to have banned slavery or stop stoning women which is against god word, tat is why they r being punished.<br><br><blockquote>which highlights the importance that Scripture has to be read with the understanding of language, culture, context, styles as well as tradition. </blockquote>however trying to interprete the bible to your side and saying tat we have to read your way to suit your need is a bit... baised.

            <div class='col-md body'>if you want to talk abt verbs, nouns and meaning of words, go join the spelling bee contest. i believe this is a forum discussing chrsitianity issues. i believe the topic is about whether the nature of gay is planned by God, from the begining?<br><br>i believe, because it is written in the bible, *bearing in mind that this is a christian forum, not a dictionary debate club* that God find the acts of gayness, perverse and evil. they can be nice people, i very much believe so, but it gives no excuse that it is wrong. a child can steal, although the child is sweet in nature, but the act of stealing is wrong. so the perverse act of gayness, is wrong, even if the people are good people. thats why, God loves the people. but hates the sins. is my english good enough a standard for you to comprehend that? or are you so enclosed in your own world of perfect A1s for english that you can't understand what i am saying.<br><br>personally. if you want to debate about the existance of God, i can introduce you to a group of renowned scientists, who can explain to you about creation. and the backings la. been to one of their talks a few years back.<br><br>but from my own experiences, people just refuse God's existance, *furtile, cuz its like you denying my existance, even though i am really existing, but you are just going into denial mode "dumbdumb don't exist... dumbdumb don't exist..."*, for the sake of denying... even if the facts hit them in the face like a ton of bricks, they just refuse to.<br><br>like i said, throughout my experiences. there are 3 kinds of people who deny God's existance,<br><br>the really ignorant<br><br>the ones who just refuse to believe, even if they see it *sounds like you doesn't it?*<br><br>and the ones who are just plain retarded and stupid.<br><br>honestly evaluate yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>you may say "what does my denial of God's existance got to do with the issue at hand? you are just a DUMBDUMB!"<br><br>i am arrowing you the fact that because you deny God's existance, you are just seeing the world how you want to see the world, like gay is alright etc. but the world definitely makes more sense when God is placed into the equation *i hope your maths is as good as your english*<br><br>like how God made adam and eve, and not adam and steve. sex is for reproduction, why we should treat our bodies well, why we shouldn't murder, steal, why we must respect our parents.. etc.<br><br>when you remove God out of the equation of life, in your own lil world of "god doesn't exist in my world" you start doing things your own way, which brings hurts, pains, and suffering into the world. thats called sin. are you following me?<br><br>and the people thought it's alright to stuff their lil equiptments into each others' asses for pleasure, people thought its alright to "borrow" without asking *or returning* people thought its alright to "kill a person of a different race.."<br><br>you see? everyone thinks its alright to do something, because it may feel right to them, but yet it isn't right. its called sin.<br><br>and having a better education won't make the world a better place, singing micheal jackson's heal the world, won't make the world a better place, only one thing can make the world a better place. and its simply, us. but we are so crappy in nature, we hurt one another etc etc.. its becuz we are imperfect. but God can change us, cleanse us from the penalty of sin, which is death, and as we grow, and walk in His ways, not our ways, we will bring healing wherever we go. real christians will never intentionally hurt others, unless its for their own good. even if they do, they will want to make amends. to make things right between people. do you get it? or is your mind so vast, what i said got lost in some black hole you call your brain?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>seriously, if you just want to prove your command of english is better than us, then just leave la. if its any consolation to you, i suck thumb la, i lose ok? my english lousier than you..<br><br>"powderful" english = more logic?<br><br>hardly. i can make more sense than you, using my "lehs", "lars", and "lohs".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>its my nature to speak my mind, i've said whatever i want to say, you can be hurt, and go "since dumbdumb made fun of me, i shall be stubbon.." or you can grow up, find out for yourself how much i said is truth. i'm not even gonna bother to tell you to do anything, you should go find out for yourself. pfft.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorree for the long wait<br><br><blockquote>3 archaic : to have sexual intercourse with </blockquote>Although u can not prove to me whether it is just "know" as in "know", neither am I able to show u tat tis "know" is not sexual intercourse.<br><br>However need to ask another question, before someone actually says tat new testaments fulfil old testaments. However on the issue of slavery, it is again supported by new testaments as well. Since now obviously there r no slavery and most christians now do not support slavery. isn't tat a sign of changing rules ? Not only tat bibles have been wrong about things such as sun revolves around the earth too. I believe there has been changes from the new testaments to now, why doesn't the issue of gays evolved ?<br><br><blockquote>the Statement issued by National Council of Churches of Singapore </blockquote>i know wat is the official stand, I am just asking for the rationale of it<br><br><blockquote>if you want to talk abt verbs, nouns and meaning of words, go join the spelling bee contest. i believe this is a forum discussing chrsitianity issues. i believe the topic is about whether the nature of gay is planned by God, from the begining? </blockquote>How do u know whether the nature is planned by god or not unless u interprete your bible ? Tat is wat I and the others r doing isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote> believe, because it is written in the bible, *bearing in mind that this is a christian forum, not a dictionary debate club* that God find the acts of gayness, perverse and evil. they can be nice people, i very much believe so, but it gives no excuse that it is wrong. a child can steal, although the child is sweet in nature, but the act of stealing is wrong. so the perverse act of gayness, is wrong, even if the people are good people. thats why, God loves the people. but hates the sins. is my english good enough a standard for you to comprehend that? or are you so enclosed in your own world of perfect A1s for english that you can't understand what i am saying. </blockquote>Unlike most christian, I ask "where" is it written. I don't go and believe watever junk people told me unless I see it for myself.<br><br>Now on the issue of child stealing, I got to ask... why is being gays wrong ? From the bible they says losing virginity deserevs to be stoned to death while slavery, even slaves for sex is okie. So they can be conveniently forgotten while gays have to be taken seriosuly. Bible has also twist and turn its stand many times in the past too. Maybe in a hundred years they will say gays r right too. It is unlike most people claims, saying tat it is never changing, but like most human made policies, they change with time.<br><br>U say tat gays r sinful acts now, but then again is it wat god says or wat human interpreted ? Or worse still, invented ? we can see around how capable people r at in twisting scripture to fulfil their own agenda, why can't u see tat tis may be twisted too.<br><br><blockquote>personally. if you want to debate about the existance of God, i can introduce you to a group of renowned scientists, who can explain to you about creation. and the backings la. been to one of their talks a few years back. </blockquote>there has already been a debate about the existence of god in tis forum before.<br><br><blockquote>but from my own experiences, people just refuse God's existance, *furtile, cuz its like you denying my existance, even though i am really existing, but you are just going into denial mode "dumbdumb don't exist... dumbdumb don't exist..."*, for the sake of denying... even if the facts hit them in the face like a ton of bricks, they just refuse to. </blockquote>for dumbdumb case, there is a person writing or replying in tis forum. it is very real, u can see is existence and the things he do. for god is different. U see a sky and u say it is done by god, u see a stone u say it is done by him and u see yourself and u say it is done by him, even though u have no evidence, never see its existence or see him designing in the process. Everything they do not know, they say it is god who design it, which is a very convenient excuse. Different group of people have done tis too. Chinese, japanese, african and indians have come up with their own different version of god theories too. Frankly I felt tat I am the one surprised at people believing in god even though the facts had hit them hard on the face. Who is going into denial mode here ? There r people who just believe for the sake of believing even though the bible has many contradictions, flaws, inadequacies, logically wrong etc. In fact most don't even know it well in the first place. They just believe for believing.<br><br></div>

I can also say there r 3 types of christians too<br><br>1. They r borned as one, as their parents r one. they r brainwashed from a young age<br><br>2. They suffer a major setback in life such as getting incurable diesease or career setback. They rely on a religion because they can't stand the truth. This type of people will most likely end up more fanatic than others.<br><br>3. To be with christians. Friend and peers has been pushing them into religion.

They only make sense to people who become terrorists and bombed themselves or start a war because of religion. Aren't u seeing the world u want to see ? U want god to exists because only then will the truth hurts lesser ?

So u believe in men being more important than women ? Why shouldn't u murder etc ? because laws is there and they r there to preserve harmony and growth for human. We also respect our parents etc because we belieevs in ethics ourselves. U don't need god to tell u how to do good things, confucius is good enough.<br><br><blockquote>when you remove God out of the equation of life, in your own lil world of "god doesn't exist in my world" you start doing things your own way, which brings hurts, pains, and suffering into the world. thats called sin. are you following me? </blockquote>tat is a very wrong misconception. We believes in rules and we believe in helping others and we believe in living in a group. There r probably many people with no religion too. R they going around killing people etc ? On the other hand, religion can manipulate people. Religion can make people start wars, massacre and terrorists.
