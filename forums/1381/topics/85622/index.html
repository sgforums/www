The problem is that this church apparently has practicing gays (ie people with partners of the same sex). Unless the leadership has a method to bring in these people and makes attempt to council them away from that practice. which by the way is condemned in the Bible.</div>

And it welcomes gay people.<br><br>The church has even gone as far as to say that homosexuality is not a sin.<br><br>This makes Free Community Church probably the only one in Singapore to accept homosexuality.<br><br>Although mainstream churches do accept gay worshippers, their stand on homosexuality is that it is wrong. (See related report.)<br><br>Said Mrs Susan Tang, a vice-chairman on the church's council: 'We have a congregation of about 50 people, of whom about 75 to 80 per cent are gay.<br><br>'Our stand is that homosexuality is not a sin, and we welcome gay people to come and worship.'<br><br>A check on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore website revealed that the Free Community Church is currently registered as a company. Its members said the church is striving to be accepted as a regular church, and not be labelled a gay church.<br><br>Said church-goer Peter Goh, 31, an R&amp;D programmer: 'Our church welcomes gay people, but why should it be called a gay church? I would rather call us an all-inclusive church.'<br><br>Mrs Tang herself is a straight 48-year-old housewife, who has been happily married for 20 years, and has three children.<br><br>She is one of two vice-chairmen of the church council. There are about 10 members in the council.<br><br>According to another member, a businessman in his 30s who gave his name only as Eugene, the church gives people an environment to work out the conflicts they may have about being gay and Christian.<br><br>'Many gay Christians choose to remain closeted in mainstream churches, for fear of getting blacklisted,' he said.<br><br>Said another member, a 40-year-old financial engineer who gave his name only as Tianci: 'Many churches believe in 'accepting the sinner, but rejecting the sin'.<br><br>'But they expect you to change and become straight, or at least be celibate,' he added.<br><br>Tianci revealed that the church was started about 1 1/2 years ago, when one of its original members was expelled from his church for being gay.<br><br>He declined to give the name of the church.<br><br>With no place to worship, the original member gathered a few gay friends, and they began to meet weekly in one of their homes.<br><br>When their number grew to about 10 to 15 in two months through word of mouth, they moved their place of worship to an art gallery.<br><br>When they further expanded, they moved to the pub in April this year.<br><br>But it won't be their permanent home. The church requested that the pub not be named.<br><br>'The pub location is only temporary, we are still looking for a more suitable place to gather,' said Mr Goh.<br><br>He added that the church had managed to rent both venues - the pub and the art gallery - as their members knew the owners of the premises.<br><br>The New Paper team attended a service on Sunday, after receiving an e-mail about the church from a mainstream Christian who was uncomfortable with the church.<br><br>The e-mail had a link to the church's website, which gave its meeting venue and time. At first, we only had the address of the venue, so we were shocked to discover that it was actually a pub.<br><br>There was no sign outside indicating there was a church service being held inside.<br><br>But once we were seated, several friendly church members approached us on their own to make us feel welcome.<br><br>And, once you got over the unusual surroundings, it seemed like any other church.<br><br>There was Christian music playing, and several people in prayer.<br><br>JUST LIKE A REGULAR CHURCH<br><br>When the service began, it was just like any other service in regular churches. There were hymns, the Holy Communion, and a sermon given by a straight Christian counsellor.<br><br>Despite its obvious differences in theology from mainstream churches, the Free Community Church, which does not belong to any denomination, says that it is a regular church like any other.<br><br>But the 'gay factor' has drawn criticism for both the church and outside speakers who come to give talks to the congregation.<br><br>'Some of our speakers are high-profile in the religious world, so word gets out, and they come under lots of pressure from other Christian organisations not to be associated with us,' said Tianci.<br><br>He added that the general misconception about the gay community has deepened the prejudice.<br><br>'Admittedly, some gays do behave irresponsibly. But we want our members to develop respectable lives,' he said.<br><br>But the speakers are not deterred.<br><br>Said the Christian counsellor, who declined to be named: 'These are fellow imperfect people, so I have no reason to reject them - it's not my job to condemn them.'<br><br>And that effectively summarises the meaning of the church's name, FREE - First Realise Everyone is Equal.<br><br>Church-goers say that the church's openness towards not just sexuality, but to all religions and church denominations, has attracted even a few Buddhists to attend the services regularly.<br><br>Tianci added that the church has faced many struggles, and only wished to worship God in peace.<br><br>When The New Paper visited the church's website again yesterday, the venue of its services had been removed.<br><br>- Additional reporting by TAN MAE LYNN<br><br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

            <div class='col-md body'>Romans  1:18-32<br><br>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,  since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.  For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.<br>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.<br>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.<br>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.<strong>Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</strong><br>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To you,<br><br>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.<br><br>I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them.<br><br>a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?<br><br>b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br><br>c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br><br>d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Indonesianss, but not Malaysians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Malaysians?<br><br>e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?<br><br>f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an Abomination (Lev 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?<br><br>g) Lev 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?<br><br>h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev 19:27. How should they die?<br><br>i) I know from Lev 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br><br>j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev 24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)<br><br>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help.<br><br>Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.<br><br></div>
