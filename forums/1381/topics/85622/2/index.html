In the past, I do not know if there is a real need to label people as slaves and masters but it surely shows god do not support the idea of fairness. He can save the people from egytians yet allow them to treat other people almost the same way egytians treat them before. Isn't tat a form of double standard ? god allowing the master to nearly kill the slave, raping, selling or beating of them. Wat is the difference between u and egytians.<br><br>BTW u seems to have failed to answer for the other practices like stoning people to death if she is being raped.<br><br><blockquote>However bear in mind Paul's writing to his young protege Timothy on the character of leadership of which in 2 Timothy 3:2 states <strong>A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach. </strong></blockquote>However 2 timothy says<br><br>1 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work<br><br>followed by looking at timothy 3:2, it only shows tat gays cannot be a bishop, not gay is not allowed.<br><br><blockquote>Another verse further down verse 12 states: Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well<br>This verse obviously put paid the notion of homosexuality as well as bigamy which was practiced in the OT. </blockquote>Tis appears to have been used wrongly again. It is still trying to talk about the conditions to be a deacon, which is a cleric ranking just below a priest in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, and Roman Catholic churches. (from dictinary .com)<br><br>It never says tat normal folks r not allowed to be gays either. Anyway it just says tat to be a good deacon or bishop, he must rule his family well. Otherwise if he can't rule his life well, how can he lead other people. However the issue now is not on whether should gays be appointed as priest or deacons, but whether r they allowed to be just normal church memebrs. BTW it never states tat homo is a sin either.<br><br><blockquote>I read from you note that you are genuinely seeking some answers.

If we read it to know the truth, I am confident that we will find it.<br><br>2) We are not the first audience of the scripture<br>The scripture was written to an original audience, then to us. When intepreting the bible, it is beneficial to ask ourselves what the passage meant to the original audience.<br><br>In the case of OT laws, there are moral codes, civil laws and ceremonial laws. Not all laws, especially civil and ceremonial laws, are applicable today, though one may extract and follow the principles behind them.<br><br>In the case of homosexuality, it should not be condone because teachings against it was reiterated by the apostles (as implied by neontetra and chin eng).<br><br>3) The bible can be misintepreted by christians and non-christians<br>To avoid this, we need to apply sound principles when we are intepreting the bible. A good read would be "How to read the bible for all its worth" by Fee and Stuart.<br><br>4) Jesus saves, not some legalistic application of the law (OT and NT)<br><br></div>

It brings to mind Sodom and Gohmorrah. There's where the word "sodomy" somes from by the way.<br><br>The mentioned church here is totally at the wrong end of Christianity. When i read the article, the onlything that seems right was the statement about "Love the sinner but hate the sin."<br><br>However, the sinner, in this case - homosexual, MUST confess and truely repent and stop his/her sin right there and then. It is then that he/she will be welcomed to any of the fundamental churches provided that he truely repent. If he/she returns to his/her vomit then the church must not accomodate this.<br><br>As for Old Testament and New Testament, bible-believing churches always hold to the stand that you must understand both testaments because 1) Scripture interpret scriptures. 2) New tstament fulfills old testament.<br><br>The laws of the Old Testament are still to be kept. For example the 10 Commandments. Many city , charismatic churches no longer stand by the 10 commandments. - thats very sad because we can see the morale degration in their churches.<br><br>The Jews still only holds the Old Testament and disregard Jesus as their Messiah. Thus if you go to Israel or just observe the Jews anywhere, they will keep the Old Testament practices and laws - possibily the stoning and the slavery - i cant say for sure.

A common example is the word Love: in Greek it has at least 4 similar words: Philieo, Storge, Eros and Agape.

SO he is wrong, meaning god is wrong lah ?<br><br><blockquote>In the case of homosexuality, it should not be condone because teachings against it was reiterated by the apostles (as implied by neontetra and chin eng). </blockquote>Where ?<br><br><blockquote>3) The bible can be misintepreted by christians and non-christians<br>To avoid this, we need to apply sound principles when we are intepreting the bible.

Aren't u interested in finding the truth ? U prefer to cheat yourself and not hear anything against it ? As I said many times, I do not hurl verbal abuses without reasons. I brought my arguments and facts over and talk about it.

Most christian r probably irritated because they r see the ugly side of christainity, tat probably it all is just one big lie.</div>
