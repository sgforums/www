            <div class='col-md body'>I have started this thread as a followup from the thread of our former mod. The purpose is to DRAW the discussion away from this individual and focus on an important aspect of Eternal Hope - the role of the moderator.<br><br>The following quotations from skeujin and sillyme is from the other thread.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by skeujin:</div><div class="quote_body">when a person is delegated n accepts responsibility of anythg. a forum. a club. a company.... he/she accepts that their role is to maintain the integrity of the forums. the interest of the forum or organisation comes 1st above all else. personal interests are secondary.<br><br>if he/she feels that their personal interest is in conflict with the interests of the organisation and this hinders the harmony in the organisation. they should step down or the remaining mods remove him/her after relevant justification.<br><br>if he/she does not step down and conflict arise because of this person. the integrity of the entire organisation will be questioned and innocents will suffer.</div></blockquote>Well put, skeujin.... this is what I have been saying all along... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sillyme:</div><div class="quote_body">I apologise if my explaination came off badly.<br><br>One reason that I minimized posting my opinions is because I found that people began to attack EH for my opinions. That is why I said the visitors here find it hard to separate one's opinion from his role in the forum. Therefore, I acted on my own to remove brey from the role of mod.<br><br>Frankly, I am very satisified with brey as a mod. It is true that I had assured him that I am ok with him as a mod a few weeks ago. I had told him to hang on and give it a try some more. But I think the situation has not improved.<br><br>I feel that brey can still be heard even if he is not a mod. I know it may hurt some feelings, I am sorry for that. My actions may have been wrong to some. But I cannot undo the damage.<br><br>Moving forward, I think we need the help of all of you to keep EH in good order. It is increasingly difficult to monitor the forum just by a few individuals. Adding to that, decisions made cannot please everyone. It is also technically not possible to give everyone moderating rights. Therefore, we need the help of everyone. I don't think locking and deleting threads is a long term solution. If there is anything about our faith that needs to be defended, you have to do it. Speak up and stand up for your beliefs.<br><br>I cannot and do not hope to shut everyone up, but we can speak the truth and be heard. And those who have ears, let them listen.</div></blockquote>I think it is important to define what is the role of the moderator.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Is the moderator responsible for the defense of the faith?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Is the moderator responsible to answer all queries?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Is the moderator responsible to engage in proselytization of his pet topics or favourite denominations?<br>Therefore the first question here is: is the moderator a Christian in defense of the Christian faith, or a person who administers a domain (a domain that nonetheless skewed towards one lifestyle).
