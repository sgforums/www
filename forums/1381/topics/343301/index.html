              <p>Bring it to any Catholic Church and leave it with the secretariat. The Bible, rosary and cruxifix will benefit someone else....</p>
              <p>Tossing into a bin is not nice as you don't see people of any faith throwing their religious objects into the bins.</p>
              <p>Not "pang tan" but may be offensive when another Christian see it in a bin or worst when someone else step on it accidentally etc....just want to be sensitive to others (Christians especially).</p>

              <p>oh, i consider catholic christians, but i said it that way because it's your rosary ending up in the bin, for me, i would feel sad for the person, but protestants don't reverent inanimated objects, so we won't feel like "God is in the dustbin" or smth</p>

              <p>haha.. that boils down to individual.. like i know someone who led a rosary group, and changed the mother mary statue, and the entire rosary group complained, said that they had sentimental values with the old one, and that they shouldn't anyhow change.. lol then the leader scolded them said they are not praying to the statue, it doesn't matter, it's all spiritual.</p>
              <p>so.. it's hard to say wor, that every catholics don't accidentally view that God is in the inanimated object.</p>

              <p>I view them as a representation of our Christian faith, like our flag. So, some respect must be given (to our faith) ....and if you need to throw them away, wrapped them up. Is that so difficult?</p>

              <p>I am not sure about this cause you said "sentimental
              values" and I take it as just that. It has nothing to do with thinking that God is in the object.....or do you mean they feel they are "changing god" when objects are changed? Not making sense to me....</p>
              <p>Holy Cross has a new crucifix which Fr Richard designed and is now hanging in the middle of the Church. Does that means that they have changed their God? I have not heard about any complaint about that - not even one.....</p>

              <p>yeah they said sentimental value (they hinted that they had attachment to it). but it shouldn't be so what. they got affected in their prayer life because an inanimated object was changed. they don't say it, but it's really easy to fall into the mental trap of idolatry. even for myself.. it's only a thin line in your thought life - from using the statue to remind yourself of a particular person, and to thinking that Jesus is on the cross now.</p>
