I personally am a bit cheesed wz the "health, Wealth, $$, Blessings" stuff. I have nothing against the church going high-tech after all in order to reach out the younger new generation we also have to follow with the times. However, i feel there should be some decernment in the doctrines dat they preach. Perhaps i am still a tradition at heart.<br><br>Correct me if i am wrong but as a servant of God, should not the life be led in humility? In that sense i have full respect for the Catholic priests.<br><br>Altho i am protestant by birth, 2 me there is no division, we are all children of God, all living in the body of Christ. Thats why we are called "Christians". Of course it will be revelation if all can unite as 1 body. Sigh.....</div>

(sorry Ito_^, do not mean to nitpick)<br>My take?<br>1. Every self-proclaimed Christian WILL CHECK with the Bible. The problem is not the checking, but the interpretation. No self respecting church leader will say that Satan will win. I have heard too many leades proclaim a verse as a revelation (and mandate) for them to embark on a programme only to see the programme falling flat in the face within 2 yrs.<br>2. Depending on the church. Seems the the new-age churches' leaders follow their pastors to the word, as oppose to, say, my church where pastors can be wrong, and can be outvoted by the lay-leaders. If the church leaders and their pastors sing the same song ALL (or most of) THE TIME, it is likely to be a personality cult. Especially when the pastor concern is always perceived to do-no-wrong.<br>3. Refer to point 1. No self-respecting Christian leader will avoid this phrase - let's pray about it. Substantially, where does that lead us? It will still lead to point 2.... a darn vicious cycle.<br><br>My own yardstick?<br>A tree will be known by the fruits it produces.<br>I am in a ministry, my ministry flourishes, there is a constant supply of workers, the people that I am reaching out to are benefitting, the church is benefitting from the efforts and places priority to support it.... and lastly, I, as the ministry leader IS NOT glorified by it and I am willling to reliquish it anytime to allow for a better leader to take over.<br><br>God did not speak to me (using the traditional understanding), but I feel God has used me in a way I thought not possible.<br>I saw a need, I addressed the need trusting God's providence.<br>Having said all that, my approach may not be suitable to all. To those who feel that falling on their knees work for them, it's fine with me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chin Eng:</div><div class="quote_body">Superficially a good answer.... (sorry Ito_^, do not mean to nitpick)<br>My take?<br>1. Every self-proclaimed Christian WILL CHECK with the Bible. The problem is not the checking, but the interpretation. No self respecting church leader will say that Satan will win. I have heard too many leades proclaim a verse as a revelation (and mandate) for them to embark on a programme only to see the programme falling flat in the face within 2 yrs.<br>2. Depending on the church. Seems the the new-age churches' leaders follow their pastors to the word, as oppose to, say, my church where pastors can be wrong, and can be outvoted by the lay-leaders. If the church leaders and their pastors sing the same song ALL (or most of) THE TIME, it is likely to be a personality cult. Especially when the pastor concern is always perceived to do-no-wrong.<br>3. Refer to point 1. No self-respecting Christian leader will avoid this phrase - let's pray about it. Substantially, where does that lead us? It will still lead to point 2.... a darn vicious cycle.<br><br>My own yardstick?<br>A tree will be known by the fruits it produces.<br>I am in a ministry, my ministry flourishes, there is a constant supply of workers, the people that I am reaching out to are benefitting, the church is benefitting from the efforts and places priority to support it.... and lastly, I, as the ministry leader IS NOT glorified by it and I am willling to reliquish it anytime to allow for a better leader to take over.<br><br>God did not speak to me (using the traditional understanding), but I feel God has used me in a way I thought not possible.<br>I saw a need, I addressed the need trusting God's providence.<br>Having said all that, my approach may not be suitable to all. To those who feel that falling on their knees work for them, it's fine with me.</div></blockquote>You have certainly opened my eyes to a greater insight. Really appreciate it. Guess i should not be such an idealogist, cause all the while for me seeing is believing, alot of times i use my head &amp; not my heart and i really need to work on that aspect.</div>
