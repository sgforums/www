For starters, CGLs are selected because they toll the line. Next, the attend a set course for qualification as a CGL. They're probably tune to react in a certain way using the standard Q&amp;A. CGLs are probably good only for the standard Bible Study as these are the stuff that they are trained to do.<br><br>It is unlike that CGLs are selected from folks who have a diversified view of Scripture or has strong opinions on how CGs are to be run.<br><br>I know this for a fact because I was a CGL and was constantly at loggerheads with the logic and methodology (as well as the doctrine) of cell groups.<br><br>Here is not to say that there are NO good CGLs. I know of some who are extremely intelligent and very spiritual, but these are far and few in between.<br></div></blockquote>Maybe i'm outdated already, many years back. In CHC, a qualified CGL have to be a calibre a Trainee Pastor which was very very impressive.<br>Each CGLs were handpicked by Higher Pastoral management themselves.
