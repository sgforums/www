One need not do out and out sins to be a backslider. A 'faithful' church attender, gospel tract distributer and etc. could do Christian things and yet be a backslider at heart.<br><br>an example of a backslider though still doing religious things are the Galatians. See the one posted by vince.<br><br>It is different from an apostatizer. this is a person who is not really a believer from the start but just looks like it.<br><br>1Jo 2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us.</div>
