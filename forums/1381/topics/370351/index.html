              <p>this thread is for those who were ex christians,non believers...</p>
              <p>in the beginning there was God(for easy differentiation, the more popular name Jehovah will be used)..now Jehovah is very unique...even his name meant he who purpose..now he wanted to share the gift of life..so he started creating...the 1st and only direct creation..his only begotten son..whom people got to knw later as Jesus..</p>
              <p>Jehovah and Jesus spent countless ages together..Jesus had the privillage to learn directly from Jehovah..they are the best example of father and son..now Jehovah wanted to make Jesus happy..so they went into plans of further creation...soon..more spirit creatures were created...known as angels..universe, stars,planets were created by Jehovah through the hands of Jesus...</p>
              <p>then came earth...where the bible book is eventually written by the hands of men,inspired by Jehovah..now, it was written, Jehovah created everything in 6 days...its impossible if its a day = 24 earth hours..as it will contradict science..the truth is..each day of creation was a long period of time..unknown to be exact how long each "day" was..so 6 such "days" past by and the creation is done with Jehovah resting on the 7th and thus made the number 7 holy.(the idea of each day not a literal days can be found in the prophecy of the rebuilding of the jerusalem temple)</p>
              <p>on earth,man was created...adam(not adeline)...soon woe to man(woman) was created to compliment and assist adam..eve(not steve)...a strict law was given them..of all the fruits in eden you may eat to your content.except the fruit from the knowledge of good and bad..even the fruit from the tree of life was allowed...if you eat from the former tree..you will positively die..</p>
              <p>meanwhile..in the heavenly realm, there was this cherub..perfect and maybe only second to Jesus..started to feel vain after so many angels looked up to him..he had loved Jehovah so much then..now he wants to have the worship for himself..he wants to be God...he knows if he challenged Jehovah in terms of might there will be no fight..so the crafty guy came to challenge his right to sovereignty..he might have a chance if more agreed that its better for creatures to rule themselves than ruled by Jehovah...off he went to eden and he knew eve didnt had that much time with Jehovah to know enough of him..and twisted his words to lure eve..now eve was vain..she didnt want to be under adam(not in terms of sex position) so she took the forbidden fruit herself first..before she offered it to adam...adam loved her too much..so sinned with her..thus humans were doomed..but the love of God prevailed..he uttered that humans will be saved..the lying serpent will be crushed..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>conclusion...Jehovah and Jesus are 2 distinct entities..satan was never named lucifer..humans chose to die...Jehovah still lovingly made leeways for humans to be saved..the 6 days were explained...adam loved eve more than Jehovah...</p>
              <p>though the name Jehovah was used..it has nothing to do with christian group known as Jehovah Witnesses</p>

              <p>precisely..through Jesus...Gid was using Jesus as a master craftsman...if you look at alot of other translation..especially original texts..it will be translated as the word was a god..a god is surely different from the God...</p>
              <p>and seriously..no christians showed me the verse where Jesus claim he is Yahweh/Jehovah..not even that he claim he is God..all only points to Jesus submitting to the abba father..no1 can be his own father..and God cannot be subjecting himself to someone else..</p>
