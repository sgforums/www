              <p>Jesus was always very careful to 
                              distinguish His relationship with the Father from the relationship 
                              His disciples had with the Father. He never addressed God as “our 
                              Father” in reference to Himself and the disciples, but rather 
                              addressed Him as “My Father” and “your Father.”<a id="fn2a" name="fn2a"></a> This is significant to note because Jesus is God’s Son <strong>by 
                              nature</strong>; whereas, His disciples are God’s sons <strong>by 
                              adoption</strong> (John 1:12). As the “Son of God,” 
                              Jesus has the <strong>same nature</strong> as God (John 5:18, 
                              19:7), but in the incarnation, Jesus took on the nature of man 
                              and thus became the “Son of Man.”  While in His Divine 
                              nature, Jesus still has all the power and authority of God, <strong>it 
                              is in his human nature that Jesus refers to the Father as His 
                              God</strong>.</p>

              <p>the difference is yes..Jesus was similiar in nature..as he too is a spirit since anything else was created..the prehuman form of Jesus..the only begotten son..humans are sons and daughters of God because they were repurchased by the blood of Jesus..in his divine nature..yes..he was fully authorized by Jehovah/Yahweh to act.in short..God = President, Jesus = vice President..its just that simple..God cannot die...if he were to take a human form like the angels and die..he go against his principle..by using an uncreated Being like God to repurchase creatures, humans, thats over priced..God is fair..so he constrained himself in so many things to make it fair..so he had to transfer Jesus down to earth with Jesus' willingness to redeem humans...there is also a hughe risk that as as human, Jesus might sin against God but God trusts him and Jesus love his father...</p>
              <p>even in revelation..Jesus who is already back in heaven..having his spirit form..he still subject himself to God..and if God and Jesus are the same person..than Jesus cannot be exalted to an even higher position..God is already the highest..how else will Jesus be exalted if he is God??but God can exalt Jesus because they are 2 different persons..</p>

              <p>“…Are you not from long 
                              ago, O Jehovah? O my God, <strong>my Holy One, you do not die</strong>.”</p>
              <p><strong></strong><strong>HABAKKUK 
                              1:12</strong></p>
              <p>One of the attributes of our immutable
              God is that He does not die. Yet, at Acts 2:27, 3:14, and John
              6:69 we read that this “Holy One” is Jesus who, as foretold by David at
              Psalm 16:10, was to die but whose body would not “undergo decay.”  How
              can this be? If the Holy One does not die, how can Jesus as the “Holy
              One” die?  We can reconcile this by recognizing that according to Psalm
              49:7, more was required than just a mere man to atone for the sins of
              mankind. Thus, it was necessary for Jehovah God to become man in the person of
              Christ in order to die and atone for the sins of the world.  Although
              Jesus (in His human nature) had completely died, He (in His Divine
              nature) still possessed the power to raise Himself.</p>
              <p>“...I lay down My life that <strong>I may 
                                take it again</strong>. No one has taken it away from Me, but 
                                I lay it down on My own initiative. <strong>I have authority 
                                to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again</strong>.…Destroy 
                                this temple, and in three days <strong>I will raise it up</strong>.”—John 
                              10:17-18; 2:19</p>
