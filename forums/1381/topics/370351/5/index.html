              Of course it's understandable. You know neither the church nor the bible nor God. And you are not looking to know either too.

              I wish I would have a share in the coming kingdom. It is written whoever entered the kingdom of God would rule as kings with Christ. Many people don't realize in the end the chosen ones will be rewarded not only with eternal life but also with power to rule. Not the puny power of the kingdom of men today but the kind of power that would make any other people envious . . .kings of men included.
                                                                                      <br><br>
              The keyword of God is: authority and power, mighty power to rule.
                                                                                       <br><br>
               Men of this world  lie, cheat, betray, plot, kill, and go to wars for power....power that they are only going to have for a very short time. Power that is actually so little...then they all fall into nothingness they become nothing, all their accomplishments and glory become nothing, useless to them, even when the whole world knew their names and worshiped them they are nothing now. Nothing. And this is only half of the story . . .worse far far worse would fall unto some of them in the day of the Lord's reckoning. The worst part is they wouldn't even realize when they are in the better period of their time in death.
