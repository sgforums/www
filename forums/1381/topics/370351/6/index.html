              <p><br> I wish I would have a share in the coming kingdom. It is written
              whoever entered the kingdom of God would rule as kings with Christ.
              Many people don't realize in the end the chosen ones will be
              rewarded not only with eternal life but also with power to rule.
              Not the puny power of the kingdom of men today but the kind of
              power that would make any other people envious . . .kings of men
              included.<br> <br> The keyword of God is: authority and power, mighty power to
              rule.<br> <br> Men of this world lie, cheat, betray, plot, kill, and go to wars
              for power....power that they are only going to have for a very
              short time. Power that is actually so little...then they all fall
              into nothingness they become nothing, all their accomplishments and
              glory become nothing, useless to them, even when the whole world
              knew their names and worshiped them they are nothing now. Nothing.
              And this is only half of the story . . .worse far far worse would
              fall unto some of them in the day of the Lord's reckoning. The
              worst part is they wouldn't even realize when they are in the
              better period of their time in death.</p>

              <p>sad to break this to you bro..i really dont think you have a share in the ruling class..they have to be virgins..not that i know if you are one..and they are very different from us normal humans..based on what i see on your understanding on the bible..its obvious to see you are not one of the anointed class of 144k to serve as co heirs to JC...im sorry..</p>

              <p>What happens alot of the time though is people tell us to stop calling them and inviting them to events and caregroup ...  How i know?  Cos I'm in charge of calling some new members of CG that just joined and alot of times i kena "reject call" or "sry.. too busy"...  </p>
              <p>If dun wanna join us, no problems.. but the thing is, we cant keep on calling you forever..  so we leave it to your choice to call us... the door is always open..  just let us know..</p>

              <p>Actually what is the point of trying to treach as much truth as possible? Turth mixed with lie is still lie. G_d already gave you how He wants Himself to be worshipped, its written in this thing called the bible.So what is your excuse for trying to do things in a way that He did not ask you to do? When you get instructions from your boss detailing how you are supposed to do things his way, will you change it?</p>
              <p>You think? Then what about all those people who said to Yahweh did we not do this or do that in your name? What did G_d say to them? Away with you you workers or inquity I KNOW YOU NOT. I understand effort, but my question is this what is the point of effort in something that is so clearly not accordig to His way/will? Will G_d be pleased? Lets say your dad asked you to wash the car, but you cleaned the garden instead? Will your dad be pleased? or if in the army you are asked to get position A,but you got position B, will your commander be pleased? no. you did not achieve your objective. That is my point.</p>
