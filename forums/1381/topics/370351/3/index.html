              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>in my opinion, i believe the creation was done in literal 6 days.</p>
              <p>Then the question comes, if yes, then show proof. Of course, if have rock solid proof of course early early show liao.</p>
              <p>But my request is, could someone give me rock solid proof that the old [not young] earth theory [not law] is absolutely true? could someone give me the proof of methods used in obtaining the dates of how old fossils are absolutely true?</p>
              <p>In discussiong about methodology and order, i first choose to believe that the Bible is true and neverchanging, and continue in reasoning and science as well. But some will believe in scientific theory to be true and neverchanging, then say that Bible is false.</p>
              <p>I would say that, as fallen man, my understanding is yet full and my comprehension of the matter lacking. Thanks to all, i would continue in understanding it, but i will do it with the believe and faith and foundation that the Bible is the Truth.</p>

              <p>yes thats the contradiction isnt it. ask god to create something he cant lift and if he can lift, he is not powerful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how can you say its not a big difference dude. 6 days and 6 million or billion years is a huge difference. that means the creation of 6 days is a myth, proven by science, period.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>dear don..carbon dating can be off..but not pure nonsense..science is in lieu with the bible..but the bible isnt a science text book..6 literal days will contradict both the bible as with science..in fact bible first mentioned that the earth is round..and scientific laws showed how precise everything is and cannot be a by product of chance..</p>
              <p>so therefore..look at our nature..look at the textbooks..and look in the bible..and you will see all compliement each other..just be careful of human lies..</p>

              <p>all god religions are talking about a creator ie whether one god or many god, it doesnt matter. In India alone, there are 300 plus god religions alone. every religion would surely preaches their religion is the one and only religion that is true.</p>

              <p>It takes away human endevour. look how far mankind has progresse in leaps and bounds with science and technology. frankly speaking what has bible or god reveal other than say that god is almighty and creator of all things.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>in my opinion, science and technologies is just one of the means that a civilisation, a culture progresses, last time we use to write mails, now we write emails so can be said as language and literiture. But what is the motivation behind all these things?</p>
              <p>Science, in latin, is Scio, which literaly means, to know. But what motivates you to know? Is curiosity enough and sufficient to motivate [not force] you to know?</p>
              <p>In the ancient times, people view time as a wheel, mainly known as a wheel of time. So things happen and re-happen and so on, life, death, life death and so on. But the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 1</p>
              <p><sup id="en-NIV-29950" class="versenum">2</sup>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed <strong>heir of all things</strong></p>
              <p>and as St Augustine understands from the Bible that time is linear, and in his Book "City of God" writing that, even if the earthly rule of the empire was imperilled, it was the City of God that would <strong>ultimately </strong>triumph.</p>
              <p>By knowing where history is heading, Christians by right, should have no excuse and strive and progress in this live, and giving all glory to God.</p>
              <p>Some of us would detest Christians that are all about happy happy, lovey dovey, warm and cuddly and sometimes even self consumed and lived in our own small little enclove. But this is not the case, Christians are called to bring glory to God, and even to let all nations give glory to God.</p>
              <p>Sadly, sometimes [maybe most of the time] we fail. But it shows us, on the other hand the mercy and grace of God, and His willingness to have a partnership with us humans.</p>
              <p>I understand and accept the objective and sincere remand/comments made towards Christians. We fail at times, and needed to move on. Thank you so much.</p>
              <p>regards,</p>

              <p>yes thats the contradiction isnt it. ask god to create something

              <p>how can you say its not a big difference dude. 6 days and 6
              million or billion years is a huge difference. that means the
              creation of 6 days is a myth, proven by science, period.</p>

              <p>IMO..the thing of creating things he cant lift is just pure bull...its just twisting of words...</p>
              <p>now the days and years thingy..time maybe a diff..huge diff i agree..but..the end result is the same..shit gets created..you get what i meant??</p>
              <p>the creation in 6 days is bullshit as proven by science if you listen to what certain sects of christianity says...that im sure you agree...however,based on the example i gave..you cant deny it covers up pretty well...</p>
              <p>im only defending the constant facts in the bible against the inconsistant crap of religious teachers...</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>in my opinion, science and technologies is just one of the means
              that a civilisation, a culture progresses, last time we use to
              write mails, now we write emails so can be said as language and
              literiture. But what is the motivation behind all these things?</p>
              <p>Science, in latin, is Scio, which literaly means, to know. But
              what motivates you to know? Is curiosity enough and sufficient to
              motivate [not force] you to know?</p>
              <p>In the ancient times, people view time as a wheel, mainly known
              as a wheel of time. So things happen and re-happen and so on, life,
              death, life death and so on. But the Bible tells us in Hebrews
              chapter 1</p>
              <p><sup>2</sup>but in these last days he has spoken to us
              by his Son, whom he appointed <strong>heir of all
              things</strong></p>
              <p>and as St Augustine understands from the Bible that time is
              linear, and in his Book "City of God" writing that, even if the
              earthly rule of the empire was imperilled, it was the City of God
              that would <strong>ultimately</strong> triumph.</p>
              <p>By knowing where history is heading, Christians by right, should
              have no excuse and strive and progress in this live, and giving all
              glory to God.</p>
              <p>Some of us would detest Christians that are all about happy
              happy, lovey dovey, warm and cuddly and sometimes even self
              consumed and lived in our own small little enclove. But this is not
              the case, Christians are called to bring glory to God, and even to
              let all nations give glory to God.</p>
              <p>Sadly, sometimes [maybe most of the time] we fail. But it shows
              us, on the other hand the mercy and grace of God, and His
              willingness to have a partnership with us humans.</p>
              <p>I understand and accept the objective and sincere
              remand/comments made towards Christians. We fail at times, and
              needed to move on. Thank you so much.</p>
              <p>regards,</p>

              <p>Yeshua was not born on christmas and He most certainly was not ressurected during easter... get YOUR facts straight... if you bothered to read your bible you would know when Yeshua was born and when He was ressurected. christmas the 25th of dec is well known to be the birth day of tammuz the sun god... and easter is associated with eoster, astarte, ashera.... do you remember what Yahweh said to do with ashera poles and the like? Yet the church brings them wholesale in...</p>
              <p>These two supposedly sacred days are really pagan festivals which are adopted by the rcc under the leadership of pope gregory. I challenge you to ask how many christians have christmas trees in their homes and how many give easter eggs during easter...</p>
              <p>Do you have sun rise service during easter? Do you not worship on SUNday...during mass...don't the rcc use what is called a monstrance/ostensorium, have a look at what it looks like... even the rcc admits that this is a sunburst...</p>

              <p>Thu church has brought the sun gods wholesale in? Funny thing is that I've never heard of them before. So if 25th Dec happens to coincide with Hitler's birthday, do we worship Hitler? Yes, the actual birthday and resurrection days of Jesus may not be exactly on Christmas and Easter Days itself, but so what? Isn't it more important to remember and celebrate the days for what they signify than whether it actually happened <em>historically</em> on that day? </p>
              <p>Yes, I'll proudly say that I have a Christmas tree at home and I give Easter eggs. Am I replacing Jesus Christ with the tree and the eggs? I give Christmas presents and Easter eggs to my loved ones because I want to without any religious significance. They experience peace, love and joy as a result, what's wrong with this? And yes, we worship on Sunday for the simple reason that God rested on the 7th day after the creation of the world and asked us to keep that day holy. No coincidence also that Jesus died on Good Friday and rose on the 3rd day which is now called Sunday, or Easter Sunday. And no, our biggest Easter service is the Easter vigil mass <strong>the night</strong> before Easter morning.</p>
              <p>The entire point about the monstrance is the <strong>Eucharist within that it contains</strong>, not about the monstrance itself. The imagery of light is used to decorate it as Jesus himself said that He is the light of the world. During the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, Catholics focus on the consecrated bread (which by the way has on a few occassions miraculously turned into actual human flesh and kept till today, praise the Lord), not on the decorative sun rays.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if you've realised by now that your bizzare, unsubstantiated and offensive attacks on the Catholic faith (in this post and others) speak volumes about the kind of religion that you subscribe to. One thing you have helped me confirm is that Catholics will continue to endure these relentless attacks as Jesus himself warned his church that we will be persecuted if we follow Him, just as he was persecuted by his enemies. A word of advice - ask Catholics for what Catholics believe, don't ask an anti-Catholic for what Catholics believe as you will end up committing the sin of bearing false witness against your neighbour. </p>

              <p>Please go and read Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) chapter 10. Do you not know the origins of chirstmas??</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"> The <em>Catholic Encyclopedia</em> tells us: "Christmas was not among the earliest festivals of the
                  Church. Irenaeus and Tertullian omit it from their lists of feasts;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Historians acknowledge that the earliest December 25 celebration of Christ’s birth "took place <em>at Rome</em> about the middle of the fourth century… The first mention of a Nativity
                  feast on December 25 is found in a Roman document known as the
                  Philocalian Calendar, dating from the year 354 [ad]… <em>From Rome</em>,
                  Christmas spread throughout the West, with the conversion of the
                  barbarians" (Miles, pp. 20–21). The Bible, of course, does not mention
                  the date of Jesus’ birth. "The <em>real reason</em> for the choice of
                  the day [December 25] most probably was, that upon it fell the pagan
                  festival" that celebrated the rebirth of the sun (<em>ibid.,</em> p. 23). <br>     Hoping
                  to encourage pagans to embrace the Roman Catholic faith, clerics sought
                  to adapt pagan customs into their religion by giving them new names.
                  Pope Gregory I, writing in 601ad, urged Augustine of Canterbury to
                  allow the pagan Anglo-Saxons to retain the outward forms of their old
                  festivals, but to practice them with a new meaning (Miles, p. 179). As
                  one author concludes, reflecting on the Pope’s letter, "We see here
                  very plainly the mind of the <em>ecclesiastical compromiser</em>" (<em>ibid.</em>). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Catholic historian Will
                  Durant acknowledged this plainly when he wrote, "Christianity did not
                  destroy paganism; it adopted it… the Greek mysteries passed down into
                  the impressive mystery of the Mass. Other pagan cultures contributed to
                  the syncretist result. From Egypt came the idea of the Trinity… the
                  adoration of the Mother and Child, and the mystic theosophy that made
                  Neoplatonism and Gnosticism and obscured the Christian creed… From
                  Phrygia came the worship of the Great Mother… Christianity was the last
                  great creation of the ancient pagan world" (<em>Caesar</em> <em>and</em> <em>Christ</em>, p. 595). </span></p>
              <p>"Ishtar", which is pronounced "Easter" was a day that commemorated the
                  resurrection of one of their gods that they called "Tammuz", who was believed
                  to be the only begotten son of the moon-goddess and the sun-god. Easter is the worship of Ishtar the fertility goddess...it has and will never have anything to do with the ressurection of Yeshua. Does the bible tell you to celebrate easter??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Aaron made the golden calf for the Israelites at Mount Sinai, he
                  had still proclaimed the celebration that attended its inauguration the
                  “feast of the Lord.” (Exodus 32:5). Yet, this did not prevent the wrath
                  of God from falling upon them. This is exactly what the church is doing...</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you <em>shall not add</em> to it nor take away from it" (Deuteronomy 12:29–32).</span></strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Yet the church has not obeyed... <br></span></p>
