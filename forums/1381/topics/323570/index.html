              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>The prodigal son trudges up the path. His pig stink makes
                  passersby walk wide circles around him, but he doesn't notice. With eyes on the
                  ground, he rehearses his speech: "Father" - his voice barely audible
                  - "I have sinned against heaven and against you. I'm not worthy to be
                  called your son." He rehashes the phrases, wondering if he should say
                  more, less, or make a U-turn to the barnyard. After all, he cashed in the trust
                  fund and trashed the family name. Over the last year, he'd awakened with more parched
                  throats, headaches, women, and tattoos than a rock star. How could his father
                  forgive him? <em>Maybe I could offer to pay off the credit cards.</em> He's so
                  focused on penance planning that he fails to hear the sound of his father...
                  running!<br> <br> The dad embraces the mud-layered boy as if he were a returning war hero. He
                  commands the servants to bring a robe, ring, and sandals, as if to say,
                  "No boy of mine is going to look like a pigsty peasant. Fire up the grill.
                  Bring on the drinks. It's time for a party!"<br> <br> Big brother meanwhiles stands on the porch and sulks. "No one ever gave me
                  a party," he mumbles, arms crossed,<br> <br> The father tries to explain, but the jealous son won't listen. He huffs and
                  shrugs and grumbles something about cheap grace, saddles his high horse and
                  rides off. But you knew that. You've read the parable of the gracious father
                  and the hostle brother (Luke 15:11-32)<br> <br> But have you heard what happened next? Have you read the second chapter? It's a
                  page turner. The older brother resolves to rain on the forgiveness parade.<br> <br> <em>If Dad won't exact justice on the boy, I will.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: normal;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'><br> <br> "Nice robe there, little brother," he tells him one day. "Better
                  keep it clean. One spot and Dad will send you to the cleaners with it."<br> <br> The younger waves him away, but the next time he sees his father, he quickly
                  check his robes for stains.<br> <br> A few days later, big brother warns about the ring. "Quite a piece of
                  jewelery Dad gave you. He prefers that you wear it on the thumb."<br> <br> "The thumb? He didn't tell me that."<br> <br> "Some things we're just supposed to know."<br> <br> "But it won't fit my thumb."<br> <br> "What's your goal - pleasing our father or your own personal
                  comfort?" the spiritual monitor gibes, walking away.<br> <br> Big brother isn't finished. With the pleasantness of a dyspeptic IRS auditor,
                  he taunts, "If Dad sees you with loose laces, he'll take the sandals
                  back."<br> <br> "He will not. They were a gift. He wouldn't... would he?" The
                  ex-prodigal then leans over to snug the strings. As he does, he spots a smudge
                  on his robe. Trying to rub it off, he realises the ring is on a finger, not his
                  thumb. That's when he hears his father's voice, "Hello, Son."<br> <br> There the boy sits, wearing a spotted robe, loose laces, and a misplaced ring.
                  Overcome with fear, he reacts with a "Sorry. Dad" and turns and runs.<br> <br> Too many tasks. Keeping the robe spotless, the ring positioned, the sandals
                  snug - who could meet such standards? Gift preservation begins to wear on the
                  young man. He avoids the father he feels he can't please. He quits wearing the
                  gifts he can't maintain. And he even begins longing for the simpler days of the
                  pigpen.<br> <br> "No one hounded me there."<br> <br> That's the rest of the story. Wondering where I found it? On page 1,892 of my
                  Bible, in the book of Galatians. Thanks to some legalistic big brothers, Paul's
                  readers had gone from grace receiving to law keeping. Their Christian life had
                  taken on the joy level of an upper G.I. endoscopy. Paul was puzzled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: center; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: red;'>I am astonished that you
                  are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are
                  turning to a different gospel— which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some
                  people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of
                  Christ.<br> <br> We who are Jews by birth and not 'Gentile sinners' know that a man is not
                  justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have
                  put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and
                  not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be
                  justified.</span></em><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: red;'><br> <br> (Gal 1:6-7, 2:16)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Joy snatchers infiltrated the Roman church as well. Paul had
                  to remind them, "But people are declared righteous because of their faith,
                  not because of their work" (<span style="color: red;">Rom 4:5</span>).<br> <br> Philippian Christians heard the same foolishness. Big brothers weren't telling
                  them to wearing ring on their thumbs, but they were insisting, "you must
                  be circumcised to be saved" (<span style="color: red;">Phil 3:2</span>).<br> <br> Even the Jerusalem church, the flagship congregation, heard the solemn
                  monotones of the Quality Control Board. Non-Jewish believers were being told,
                  "You cannot be saved if you are not circumcised as Moses taught us" (<span style="color: red;">Acts 15:1</span>)<br> <br> The churches suffered from the same malady: grace blockage. The Father might
                  let you in the gate, but you have to earn your place at the table. God makes
                  the down payment on your redemption but you pay the monthly installments.
                  Heaven gives you the boat, but you have to row it if you ever want to see the
                  other shore.<br> <br> Grace blockage. Taste, but don't drink. Wet your lips, but never slake your
                  thirst. Can you imagine such instruction over a fountain? "No swallowing
                  please. Fill your mouth but not your belly."<br> <br> Absurd. What good is water if you can't drink it? And what good is grace if you
                  don't let it go deep?<br> <br> Do you? What image best describes your heart? A water-drenched kid dancing in
                  front of an open fire hydrant? Or a bristled desert tumbleweed? Here's how you
                  know. One question. Does God's grace <em>defines</em> you? Deeply flowing grace
                  clarifies, once and for all, who we are.</span></p>
