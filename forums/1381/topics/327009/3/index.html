              <p>lol, not showing respect to other religion practices would be going up to every uncle and auntie who are burning tons of paper money, candles, joss sticks and food, and putting it out in front of them. and that's not the case here.</p>
              <p>as a christian, naturally i would think that these practices aren't right, but that's besides the point.</p>
              <p><strong>respect is about allowing others to practice whatever they want to practice, but it doesn't mean i have to agree that what they are doing is right</strong>, because i know that this practice is irrelevant to filial piety, and anyway it is wrong, as a catholic from birth, you surprise me..</p>
              <p>joss sticks burning are logically irrelevant to filial piety. think about it, someone who is really nice and sweet to his parents and took care of them the best he can, until his parents' departure, didn't offer a joss stick during the wake or funeral.</p>
              <p>compare that with his brother, who wasn't around at all, only know how to squander his parents money, incur gambling debts because of a drug problem, a menace to the family, threaten the parents with physical violence etc etc. during the wake, he offers up a ton of joss sticks.</p>
              <p>who is more filial?</p>

              <p>well, TS said that it's a sign of respect, so i'll take it face value. that it really is just a sign of respect.</p>
              <p>but does that mean that the other things in the lists don't speak of respect, if not even more than just the action of joss sticks?</p>
              <p>imo, and this is really just my opinion, joss sticks offering is so showy. everyone's on the look out for that idiot who don't offer joss sticks and is ready to condemn them, not knowing of the other things they have done for the deceased.</p>
              <p>or the other extreme, they have been awful to their parents, so now they make a big show to make it up? but the dead can't appreciate it, physically, psychologically or emotionally.. they're gone, what's the point. the only ppl who can see what you're doing are those who are alive, your relatives, so you're actually doing it for their benefit, and your own benefit, to sooth your aching conscience (this is grounded on the belief that dead ppl actually don't receive anything from us spiritually, a christian belief)</p>
              <p><strong>soosiang was saying that, at the very end, if you offer joss sticks, means you're filial, if you don't, means you're not, regardless of anything you did in the past for the deceased. that's a very flawed logic, because the dead don't appreciate anything being done for them after they're dead. they can't! and it's a very unfair judgement on the child who served his parents and was always there for them, compared to the others, who were just conveniently there at the wake, lighting up a joss stick, and they're branded "Wonderful! 100 marks"</strong></p>
              <p>that's why, let's just assume that i'm not christian first, even if i'm not a christian, it's still logically flawed. at best, you're either doing it, because everyone else is doing it, or at worst, you're just doing it for the sake of not getting pked by your relatives, or just soothing your conscience.</p>
              <p>but the dead, don't benefit.</p>

              <p>that's why i'm not disproving you, i'm disproving TS, whose religion claims to be the same as mine.</p>
              <p>if you're of a different religion, i can't say anything, because you believe you're right. but neither should you hammer me if i don't offer up incense. You won't see christians telling ppl in a taoist of buddhist funeral that they're wrong in offering up incense. But you'll see non christians critisizing christians for not doing so, during the funeral, quietly.</p>
              <p>but the problem is, TS is a catholic, from birth, and he knows the truth, so i'm surprised.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the question here isn't about whether joss sticks are right or wrong, the question is, is it right for a christian to be offering up joss sticks.</p>
              <p>if the basis of the debate is grounded on religion, then obviously a christian, shouldn't do so, because as you said, you believe that the dead receive the offering of joss sticks, to help them with their next life, and we, as christians don't believe that, and because now, it's an offering to a spirit, someone is receiving it, and we believe that there is only 2 powers, God or Satan, and if God isn't receiving anything, means someone else is, and that to us, is wrong.</p>
              <p>And you can't say anything about it, because you're from a different religion, and neither can i disallow you from doing it, because it's your religion, and you're only doing what you think is best and right. we're all just doing what we think is right. But it doesn't mean, either of us, have to agree that the other party is right.</p>
              <p>if the basis of the debate is not grounded on religion, and simply on filial piety, joss stick offering is not relevant to it. as i've pointed out. the dead, don't appreciate it, and it's only for the benefit of the relatives and your own aching conscience. So how is that filial piety?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my example, just simply shows that, joss stick offering, cannot equate to filial piety.</p>

              <p>by the way, you won't see christians telling non believers that they are wrong in offering joss sticks during a taoist funeral, we just simply won't participate in areas we aren't comfortable with.</p>
              <p>but you will see non christians critisizing christians for not participating, quietly by themselves.</p>

              <p>dumbdumb!, God wants us to obey our parents regardless of
              religious beliefs.Do you understand that?Do you know that God views
              disobedient to parents as moral decay?In the 10 commandments, there
              is one commandment which is honour your father and mother.</p>
