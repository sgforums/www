              <p>What are the reasons for me to believe in God?</p>
              <p>Well, it depends on which God. Although I excepted Christ during
              my teens, I grew up with in a family where my father is a Tang Ki,
              a Chinese Medium. He had bloodless scars when he used parangs to
              slash his own belly. He also kept Kun Man Thong (Those Thai statues
              of little children believed to be spirits of children).</p>
              <p>I stopped attending church after my O'levels I also became a
              professed Thai Buddhist where I consulted a Bomoh &amp; I set up an
              altar at my own home, I did'nt even know what I was worshipping. I
              worshipped anything which promises me wealth. It is a Phra Na Prok
              statue, a Buddha sheltered by a Giant Cobra but for mine, the
              statue sitting there was Khum Paeng, a general in Thailand during
              the medievel days, the one who believed to be the Father of all the
              Kun Man Thong. In the Thai mythology, he sweared before the devils
              from Hell to make him the most powerful warrior on earth, he killed
              his wife &amp; roasted his unborn foetus over fire, his foetus
              spirit made him a powerful warrior, but his story also ended up in
              a tragedy.</p>
              <p>The Phra Na Prok statue was one of the kind, with seven monkey
              heads on the Cobra's crown, with Khum Paeng sitting on it.In the
              Cobra's coiled body there were those pearl like bone
              relics(believed to be the monk's unburnt ashes) sealed by a Tan
              Gah. Those copper plates with the symbolic signs.</p>
              <p>I also kept a Phra Som Deq pendant where I will always put on
              faithfully. I also chanted faithfully on every Thurs morning. I
              will also visit Thai Temples to worship Phra Pong, the four face
              Buddha &amp; often get the monks to bless me.</p>
              <p>But a twist of fate happened to me. Although my dad did strike
              4D oftenly, my parents were divorced. Both my parent were down with
              schizophrenia. My Dad was also down with stroke &amp; every single
              organ was failing him. He almost lost his life. For me, I lost my
              job, lost my house, lost my car &amp; what I only have is my wife
              &amp; kid. I looked for a shelter to for my Dad to live in. At
              last, it was a Pastor who lended the 1st helping hand. That was my
              turning point. I returned to Christ. Now my Dad is resting in a
              Methodist nursing home.</p>
              <p>Through this twist of fate, I am now attending church. Although
              life is not smooth &amp; I faced some of my toughest times in my
              life even when I'm a Christian. Me &amp; my wife is on the brink of
              bankruptcy. But deep inside I know that this is the God that I want
              to worship. The God of Abraham, Jacob &amp; Moses. The same God
              which parted the Red Sea &amp; brought His people out of Eygpt. The
              strength which the Lord gave me to overcome the few of my most
              toughest times made me knew that it was'nt me. I was broke but not
              broken. It was my God who strengthened me. I grew in character
              &amp; learnt how to enjoy my family life although we are not
              financially well off, as well as the wisdom to handle money which
              do not seem to be much. I was given the Grace to repent for my
              wrong doings.</p>
              <p>Although I am not saint, but I am looking forward to changing
              myself everyday, from the inside out. I regained my fitness, I have
              a stable job despite the economical madness &amp; I am expecting a
              pay rise next month. No one forced me to accept Jesus as my Lord
              &amp; Saviour. I chose Him because I believe in His goodness, His
              mercy especially His acceptance of who I am.</p>

              <p>Seriously, there's only 1 and only 1 true God/Creator/Source (who doesn't belong to anyone or group), with many highly evolved Masters eg. Jesus helping Him.

              <p>Great to hear that your life has turned for the better. From your description, I'm sure you've been given the necessary spiritual guidance and help in your learning journey, whether you were aware or not.

              <p>God/Creator/Source and Higher Beings distinguish between needs and wants extremely clearly, and also treat required karmic lessons as crucial, always for the highest good of the requestor. So, someone wishing to be rich for the sake of pure pleasure will not get spiritual help to be so, unless it's part of a learning lesson for him/her, as part of his/her lifeplan. That's one reason why we sometimes hear of people winning lottery jackpot, only to lose everything and more later in his/her life.</p>

              <p>I think that if one chooses to believe in the christian god, one
              has to actually ignore most of the bible, to ignore the teaching
              that it is holy word. Many people who actually believe only hear
              the watered-down version, where all the inflammatory verses
              advocating murder, war, and slavery are not usually mentioned or
              reinterpretated according to the moderate views of today.</p>

              <p>Yah...it is true that less for Jesus, all the Biblical heroes are far from perfect. You are right. There are quite alot of war stories in the Bible &amp; most of the Bible heroes also sinned. Let me quote you the book of Joshua chapter 2. Rahab is a prostitute. She is not a Jew. She is far from perfect. But she heard of the God of Israel &amp; she believed.</p>
              <p>She hid Joshua &amp; his gang &amp; she lied to the group of pursuers. At the end of the day, she was married to Salmon &amp; gave birth to Boaz, who became one of the richest barley field owners in the land &amp; Boaz became the kinsmen redeemer for Ruth, a Moabite woman, the enemy of the Jews in her days.</p>
              <p>The genealogy went down to the line of David, where David had an affair with Uriah's wife &amp; gave birth to Solomon, the richest king &amp; wisest Jewish King who ever lived &amp; the genealogy went down to Jesus.</p>
              <p>Now think with me. Rahab is one of the ancestors of Jesus. Rahab was a prostitute. But why her name is listed in the geanology of Jesus to be read &amp; honoured by millions of Christians today? Was it because of her good behaviour? I don't think so. She lied &amp; she sold her body for a living. That is something which human logic do not understand.</p>

              <p>What are the reasons for me to believe in God?</p>
              <p>Well, it depends on which God. Although I excepted Christ during my teens, I grew up with in a family where my father is a Tang Ki, a Chinese Medium. He had bloodless scars when he used parangs to slash his own belly. He also kept Kun Man Thong (Those Thai statues of little children believed to be spirits of children).</p>
              <p>I stopped attending church after my O'levels I also became a professed Thai Buddhist where I consulted a Bomoh &amp; I set up an altar at my own home, I did'nt even know what I was worshipping. I worshipped anything which promises me wealth. It is a Phra Na Prok statue, a Buddha sheltered by a Giant Cobra but for mine, the statue sitting there was Khum Paeng, a general in Thailand during the medievel days, the one who believed to be the Father of all the Kun Man Thong. In the Thai mythology, he sweared before the devils from Hell to make him the most powerful warrior on earth, he killed his wife &amp; roasted his unborn foetus over fire, his foetus spirit made him a powerful warrior, but his story also ended up in a tragedy.</p>
              <p>The Phra Na Prok statue was one of the kind, with seven monkey heads on the Cobra's crown, with Khum Paeng sitting on it.In the Cobra's coiled body there were those pearl like bone relics(believed to be the monk's unburnt ashes) sealed by a Tan Gah. Those copper plates with the symbolic signs.</p>
              <p>I also kept a Phra Som Deq pendant where I will always put on faithfully. I also chanted faithfully on every Thurs morning. I will also visit Thai Temples to worship Phra Pong, the four face Buddha &amp; often get the monks to bless me.</p>
              <p>But a twist of fate happened to me. Although my dad did strike 4D oftenly, my parents were divorced. Both my parent were down with schizophrenia. My Dad was also down with stroke &amp; every single organ was failing him. He almost lost his life. For me, I lost my job, lost my house, lost my car &amp; what I only have is my wife &amp; kid. I looked for a shelter to for my Dad to live in. At last, it was a Pastor who lended the 1st helping hand. That was my turning point. I returned to Christ. Now my Dad is resting in a Methodist nursing home.</p>
              <p>Through this twist of fate, I am now attending church. Although life is not smooth &amp; I faced some of my toughest times in my life even when I'm a Christian. Me &amp; my wife is on the brink of bankruptcy. But deep inside I know that this is the God that I want to worship. The God of Abraham, Jacob &amp; Moses. The same God which parted the Red Sea &amp; brought His people out of Eygpt. The strength which the Lord gave me to overcome the few of my most toughest times made me knew that it was'nt me. I was broke but not broken. It was my God who strengthened me. I grew in character &amp; learnt how to enjoy my family life although we are not financially well off, as well as the wisdom to handle money which do not seem to be much. I was given the Grace to repent for my wrong doings.</p>
              <p>Although I am not saint, but I am looking forward to changing myself everyday, from the inside out. I regained my fitness, I have a stable job despite the economical madness &amp; I am expecting a pay rise next month. No one forced me to accept Jesus as my Lord &amp; Saviour. I chose Him because I believe in His goodness, His mercy especially His acceptance of who I am.</p>
