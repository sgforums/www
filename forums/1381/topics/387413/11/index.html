              <p>If you look at Communism practiced by Soviet Union and Mao's China, you would have clearly knew that it's not atheist...Stalin and Mao both built cults of themselves which place them as the "heroes" of the nations and maybe even god-like. Atheist? Or religious? (in these two cases, Stalinism and Maoism).</p>

              <p>atheism, communism, .... let's introduce another useful word - Secularism (comes in both hard and soft type). </p>
              <p>Depending on the context we are in...Sg is a multi-racial-cultural-religious society...the govt could not take sides...hence, it is prudent to adopt secularist approach - that politics and religion should be separable..even so, secularism also has its problems of being anti-religious while its main intention is to be religious-neutral. </p>
              <p>in another country where dominantly a religion is upheld by almost all...it is usually taken that their politics often sought religious decisions - state religion, churches or mosques or temples....</p>
              <p>no matter which mode was chosen, it would still depends on the people using it....</p>
              <p>if one chooses to believe, by all means, good for him or her; if not to believe, also good and all the best...the problem starts when we question to the point of being vicious as to why one choose to believe or not believe....</p>

              <p>I believe that there has been enough elaboration on this point.
              Do the communists do what they do based on atheism? Is atheism a
              specific driving factor? The idea that gnomes may exist can cause
              people to go hunting for them, but for those that have no such
              idea, it possesses no driving force. For much of the horrors of
              religious governments, they do so specifically because of the
              religion. Driven by what they think god wants/commands. As such we
              can see the clear disparity between atheist governments and
              religious ones</p>

              <p>Yes, perhaps in cases of persecution of clergymen they did so because of atheism, but as for religious governments, they persecute everyone not of their religion, the inquisition even persecuted their own. Looking away from the side of the government, we can clearly see how dangerous the religious can become. How many atheists go pointing guns in churches, compared to the terrorists of today?</p>

              <p>Of course any ideology can, but its the extent that matters. I dont think an atheist would want to give up his life in a suicide attack, unlike the many religious that would do it today. The fact that religion advocates life after death shows how dangerous it is as it convinces people that dying in this life in an attack is somehow good, making them a martyr</p>

              <p>Of course any ideology can, but its the extent that matters. I

              <p>Erm, the data indicates your conclusion is not correct. You are assuming that an atheist will be egoistic in nature and places top value in his own existence. Not believing in God does not automatically mean you'll do that, other things can take the place of the instinct of survival.</p>
              <p>Athiests do give up their lives for their cause, history is full of examples.</p>
              <p>As in athiest- I refer to those who do not believe in an afterlife and reward after death as part of their ideas.</p>
              <p>Just look at the amount of people who gave up their lives for revolutions of order that had very little to do with promising an afterlife. If anything Communism is a good indication of that. The Chinese suicide human-wave attacks in the Korean war, red terrorist suicide bombings. What have you not.</p>
              <p>People are willing to die for ideas. If there's an afterlife or not is often irrelevant. All you need to do is to work them up to believe that their own life/ the individual is unimportant and that it serves the greater good. You'll have legions ready to die for you even if dying means the end for them, no reward.</p>
              <p>Afterlife not needed.</p>

              <p>As I said. Dogma and ideas kill people not God.</p>
              <p>It can be athiestic or theistic, it does not matter. Give the
              ignorant a reason to kill and they will kill. You don't need to
              believing in God to become a raving, killing monster. You just need
              to believe in something, anything that justifies the killing to
              another human being.</p>
              <p>Atheism could also be used for a reason to kill just as much
              theism is. If somebody convinced you that being athiest, and
              removing all the theists was the best way forward for humanity and
              that one has to do what it takes to achieve that goal. It's
              entirely easy to see how all this could happen.</p>
              <p>My point is not that atheism is inherenty bloodthirsty- my point
              is ANY idea can become a bloodthirsty and murderous idealogy under
              the right/wrong conditions. The problem is human beings. If
              athiests can disavow the actions of the communists then Christians
              and Muslims can disawov the actions of the crusaders and Islamic
              extremists as well, and what have you not.</p>
              <p>Hence I find this focus on religion as the root of all evils
              ala. Dawkins greatly myopic.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, theism or athiesm is a philosphical
              framework from which you determine your worldview and actions. The
              decisions and actions you take with this framework is entirely up
              to you. But enough with the claptrap that theism inherently leads
              to violence. All ideas do. Being an athiest does not automatically
              make you more peace-loving or rational.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I don't believe anyone is claiming being atheist=more peace-loving.</p>
              <p>And I agree that some atheists are just as bad as religious extremists.</p>
              <p>What are you implying here: "If
              athiests can disavow the actions of the communists then Christians
              and Muslims can disawov the actions of the crusaders and Islamic
              extremists as well, and what have you not."?</p>
              <p>Look through our human history and tell me how many times is God/gods used as excuses for murdering of others? Why did crusaders shout "Deus Vult" as they cut down Jews, Muslims and even the native Christians when they capture Jerusalem? Or Islamic terrorists shouting "Allahu Akbar" before they blow themselves up to kill westerners and even their fellow Muslims?</p>

              <p>yes religious extremism is dangerous. but then illiteracy and economic realities also played a part.usually the people who are illiterate and poor from the slums are targeted by terrorists, who uses religion as an excuse to carry out targets. but then highly educated people are also susceptible as they believed they are fighting a holy and just war / cause.</p>

              <p>I find confusion about the concept of extremism. How can it be considered extreme when someone takes the text of say the Koran or the OT literally? One cannot be certain that their interpretation of the text is correct, yet the so-called "extremists" can argue that they are following scripture to the letter. Extremism seems to be nothing more than a label for those who disagree with the interpretation of the masses. The extremists might be the moderates while the moderates the "softies"</p>
