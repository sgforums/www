              Hello to you, to answer your question, I pray that God will instill his spirit in you so that you will understand the things of God.
              Let me explain why you need his spirit.
              We are mortals therefore as mortals we are not capable to comprehend the things that are spiritual.
              So to be in the spirit, one must be born again.
              To then accept Jesus, you are then born into a new birth.
              A spiritual birth. Let me refer you to what the bible says in1cor2:11..
              Even so the things of God knows no man except God.
              Is not possible  you experience the electric current without touching it and anyone to explain the experience to you.
              By the way, you want to disqualify my answer you can as I am also of nature.
              Again my point of reference to the bible.It says,"know the truth and the truth shall set you free".
              Free from what?free from lies, deception,free from our mortal finite understanding.
              And in the book of Hebrews,it says, "without faith(word of God), it is impossible to please God, for he that come to God must belive that he is and is a rewarder of them that Diligently seek him.
              You then need the word of God as is the language of the Spirit without it is impossible to know him.
              I hope I am not boring you, but hope that you will be enlighten by the grace of God.

              <p>first paradox on angel lucifer becoming satan. in the beginning he is jealous and rebel against god and created hell. but the thing is how did he has these sort of feelings? to attribute all evils to satan is naive and simple. everyone have these sort of emotions. so you are saying that teenagers that have angst and are rebellious are attributable to satan? so back to satan, why does he wants to rebel against god? because he is clouded by ignorance and fueled by his own delusions. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if god is all merciful and compassionate, why is the world in such a misery. if god is powerful, then can he create something he cant lift? if he can, he is not all powerful. if he can, then he also isnt all powerful either.</p>

              <p>Sad that we have people who is okay with the fact that Jews were sent to their death by Europeans other than the Nazi Germans and thinks just because Germany apologized, it means the other European nations who are involved in this crime shouldn't be blamed.</p>

              <p>Actually this is the same for all ideas. Actually a simple look into history quickly reveals that people are quite willing to kill for just about any idea.</p>
              <p>The idealogy that killed the most people in the shortest time, prehaps with the bloodiest legacy in human history was not any religion. It was an transformational atheistic idealogy with an incredible bodycount of over 149 million dead since 1918.</p>
              <p>Communism.</p>
              <p>In short, all the idealogies of religions and the atheistic idealogies in the french revolution and what have you not put together could not even come close to exceeding the bodycount of Commonism.</p>
              <p>I think people are too quick to pin stuff on religion. The data indicates otherwise.</p>

              <p>I believe that there has been enough elaboration on this point. Do the communists do what they do based on atheism? Is atheism a specific driving factor? The idea that gnomes may exist can cause people to go hunting for them, but for those that have no such idea, it possesses no driving force. For much of the horrors of religious governments, they do so specifically because of the religion. Driven by what they think god wants/commands. As such we can see the clear disparity between atheist governments and religious ones</p>
