              <p>If you wish to use nature as an example, then everyone else will argue that "their God" created it, thus i see no point. Another thing is that using nature, something like the Intelligent Design idea, is explained by evolution.</p>

              <p>Yes, there are many things we need not believe in, but whether we do or not has no bearing on our current lives. In the case of religion, its effects are far reaching, thus the need to have a stricter criteria to face it. As for the argument of caution, if you wish to be on the safe side, you might as well join every religion. This alternative renders the argument moot</p>

If you want to believe in Jesus, you either reap the benefits or suffer the consequences! If you want to believe in Taoism, you either reap the benefits or you suffer the consequences! Sama sama for any other thing or any other decision you make. My only food for thought is always, are we able to afford those consequences? Its not just in your faith or belief, in every decision in life, your career, your family, especially a big decision, dun you ask yourself whether that would either bring you great benefit or if it was a wrong one, are we able to bear the consequence? At the end of the day, no one can force you to make a decision for YOUR OWN LIFE. You decide to believe in Jesus, cool! You decide not to, cool! I do not go around telling people that they suck just because they have a different faith from me you know hurhurhur</span></p>
              <p>If u in anything just because of the fear of the consequences

              should is dangerous.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But of course! I believe in Jesus because I do. My mother believes in Taoism because she does. When people shares with her the gospel, she dismisses it because if she doesnt believe in Jesus, she certainly doesnt believe all that bullcrap about going to heaven or hell just becos of a decision. And like I said, I never said anyone should believe because of the consequences. I am only saying IF THIS WAS ALL TRUE, are you able to handle the consequences? And some people would say YES I CAN, then cool! Why should anyone has anything to say then if someone is willing to take that risk and believes in what he thinks he should believe? I certainly think so because being the only believer in my entire family history allows me and the rest of my family members to respect and appreciate each other's diverse beliefs.</span></p>

              <p>hahaha thats what some people are doing and why? the reason was cause of fear of the unknown and fear of the supernatural. some wants prosperity and blessings of good life and good fortune/luck, that is why they go pray or worship to this god or that god. thats human nature for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when life dun turn out the way they want it to be, or they encounter some difficulties in life or bereavement, turning to a god is one good way to relieve emotional turmoil they are facing in their lives. different people have different reasons getting involved in their religions.</p>

              <p>hahaha thats what some people are doing and why? the reason was
                  cause of fear of the unknown and fear of the supernatural. some
                  wants prosperity and blessings of good life and good fortune/luck,
                  that is why they go pray or worship to this god or that god. thats

              <p>when life dun turn out the way they want it to be, or they

              <p>Yes, there are many things we need not believe in, but whether
              we do or not has no bearing on our current lives. In the case of
              religion, its effects are far reaching, thus the need to have a
              stricter criteria to face it. As for the argument of caution, if
              you wish to be on the safe side, you might as well join every
              religion. This alternative renders the argument moot</p>

              <p>In this case, everyone makes decisions all the time. And like I said, every decision may comes either with a benefit to you or there may be consequences. Knowing the consequences does not necessarily put a person off making that decision. A person may resign from his job because he is damn unhappy but he knows the consequence is that his family may need to suffer for a short while until he finds a new job. He knows that consequence but he was prepared to take it because he was really unhappy. All I am saying is, know the consequences and benefits of every single decision you make. If at the end of the day, making the decision to not believe in Jesus after understanding both the benefits and consequences of not believing, then its your decision! No one should have anything to say then!</p>

              <p>Haha but my friend, you got to understand! You are standing on the ground that all these God or gods do not exist. Christians however believe that everything originates from God! They will say they are right which of cos you do not agree. You will say your point is right which of cos they will nto agree. See the similarity here? Christians believe what they believe, you believe what you believe. This is not about right or wrong. This is just about different beliefs!</p>

              <p>but you can change your belief system if something convinces you otherwise or you can do some soul searching yourself. in the meantime, do use common sense and willing to challenge conventional truths, esp from an era of 2000 years ago.</p>

              <p>Cos I always believe that there is a God out there. I did not buy the big bang theory. You ask me to show you physical evidence i do not have. Though not intensive, I did some questioning on various reglions from various people and I ended up believing in Jesus some 16 years ago.I have personal experiences that came later in my life on why I continued in my faith in Jesus. I do feel sad seeing the state of some churches nowadays but I was very clear that I believe in Jesus not these churches. But thats another story.</p>
              <p>And because I have talked to so many people, I also came to understand the meaning of religious tolerance, to agree to disagree. I am very happy to say that I can a discussion with most muslim friends or buddhist friends or taoist friends or homosexual friends on my beliefs and they still count me as their good friends. I do not believe in being pushy. I state my beliefs and thats it, i will never say you SHOULD or SHOULD NOT. No one can make that decision for you.</p>
