              <p>I have no opinion on marriage, since im not married. I guess most people just look at their parents as examples, while some don't believe in eternal bliss. Lets say you get married, what have you to lose(except maybe the divorce settlement)? You would probably enjoy it for some period of time. For religion you might be wasting your precious moments of life worshipping a deity, worrying away on the small things that you think does not please god. On a micro scale it might improve the lives and give hope. On a macro scale, theres always the fanaticism, more apparent in religion compared to other things like patriotism, as well as emotional distress perhaps.</p>

              <p>I am the TS... Most of the three pages don't really give any substantial reasons for belief. Science does exist because of nature, but the conflict between science and religion occurs when religion says otherwise, (e.g. creationism). It took hundreds of years to prove heliocentricity, which was a major disgrace to the church, which called such ideas herectical. If we had taken the church's word for it, we would have not advanced this much in science. It might take centuries to find out about the beginnings of life. Because christianity offers a plausible but improbable answer, I would not be so quick to endorse it due to lack of other explanations. As we look back on the past today, how people thought the earth was flat, the centre of the universe, think about how the future generations of humans might come to see us.</p>

              <p>Yes, we usually don't look at the statistics, I guess that kinda answers your qn on why folks get married.I can't prove that you won't be divorced,  but at the moment of marriage I would assume you love your spouse. Based on the evidence there and then, i would say you would enjoy marriage, however the conditions may change</p>

              word...experience...and we are toking abt PERSONAL experience cos
              person 1 experienced the direct opposite...so to person 1, blissful
              marriages do exist...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>likewise, wads the diff btw christians and non-christians? the
              PERSONAL experiences we have that non-christians dun...you say
              there are sufferings, black sheep, killings within the faith, we
              acknowledge tat...isnt this like marriage? there are happy ones,
              sad ones, horrendous ones...so teh conclusion is, where do u place
              ur emphasis on? the positive or the negative? needless, to say
              where ur emphasis is depends heavily on ur
              experiences/non-experiences...</p>

              <p>I was mistaken on the flat earth part, but the church did claim the sun revolved around the earth... In response to the experience part, that argument holds little water to convert anyone to christianity. If many from all kinds of religion lay claim to their personal experiences, all we can say is that these "experiences" are actually figments of the imagination. Unlike that of marriage, which is a seen and proven reality. Are you likely to believe a man with a bad experience with his marriage, or one who says he had an argument with Zeus? I remember this phrase which i feel makes alot of sense. "We are all atheists without regards to Thor, Amon-ra or Zeus. Some of us just go one god further"</p>

              <p>Agree. Some pastor even have the cheek to say that chinese's religion is suspose to be christianity blah blah blah. Never belive in that. Anyway, I belive in God and exsistence of Jesus, as it had indeed changes my life, but I will not let the thing called "Christainity" to blind me from the very fact that the other religion exsist, and other theology and sciences that seem to be oppose to what the bible have shown. My only reason in church is to praise God, acknowledge the exsistence of Jesus (be it a prophet or a son of god, which does not really mattar to me since I not 100% christian), and the bible often contain words that enlighten us, which can be applied to our daily life.</p>
