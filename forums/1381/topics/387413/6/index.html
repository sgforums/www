              Yea there's truth in that but people should know what they believe in otherwise it's easy for other people to confuse them then again if one falls for a lie or get confused over lies I wouldn't say that they are really called into God in the first place.

              <p>Seriously,</p>
              <p>The bible has a very BIG MISTAKE.</p>
              <p>If you add up everything, the ages of Adam until the present age, the age of the Earth is only 6000years old. But then, there are tribes in this world of 30000years old, and also a religion called Hinduism which is around 10 000 years old. Isn't it odd? And then God says he gives us free will but then he said he has some plan for us in our lives. That is a very obvious paradox. The bible is false.</p>

              <p><br>Deism on a fundamental level is closer to Theism than Atheism because of the belief in the possibility of a God.</p>
              <p>However, in actual practice Deism and Atheism has far less conflicts with each other than Deism and Theism because Deism makes far less assumptions of this God and do not expect miracles and interventions nor expects better odds through ritualized prayers and offerings.  </p>
              <p>Deists also believe that God is a better engineer than organized religion thinks and do not need to interfere at all with the material universe (miracles, etc).</p>
              <p>So, the more accurate description would be that Deism is the abandonment of Theism and a step closer to Atheism.</p>

              <p>It's more legitimate you see, instead of saying "I am special" he says "Jesus/God tells me i'm special". You make yourself more credible by claiming that another entity said it.</p>
              <p>It's quite a common cult practice.</p>
              <p>By saying that the system is deliberately out to get him, he hopes to get sympathy so that people would pay more attention to him and make him feel special.</p>
              <p>That said, he harms the cause of getting rid of the PAP more than helping it considering he can so easily be made a poster child of the "Crazy Opposition Supporter"</p>

                                I'm not trying to potray anything but the truth. As far as I believe we are all special just that few people believe that. And I'm not trying to get sympathy but Im trying to EXPOSE this corrupt LKY and FAMILEE. You Singaporeans have villains as your rulers. Just where did I claim that Jesus said I was special your argument is baseless. You are either speculating or making lies
                                 <br><br>And judging your judgment I say you're one of those PAPer. One of their tactic is to make genuine opposition to be made like false and to discourage real people who have been persecuted while they pretended to bait dissident for further process.

                                The very fact that laurence and you are posting in eternal hope to make accusation on me to discourage me instead to reply to a genuine question in a Christian forum is a valid proof that you are here as a PAPer. Any fool could see right through that. You're not much of an analyst mister stevenson people could see lie through your posts.
