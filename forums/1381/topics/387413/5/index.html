              <p>Why would you adopt a creationist mindset? Most people do so because they don't buy/understand the scientific theories, and since creation is the only plausible explanation around that they are willing to accept, they see it as truth. Another argument is that even if you acknowledge the Big Bang Theory, there remains no explanations for the protons that collided. I think the invention of a repetition terminator like a deity is not a very logical explanation. If one can apply the eternal existence concept to a god, why not to the protons in the big bang? To support creationism, i think is a complete denial of evolution, which has plenty of evidence behind it. </p>

              <p>i could see that you are not truly seeking from the previous few
              posts...hence i wun indulge in apple-orange discussions...u are not
              willing to even try looking at christianity diff from other
              religions. neither are u willing to put on the creationist mindset
              juz to hear the creation believers out. admit it, you are here
              to question wif the mentality to throw out any evidence or
              explanations the christians give to u...</p>

              <p>Accepting that the big bang happened by chance does seem less ludicrous than a deity actually bothering to care about humans, who seem so insignificant in perspective. Some think that earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, plagues and diseases are because of human sin. Why is it always about humans? What makes humans so important that nature actually bends because of what we do? Am I to understand that Jupiter is there for the human race? After some time thats how christianity is like to me, seems totally devoid of reason. </p>
