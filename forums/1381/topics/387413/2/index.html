              <p>Haha but my friend, you got to understand! You are standing on
                  the ground that all these God or gods do not exist. Christians
                  however believe that everything originates from God! They will say
                  they are right which of cos you do not agree. You will say your
                  point is right which of cos they will nto agree. See the similarity
                  here? Christians believe what they believe, you believe what you
                  believe. This is not about right or wrong. This is just about
                  different beliefs!</p>

              <p>yes that should be the way, but not all christians are as tolerant and patient as you are. But I do not blame them, cos they are trapped in their own religious paradigm, when they go telling others the god you are worshipping are satanic, or the idol you pray to are made of wood or gold.</p>

              <p>Fair enough! I would like to say that believing in Jesus is nothing LOGICAL! If it was logical, we do not have to call it faith! But alot of times, just as zealous christians tried to use their so called bible knowledge and tried to argue the way through with people using logic and science, the opposite happens too. I think both parties need to really understand what it mean to agree to disagree. I leave those who must argue until one party surrenders alone and I leave those to apologetics and those scholars who thrive on such intellectual discussions. To me, the principle remains, you state your beliefs, I state mine, I respect yours, you respect mine. the moment respect is not there, end of discussion, thats my stand.</p>

              <p>This is partly the reason for my contention with the abrahamic religions, when some believers claim that they are 100% right. Such religious beliefs should cease to be taught in schools, when the teachers themselves know to a large extent that they might be wrong, but due to their beliefs, refuse to address the doubt</p>

              <p>I understand what you are trying to say. When what you try to push what you believe into someone's else throat, it becomes propaganda and no one likes that. Instead of saying that what I believe is 100% right , I simply say, I have 100% belief in what I believe in. Big difference in those 2 mentalities.</p>

              <p>Within this thread itself? I agree, though we cannot say that everyone's beliefs stem from those reasons, I agree that in the past and even till now, alot of such believers stem from the fear of the unknown and to buy 'insurance' for themselves. Religion was even used as a political tool and we all know the history of the Catholic church, or the Muslim and Christian crusades...</p>

              <p>Yes, but as I also state, not everyone is like that. I do not think there are going to be alot of this kind of mass crusades going on now. Terrorism is different, they are not real practioners of the religion. I think nowadays people can sit down and talk about differences in beliefs more peacefully. There are still people like me, who believes simply because I believe.</p>
