              <p>also most churches will not officiate a marriage if one party is not a Christian.</p>

              <p>Can you imagine if I go Buddhism forum and start saying that I am offended whenever they share about karma and Buddha's teaching?  It's ridiculous right?  They reserve the right to say Buddha's teaching very good how good how good in their forum.  Likewise, this is a christian forum. </p>

              <p>nope that's not what I said... what I said is, let each couple make the choice themselves. the church leaders should not go at start making issues about it.</p>

              <p>well of coz its wrong to convert to Christianity and go to church for girls. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT if through these girls u meet, u are truly convicted and become faithful and love God. then yes that's fine. </p>

              <p>hi vince... long time...</p>
              <p>reality as i see it, is, even Christian couples get into relationship problem..... i just think we place too much emphasis on the "unequally yoke" thing.</p>
              <p>and reality is, we really don't know what is going to happen in the future.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>think of all the "unequally yoked" couples in the Bible....</p>
              <p>Ruth was a Moabite woman and there is no indication that she worships Jehovah.</p>
              <p>Esther husband was a Persian king, whom I am sure also does not worship Jehovah.</p>

              <p><br>Hi unker</p>
              <p>maybe different people understand this "unequally yoke" thing differently. However, this is a real problem that need to be dealt with seriously.</p>
              <p>to me, this is not about christian/non-christian or christian/christian or non-christian/non-christian thing, its between two individual person.</p>
              <p>to me, unless these differences in ideology, world view, characters, expectation, ...etc are dealt with. these will potientially be problem for the future which will result in heartaches.</p>
              <p>I agree that this is about choices, but personally, its best that both parties deal with these differences before committing to any relationship.</p>

              <p><br>yes, conflicts and problem, we will have and continue to have, its how we deal with these that help us grow.</p>

              <p>however, there are things that can be dealt with, before it becomes a problem/conflict, these should be delt with, very fast.</p>

              <p>as for outsider, ... love is blind... sometime, these "outsider" meant well when they raise this alarm (maybe, they need training on communication skill, haha)...</p>
