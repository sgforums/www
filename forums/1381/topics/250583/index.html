Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.<br><br>21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.<br><br>22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:<br><br>23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.<br><br>24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.<br><br>25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.<br><br>26 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.<br><br>27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.<br><br>28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.<br><br>29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.<br><br>Does this help?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've always like how a good friend of mine once described Faith. She told me that a quiet knowing of God feels her with awe and wonder and amazement. Granted, there are times where we backslide and we doubt. But that's part of our faith journey. At least to me, i dun need to see miracles to believe. It's funny how you mention about encountering God. We encounter God everyday. In our prayers, in nature, in love, the list just goes on. Sorry if i am not answering your question. Because i probably don't know how to. Godspeed.</div>

This can be counted as another intervene from God right?<br><br>My Qn: If God wanted to heal me right, why doesnt he heal me directly,then i can know for sure it was God's work, which will strenthen my faith. Why does he heal me, eg through the doctor's hands and natural laws. Like that we will never be sure if it were God's work.<br></div></blockquote>my take?<br><br>If God has to heal you divinely, why did you need to fall sick in the first place? Why not just assume that everyone should not fall sick because of God's power?<br><br>Another way of looking at it.... if by dying one goes to heaven, why the need to be healed?<br><br>How about.... why do you need to God to strengthen your faith by showing you "intervention"?</div>
