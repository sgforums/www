Do you feel that the last words of Christ were significant? If so, why do the four gospels attribute three different sentences to Christ as his last? (Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34: "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?"; Luke 23:46: "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit"; John 19:30: "It is finished".<br><br>Answer:  <a href="http://www.carm.org/diff/Mark15_34.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/diff/Mark15_34.htm</a><br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>46. At no point in the four Gospels did Jesus claim to be the son of your god. (He said "son of man" quite frequently, and at one point referred to himself as "a son of god," but that was a common Hebrew expression at the time. Someone who was "a son of god" was a Jew. This reflected the Israelites' belief that they were the chosen people of your god. See Job 1:6). Why, then, do you believe that Jesus was divine? If you don't believe that Jesus was divine, then why do you call yourself a Christian?<br><br>Actually, look at Daniel 9.  The term "Son of Man" is a term used for one who enters in the very presence of God, and is given absolute dominion and authority.  This means that the term "Son of Man" can only be a term for the Jewish Messiah, a Person of great exaltation.  This explains why the high priest Caiaphas tore his clothes when he heard Jesus make the remark about being the Son of Man; Jesus basically said that He was the Messiah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>47. Given the fact that Jesus did not say anything original (the Golden Rule and the "turn the other cheek" idea were stolen from Buddhism; and the Beatitudes were common in the Jewish devotional literature at the time), why do you see Jesus as such a great thinker/philosopher/ethicist?<br><br>How did Jesus steal it from Buddhism, when no contact between ancient India and the Roman Empire to that time is ever recorded?  Where are the Beatitudes in "the Jewish devotional literature [of] the time," and when did Buddha use the term "turn the other cheek?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>48. When Jesus said, "Resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also," why do you suppose that most Christians fight for their rights? To put it another way, why don't we, as a country of 85% Christians, let the government abuse us?<br><br>Actually, you may have a point.  Of course, some say that there is a limit.  In countries all over the world, people are arrested, exiled, imprisoned, tortured, and killed for their faith in Christ.  Today, more people are executed for their faith than during the 300 year time period that Christianity was in the Roman empire.  And not just in Communist and Muslim countries.  In South America, Marxist rebels and drug lords execute Christians just because they will not join their causes.<br><br>And the Catholic-oriented government doesn't help much, either (keep in mind, the RCC is not very tolerant toward Protestants, it's just that they can't do anything about it here in many democratic countries or republics).<br><br>Also when you say "85%", these "85%" include those that self-profess to be Christians who don't even go to church, who haven't even seen a page of the bible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>49. Why are so many Christian holidays on the same day as Pagan holidays? Couldn't the early Church fathers have converted pagans only by appealing to their reason and/or faith if Christianity is the true religion?<br><br>Good question.  Apparently, somebody thought it up, and everyone else either went along or was persecuted because they didn't follow the bandwagon. You must be aware that nobody know which day Jesus was born. People just slapped on 25th December as Christmas. Many Christians do not celebrate Christmas as the world do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>50. Explain how your god can be "just and merciful" in light of Exodus 20:5.<br><br>Like it says, He's a jealous god.  Why worship something that doesn't exist?  Plus, it is more than likely that whatever ideas that you believe will be passed along through your children, so God's only doing what is deserved.  Look at the kings of Israel.  After the kingdom split into Israel (the ten northern tribes) and Judah (the tribes of Judah and Benjamin), the kings of Israel didn't have one God-fearing king!  Why else do you think that they were conquered by Assyria?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>51. Do you believe that the Old Testament should be accepted as part of Christian theology? If so, explain how you can worship such a cruel, sadistic asshole (see Numbers 31:17-18, Deuteronomy 20:16, Proverbs 20:30, Amos 3:6, Deuteronomy 13:8, Psalms 3:7, Psalms 52:5, etc.); if not, explain how you can believe that Jesus is the promised savior sent by your god without the messianic prophecies and the ruling rights of the line of David, both of which are in the Old Testament in books such as Isaiah, Zechariah, Daniel, Psalms, etc. (as opposed to, say, believing that Jesus was an irritating nut wandering around saying things that people didn't like much).<br><br>I would really like it if you didn't curse out my Lord, God, Savior, and King.  I try not to show excessive disdain (or any, if possible) towards your belief system.  All of these passages refer to those that do not believe, and probably will never believe.  These people will fight against and reject God no matter what, and then drag Israel down along with them.<br><br>In order to protect God's chosen people, He had to somehow get rid of them.  And since they would have not been saved anyway, it almost wouldn't have mattered.  Yes, I know this is a cruel thing to say, but that is what appears to me the be the truth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>52. Explain why your "just and merciful" god sent bears to kill forty-two children who called his prophet Elisha "baldhead." (See 2 Kings 2:23-24).<br><br>Once more, these people reject not only God, but those that He sent to them.  From the description, these young men would have killed Elisha, given the chance.  Why?  Simple, they were diametrically opposed to his teachings, which were that of holiness, righteousness, and condemnation of the wicked lives that they and the general public were living in at the time.  Their hearts were so hardened, because of their love for that wickedness, that they would never have repented, so then the only thing to do was keep them from hindering the prophet's mission.</div>
