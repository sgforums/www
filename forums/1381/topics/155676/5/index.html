            <div class='col-md body'>31. If Jesus did have to die, why did someone (specifically, Judas) have to be damned in order accomplish the death and resurrection of Jesus? Jesus was at least a volunteer for the cross; I doubt that your god asked Judas if he was willing to go to Hell so that the resurrection could be accomplished.<br><br>Of course not.  The thing is, like Jesus said, "You cannot serve both God and Money."  Like many in our world today (including a lot of Christians), Judas claimed to serve God, but he only served Money.  Betraying Jesus was to him, at first, just a quick way to make a few pieces of silver.<br><br>Also, note that Judas figured out that what he did was wrong, like Peter, but he judged himself and committed suicide.  Unlike Judas, Peter turned to God, and when Christ was resurrected, He forgave him.</div>

Shouldn't we then be worshipping Judas?<br><br>No!  At the time, he was just trying to make a quick buck, and didn't realize that he was fulfilling prophecy by sending Messiah to die.  Actually, also, Satan possessed him, and he obviously didn't know what he was doing.  Look at my answer to question 31 again.  Plus, he did eventually realize that what he did was wrong, and that is why he killed himself.</div>

(See Romans 3:7).<br><br>Read the context, and it would appear that Paul is saying that the ends do not justify the means.

If not, refute or explain away Leviticus 20:13 and Romans 1:26-27.<br><br>He didn't create them, they chose that lifestyle.  Why is it wrong?  It's unnatural.  If God wanted it that way, He would have made Adam and Steve (two men), or Amanda and Eve (two women).  But obviously, He didn't.<br><br>Our modernist view is that homosexuals believe that they were born and created in that manner. They argue that they are either born with additional organs or the lack of. But there has been no scientific proof that this is true. Surely the world love proof-by-science, why the null results even up till this day?</div>

Explain why prayer is OK, but spell casting is not, when both amount to the same thing: requesting that a superior supernatural force to intercede in a way that would be impossible according to the normally accepted laws of physics.<br><br>Prayer does not necessarily request a miracle.  It can be used for praise, worship, strength in times of trouble, etc.  The dark forces of the world (Satan and his minions) have power to work miracles, except that God holds them back when necessary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>36. According to the Gospels, from the Christian standpoint, Jesus was the most important person to ever live. From the Roman standpoint, Jesus was a huge pain in the ass because of his political activities. Explain why nothing was written about his life for over thirty years after his death, and nothing except the Gospels was written until the third century CE.<br><br>My theory is that they were too busy going around and telling people about him!  You must remember, the Roman world was mostly word-of-mouth, not at all like today - internet, fax, teletext, cable TV news. The last book written, Revelation, was written in AD 95.  Compared with other ancient writings about prominent figures, this is almost like a news flash!  Take for example Alexander the Great.  The first books written about him were done five hundred years after his death, but no historian says that they're falsified.  Also, inside the New Testament there is proof that the gospels could not have been written later than thirty years after His resurrection.<br><br>The book of Acts, the second in a two-part work by Luke, ends with Paul being kept under house arrest in Rome.  It does not go into his release, missionary journey into Spain, his re-arrest, and beheading.  So, this means that Acts cannot have been written later then AD 62.  Working back from this, and giving a year or two between the gospels, we see that Matthew and Luke were written about AD 60-61, and Mark (generally considered to be the oldest gospel) was written no later then AD 60, possibly even the late 50s.  Plus, we can look at the 1 Corinthians 15 creed (a four line formula summarizing what the gospels teach), which was included in this letter that was written before the gospels, and see that it was made around the time Paul was converted (we can tell this b/c of the early terms such as "the Eleven" and the use of Peter's Aramaic name Cephas), within two to eight years of the resurrection of Christ!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>37. Explain why you believe a person whose life is so poorly documented (see #36) was even ever born.<br><br>People, including the Roman authorities and the Jewish historian Josephus (keep in mind that both groups hated the Christians), acknowledged Jesus' birth and death.  If they really wanted to put a blow in this cult, they would have said, "No, he was never born and you know it!"  But they knew that many of the facts that the early church had could be supported.  You could almost say that they were too honest.<br><br>Also if we were to take this question literally, i think 99.9% of the world population should never been born since no one is going to document our lives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>39. Explain why Jesus, who was anti-Gentile (see Mark 7:25-29) and anti-sex (see Luke 14:26 and Matthew 19:12), would want to be anointed with oil in a pagan sexual rite after his death (see your definition for #3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>By his own admission, he came to see the lost, the sinners of the world.  As He said, "It is not the healthy that see a doctor, but the sick."<br><br>I already explained the anti-Gentile and anti-women questions.<br><br>As He also said (loosely), "When John the Baptist came, and he did not eat or drink, you [the Pharisees] said, 'This man has a demon.'  But when the Son of Man came, and He did eat and drink, you [again, the Pharisees] said, 'This man is a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners' [prostitutes; remember, He was anointed by Mary Magdalene, a known prostitute]."<br><br>The point here is that this question is not valid because i have already provided you with an answer to anti-Gentile, anti-women and pagan 'Christ'. Just like the Pharisees, you will flip-flop your respond just to justify your question.<br><br></div>

If your god requires that people believe in him and follow his orders through their own free will, why do Christians push their views on public policy?<br><br>Because we believe that the morals that we try to bring into the mainstream have a good and solid basis in secular fact.  Alcoholism and drug abuse brings death and destruction of the family.  Prostitution and sexual promiscuity bring STDs, AIDS, and unwanted pregnancies.

            <div class='col-md body'>44. Explain why being a good Christian requires you to push your beliefs on others. If you do not believe that you have to push your views on others (no matter how much this annoys them), explain why you do not believe this despite the fact that the New Testament seems to suggest that you must do this to get to Heaven (for instance, in Matthew 28:19-20).<br><br>The Great Commission does not say that you won't get into heaven if you don't proclaim the gospel.  Here's how I "push my views" on others:  I try to live the best Christian life I can, and when you notice this, and you wonder why, I will explain the gospel.  If you accept it, praise God!  If not, that's fine, I'll still keep loving you (that is, as Jesus loved the people of His day), I won't jam it down your throat, and you aren't any less of a person in my eyes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>36. According to the Gospels, from the Christian standpoint, Jesus was the most important person to ever live. From the Roman standpoint, Jesus was a huge pain in the ass because of his political activities. Explain why nothing was written about his life for over thirty years after his death, and nothing except the Gospels was written until the third century CE.<br><br>My theory is that they were too busy going around and telling people about him! You must remember, the Roman world was mostly word-of-mouth, not at all like today - internet, fax, teletext, cable TV news. The last book written, Revelation, was written in AD 95. Compared with other ancient writings about prominent figures, this is almost like a news flash! Take for example Alexander the Great. The first books written about him were done five hundred years after his death, but no historian says that they're falsified. Also, inside the New Testament there is proof that the gospels could not have been written later than thirty years after His resurrection.<br><br>The book of Acts, the second in a two-part work by Luke, ends with Paul being kept under house arrest in Rome. It does not go into his release, missionary journey into Spain, his re-arrest, and beheading. So, this means that Acts cannot have been written later then AD 62. Working back from this, and giving a year or two between the gospels, we see that Matthew and Luke were written about AD 60-61, and Mark (generally considered to be the oldest gospel) was written no later then AD 60, possibly even the late 50s. Plus, we can look at the 1 Corinthians 15 creed (a four line formula summarizing what the gospels teach), which was included in this letter that was written before the gospels, and see that it was made around the time Paul was converted (we can tell this b/c of the early terms such as "the Eleven" and the use of Peter's Aramaic name Cephas), within two to eight years of the resurrection of Christ!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
