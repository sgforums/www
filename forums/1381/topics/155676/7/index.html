This is not the Lake of Fire in Revelation 20, but is where the rich man went in Luke 16.  The Lake of Fire is what is found in Revelation 20, where all the unbelievers in history go to at the end of time.  Tartarus is where many demons are chained in everlasting torment.<br><br>I personally believe that these places (both the third heaven and these three places) have no physical location in this universe, but are in fact other dimensions or universes separate from our own. Some say hell is at the core of the Earth which still awaits the mining companies to verify it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>62. Once Satan has someone's soul, what does he do with it?<br><br>Usually, he uses it for his evil purposes.  However, I must clarify.  By default (thanks to Adam, Eve, and the fruit), he has access to every soul from their beginning, though he does not create that being, because he does not have the ability to create.  Those who have accepted Christ into their lives have been taken from the clutches of the devil, though they may still sometimes fall into sin.  The devil and his minions continually deceive anyone that hasn't, so that they may continue to walk in sin.  Some of these have their hearts hardened, so that they will not accept the gospel of Jesus Christ, and will fight against it at every chance they get.</div>
