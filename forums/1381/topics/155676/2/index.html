            <div class='col-md body'>I think that what ben1xy and happy harvest have said are pretty spot on... are you serious about your questions? Seeing as it is you have to copy this from someone else, do you personally have any questions in particular that you would like answered?<br><br>Like they have stated, if you are serious, we are more than happy to have a "chat" with you.<br><br>3. Did everyone who died before Jesus died go to Hell? Justify your answer.<br><strong>No, not everyone went to hell... David is in heaven, so is Moses, so is Elijah... and the list goes on.</strong><br><br>8. Explain why Jesus made apparently racist statements (see Mark 7:25-29).<br>These remarks were not racist but made to test the womans faith. The answer to your question is quoted at the end of the verse... have you even read this yet?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Explain why your god's only son had to die so we can go to magic happy land when we croak.<br><br>God didn't want us to sin, but we did.  But He still wanted to walk with us, and for us to be in heaven with Him.  In His infinite Wisdom, He knew that by sending His Son Jesus to die, that same Jesus' Blood would cleanse all who believed in Him from their sin, allowing them free access into heaven.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2. Did everyone who died before Jesus died go to Hell? Justify your answer.<br><br>No.  All those who died before Jesus and still believed in the one True God went to Paradise, a sort of holding area.  It took the Blood of God's own Son to open the gates and cleanse all sinful people, so that all who believe would go to heaven and be with God.  Luke 16 describes this in detail.<br><br>In a way, the Blood of Christ cleansed the Old Testament saints as well; they looked forward to the prophecies of the cross, while we today look back to what happened on the cross.</div>

Why not highlight ten of the questions that bothers you the most and see if some of us are willing to deal with them.<br><br>End of the day is if I can answer all of them, so what? or if I can answer 90% of them, so what? or if I cannot any of them, so what? It does not make any difference to you anyway right? So why waste my time.<br><br>It is easy to lift something out of the internet and throw it at this forum. It is more difficult however to have an original thought!<br><br>In the first place the original writer is extremely inconsistent. Some questions he asked using the original language of the Bible, others he ignored it totally. Some he enclose the area of interpretation by putting a rope around a verse, others he choose to use other parts of the Bible to contradict another. Some questions were asked using examples of bad behaviour/events and these behaviour/events are now pinned on us presently.
