Don't blame God when we only have ourselves to blame.<br><br>12 can't find anything there<br><br>13 As I said above, God wants people to be near Him, and if they don't, they should be punished for rebellion against their Creator and willful rejection of the One that loves mankind so.

However he "force" us to follow a lifestyle and when we do not, he will send us to hell. Tis is not really "free will" anymore. If free will is the thing tat cause us to be in eternal damnation, then "pluck it out and throw it away"; meaning god should started off by giving us restricted free will from the start.

The thing is, like Jesus said, "You cannot serve both God and Money." Like many in our world today (including a lot of Christians), Judas claimed to serve God, but he only served Money.

God specially create judas to become the role he is playing, tat is betray jesus, take the money and then get killed etc. So in fact from a certain viewpoint juda is a victim of circumstances which he have no real control of.

The actual cause is, according to medical research is physical, such as differences in the brain frontal lobes, hippocampus, and temporal lobes. These differences are heavily linked to the neurocognitive deficits which often occur with schizophrenia, particularly in areas of memory, attention, problem solving, executive function and social cognition. Electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings of persons with schizophrenia performing perception oriented tasks showed an absence of gamma band activity in the brain, indicating weak integration of critical neural networks in the brain. Those who experienced intense hallucinations, delusions and disorganized thinking showed the lowest frequency synchronization.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia</a><br><br><blockquote>haha, certainly u r right about that. adam-eve were created as adults, not infants. then infants see whatever the world is doing, they do the same. as for the covering up part, it's one of manifestations of self-consciousness. even the most indigenous ppl don't walk stark naked. but as these people learn more about the ways of the world, their huts got further and further away frmo each other. these people emphasized more on their personal privacy, moving from a tribe-centered mindset to a more self-profit one.<br><br>it's a little hard to explain, but i hope u get my idea. perhaps u could try reading the first chapters of genesis and ponder what it is.<br><br>to answer your question which i think i had missed. i really take a neutral stand and put in a few fair words here and there. </blockquote>I am glad u know tat there r indeed some indigenous people tat walk around naked. (african tribes, chumash clans, native americans in amazon basin). At one time in greece nudity is accepted. So the idea of "consciousness" is really flawed and men were trained to wear clothes and not out of consciouness. The scientist belief on the true origin of clothing is when they need to wear fur clothes to travel in cold regions. It is probably after religion and other factors set in then men become conscious of nakedness or not.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked</a></div>
