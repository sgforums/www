If someone accepts Jesus, and is "saved," but then turns away from Jesus, is that person still saved?<br><br>I would subscribe to the teaching "Once saved, always saved".  That aside, the Holy Spirit does chasten us when we sin, so that I John 1:9 can take place (repentance and prayer for forgiveness).  This corresponds with Jesus' parable of the lost sheep (a believer that has fallen into temptation and is brought back by the Good Shepard, Jesus Christ).<br><br>So, if you have ever come across a "Christian" that has gone back to drugs, other religions, drinking, gambling, etc, there can be two conclusion:<br><br>1) He was never saved at the first place.<br>2) He is saved, just that God is holding His time to struck him with something big in his life to bring him back to Him.</div>

The Bible supports both these viewpoints. What does your sect think?<br><br>I believe that it is based on faith in Jesus + nothing. That aside, when the bible says "Faith without works is dead." it doesn't mean:<br><br>salvation = Jesus + works.<br><br>it simply means:<br><br>rewards in heaven = Jesus + works<br>in heaven but no rewards = Jesus + no works<br><br>this equation is also very important<br><br>works = fruits of the Spirit<br>fruits of the Spirits = serving the Lord, witness for Christ, keeping good testimony.<br><br>thus, works = serving the Lord, witness for Christ, keeping good testimony.<br><br>So what are rewards? The Bible only mention crowns that you may wear on your head or keep in your heavenly mansion.</div>

The professor answered straight away with a "NO". The couple asked why. The professor confessed that he asked these questions for his acadamic purposes. </blockquote>Putting it in another way, if u come out with 101 questions about people who do not believes in christ and if they manage to answer all of them well, will u drop your faith of being a christian ? I think if u answer the question satisfactory, then u will clear more doubts about your religion.<br><br><blockquote>God didn't want us to sin, but we did. But He still wanted to walk with us, and for us to be in heaven with Him. In His infinite Wisdom, He knew that by sending His Son Jesus to die, that same Jesus' Blood would cleanse all who believed in Him from their sin, allowing them free access into heaven.</blockquote>If he don't wanna us to sin, since he is omnipotent he could have simply made us not sinning  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If he is omnipotent, he could just clense all our sins and give us free access into heaven.

Explain why I should believe that your god is all good when the only real information we have about him is the Bible, which clearly describes him as both good and evil. (See Isaiah 30:32, Luke 14:26, Numbers 31:17-18, Matthew 10:34, Amos 3:6, Deuteronomy 18:8, Deuteronomy 20:16, Exodus 20:5, Exodus 32:27, Isaiah 45:7, Psalms 52:5, Luke 22:36, and Jeremiah 18:11 for a small sample of Biblical passages which describe Jehovah as having an evil morality at times).<br><br>This isn't evil; it is just His punishment for those who will never accept Him, no matter what. You cannot label you mother as 'evil' just because she slaps your hand with the ruler due to your failure to listen to her.<br><br>The Jewish Pharisees alive when Jesus was on earth saw incredible miracles, but yet, they did not (and probably never did) believe in Him.</blockquote>If a mum go around and beat a child or burn him just because he make a noise, I am gonna call her "evil" and call the police to catch her for child abuse. He allocate severe punishment for no good reasons. He do not show the people of his existence, he inevitably created many other religions so why does people get punish for him being unclear ?</div>

This must be clear.</blockquote>U have not answer or refute the quotes from 1 Cor. 11 or 1 Tim 2:11-15. In fact your answer does not say tat the bible is not opressing women. If u look at 1 Tim 2<br><br>11A woman should learn in <strong>quietness and full submission</strong>. 12I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. 13For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 15But women[a] will be saved[b] through childbearingÂ—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.<br><br>They already clearly stated full submission and no authority over a man.

NOTE: under no circumstances will I believe that slavery is an acceptable way to run a society.<br><br>Here's a quote from a packet I'm using in American history:<br><br>"Like America's old South, ancient Rome teemed with slaves who labored in their master's fields and houses. But unlike their counterparts in America, Rome's slaves also could be ship's captains, bankers, business agents, and doctors. They could be of any skin color, well-to-do, highly educated and, given the state of negotiations with their master, eventually free. What emerged centuries later in the New World shed such ancient flexibility for a modern harshness."<br><br>Because the Romans didn't have bankruptcy laws, if you got into financial trouble, selling yourself and/or your family into slavery was, in most cases, the only choice you had. There were people of all races and nationalities enslaved. But in America, all blacks and only blacks were slaves, and that was the part that was wrong. You must also ask: how did the slave trade stop? In the beginning of the 19th century, evangelical Christians rammed through the British Parliament the necessary laws to stop the slave trade, and enforced them with the gun boats. This happened not only on the western African coasts, but in the Persian Gulf, where 13 million slaves (as opposed to 11 million the Americas) were shipped for use by the Arabs.<br><br>Once again, this question entails trying to apply modernistic idealogy to biblical teaching.</blockquote>If i do not read incorrectly, u r not answering the question on whether does the bible support slavery. The bible do support slavery and slavery of watever reasons r really wrong. And u r also avoiding the slavery of negores in south america where amputation and physical torture is employed (even jesus recommend physical punishment to slaves who do not obey)</div>
