            <div class='col-md body'>21. If your god did not want Adam and Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, why did he put the tree in the garden of Eden (and at the center, no less)? Was it for shade? If so, why use something so dangerous as a shade tree? If the purpose of the tree was to tempt Adam and Eve, explain why it's OK for your god to engage in a practice that our modern-day courts of law refer to as "entrapment."<br><br>We may never know, as His ways are not our own.  Some say that it was a test.  If they resisted the serpent, or if they ate the tree of life first, the test would be over, and they would have passed, and gone on to eternal life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>22. Explain why sex, potentially one of the most wonderful, beautiful things in human nature, is considered "bad" by your particular sect. If your sect does not consider sex to be "bad," then refute Matthew 19:12, 1 Corinthians 7 (particularly verses 1 and 9), Galatians 5:17, 1 Thessalonians 4:3, James 1:14-15, Matthew 24:38, Luke 17:27, and Revelation 14:4.<br><br>Between two partners in marriage, it can be a good thing.  If it is homosexual, or if it heterosexual outside of marriage, it is wrong, because God designed it in the perfect, beautiful and holy manner inside of marriage. The key phrase here is "IN MARRIAGE". Anything outside is just wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>23. Explain why, if Jesus was perfect, he thought that the end of the world was coming soon, when it has clearly not come yet. See Matthew 16:27-28.<br><br>II Peter 3:8:  "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."  The past two thousand years are to him merely a couple of days.<br><br>That aside, Jesus might be coming in 5 mintues time, 5 days, 5 hours or 50 years time. We do not know exactly when. But one thing is for sure is that if you look at the situation around the world right now, we could well now be living in the century of Jesus's 2nd coming.</div>

Explain why some people (James, Peter, Paul, Thomas, etc.) should get convincing physical proof of miracles, while the rest of us are supposed to take these happenings on faith.<br><br>They are based on faith all the time.  The Pharisees saw them, and they still didn't believe!  Anyway, God still works in our lives today, you just have to look for it. And no, modern day miracles are not "performed" on stage or pulpits as seen from many churches today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>25. Why are the stories of the resurrection inconsistent?<br><br>They do not seem inconsistent to me.  Please point out the inconsistencies.  God put all the facets in all four gospels so that we could know everything that happened.  Here's why I believe this:  the philosopher says, "They aren't the same, throw it all out."  But the historian doesn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.  He says, "Yes, I see inconsistencies, but they all have the same basis.  A group of women go to visit Jesus' tomb, and someone there meets them and says that Jesus isn't there, and that He has risen from the grave."  The gospels don't say how many women were there, no more and no less, or how many angels/men in white were there, no more and no less.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>26. If you are a Protestant or a member of an Eastern Orthodox church, explain why you are still using the Catholic Bible, which was formalized by a vote among (supposedly divinely inspired) cardinals and bishops in the fourth century CE, when you disagree with the idea that the Pope, who is higher in the Catholic hierarchy, is divinely inspired; if a Catholic, explain why your church accepts the canonical Bible while rejecting the Apocrypha (do not use the "divinely inspired" argument: Because I am not religious, I will not be able to accept it).<br><br>The Old and New Testaments were used way before the members of the council you speak of were even born!  They represent the Jewish Bible and the 27 letters most used by the churches of the time.  Also, they are the books that best represent (in the cases of the gospels and Acts) what really happened.  In the cases of the Epistles, they best represent the first century teaching given by the apostles.  A good example of this is a group of musicians getting together and saying that Beethoven's music was wonderful.<br><br>To my knowledge, the Catholic Church accepts some of the OT Apocrypha simply because they were inserted during the 1500s. They should be able to understand this part of the question.</div>

I am not saying that this is 100% true, but it does fufil bible prophecies<br><br>Matthew 24:6-7 "And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.

If you have someone threatening you with a punishment, it isn't free will.<br><br>See what I wrote for question 11, 12 and 13.  Plus, note today that people in popular culture almost like the idea of going to hell, and look forward to it, as if it wasn't a punishment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>30. Why would your god deliberately cause sinners to sin (cf. Romans 9:15-23 and numerous parts of the book of Exodus where Jehovah says, "I will harden Pharaoh's heart."). Are these sinners still responsible for the sins that your god forces them, against their will, to commit? Justify your answer.<br><br>Look carefully at that passage again.  God doesn't force them to sin, but with their heart hardened, they won't accept Him yet.  This is done so that God's will may be fully accomplished on earth.</div>
