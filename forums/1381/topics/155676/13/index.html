We will still be saddened by not being with our loved ones, but it was their choice. I will admit that the mere thought of billions of people condemned there would make Paradise no longer Paradise.

Explain why original sin exists </blockquote>some slight misunderstanding here i presume. first of all, original sin is not about becoming sexual; for God made man and woman before they even ate the apple - God made human sexual before Adam even ate the apple. the original sin is more on this..<br><br>when satan tempted eve, which led to both eve and adam disobeying God by eating the apple from the tree which God had previously forbade them. by eating the apple, a sort of self-consciousness was borned - for both of them suddenly felt ashamed, covered themselves with leaves and hid from god. i presume by eating the apple, adam and eve, became pretty much of an 'individual' creature, than being 'communal/familial' which god could've wanted the humans to be.<br><br>as for lying...lying by itself isn't a sin. read the bible and that specific commandment carefully. god didn't say 'thou shall not lie', rather, it says 'thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor'. it is through lying, and bearing malice, and causing indirect harm to thy neighbor that is forbidden; not lying.<br><br>about baptism... after all, you're right in saying that one could nevertheless ascend to heaven without being baptized. after all, baptism, or the process of being dunked is really an act came up by early christians to symbolize repentence. it's really just a symbol.<br><br>stupidissmart, r u RC? people don't know about the concept of limbo anymore. i heard limbo that is something that was came up by the clergy of the middle RC long way back. juz curious.</div>

In tat case there really isn't anythign to discuss and u can just broadly label everything as god works in mysterious ways<br><br><blockquote>demon-possessed, schizophrenia, are simply names or labels to that we give to a certain condition. it was demon-possessed since people didn't have what our modern medical science; it is now schizophrenia, yet we still can't pinpoint or know its exact causes. Alas, it doesn't matter what it is called, if jesus was indeed here, whatever it is, he can still heal it all the same. </blockquote>So u r saying the peopel r crazy because the demon possess them and not because of medical affliction ? I have to say tis but medically it is already established as a physical defect rather than a spiritiual one and cure has been found to curb the symptoms. Is the doctor's medicine attacking the demon possessing him or curing his physical ailments ?<br><br><blockquote>i don't recall if christianity promises happiness, much less being perfectly happy in heaven....none of these was stated in the bible. even though some may see it otherwise. </blockquote>I think earlier someone say tat in heaven all your pain sadness etc r removed away. If all pain and sadness is removed then my guess is u receive perfect happiness<br><br><blockquote>the evolutionary theory, in which the lines explains for itself, is only a theory, is not a truth. We can't prove the evolution has taken place, for one thing that the study and the field of science hasn't been around for a million years. 1 to 2 centuries of science, much less the age of evolutionary theory, hasn't stand long enough to have a million years archive to document evolution.<br><br>however, as in the case of evolution, there are many hints and cues which could point to its existence. </blockquote>Actually I have explained tis many times before. Even though evolution is a "theory", in scientific terms it is a scientific fact. It means scientifically, it is regarded as true and they really did find some species att were evolved (nylon digesting bacteria where nylon is man made)<br><br><blockquote>some slight misunderstanding here i presume. first of all, original sin is not about becoming sexual; for God made man and woman before they even ate the apple - God made human sexual before Adam even ate the apple. the original sin is more on this..<br><br>when satan tempted eve, which led to both eve and adam disobeying God by eating the apple from the tree which God had previously forbade them. by eating the apple, a sort of self-consciousness was borned - for both of them suddenly felt ashamed, covered themselves with leaves and hid from god. i presume by eating the apple, adam and eve, became pretty much of an 'individual' creature, than being 'communal/familial' which god could've wanted the humans to be. </blockquote>And so ? U mean having conscious is a sin ?<br><br><blockquote>as for lying...lying by itself isn't a sin. read the bible and that specific commandment carefully. god didn't say 'thou shall not lie', rather, it says 'thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor'. it is through lying, and bearing malice, and causing indirect harm to thy neighbor that is forbidden; not lying. </blockquote>Someone use it as an example before...<br><br><blockquote>about baptism... after all, you're right in saying that one could nevertheless ascend to heaven without being baptized. after all, baptism, or the process of being dunked is really an act came up by early christians to symbolize repentence. it's really just a symbol.<br><br>stupidissmart, r u RC? people don't know about the concept of limbo anymore. i heard limbo that is something that was came up by the clergy of the middle RC long way back. juz curious.</blockquote>Biblically speaking, no one can say for sure when babies, if they die, can reach heaven. There r verses tat support babies go to hell while verses tat stand babies can go to heaven. Tat is why they come out with the idea of baptising babies so even when they die they can go to heaven for sure (don't know why can ti be sure). Anyone I am not an RC person and the limbo do get mentioned religiously</div>
