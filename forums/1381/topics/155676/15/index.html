            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>36. According to the Gospels, from the Christian standpoint, Jesus was the most important person to ever live. From the Roman standpoint, Jesus was a huge pain in the ass because of his political activities. Explain why nothing was written about his life for over thirty years after his death, and nothing except the Gospels was written until the third century CE.<br><br>My theory is that they were too busy going around and telling people about him! You must remember, the Roman world was mostly word-of-mouth, not at all like today - internet, fax, teletext, cable TV news. The last book written, Revelation, was written in AD 95. Compared with other ancient writings about prominent figures, this is almost like a news flash! Take for example Alexander the Great. The first books written about him were done five hundred years after his death, but no historian says that they're falsified. Also, inside the New Testament there is proof that the gospels could not have been written later than thirty years after His resurrection.<br><br>The book of Acts, the second in a two-part work by Luke, ends with Paul being kept under house arrest in Rome. It does not go into his release, missionary journey into Spain, his re-arrest, and beheading. So, this means that Acts cannot have been written later then AD 62. Working back from this, and giving a year or two between the gospels, we see that Matthew and Luke were written about AD 60-61, and Mark (generally considered to be the oldest gospel) was written no later then AD 60, possibly even the late 50s. Plus, we can look at the 1 Corinthians 15 creed (a four line formula summarizing what the gospels teach), which was included in this letter that was written before the gospels, and see that it was made around the time Paul was converted (we can tell this b/c of the early terms such as "the Eleven" and the use of Peter's Aramaic name Cephas), within two to eight years of the resurrection of Christ! </blockquote>I don't think the answer to it is really believable... no one write much about his life, including the romans is probably hard to accept especially when u claim his disciples r actively going around to broadcast his story. In fact he probably create a big hoo haa at some villages and gathering on a mountain yet no one really record his deeds. In fact when he die there r supposed to have many undead walking around and broadcasting jesus name and people still don't bother to record his life ? It sounds incredible to me...<br><br>And alexander the great had many accounts from historians.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The ancient sources for Alexander's life are, from the perspective of ancient history, relatively numerous. Alexander himself left only a few inscriptions and some letter-fragments of dubious authenticity, but a large number of his contemporaries wrote full accounts. These included his court historian Callisthenes, his general Ptolemy, and a camp engineer Aristoboulus. Another early and influential account was penned by Cleitarchus. </span><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>37. Explain why you believe a person whose life is so poorly documented (see #36) was even ever born.<br><br>People, including the Roman authorities and the Jewish historian Josephus (keep in mind that both groups hated the Christians), acknowledged Jesus' birth and death. If they really wanted to put a blow in this cult, they would have said, "No, he was never born and you know it!" But they knew that many of the facts that the early church had could be supported. You could almost say that they were too honest.<br><br>Also if we were to take this question literally, i think 99.9% of the world population should never been born since no one is going to document our lives. </blockquote>There is really very evidences of jesus existence. The account of people mostly mention him as a person christians believe in and not they themselves as witnesses. And jesus is not tom dick or harry like 99.9% of the population. He made himself become godlike status and therefore we can expect him to be remembered. If u talk about slightly famous people, such as entertainers like 5566, they already got documented</div>

As He said, "It is not the healthy that see a doctor, but the sick."<br><br>I already explained the anti-Gentile and anti-women questions.<br><br>As He also said (loosely), "When John the Baptist came, and he did not eat or drink, you [the Pharisees] said, 'This man has a demon.' But when the Son of Man came, and He did eat and drink, you [again, the Pharisees] said, 'This man is a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners' [prostitutes; remember, He was anointed by Mary Magdalene, a known prostitute].";<br><br>The point here is that this question is not valid because i have already provided you with an answer to anti-Gentile, anti-women and pagan 'Christ'. Just like the Pharisees, you will flip-flop your respond just to justify your question. </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> he really have a pagan sexual rite after his death ?
