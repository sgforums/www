Explain.<br><br>At the Rapture, God will somehow merge the bodies and souls of all believers, first dead, then followed by the living, who have been saved from the day of Pentecost up through that time.  As far as I can tell, this same process will happen when He returns about seven years later to pick up the tribulation saints (those who were saved from the Rapture up through that point), and when He judges the unbelievers after the Millennial Kingdom.</div>

Explain why Christians (yes, that includes all branches of Christianity) have spread the lie that Jews put Jesus to death when, in actuality, it was the Romans who put Jesus to death. (For a good example of New Testament anti-Semitism, see 1 Thessalonians 2:15).<br><br>It was the Jewish leaders who ordered His arrest (and then backed it up with the Roman guard).  They were the ones who originally tried Him, and when Pilate wanted to know what the Jews wanted to do with Jesus, they (the Jews) were the ones who shouted "Crucify him!," even though Pilate (thus, the Roman liaison in the region) didn't want to.  Though the Roman guards were the ones who oversaw His crucifixion, the Jews were the ones that wanted it.<br><br>In another words, the Romans where just the "facilitator" while the Jews are the "advocators".</div>

Explain why your god created humans as imperfect, then set his standards so high that no one could possibly live up to them, then punishes us for not living up to his standards. Doesn't this also constitute "entrapment?"<br><br>He didn't create us imperfect.  He created us perfect, but then sin came and we became imperfect.  He also didn't set His standards "so high that no one could possibly live up to them."  If you are serious about your love for Him and your desire to seek Him, you will do all you can to please Him.  Christianity is not a bunch of rules, it's about a real desire to seek a real Person, God, and His love as exemplified through His Son Jesus Christ.<br><br>If you want to talk about the complexity and high standards to live up to, the Roman Catholics are good people to talk to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>79. Why would your god want to damn people by making them believe false things? (See 2 Thessalonians 2:11-12).<br><br>Once again, this is confusing in and of itself.  What I think it means, as it speaks of the end times, is that after the Rapture of the Church, "Christian" ministers that were left behind spoke of some unknown lie, so that the people would be able to live in sin.  If there was no lie, then all would have to realize that it was the Rapture of God's children, and that they are accountable to Him.<br><br>But because of sin, they don't want to believe that, so they made up a lie.  These "Christian" leaders definitely want to lie and say it wasn't the Rapture, because to admit that it was would be basically admitting that they were wrong and led lots of people astray.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>80. Should the book of Revelation be taken literally? Explain your answer.<br><br>I follow the Law of Literal Interpretation first set forth by Dr. David L. Cooper:  "If the plain sense of Scripture makes sense, seek no other sense."  I might personally add a corollary:  "If the plain sense of Scripture does not make sense, first seek other parts of Scripture for guidance.  If there is none, ask God in prayer for insight."</div>
