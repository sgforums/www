              <p>God didn't give us lust. but something far more special. God gives sexual desires and that is a good thing. lust doesn't come from God. lust and love are complete opposites.</p>
              <p>Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For
              everything in the world—the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his
              eyes and the boasting of what he has and does—comes not from the Father
              but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <em>1 John 2:15-17</em></p>
              <p>lust is all about self and loving the world, it corrupts our relationship with God.</p>
              <p>Whereas love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<em>1 Corinthians 13:4-7</em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">Lust is not kind, lust envies, lust behaves rudely, lust
              <strong>seeks all for its own</strong>, lust thinks evil, lust rejoices in sin, lust perverts the truth,
              lust bears nothing outside of its own pursuit of fulfillment. Lust does not believe God or
              His word, and <strong>hopes only in its own gratification.</strong> Lust <strong>cares only for itself.</strong> It will
              hurt, deceive, destroy, lie and anything else it has to do to sustain itself. </span></p>

              <p>i believe God created sex for a man and woman to enjoy. sex is a powerful gift, which brings a couple closer together - physically, emotionally, spiritually.</p>
              <p>i personally feel that the teaching that sex is only meant for procreation is made by man, not by God. shrugs.</p>

              <p>before you say that it's a blessing - you have to show me that God intended sex only as a mechanical tool for reproduction and not a dynamic powerful force intended to bring a couple closer together, only to be enjoyed by the couple who are as one sacred flesh in God's eyes.</p>
