              <p>Chin Eng i am simple. Im happy to be simple. Being simple in life gave me more happiness then you being complicated. At the end of the day to me sex is a form of lust. To lust after a women to have sex with her is normal for a human being male. All males are given the insticnt to be alpha males. So please, if you like to mock people your not fit to be a christian because to me your more like a hypocrite. You tarnish the name of the respectables.</p>

              IMO rather than have a chaste marriage it's better to live in celibacy.
                            
              <br><br>    
              What you are suggesting is unnatural and extreme. I'm not saying it's bad but if done would have been a personal decision of the family. Nobody should order them to do it! Or even suggest it!
              
              <br><br>
              Do you know why we like to eat especially good food?
              Because it is necessary for us to eat periodically. Had we not able to enjoy our meal I'm sure many of us would starve to death among food.
              <br><br>
              Had people not enjoy sex there would be too few children. Procreating is critical for the survival of any group of people.
