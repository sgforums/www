But we are masters of our actions! We have an intellect, and a deliberate will.

Consequently in those things which are altogether determinate to one there is no place for choice. Now the difference between the sensitive appetite and the will is that, as stated above (1, 2, ad 3), the sensitive appetite is determinate to one particular thing, according to the order of nature; whereas the will, although determinate to one thing in general, viz. the good, according to the order of nature, is nevertheless indeterminate in respect of particular goods. Consequently choice belongs properly to the will, and not to the sensitive appetite which is all that irrational animals have.

Animals kill each other, but then again god have asked men to fight wars against each other as well. So it is not against the will of god either.<br><br><blockquote>According to St. Thomas Aquinas, "acts of a Human" are instinctual, not free, no better than an irrational animal. But we are masters of our actions! We have an intellect, and a deliberate will. So Human actions have to be known by the intellect (Know what you are doing), and they have to be willed deliberately (chosen freely)...This is what St. Thomas Aquinas says about the choice of irrational animals: </blockquote>In short, they do not eat the fruit of wisdom and they r very much the same form as wat god want them to be, much like wat he expect adam used to be before eating the fruit of wisdom. They r perfect in the eyes of the lord. Tat is why I say animals r "natural". They have weak intellectual, do not have motives, they literally do not sin. However they r designed to be able to masturbate. God in one way or another made them as such and therefore we can see he has little problem with tis. If u talk about science and human have intellectual etc, then men invent religion to prohibit action tat meant nothing and cause no harm, such as masturbation.

Playing computer games is all right because it does not involve the sexual faculty. Masturbation is wrong because the use of sexual faculty is only restricted to a husband and his wife. Anything outside is wrong! Yes, sex is for pleasure, to promote love, to distress, and most importantly to procreate. Only validly married couples may gain the gift of sex.

So it is not against the will of god either.</blockquote>Sexual intercourse is obviously designed towards procreation. Onan explicitly went against God's plan for sex and marriage by spilling his seed on the ground. Christopher West says, love is free, total, faithful and fruitful. When all these things are present it correctly images God and we love according to God's design. However, when someone masturbates, it goes against the way God that loves. Love is a total gift of self. In masturbation there is no gift of self, only selfishness. It is not an act of gift to another person and demands no faithfulness or commitment to another person. It cannot be fruitful because it is wasted. There has to be the openness to fruitfulness and life for the love to image God.<br><br>In birth control, there is no total love because one is holding something of him/herself back from the other person. It cannot be fruitful either. It intentionally sterilises the act. And because of this, it cannot image the love of God. It is wrong to hold back what God wants!<br><br>So you are saying that animals kill each other, and God has asked men to fight wars against each other and therefore, it is ok for us to kill each other.<br><br>No! This logic is completely incorrect! When it comes to morality, there is really no comparison between animals and humans. Nothing an animal does can be considered "right" or "wrong." since only our actions can be categorised.

They can masturbate all day long if they want. However, we do have these abilities, and we know that God has created a higher purpose for our sexual faculties. As such, we should not defy this purpose through masturbation. Whether animals do it or not is irrelevant.<br><br>Since you are not convinced by Divine Law, I will show you some sense with Natural Law. Things are disordered when they goes against the second definition of Â‘naturalÂ’. There are two senses of the word "natural". The first is "that which occurs in nature". The more narrow definition is "that which is as it should be." When we say that certain behaviour is "only natural" we usually mean the second. Cancer is natural under the first condition, but not the second. All disease is natural under the first condition but not the second. Would you say that since malaria is natural, we shouldn't try to prevent it? Human beings are in some ways above nature because we have choice, we can, to a certain extent, go against nature. Is it natural for objects to go up? No, but we still fly planes and fire rockets. Coca Cola is not natural but mercury is (under the first definition). But drinking Coke is natural and drinking mercury is not (under the second definition). It is important not to mix up the two definitions!<br><br></div>

I told u my opinion many times and u just refuse to read them nor answer to it. The only thing u do is just keep cuttign and paste the same old thing.

Furthermore, from the earlier discussion,<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Leviticus 15: 'When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body with water, and he will be unclean till evening. 17 Any clothing or leather that has semen on it must be washed with water, and it will be unclean till evening. 18 When a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen, both must bathe with water, and they will be unclean till evening </span></strong><br><br>If u read, then u will find out tat people who have sex, including with your wife, u r unclean as well. If u have your period, u r unclean as well. In fact, if u touch a woman having her period or sit on the seat she sat like MRT seat or bus seat, then u r unclean as well. If u say masturbation is a sin then all these acts r sins as well. SO is having sex with your wife a sin ? Is a woman having period a sin ? IS touching a woman who has period unknowingly a sin ? If they r sin, then I can say tat god is an unreasonable bigot who design woman to have period but blame them for it. If they aren't sin, why do u consider only masturbation a sin ? And they never say it is a sin, they just say it is unclean. They can erase these uncleaniness easily while u can not erase sin. Can u erase sin by killing a cow or something ?<br><br><blockquote>How can you compare computer games with sex? You donÂ’t use computer games to procreate do you? Their purpose is totally different.

Then I ask u why is it wrong ? Playing games is also selfish and ly give u pleasure too isn't it ? And why do u restrict masturbation to be between men and wife ? R u god ? How can u make tat statement as though u r the one giving us sex ? Why make it into something so holy when it wasn't meant to be ? Sex is a gift, then why don't u use it ?
