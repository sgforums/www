They only look at the problems u caused to society and don't look at the contribution u have done ? In tat case isn't it better not to do any good thing and just focus on not doing bad things ? Wat is the point of performing good deeds ? at least in other religion, they will judge from the overall picture and see if u do an overall good deed or bad deed, and not just punish for the bad thigns u do without looking at any good things u have done.

Why don't they throw in a few virgins to be sacrifice to him as well ? There is no grace to humankind. He set up an unfair system where all men will definitely sin, sacrifice his son to please himself so he can be capable of forgiving. If there is real grace, he just forgive people. He don't need sacrifices to forgive people. Is tat any fair to the sacrifice ?<br><br>1. God created hell<br><br>2. Hell is created for satan and his demons as a place of eternal damnation.<br><br>3. Hell is not for humans. God created Man and loves them deeply. Tat is wat they tell u. However men do go to hell. God love to use cruelty to punish people or anythign tat do not please him.<br><br>4. Man dun simply fall into hell. They have to deliberately choose to enter it. By choosing, it meant choosing from the many different religion around the world and not giving them any evidence or reason to believe in christainity. It is not choosing, it is guessing<br><br>5. Sin is the key to enter hell because sin is rebellion against God and as such put Man together with the cohort of satan and demons. Simple things such as being given birth is sin though. Silly things such as keeping god in your mind is necessary to be sinless. Since we can't choose to be given birth, we r defaulted to be sent to hell<br><br>6. Also, sinful men and a holy God cannot co-exists. God is in heaven so sinners have to go to hell. However people who murders or kill or perform all sort of evil can go to heaven because those who believes get to be saved and become free of sins.

BTW have I told u wat is the sin system he employed to ensure u always sin ?<br><br>8. That atoning sacrifice is His only Son Jesus Christ.

U don't know why he do the things he did and a lot of things etc. U know he did a lot of cruel things like massacaring the whole tribes of people. U know he kill his own son. U know he never show mercy to anyone he felt was against him. Then why do u think he was merciful ?<br><br><blockquote>True, you don't go to heaven automatically. You can choose to go, or not to go. If you don't go to heaven, then there's only hell. </blockquote>But choosing to to go christian hell meant u go to the hell in muslim scipture. It also meant u have defied the god from the jew as well since the teacings were totally different from christainity. In fact u have occur the wrath of many other religions when u choose christainity's heaven. So choosing to heaven = to choosing to hell for the other religion. U r not choosing, u r guessing. And u get the worst punishment for guessing wrongly<br><br></div>
