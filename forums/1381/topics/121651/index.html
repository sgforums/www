Hell, not all Christians will go to heaven. I dare to say you will not go to hell, because you do not seem to have the slightest inkling of what Christianity actually is. You cannot reject something that you do not know about.<br><br>Tell me, have you ever gone into a church before? Or has the dentist made you so traumatised of us Christians? I tell you, that dentist cannot be the real face of Christianity, so do not be misled.<br><br>Yes, of course we'll pray for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Drop by here more often.<br><br></div>
