              Are Fundamentals faithless?
              
              In my time here I have noted that Fundamentals do not believe the Word that they hold so dear. They do not believe in the perfection of God or His works. They see a God who began this way and then give themselves a power greater than God by saying that man can easily destroy this perfection. None wake in the morning to Godâ€™s everlasting perfect universe. They believe instead that Godâ€™s perfect world  and Himself have back slid into a state of imperfection and must return to cleanse it with retribution and thus return it to itâ€˜s former glory. This show an intrinsic lack of faith for they do not recognize the perfection that I do.
              
              They read Genesis and show a God that fails right from the beginning of mans perfect creation. They see the first humans as corrupt and flawed instead of the perfect archetypal humans. They see a fall for them instead of the truth of their glorious leap into a history that, without the knowledge of good and evil, would be totally without meaning. They would prefer that Eve, the perfect mother of all of us, to be thought a fool when in reality it is they that do not see her clear perfection. 
              
              Logic dictates that if the beginning were flawed, an impossibility for God, then He would have killed Adam and Eve at that point in time and restarted. There is no way that an all seeing God would have waited till later to drown millions in a genocidal flood.
              
              God is not so stupid as to become the epitome of a genocidal maniac who must restart the earth. God has no need to restart one or any of His perfect works. They are everlasting.
              
              Our Genesis was and continues to be perfect for all who are born into it. To say less shows a lack of faith in God and Fundamentals say that it is less, therefore they have no faith. They quote the Bible constantly yet have no understanding of it because they have a failed perfection in mind as they read. The Bible and Jesus have tried to show the perfection of God and His works but no Fundamental has yet to give all that he owns and follow Jesus. They are trapped in their political worldly nature and will not or cannot listen to their spiritual nature. I believe that God creates all of our natures and souls perfect as scripture says He does. Fundamentals do not or make man so powerful that we all destroy Godâ€™s perfection without hardly any effort.
                  
              Fundamentals all claim to be reborn and follow Jesus yet none will do what has  to be done to do so. They prefer to call all others fools and demonize those who try to set them on the right path to understanding.
              
              Fundamentals profess to belong the one true God and Church yet follow a Church that rejected the gospel of  Peter, the designated founder of the Church. How strange. Perhaps that is why they do not mind hurting the Church by turning their Bible into a book of fairy tales by reading it literally and having Christianity become the laughing stock of the world. No wonder then that the world turns to Secularism for better laws. Religionists have let them down with foolish Fundamentalist notions. 
              
              Question for debate.
              Do Fundamentals need to be reborn to the one true God or do they already follow the true God but on a failed world in a failed universe created by a God who can somehow create what can go to imperfection.

              <p>Give me an example of Christian fundamentals because I don't know any. All I know is good Christians and bad Christians.</p>
              <p>I advise you being careful before labelling some group of Christian as being fundamentalist just because they view this world differently from you. Because in making such judgment you are being one. Who are you or we to judge who is more righteous in the eyes of God? Who are we to judge which one of us is more correct than the others in the eys of God. We can't because we don't have perfect knowledge. Hence our judgement is flawed and could be wrong altogether.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I could think IRA but they are political whose members' religion happen to be Catholic. Of course violence cannot to be condoned.</p>

              <p>First there is only ONE God. One for the entire human race. One for the entire animal kingdom. One for the entire spirit realm. One for the whole universe. One.</p>
              <p>The One who [is able to] shakes the pillars of this world,  who knows what is inside everyone's hearts, who knows the end before the beginning even began, who sees what is hidden in the dark by men, who changes the light of day of men into night and who gives rest to those who have departed into it. The One who raises His chosen ones to life and power, eternal. The One whose face shines BEYOND EVERYTHING. Who gives overwhelming peace to those that He favors and who takes it back. The one whose presence sounded like SUCH A MIGHTY wind [just like in pantecost]. The one who hears prayers and answers them. The One who is holy. The One who defeats all. The One whose plans never fail [and make them in such a detail]. The One who is inside everybody. The One who never leave His own people to walk alone. The One who is within, surround and around us ALL. The One who never leave and forget us EVEN when we've rested in the world of the dead and no longer remember Him. The One who reveals secrets.</p>
              <p>Is there such a spirit like God? NO.</p>
              <p>Be it that you are Jew, Moslem, Christian, Buddhist, Hindus, or atheist or even satan worshipper. There is only one God. One. One the same God for ALL.</p>
              <p>Some people worship other entity other than God and call it their God but it's not God. It's spirits other than God. Not everyone knows the true God. But if you were to make a contest between other spirits and the true God the difference would be obvious. If one could make such a contest. But this is most unlikely so the best bet is to make yuor life a living testimony of the God whom you worship.</p>

              <p>Do you think harming one own kids is God's teachings? Why waste
              time on cults and wrong teachings? God gave us the gifts of wisdom

              <p>First there is only ONE God. One for the entire human race. One for the entire animal kingdom. One for the entire spirit realm. One for the whole universe. One.</p>
              <p>The One who [is able to] shakes the pillars of this world,  who knows what is inside everyone's hearts, who knows the end before the beginning even began, who sees what is hidden in the dark by men, who changes the light of day of men into night and who gives rest to those who have departed into it. The One who raises His chosen ones to life and power, eternal. The One whose face shines BEYOND EVERYTHING. Who gives overwhelming peace to those that He favors and who takes it back. The one whose presence sounded like SUCH A MIGHTY wind [just like in pantecost]. The one who hears prayers and answers them. The One who is holy. The One who defeats all. The One whose plans never fail [and make them in such a detail]. The One who is inside everybody. The One who never leave His own people to walk alone. The One who is within, surround and around us ALL. The One who never leave and forget us EVEN when we've rested in the world of the dead and no longer remember Him. The One who reveals secrets.</p>

              <p>Be it that you are Jew, Moslem, Christian, Buddhist, Hindus, or atheist or even satan worshipper. There is only one God. One. One the same God for ALL.</p>
              <p>Some people worship other entity other than God and call it their God but it's not God. It's spirits other than God. Not everyone knows the true God. But if you were to make a contest between other spirits and the true God the difference would be obvious. If one could make such a contest. But this is most unlikely so the best bet is to make yuor life a living testimony of the God whom you worship.</p>

              <p>Loving your neighbour is just that - loving them without conditions. Conversion is not the reason to love. If you love with your heart, they will know and they will be moved because you showed that it was your true following of God's teachings. I know that this is easier said than done but it can be done with lots of prayers and God's guidiance.</p>
              <p>Spreading gospel is done by showing love as God has taught us
              to do. Love is about giving - not receiving. Jesus said, He
              is here
              to serve and not to be served. He also called on His disciples to do
              the same – to serve.</p>
              <p>Good example are homes and hospice where old, sick and dying are abandon by families. They are cared for regardless of faith and status and being shown that there is love and hope. These can only come about cause God loves them and send help to reach out to them times when they needed it most.</p>
              <p>Each one of us has a role to play in God's plan and each has his own free will to make a choice. At the end, we are all answerable ourself to God and to God alone.</p>

              <p>No matter what, all creation by God will face His judgement isn't it? Or if one worship "another God" will face judgement from "another God"? Even within Christianity, there are so many denominations and now, people who claimed no denominations etc.. People who claimed that God spoke to them thru the bible and preach etc... People who read the bible and think it means like and that etc...Are they all worshipping the same God? One God but so many variations of teachings? Worst comdenming each other?</p>
              <p>Then if we look at any other faith and try to understand what they are preaching, you will see similiarities and an important fact is many of the other faith do teaches love your neighbour (which Jesus said is one of the 2 commandments we need to follow which will bring us eternal life - again Mt 25 last judgement).</p>
              <p>But it is not just teachings but actual feat of doing what is being preached. And all good things come from God (even when it comes from another faith other than Christianity) and God alone.</p>
              <p>If a Christian has no love for his neighbour while one from another faith does, who should God grant eternal life to? I believed that God is loving, compassionate, just, forgiving and great as the scriptures has told us so and He will be so to ALL his creations - Christians or not.</p>
              <p>Who are we to judge who goes where (Heaven or Hell) as our Lord is the only one qualified and tasked by our Father to judge - so we leave it to him.</p>
              <p>Not being a Christrians does not mean bad ending (any bible verse to prove that?).....we have to share the Gospels and every one has the free will to choose. As long we show love to all (I mean all regardless of faith) and treat all as equal (as Jesus always does), then I think we are ok. If others around us can see that as Christians, we have no divide and bias on others, then people are more inclined to hear us out and find out why God is so good as the goodness comes from God thru our deeds.</p>
