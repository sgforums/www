              <p>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10203728/Satanic-cult-blamed-for-killing-of-Dartmoor-pony-in-full-moon-ritual.html</p>
              <h2>A Satanic cult has been blamed for the horrific death of a pony which was 
                mutilated in a ring of fire during a full moon.</h2>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p>Police are investigating after the two-month old male was found surrounded by 
                circular patches of burnt moorland, with traces of white paint on one of its 
                legs.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Experts believe this suggests it was killed as part of a bizarre ceremony, 
                after a spate of animal sacrifices by gangs of satanic worshippers on 
                Dartmoor.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>The male was found with its tongue and eyes cut out, and its genitals and 
                right ear sliced off at Yennadon Down, a remote, bushy area of the Devon 
                National Park.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Karla McKechnie, Dartmoor’s Livestock Protection Officer, said she feared 
                “witches or devil worshippers” were behind the slaughter.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>"We do get strange things happening from time to time, normally when it’s a 
                full moon”, Ms McKechnie said.</p>
              <p>"I've come across strange circles in the ground, boulders used as altars, that 
                sort of thing, but thankfully animal mutilations are rare.</p>
              <p>"I suspect its witches or devil worshippers but it's always hard to get to the 
                bottom of it.</p>
              <p>"My main concern is how someone has been able to walk up to a foal and kill it 
                in the middle of the night. I'm almost certain more than one person was 
                involved."</p>
              <p>Jenny Thornton, of the South West Equine Protection, said Dartmoor ponies have 
                become easy targets because they are used to being fed by humans.</p>
              <p>Ms Thornton said: "I've seen plenty of dead animals but this was horrendous. 
                The belly has been sliced open. It's a boy and its genitals had been cut 
                off.</p>
              <p>"The tongue had been pulled out and his eyes are missing. There have always 
                been rumours of animal sacrifices and sheep have been found dead in the 
                past, often around the time of a full moon.</p>
              <p>"All we can be absolutely certain of is that someone has caused unnecessary 
                suffering to an animal, possibly severe suffering if it was still alive at 
                the time."</p>
              <p>Last year a two-year-old horse belonging to Dawn Jewell, 27 was found 
                mutilated on the day of satanic animal sacrifice.</p>
              <p>Eric was found dead in his field near Stithians close to Falmouth, Cornwall, 
                with his right eye gouged out, his teeth removed and his genitals hacked off 
                after a full moon.</p>
              <p>As police hunted those responsible, Inspector Chris Strickland said there was 
                "a strong possibility" that Eric was the victim of a satanic ritual.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the time, he said: "There are people out there with these beliefs. 
                It's one line we will pursue."</p>
              <p>In 2006 around 100 sheep animals were found slaughtered with their tongues, 
                eyes and sexual organs removed on Dartmoor.</p>
              <p>And in June of this year police appealed for information after two horses were 
                found with "gaping" knife wounds in neighbouring fields in the village of 
                Stokeinteignhead, Devon.</p>

              <p>What has TCM got to do with satanic worship????</p>
              <p>is TCM a religion?? it is obvious you don't know anything about TCM, or religion.</p>
              <p>Please check it out first become become you come out with such false accusation, it doesn't reflect well on Christianity.</p>
              <p>By the way, TCM often cost more than the medicine from polyclinics.</p>

              <p>You read religious books to understand medicine?? are the writers doctors? When you go see a chinese TCM practisioner, does he ask you if you are morally upright or sinful??</p>
              <p>go ask a western doctor what is TCM, or simply check the net, even wikepedia can give you an idea what is TCM. Stop reading rubbish from religious fanatics, they bring people closer to hell, if you are not careful, you fall in, it is not their problem.</p>
