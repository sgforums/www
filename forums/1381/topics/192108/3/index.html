            <div class='col-md body'>I think this is a very interesting topic to discuss. I do believe in the ministry of exorcism which is also the ministry of delivarance. (Depend on your individual church).<br><br>When you look at the bible, there are records of delivarance which happened throught the ministry of Jesus as well as the apostles. When you look at the Christian faith that we are carrying, the main thing is to believe what the Lord has done as well as the works of the saints. Jesus did cast out demons from humans and the apostle did cast out demons too by the authority of God.<br><br>The reason why delivarance looks so strange to us or unknown to us is because of the distortion from the media as well as a topic that is least talked of in the church. Jesu did cast out demons, but it is not for the sake of his popularity but for the fact that he loves people and doesn't want to see human suffering.<br><br>When you apply that into our time, it is still the same. The pastor/priest that is involved in delivarance also loves people. For myself personally, I did witness various delivarance instances. It is not something of the natural. People starts to lose control of themselves physically and mentally. It is not something that we can take for lightly because life is at stake.</div>
