              <h1>What Wesley Practiced and Preached About Money</h1>
              <p><em>by Charles Edward White</em></p>
              <p>Most
              of us know that John Wesley was used of God to revive 18th- century
              England and to start the Methodist Church. We know him as a great
              preacher and a greater organizer. But few of us realize that Wesley
              made enormous sums from preaching - the sale of his writings made him
              one of England's wealthiest men. In an age when a single man could live
              comfortably on 30 pounds a year, his annual income reached 1,400. With
              such an income he had the opportunities to put his ideas on money into
              practice. What did he say about money? And what did he do with his own?</p>
              <p>John Wesley knew grinding poverty as a child. His father,
              Samuel Wesley, was the Anglican priest in one of England's
              lowest-paying parishes. He had nine children to support and was rarely
              out of debt. Once John saw his father being marched off to debtor's
              prison. So when John followed his father into the ministry, he had no
              illusions about financial rewards.</p>
              <p>It probably came as a
              surprise to John Wesley that while God had called him to follow his
              father's vocation, he had not also called him to be poor like his
              father. Instead of becoming a parish priest, John felt God's direction
              to teach at Oxford University. There he was elected a fellow of Lincoln
              College, and his financial status changed dramatically. His position
              usually paid him at least thirty pounds a year, more than enough money
              for a single man to live on. John seems to have enjoyed his relative
              prosperity. He spent his money on playing cards, tobacco and brandy.</p>
              <p>While
              at Oxford, an incident changed his perspective on money. He had just
              finished paying for some pictures for his room when one of the
              chambermaids came to his door. It was a cold winter day, and he noticed
              that she had nothing to protect her except a thin linen gown. He
              reached into his pocket to give her some money to buy a coat but found
              he had too little left. Immediately the thought struck him that the
              Lord was not pleased with the way he had spent his money. He asked
              himself, Will thy Master say, "Well done, good and faithful steward"?
              Thou hast adorned thy walls with the money which might have screened
              this poor creature from the cold! O justice! O mercy! - Are not these
              pictures the blood of this poor maid?</p>
              <p>Perhaps as a result of
              this incident, in 1731 Wesley began to limit his expenses so that he
              would have more money to give to the poor. He records that one year his
              income was 30 pounds and his living expenses 28 pounds, so he had 2
              pounds to give away. The next year his income doubled, but he still
              managed to live on 28 pounds, so he had 32 pounds to give to the poor.
              In the third year, his income jumped to 90 pounds.</p>
              <p>Instead of
              letting his expenses rise with his income, he kept them to 28 pounds
              and gave away 62 pounds. In the fourth year, he received 120 pounds. As
              before, his expenses were 28 pounds, so his giving rose to 92 pounds.</p>
              <p>Wesley
              felt that the Christian should not merely tithe but give away all extra
              income once the family and creditors were taken care of. He believed
              that with increasing income, what should rise is not the Christian's
              standard of living but the standard of giving.</p>
              <p>This practice,
              begun at Oxford, continued throughout his life. Even when his income
              rose into the thousands of pounds sterling, he lived simply, and he
              quickly gave away his surplus money.</p>
              <p>One year his income was a
              little over 1400 pounds. He lived on 30 pounds and gave away nearly
              1400 pounds. Because he had no family to care for, he had no need for
              savings. He was afraid of laying up treasures on earth, so the money
              went out in charity as quickly as it came in. He reports that he never
              had 100 pounds at any one time.</p>
              <p>Wesley limited his expenditures
              by not purchasing the kinds of things thought essential for a man in
              his station of life. In 1776 the English tax commissioners inspected
              his return and wrote him the following: "[We] cannot doubt but you have
              plate for which you have hitherto neglected to make an entry."</p>
              <p>They
              were saying a man of his prominence certainly must have some silver
              plate in his house and were accusing him of failing to pay excise tax
              on it. Wesley wrote back: "I have two silver spoons at London and two
              at Bristol. This is all the plate I have at present, and I shall not
              buy any more while so many round me want bread."</p>
              <p>John Wesley's    teaching on money offered simple, practical guidelines for every believer.</p>
              <p>His first rule    about money was <strong><em>Gain all you can</em></strong>.
              Despite its potential for misuse, money in itself is something good.
              There is no end to the good it can do: "In the hands of (God's)
              children, it is food for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, raiment for
              the naked. It gives to the traveler and the stranger where to lay his
              head. By it we may supply the place of a husband to the widow, and of a
              father to the fatherless. We may be a defense for the oppressed, a
              means of health to the sick, of ease to them that are in pain. It may
              be as eyes to the blind, as feet to the lame: yea, a lifter up from the
              gates of death!"</p>
              <p>Wesley added that in gaining all they can,
              Christians must be careful not to damage their own souls, minds, or
              bodies, or the souls, minds or bodies of anyone else. He thus
              prohibited gaining money through industries that pollute the
              environment or endanger workers.</p>
              <p>Wesley's second    rule for the right use of money was <strong><em>Save all you can</em></strong>.
              He urged his hearers not to spend money merely to gratify the desires
              of the flesh, the desires of the eye, or the pride of life. He cried
              out against expensive food, fancy clothes, and elegant furniture:
              "Despise delicacy and variety and be content with what plain nature
              requires."</p>
              <p>Wesley had two reasons for telling Christians to buy
              only necessities. The obvious one was so they would not waste money.
              The second was so they would not increase their desires.</p>
              <p>The old
              preacher wisely pointed out that when people spend money on things they
              do not really need, they begin to want more things they do not need.
              Instead of satisfying their desires, they only increase them.</p>
              <p>Wesley's third    rule was <em><strong>Give all you can</strong></em>.
              One's giving should begin with the tithe. He told the one who does not
              tithe, "Thou dost undoubtedly set thy heart upon thy gold" and warned,
              "It will 'eat thy flesh as fire!'"</p>
              <p>But one's giving should not
              end at the tithe. All of the Christian's money belongs to God, not just
              the first tenth. Believers must use 100 percent of their income as God
              directs.</p>
              <p>And how has God    directed Christians to use their incomes? Wesley listed <strong>four scriptural principles</strong>:</p>
              <p>1.
              Provide things needful for yourself and your family (I Tim. 5:8). The
              believer should make sure the family has "a sufficiency of plain,
              wholesome food to eat, and clean raiment to put on" as well as a place
              to live and enough to live on if something were to happen to the
              breadwinner.</p>
              <p>2. "Having food and raiment, let us be therewith
              content" (I Tim. 6:8) . "Whoever has sufficient food to eat, and
              raiment to put on, with a place to lay his head, and something over, is
              rich," he said.</p>
              <p>3. "Provide things honest in the sight of all
              men" (Rom. 12:17) and "Owe no man anything" (Rom. 13:8). Wesley said
              the next claim on a Christian's money is the creditors'. He adds that
              those who are in business for themselves need to have adequate tools,
              stock, or capital for the carrying on of that business.</p>
              <p>4. "As
              we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially
              unto them who are of the household of faith" (Gal. 6:10). After the
              Christian has provided for the family, the creditors, and the business,
              the next obligation is to use any money that is left to meet the needs
              of others.</p>
              <p>In giving these    four biblical principles, Wesley recognized some situations were not clear-cut.    He accordingly offered <strong>four questions to help his hearers decide</strong> how    to spend money:</p>
              <p>1. In spending    this money, am I acting like I own it, or am I acting like the Lord's trustee?</p>
              <p>2. What Scripture    requires me to spend this money this way?</p>
              <p>3. Can I offer    up this purchase as a sacrifice to the Lord?</p>
              <p>4.
              Will God reward me for this expenditure at the resurrection of the
              just? In 1744 Wesley wrote, "When I die if I leave behind me ten pounds
              . . . you and all mankind can bear witness against me, that I have
              lived and died a thief and a robber." When he died in 1791, the only
              money mentioned in his will was the miscellaneous coins to be found in
              his pockets and dresser drawers. Most of the 30,000 pounds he had
              earned in his lifetime he had given away. As Wesley said, "I cannot
              help leaving my books behind me whenever God calls me hence; but in
              every other respect, my own hands will be my executors."</p>
