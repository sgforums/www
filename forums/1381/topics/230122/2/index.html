God transferred his authority to his church so i think it can withold forgiveness if necessary until penance through binding and loosing.<br><br>No one contesting abt dampening the Blood of Christ.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Source - wikipedia<br>"Penance" also refers to acts that a believer imposes on him or herself outside of the sacramental context. Penitential activity is particularly common during the season of Lent and Holy Week (mainly the Passion week, inspired by Christ's suffering;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> hence in some cultural traditions still including flagellantism or even voluntary crucifixion</span></strong>) and, to a lesser extent, Advent, when penance is often combined with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">acts of self-discipline, such as fasting, voluntary celibacy, or other privations.</span></strong> In the Roman Catholic tradition especially, such acts of self-injury are sometimes called mortification of the flesh because of the belief that an unrestrained corporeal body endangers salvation, unless controlled by the spirit, serving to detach the penitent of his worldly passions, as to draw him into closer union with God.</blockquote>Penance was originally meant to be something good.  i.e apologising to the injured party and compensating him or her for the hurt caused.  In the case where no one was harmed, penance was meant for the person seeking forgiveness to do good deeds like charitable work to atone for his sins.<br><br>I strongly condemn penance with the intention of hurting oneself.  This is morally wrong as the body is the temple of God, and additionaly it serves no real purpose other than self-edification.  Instead of taking a negative view and inflicting (self) punishment isn't it better to do good and help others that they may praise God too?</div>

However sufferings bring u closer to good thats why u fast etc etc. If done with a good intention, so be it. Many Church Fathers castrated themselves etc etc.<br><br>Penance is more like<br>a) a price to pay for your sins - removing temproal punishments<br>b) a neccessary means to reconcile with God to attain forgivness.<br><br>I feel (a) is Catholic doctrine and (b) is my own thought haha.</div>
