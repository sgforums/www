            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about hell, I came across this article in a website Tomorrow's World<br><br><a href="http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw/tw-mag.cgi?category=Magazine1&amp;item=1103817219" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw/tw-mag.cgi?category=Magazine1&amp;item=1103817219</a><br><br>Here is part of what it says about the fate of the wicked...<br><br><strong>The Fate of the Wicked</strong><br>You have heard the gospel of the Kingdom preached on the TomorrowÂ’s World telecast, and in the pages of this magazine. That gospel is the good news of Christ coming back to rule this earth as King of kings and Lord of lords! But did Jesus Himself also speak about a fiery judgment? Yes, He did!<br><br>When Christ returns, He will bring both rewards and condemnations. He will reward His faithful servants. As the Bible describes it, "Then the King will say to those on His right hand, Â‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the worldÂ’" (Matthew 25:34).<br><br>But there is also punishment for those who have sealed their character as wicked and evil rebels against the way of God, the law of God and the love of God. As the Bible tells us, after rewarding His faithful servants, "Then He will also say to those on the left hand, Â‘Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angelsÂ’" (Matthew 25:41).<br><br>What happens to these cursed individuals? Do they remain alive for all eternity? Or are they burned up? Here is what the Bible says will happen to the incorrigibly wickedÂ—those who have sealed their minds to never repent and never obey God: "Â‘For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, and all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.<br><br>And the day which is coming shall burn them up,Â’ says the Lord of hosts, Â‘That will leave them neither root nor branchÂ’" (Malachi 4:1).<br><br>The wicked will be totally destroyed. They will receive the eternal death penalty. Malachi continues with the description, "Â‘You shall trample the wicked, For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this,Â’ says the Lord of hosts" (Malachi 4:3).<br><br>Those who have sealed their own fate, those who have determined never to repent of their evil attitude and nature, will be totally burned up and will become ashes! They will not be tormented forever. They will be totally annihilated!<br><br>Many people have wondered why, if God is such a just God, He condemns people to suffer for all eternity when they have never had a real chance to hear, believe or act upon the gospel. The answer is simple: He does not do that! God is just and fair.<br><br>It is Satan and his angels who will be tormented forever. Satan wants us to believe that his fate, as a spirit being, will be the fate of humans! Satan "deceives the whole world" (Revelation 12:9). Contrary to SatanÂ’s propaganda, God will not allow humans to suffer forever!<br><br>Notice JesusÂ’ amazing statement, "And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:28 ).<br><br>Read this scripture in your own Bible! God is able to destroy both soul and body. Yes, God is so powerful that He can destroy souls forever! This means that life, psuchÃ© in the Greek, will be totally destroyed. There is no resurrection from the death that Jesus is speaking about! We will see this more clearly when we look at the book of Revelation later in this article.<br><br>We have seen that there is a widespread religious belief in the eternal punishing of wicked souls. Various religions believe that an ever-burning hell fire will torment evil humans forever. But we also saw that God is able to destroy the souls of humans. He will put the incorrigibly wicked out of their misery forever! God is fair and just!<br></div>
