            <div class='col-md body'>I know that this post will be elementary to those who are mature Christians here. But for the sake of evangelism, for those who do not know what the Gospel is, this post is written. May God use it for the salvation of souls.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>What is the Gospel?</strong><br><br>There are questions we canÂ’t afford to have the wrong answers to. Questions that our eternities hang on and depend. And one such question is the one above: Â“What is the gospel?Â”<br>For sure, you have heard this word gazillion of times already but what is it? Do you know? First, before going into the answer, let me catalog for you what the gospel is not:<br><br><strong>    The Gospel isÂ…Â…Â….</strong><br><br><strong>Â…Â…not the 10 commandments</strong> [these only show you that you need the Gospel. it is not the Gospel]<br><br><strong>Â…Â….not the whole Bible</strong> [The OT prophecied about the Gospel. It is not the Gospel. The NT is the fulfillment of the Gospel{Matthew to John}. The book of  ACTS show us the gospelization of the apostles. The Books from Romans to Revelation show us the implication of the Gospel with regards to our moral lives. The NT is not the Gospel. It contains the Gospel]<br><br><strong>Â…Â….not the whole New Testament</strong><br><br><strong>Â…Â….not All the commandments in the New Testament</strong> [these NT commands were given to those who have already recieved the Gospel. They are not the Gospel]<br><br><strong>Â…Â…..not Prayer </strong>[This is what those who have recieved the Gospel should be doing after they have recieved it. This is not the Gospel]<br><br><strong>Â…Â…..not Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. </strong>[these individual books of the Bible are not the Gospel, they contain the Gospel]<br><br>so what's the Gospel?<br><br>The Gospel, dear reader, is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself and what He did on the cross of Calvary for you and me. The Gospel is the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ for the sins of sinners. Anytime you hear these words:<br><br>Â“<strong>The Lord Jesus Christ died for the sins of sinners, buried and resurrected for us."</strong><br><br>everytime you hear those words my friend you hear the  Gospel, the Good News of salvation. YouÂ’ve heard that millions of times already right? You know what the Bible says about the Gospel? You know whatÂ’s the divine commentary of the Bible about the Gospel?<br><br>Here read it for yourself:<br><br>Â“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.Â”<br><br>Â“For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by faith." [Romans 1:16-17]<br><br>The Gospel speaks about ChristÂ’s humiliation for our exaltation. From the vantage point of the world, ChristÂ’s hanging there on the cross seemed a failure, a picture of defeat. The world laughs and scorns: Â“whatÂ’s there in a man nailed to the cross? How can that be good news for meÂ…Â…this is plain foolishness.Â”<br><br>But Paul was not ashamed to proclaim such a message. Why? Because Â“it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes.Â” The Gospel is the life-boat in a sea where every ship is sinking. The Gospel is the only strong and formidable tower of salvation that men and women can take refuge. The Gospel is the Rock of Gibraltar that stands mighty and indomitable in the midst of shaking foundations. When the smoke clears, only the truth of the Gospel will be seen standing firm unscathed.<br><br>Â“It is the power of God to salvationÂ” it cannot sink; God is its buoy. It cannot crumble; God is its architect and builder. It cannot fall; God is its foundation. It is trustworthy; its GodÂ’s saving truth.<br><br><strong>Practical Application:</strong><br><br>What are you doing with the truth of the Gospel, dear reader? ItÂ’s meant to benefit us sinners like you and me.<br><br>Are you trusting it?<br><br>a)You are not trusting the Gospel [the work of salvation by the Lord Jesus Christ] if you attempt to be right with God through good works.<br><br>b)You are not trusting the Gospel if you believe that somehow your good deeds can lessen and atone for your sins.<br><br>c)you are not trusting the Gospel if you think that it's your good works + the Gospel can get you to enter the Kingdom of heaven.<br><br>d) you do not have true faith in the Gospel if you do not reciieve it with a repentant heart.<br><br>He came to die for the sins of sinners and rose again for our justification [justification-meaning that we may be declared perfectly righteous in GodÂ’s eyes forever]. What you must do is trust the Good News of salvation.<br><br>Here's the Gospel command: Trust in the saving work of Christ on Calvary alone.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> May God bless you<br><br></div>

We always joke in church saying that if your christian life has been peaceful thus far, repent becos Satan cannot be bothered about you at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

There is no standard or correct prayer. It is basically a prayer for a non christian to accept the salavtion and acknowledged Christ as his/her saviour and Lord.</div>
