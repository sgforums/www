He attend's Church of Singapore (COSB) and in 1990 he was diagnosed with Hypertension and had to be on medication for life cause if his BP shoots up chances of him suffering a stroke is very high. Whenever he suffer's from stress or is tense, he would have tingling sensation to his arms &amp; get giddy spells. Everyday he would have to pop like 10pills which is really heart wrenching to watch.<br><br>If i can recall correctly in 1996 there was an invited speaker Rev Peter Tan who came to preach on healing &amp; altar call was made. My dad went out in faith to be prayed for &amp; to receive healing at the same time he took another step of faith by not taking his medication.<br><br>The following week he had a medical appointment and the doc checked him &amp; asked if he took his med regularly. My dad said he stopped it &amp; the doc was shocked cause the BP &amp; heart rate was NORMAL! Praise God! The follow-up med appointment also did not show any signs of relaspe. The doc asked how he did it and my Dad testified to the doc &amp; guess wat? The doc was led to Christ by my dad's testi! AMEN!!!<br><br>Till today dad's in Good health, no need to pop pills, just take regular vitamin supplements. Hallelujah!!!<br><br>*God will make a way, when there seems to be no way*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. I just came back from Miracle service. Quite an interesting event I would say.<br><br>Those who were healed were requested to go on stage to give testimonial about it. There was this guy who was wheelchair bound. After prayer had been given, he simply stood up and went to stage and explained that he no longer felt a "weight" on his legs.<br><br>There were also people from the church to assist those who needed healing. What they did was this: They placed their hands on the area of the affected parts and said a prayer. Through the prayer, they encouraged the affected person to receive the healing and thank christ for it.<br><br>All first timers were also given a booklet contaning information on the miracle service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm you ask an interesting question... of course the real question is if you believe that this is possible to begin with in the first place... it's all a matter of some reasoning. Just as a person who does not believe in ghosts will never believe it despite having seen one, or a person who does believe will try to see one at ever corner. In a sense, having evidence is not enough as having the faith and thinking required to make sense of it. Two people seeing the very same thing may come up with different conclusions.<br><br>Barring that, do you have reason, never having seen, to believe that miracles are possible? I believe so. </div></blockquote>I do believe that miracles can happen - otherwise how can I believe in God?<br>I do believe that healing had taken place before - otherwise how can I believe in the Bible?<br><br>Having said all that.... it should also be noted that there are many charlatans around. If there is a claim that healing had taken place, there must also be a record that in the first place, healing was necessary.<br><br>I can now pray for someone for healing for his headache, this chap may recover immediately or within a period of time - did healing took place or did the body reacted to some internal mechanism?<br><br>The real issue is not such psychosomatic illness, but real cases, eg documented cancer cases, or really lame folks (not some who'd sprained his ankle) now standing up to walk, or, as I'd said, the blind now seeing.<br><br>For a "miracle" service to be really credible, there must be some kind of audit and credible independent testimony.<br><br>Ghosts? I am not into the supernatural, I don't think about it or pay attention to it. When I travel and sleep in strange hotel rooms, I turned off all the lights (because that's the way I like it)..... yet, I have seen stuff (a couple of times) that appeared close to me that I cannot explain.</div>
