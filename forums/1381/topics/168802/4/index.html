            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Living SimplyÂ— Yet Focused</strong><br><br>Look at the birds of the air . . . . Consider the lilies of the field . . . Â—Matthew 6:26, 28<br><br>Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin"Â— they simply are! Think of the sea, the air, the sun, the stars, and the moonÂ— all of these simply are as wellÂ— yet what a ministry and service they render on our behalf! So often we impair GodÂ’s designed influence, which He desires to exhibit through us, because of our own conscious efforts to be consistent and useful. Jesus said there is only one way to develop and grow spiritually, and that is through focusing and concentrating on God. In essence, Jesus was saying, "Do not worry about being of use to others; simply believe on Me." In other words, pay attention to the Source, and out of you "will flow rivers of living water" (John 7:38  ). We cannot discover the source of our natural life through common sense and reasoning, and Jesus is teaching here that growth in our spiritual life comes not from focusing directly on it, but from concentrating on our Father in heaven. Our heavenly Father knows our circumstances, and if we will stay focused on Him, instead of our circumstances, we will grow spirituallyÂ— just as "the lilies of the field."<br>The people who influence us the most are not those who detain us with their continual talk, but those who live their lives like the stars in the sky and "the lilies of the field"Â— simply and unaffectedly. Those are the lives that mold and shape us.<br><br>If you want to be of use to God, maintain the proper relationship with Jesus Christ by staying focused on Him, and He will make use of you every minute you liveÂ— yet you will be unaware, on the conscious level of your life, that you are being used of Him.<br></div>

In that know that there is no way they can feed these magnitude of people, and also He (Jesus) had already decided what He want to do before hand. (John 6:5-6)<br><br>What does the Lord means when He tells the disciple Â“They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat. ~Matthew 14:16Â”?  Surely He had already known that this task is beyond the ability of the disciples.<br><br>Its later that I realize that the Lord would never expect us to do the things that He himself would not had already done, but He chose to allow us to participate. Another thing is that He would not do the things that we could do ourselves, He could have, but He chooses not to.<br><br>From the story, it seems that Jesus had never intended that the disciples provide food for the magnitude by their own resources, but rather would want to show them where their focus/faith is, on their own limited ability or on the Lord who can do the task.<br>What is the disciplesÂ’ response? They immediately do a stock check and decide that it cannot be done. Had they put their faith in the Lord, their response may had been different.<br><br>In John 2:5-7, Mary the mother of our Lord Jesus when faced with a seemingly impossible simply look to the Lord to get the job done and not at the limitations of resources.<br><br>Many a time, when the Lord tell us to do something, we start running off to get it done, and most of the time, we try to do it with our own strength and resources, and in a lot of cases, we burned out.<br>Perhaps when the Lord tells us to do something, our response should not be that about our own ability or what little we have but rather our focus and faith should be in how able is our Lord. What He expects of us to just obey and use whatever we have to do what we can do and believe He will finish off those we cannot do.<br><br>Give to the Lord the little we have, and believe Him to put in the plenty He had.<br><br>Some toil the ground, some plant the seeds, some water the field, but itÂ’s the Lord that make them grow.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Explanation For Our Difficulties</strong><br><br>. . . that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us . . . Â—John 17:21<br><br>If you are going through a time of isolation, seemingly all alone, read John 17 . It will explain exactly why you are where you areÂ— because Jesus has prayed that you "may be one" with the Father as He is. Are you helping God to answer that prayer, or do you have some other goal for your life? Since you became a disciple, you cannot be as independent as you used to be.<br>God reveals in John 17 that His purpose is not just to answer our prayers, but that through prayer we might come to discern His mind. Yet there is one prayer which God must answer, and that is the prayer of JesusÂ— ". . . that they may be one just as We are one . . ." (John 17:22 ). Are we as close to Jesus Christ as that?<br><br>God is not concerned about our plans; He doesnÂ’t ask, "Do you want to go through this loss of a loved one, this difficulty, or this defeat?" No, He allows these things for His own purpose. The things we are going through are either making us sweeter, better, and nobler men and women, or they are making us more critical and fault-finding, and more insistent on our own way. The things that happen either make us evil, or they make us more saintly, depending entirely on our relationship with God and its level of intimacy. If we will pray, regarding our own lives, "Your will be done" ( Matthew 26:42 ), then we will be encouraged and comforted by John 17, knowing that our Father is working according to His own wisdom, accomplishing what is best. When we understand GodÂ’s purpose, we will not become small-minded and cynical. Jesus prayed nothing less for us than absolute oneness with Himself, just as He was one with the Father. Some of us are far from this oneness; yet God will not leave us alone until we are one with HimÂ— because Jesus prayed, ". . . that they all may be one . . . ."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a personal sharing:<br><br><strong>Abraham Justified by Faith (Roman 4)</strong><br><blockquote> 3What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.<br>9Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness. 10Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before! 11And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised.<br><br>4Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation. 5However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness. </blockquote>Abraham believed God and his faith was credited to him as righteousness, what then is this faith about?<br>To the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness, meaning, this faith is about not trying to gain justifications through works, but by putting oneÂ’s trust in God who justifies the wicked, this is the faith that is credited as righteousness.<br><blockquote> 20Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, 21being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. 22This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness." 23The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone, 24but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousnessÂ—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 25He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification. </blockquote>Abraham believed that God had power to do what he had promised, and this unwavering belief (which is his faith) is credited to him as righteousness.<br>If Abraham believed in God was credited to him as righteousness, what about us? We are to believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead and that He(Jesus) was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.<br><br>Faith in God is to believe whatever God promises, He can and will deliver. It is to trust God who justifies the wicked, trust enough to understand it is not by our works we received justifications and salvation. It is believing Jesus was delivered over to death and raised to life for our justification. Faith enough to believe that when He love us and promised He will never leave us nor forsake us, He really meant it.<br><br>What about good works? The idea and the motivation of behind doing good work (be it charity, bible study, church going Â…etc) is different from what is normally perceived and need to be put into the correct perspective. We can do good works because of the grace from God through Christ, even the desire and the ability to do good works is from Him. Doing good works is a result and not a means, just as not doing it wonÂ’t change one status before God.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Put God First</strong><br><br>Jesus did not commit Himself to them . . .for He knew what was in man Â—John 2:24-25<br><br><strong>Put Trust in God First. </strong><br><br>Our Lord never put His trust in any person. Yet He was never suspicious, never bitter, and never lost hope for anyone, because He put His trust in God first. He trusted absolutely in what GodÂ’s grace could do for others. If I put my trust in human beings first, the end result will be my despair and hopelessness toward everyone. I will become bitter because I have insisted that people be what no person can ever beÂ— absolutely perfect and right. Never trust anything in yourself or in anyone else, except the grace of God.<br><br><strong>Put GodÂ’s Will First. </strong><br><br>"Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God" (Hebrews 10:9).<br><br>A personÂ’s obedience is to what he sees to be a needÂ— our LordÂ’s obedience was to the will of His Father. The rallying cry today is, "We must get to work! The heathen are dying without God. We must go and tell them about Him." But we must first make sure that GodÂ’s "needs" and His will in us personally are being met. Jesus said, ". . . tarry . . . until you are endued with power from on high" ( Luke 24:49  ). The purpose of our Christian training is to get us into the right relationship to the "needs" of God and His will. Once GodÂ’s "needs" in us have been met, He will open the way for us to accomplish His will, meeting His "needs" elsewhere.<br><br><strong>Put GodÂ’s Son First. </strong><br><br>"Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me" ( Matthew 18:5  ).<br><br>God came as a baby, giving and entrusting Himself to me. He expects my personal life to be a "Bethlehem." Am I allowing my natural life to be slowly transformed by the indwelling life of the Son of God? GodÂ’s ultimate purpose is that His Son might be exhibited in me.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tested for Abundance </strong><br><br>Psalms 66:12<br>We went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.<br><br>It is nice to hear that God desires to bring us into abundance. In fact, many a preacher has promoted the goodness of the Lord and His ability to prosper His children. Alas, my experience is that this gospel of material abundance has little to do with the gospel of the Kingdom as our Lord works in the realm of the sanctified soul. The passage above tells us that God does in fact bring us into places of abundance. However, upon further study of the entire passage, we learn the route to this abundance.<br><br>For you, O God, tested us; You refined us like silver. You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us to a place of abundance (Psalm 66:10-12).<br><br>God's economy of abundance often has little to do with material blessing. In God's economy, abundance is often measured in wisdom and knowledge of Himself. It is then that we are truly blessed. Wisdom cannot be gained through intellectual pursuits. Wisdom comes only through experience. Real wisdom comes from the kinds of experiences that come only through the deepest tests. Lessons of refinement, including prison accompanied by burdens, lead us through the fire and water. This is the territory that must be traveled to reach that place of abundance. It would seem strange that a loving God would use such means with His children. What we often fail to realize is that God's measuring stick is the character and likeness of Jesus Christ Himself in each of us. This cannot be gained through a life of ease and pleasure. Ease and pleasure fail to refine.<br><br>Is God using your marketplace to refine you today? Has He placed you in a prison or laid burdens on your back? Take heart if this is the place you find yourself, and realize that if you are faithful through the tests, you will enter a place of abundance that few will ever attain. The darkest hour is just before daybreak.<br><br>By OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Joh 1:1  "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."<br><br>John 1:1 .  The verb Â“wasÂ” from the Greek "<strong>en</strong>",  being in the imperfect tense in Greek grammar, speaks of the eternality of the Logos. This means that before things began, the Logos was already in existence.<br><br>John 1:1 The title Logos is a very important philosophical and theological term. Greek philosophers believed that the Logos was the impersonal  power which holds the universe together. Alexandrian philosophers also taught that the Logos was a powerful being, but inferior to the supreme being.<br><br>But John wrote that the Logos is a distinct person who is equal in being with God. This is emphasized by the last clause of the verse which states: Â“Â…and God was the WordÂ”.<br><br>The word God in Greek is "<strong>Theos</strong>".  This has no article and it is the first word in the  last clause. There is a very important rule in Greek grammar which states that Â“the presence of the article identifies, but its absence qualifiesÂ”.<br><br>This means that Theos in the last clause describes the Logos as God in His being, not a small god, as some groups teach. He is a distinct person, eternal and equal in being with the Father.<br><br></div>

Others may say that to live is Jenny [his wife]. Still others may say that to live is Basketball [there are so many basketball lovers from where I come. There was one who even murdered a man for speaking ill of his basketball idol]. Some may even say that to live is my children.<br><br>But to us Christians.....who are we to live for? Who is our Life?

People might be led to think that it is part of the original] It is in the italicized form because it is not in the original. it is only supplied by the translators there. So the verse really reads: "For to me, to live Christ and to die gain."<br><br>To Paul the Lord Jesus Christ is his life. The Lord Jesus is not only his Lord, his Savior, to Paul the Lord Jesus is the sphere in which he lived from the inside out.<br><br>And to die gain for he will personally be with the Lord who saved him and gave Himself for him.<br><br>How about you my friend....take a good look at yourself.......who is your life?

But when trouble strikes, celebration seems out of place. The life of faith, though, is frequently contrary to normal human understanding. Jehoshaphat faced his difficulty by applauding GodÂ’s past work and faithfulness, and by recalling His promises.  When we respond in a similar way, we, too, will be able to proceed with courage.<br><br>Self-pity is the natural human response to troubled times, and rehashing the details and repercussions of our situation only makes it seem more threatening. Praise focuses our attention on God instead. If we are looking to Him for aid, then we canÂ’t help but recognize His sovereignty. Every trial comes through His permissive will, which means He has complete control.  Whatever His reasons for allowing trouble into our life, He is faithful to see us through.<br><br>Recalling the LordÂ’s gracious acts and focusing on His sovereignty in everyday life reminds us of our dependence upon Him. (vv. 7-12) Jehoshaphat expected God to intervene because recorded history showed His willingness to rescue His people. This recognition of IsraelÂ’s helplessness unleashed GodÂ’s full power. When believers try to solve problems independently of the Lord, He cannot work freely.<br><br>Our praise is limited only by our knowledge.  The more we read and study the Bible, the better we understand GodÂ’s many attributes and assurances. Then, when difficulty comes, we can celebrate His past faithfulness while awaiting His promised help.<br><br>[taken from Crosswalk.com]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Old Virtues Can Make Your Life New<br>Whitney Hopler<br>Crosswalk.com Contributing Writer</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor's Note: The following is a report on the practical applications of Mark Buchanan's new book, Hidden in Plain Sight: Seven Old Things that Can Make Your Life New, (W Publishing Group, 2006).</span><br><br>WhatÂ’s holding you back in life? If it seems like youÂ’re stuck nursing past wounds or trying to overcome persistent bad habits, thereÂ’s hope. As a Christian, you actually already have everything you need to make real progress Â– old virtues that can make your life new if you embrace them in a fresh way.<br><br>HereÂ’s how you can experience a renewed life by embracing old virtues:<br><br><strong>* Grow in faith.</strong> Ask God to give you more faith so you can more deeply notice and appreciate what HeÂ’s doing in your life now and trust Him to continue to accomplish good purposes through your life. Recognize that attempting to be virtuous apart from God is futile, since no one can be truly good without God. Realize that you donÂ’t need more skill, more cunning, or more resources to make progress in life Â– you just need more faith. Understand that, if you rely on the Holy SpiritÂ’s power, He will magnify even your smallest efforts into more than you can ask or imagine. Pray for God to give you a vision of the future He has in mind for you. Decide to trust Him to lead you toward that future. Embrace the gift of faith and treasure it, realizing that it is the foundation for all other virtues. Understand that faith is the seed that enables all other virtues to grow and bear fruit. Spend time in the company of other people who value their faith, and let them inspire you. Know that what matters most are things unseen (the greater spiritual world beyond the material world we can see right now). Remember that God exists, and everything else that exists depends on Him. Be assured that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him, and decide to pursue God (which will bring you eternal benefits) rather than worldly things that wonÂ’t last. Develop an intimate relationship with Jesus through spiritual disciplines like prayer and reading and meditating on the Bible. Ask the Holy Spirit to fill you, empower you, and guide you. Pay attention to the SpiritÂ’s nudges and act on your faith. Serve God out of joy instead of guilt or fear. Anchor all your other virtues to your faith so you wonÂ’t be swept away from what matters most.<br><br><strong>* Pursue goodness.</strong> Realize that you canÂ’t do good without being good. So set out to be good by getting to know the One who is good Â– Jesus. Rather than focusing on being a better philanthropist, activist, or therapist, focus on becoming a better worshipper. Know that if you learn to love God, you can then love other people. Pay attention the Holy SpiritÂ’s prompting and act on it. Follow the examples of role models who exhibit true goodness at work in their lives. Learn from them.<br><br><strong>* Pursue knowledge.</strong> Pray for the knowledge you need to be wise, and the humility to always remember that knowledge is a gift from God and therefore shouldnÂ’t be used as a trophy to exalt yourself or a weapon to make others feel inferior. Read, study, and ponder the Bible often to learn the truth about GodÂ’s nature and work. Get to know God better as you encounter Him through worship and prayer. Learn about God through experiencing and studying His creation. Come to know God more deeply by inviting His love to flow through you to others in your community through relationships.<br><br><strong>* Pursue self-control.</strong> Pay close attention to what God has done and is now doing. Be aware of how evil is trying to trip you up as you run the race of faith. Ask God to help you see whatÂ’s really going on (without illusion or distortion) and act wisely in light of it. Train yourself to think clearly about what matters most. Instead of just reacting to stressful situations, pray first to help you decide how to respond wisely. Work the habit of prayer into your daily routine, so when crises hit, youÂ’ll have learned how to rely on prayer to get you through. Stand firm in your faith. Be self-controlled because youÂ’re grateful for the salvation youÂ’ve received and want to thank God by pursuing holiness, because your prayers matter now and for eternity, and because you need to resist evil that is seeking to destroy you.<br><br><strong>* Pursue perseverance.</strong> DonÂ’t quit in tough situations. DonÂ’t let setbacks defeat you. Remember the value in suffering: it refines your faith, it perfects your hope, it deepens your intimacy with Jesus, it trains you in holiness, and it weans you from sin. If you believe you are on the right path, stay the course, no matter what obstacles you face along the way. Remember that God will never abandon you and that He isnÂ’t out to get you, but He is out to perfect you. Ask Him what He wants you to learn from your current challenges and how you should redefine your expectations. Pray for the encouragement you need.<br><br><strong>* Pursue godliness.</strong> Know that God loves you completely, just as you are, but that He loves you too much to just leave you there. Understand that He wants you to become all youÂ’re meant to be. Do so by developing Christ-like character. Make your relationship with Jesus your top priority in life, and give His guidance precedent above everything else (your opinions, your emotions, your background, etc.). DonÂ’t allow anything to stand in the way of JesusÂ’ work in your life. When you sense Him leading you to do something, follow through. Hold onto hope, even in the worst situations. Remember that God can take the most challenging circumstances and transform them to accomplish good purposes. Always be willing and prepared to tell people who ask you about the reason for your hope, but do so with gentleness and respect. Remember that you represent Jesus when you interact with those who donÂ’t yet know Him; try to make His presence tangible to them by letting His love flow through you. DonÂ’t seek revenge whenever youÂ’re mistreated; instead, trust God to vindicate you at the right time. Remember that your life makes a real difference in the spiritual realm that you canÂ’t see right now, but that exists in another dimension where angels and demons are watching you. Understand that your influence extends beyond the confines of your church and local community and impacts the whole planet by touching the lives of other people who, in turn, touch othersÂ’ lives. Live in light of eternity, realizing that you will be rewarded in heaven for your faithfulness. Pray for the strength to avoid worldliness Â– whatever makes sin look more attractive than God. Constantly remind yourself of how dependent you are on God. Remember that Jesus faced many trials and temptations that you also face, and look to the example of how He handled them when you need strength to overcome them yourself. Practice the daily discipline of dying to yourself in small ways (such as avoiding yelling at someone with whom youÂ’re angry) so you can gradually let go of selfishness in larger ways as well.<br><br><strong>* Pursue brotherly kindness.</strong> Remember that God loves all people Â– theyÂ’re all His children, made in His image. Ask Him to view other people as your brothers and sisters, and to give you love for them to help you bear with them in all their flaws and annoying eccentricities. Decide to care for other people no matter what, recognizing that you canÂ’t truly love God unless you also love the people He has made. Rely on God to overcome your feelings and act in love anyway when dealing with difficult people. Treat everyone you meet as an equal. Live in unity with other Christians, recognizing that whatever makes you different canÂ’t possibly be greater than what makes you alike Â– Jesus living inside you. Develop close relationships with other people in which GodÂ’s love flows freely between you. Serve others in practical ways for their good and for GodÂ’s glory.<br><br><strong>* Pursue love.</strong> Ask God to help you love unconditionally. Instead of waiting to feel love for someone, decide to act in love toward that person no matter what. Love the Â“least of theseÂ” (people youÂ’d be tempted to trample or sidestep without love, such as prisoners, homeless people, or refugees). Love the Â“most of theseÂ” (people whom youÂ’re most likely to resent because they cause you to feel jealous and insecure, such as someone who got the promotion you wanted or someone who looks more attractive than you). Love the Â“worst of theseÂ” (people who have hurt you in some way through mistreatment). Remember how deeply and unconditionally God loves you, and let that love cast out fear from your life and give you the confidence you need to love others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2nd Reading from the Office of Readings, 16 February 2007<br><br>A Reading from the Tractates on the first letter of John by Saint Augustine, bishop<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our heart longs for God</span><br><br>We have been promised that we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. By these words, the tongue has done its best; now we must apply the meditation of the heart. Although they are the words of Saint John, what are they in comparison with the divine reality? And how can we, so greatly inferior to John in merit, add anything of our own? Yet we have received, as John has told us, an anointing by the Holy One which teaches us inwardly more than our tongue can speak. Let us turn to this source of knowledge, and because at present you cannot see, make it your business to desire the divine vision.<br>The entire life of a good Christian is in fact an exercise of holy desire. You do not yet see what you long for, but the very act of desiring prepares you, so that when he comes you may see and be utterly satisfied.<br><br>Suppose you are going to fill some holder or container, and you know you will be given a large amount. Then you set about stretching your sack or wineskin or whatever it is. Why? Because you know the quantity you will have to put in it and your eyes tell you there is not enough room. By stretching it, therefore, you increase the capacity of the sack, and this is how God deals with us. Simply by making us wait he increases our desire, which in turn enlarges the capacity of our soul, making it able to receive what is to be given to us.<br><br>So, my brethren, let us continue to desire, for we shall be filled. Take note of Saint Paul stretching as it were his ability to receive what is to come: Not that I have already obtained this, he said, or am made perfect. Brethren, I do not consider that I have already obtained it. We might ask him, Â“If you have not yet obtained it, what are you doing in this life?Â” This one thing I do, answers Paul, forgetting what lies behind, and stretching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the prize to which I am called in the life above. Not only did Paul say he stretched forward, but he also declared that he pressed on toward a chosen goal. He realised in fact that he was still short of receiving what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived.<br><br>Such is our Christian life. By desiring heaven we exercise the powers of our soul. Now this exercise will be effective only to the extent that we free ourselves from desires leading to infatuation with this world. Let me return to the example I have already used, of filling an empty container. God means to fill each of you with what is good; so cast out what is bad! If he wishes to fill you with honey and you are full of sour wine, where is the honey to go? The vessel must be emptied of its contents and then be cleansed. Yes, it must be cleansed even if you have to work hard and scour it. It must be made fit for the new thing, whatever it may be.<br><br>We may go on speaking figuratively of honey, gold or wine Â– but whatever we say we cannot express the reality we are to receive. The name of that reality is God. But who will claim that in that one syllable we utter the full expanse of our heartÂ’s desire? Therefore, whatever we say is necessarily less than the full truth. We must extend ourselves toward the measure of Christ so that when he comes he may fill us with his presence. Then we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<br><br><a href="http://www.universalis.com/20070216/i-readings.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.universalis.com/20070216/i-readings.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2nd Reading from the Office of Readings, 3 March 2007<br><br>From the pastoral constitution on the Church in the modern world of the Second Vatican Council<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Man's deeper questionings</span><br><br>The world of today reveals itself as at once powerful and weak, capable of achieving the best or the worst. There lies open before it the way to freedom or slavery, progress or regression, brotherhood or hatred. In addition, man is becoming aware that it is for himself to give the right direction to forces that he himself has awakened, forces that can be his master or his servant. He therefore puts questions to himself.<br><br>The tensions disturbing the world of today are in fact related to a more fundamental tension rooted in the human heart. In man himself many elements are in conflict with each other. On one side, he has experience of his many limitations as a creature. On the other, he knows that there is no limit to his aspirations, and that he is called to a higher kind of life.<br><br>Many things compete for his attention, but he is always compelled to make a choice among them. and to renounce some. What is more, in his weakness and sinfulness he often does what he does not want to do, and fails to do what he would like to do. In consequence, he suffers from a conflict within himself, and this in turn gives rise to so many great tensions in society.<br><br>Very many people, infected as they are with a materialistic way of life, cannot see this dramatic state of affairs in all its clarity, or at least are prevented from giving thought to it because of the unhappiness that they themselves experience.<br><br>Many think that they can find peace in the different philosophies that are proposed.<br><br>Some look for complete and genuine liberation for man from manÂ’s efforts alone. They are convinced that the coming kingdom of man on earth will satisfy all the desires of his heart.<br><br>There are those who despair of finding any meaning in life: they commend the boldness of those who deny all significance to human existence in itself, and seek to impose a total meaning on it only from within themselves.<br><br>But in the face of the way the world is developing today, there is an ever increasing number of people who are asking the most fundamental questions or are seeing them with a keener awareness: What is man? What is the meaning of pain, of evil, of death, which still persist in spite of such great progress? What is the use of those successes, achieved at such a cost? What can man contribute to society, what can he expect from society? What will come after this life on earth?<br><br><strong>The Church believes that Christ died and rose for all, and can give man light and strength through his Spirit to fulfil his highest calling; his is the only name under heaven in which men can be saved.</strong><br><br>So too the Church believes that the centre and goal of all human history is found in her Lord and Master.<br><br>The Church also affirms that underlying all changes there are many things that do not change; they have their ultimate foundation in Christ, who is the same yesterday, today and for ever.<br><br><a href="http://www.universalis.com/800/readings.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.universalis.com/800/readings.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[mod notes: transferred from another thread]<br><strong><span style="color: red;">I think the link below is quite good in explaining the issue of suffering. It lets us know that God is sovereign and in control no matter what it happens.</span></strong><br><br><a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Sermons/ByDate/1985/497_Job_Reverent_in_Suffering/" rel="nofollow">http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Sermons/ByDate/1985/497_Job_Reverent_in_Suffering/</a><br><br>Three Personal Implications<br>1. Let us join with Job and affirm with all our hearts the absolute sovereignty of God.<br><br>Let us say with the psalmist (115:3), "Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases." Let us say with Daniel (4:35), "He does according to his will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, 'What doest thou?'" Let us make the absolute sovereignty of God the rock on which we build our lives and our church.<br><br>2. Let your tears flow freely when your calamity comes.<br><br>"Job arose, rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell upon his face" (1:20). The sobs of grief and pain are not the sign of unbelief. Job knows nothing of a flippant, insensitive, superficial "Praise God anyhow" response to suffering. The magnificence of his worship is because it was in grief, not because it replaced grief. Let your tears flow freely when your calamity comes. And let the rest of us weep with those who weep.<br><br>3. Trust in the goodness of God, and let him be your treasure and your joy.<br><br>Even if God had let Satan take Job's life, we know what Job would have said. He would have said Psalm 63:3, "The steadfast love of the Lord is better than life."<br><br>When your calamity comes, may the Lord give you the grace to affirm the sovereignty of God, let your tears flow freely, and let God himself be your treasure and your joy. Amen.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Here is a short story sent to me by a friend via email. It is my prayer that God would use this to edify fellow believers in Christ. It was sent to me by GirlNextDoor. God bless her.<br><br>THE ANT AND THE CONTACT LENS<br><br>A true story by Josh and Karen Zarandona<br>Submitted by: Aaron Cardenas 9 September 2,000<br><br>Brenda was a young woman who was invited to go rock climbing. Although she was scared to death, she went with her group to a tremendous granite cliff. In spite of her fear, she put on the gear, took a hold on the rope, and started up the face of that rock. Well, she got to a ledge where she could take a breather. As she was hanging on there, the safety rope snapped against Brenda's eye and knocked out her contact lens. Well, here she is on a rock ledge, with hundreds of feet below her and hundreds of feet above her. Of course, She looked and looked and looked, hoping it had landed on the ledge, but it just wasn't there. Here she was, far from home, her sight now blurry. She was desperate and began to get upset, so she prayed to the Lord to help her to find it. When she got to the top, a friend examined her eye and her clothing for the lens, but there was no contact lens to be found. She sat down, despondent, with the rest of the party, waiting for the rest of them to make it up the face of the cliff.<br><br>She looked out across range after range of mountains, thinking of that Bible verse that says, "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth." She thought, "Lord, You can see all these mountains. You know every stone and leaf, and You know exactly where my contact lens is. Please help me." Finally, they walked down the trail to the bottom. At the bottom there was a new party of climbers just starting up the face of the cliff. One of them shouted out, "Hey, you guys! Anybody lose a contact lens?" Well, that would be startling enough, but you know why the climber saw it? An ant was moving slowly across the face of the rock, carrying it.<br><br>Brenda told me that her father is a cartoonist. When she told him the incredible story of the ant, the prayer, and the contact lens, he drew a picture of an ant lugging that contact lens with the words, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Lord, I don't know why You want me to carry this thing. I can't eat it, and it's awfully heavy. But if this is what You want me to do, I'll carry it for You." </span><br><br><strong>I think it would probably do some of us good to occasionally say, "God, I don't know why you want me to carry this load. I can see no good in it and it's awfully heavy. But, if you want me to carry it, I will."</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2nd Reading from the Office of Readings, 12 August 2007<br><br>From a dialogue On Divine Providence by Saint Catherine of Siena, virgin<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The bonds of love</span><br><br>My sweet Lord, look with mercy upon your people and especially upon the mystical body of your Church. Greater glory is given to your name for pardoning a multitude of your creatures than if I alone were pardoned for my great sins against your majesty. It would be no consolation for me to enjoy your life if your holy people stood in death. For I see that sin darkens the life of your bride the Church Â– my sin and the sins of others.<br><br>It is a special grace I ask for, this pardon for the creatures you have made in your image and likeness. When you created man, you were moved by love to make him in your own image. Surely only love could so dignify your creatures. But I know very well that man lost the dignity you gave him; he deserved to lose it, since he had committed sin.<br><br>Moved by love and wishing to reconcile the human race to yourself, you gave us your only-begotten Son. He became our mediator and our justice by taking on all our injustice and sin out of obedience to your will, eternal Father, just as you willed that he take on our human nature. What an immeasurably profound love! Your Son went down from the heights of his divinity to the depths of our humanity. Can anyoneÂ’s heart remain closed and hardened after this?<br><br>We image your divinity, but you image our humanity in that union of the two which you have worked in a man. You have veiled the Godhead in a cloud, in the clay of our humanity. <strong>Only your love could so dignify the flesh of Adam.</strong> And so by reason of this immeasurable love I beg, with all the strength of my soul, that you freely extend your mercy to all your lowly creatures.<br><br><a href="http://www.universalis.com/800/i-readings.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.universalis.com/800/i-readings.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I realized that in my Christian life now, GAZING upon [or beholding as the Bible termed it] Christ is not only essential but everything in my walk with and IN the Lord.<br><br>Christ is my position with God. God views everything that happened to Christ as having happened to me. If Christ was crucified then I am also crucified, if Christ was buried then i am also buried, if Christ resurrected then i am also resurrected, if Christ was taken up to heaven and was seated in the heavenly places with God then God also views me as having undergone all these positionally.<br><br>When i look at myself, i do not see myself as having died, buried, resurrected and seated in the heavenly places. But my position is Christ not myself. When i turn away from myself and gaze upon Christ, the Bible tells me that IN Christ I have undergone all of those things............IN Christ.<br><br>As long as a man is alive IN Adam, sin always has power over him. That is a Bible doctrine. But I have died WITH Christ. And therefore sin has no power over me:<br><br>Ro 6:7 For he who has died [<span style="font-style: italic;">with Christ</span>] has been freed from sin.<br><br>Are you one who has trusted in Christ? if yes, then live out this truth in your daily life. Always be gazing upon this truth in faith. Do not give in to what you feel, but let the Word control you. You died with Christ and therefore freed from sin and so therefore live like it even if you dont feel like it. Faith is not a feeling. It is taking God at His Word.<br><br>If light appeared when He said: "Let there be light". If everything appeared by the Word of His mouth, then if God has said: "You died with Christ" [which He did indeed said in the Bible], then let the man that died with Christ and resurrected with HIm and therefore freed from sin, appear.<br><br>Everything should be according to what He has said. If you resurrected with Christ then seek those things which are above in Christ. What are the things that are above in Christ with God? Is there sin there? NO. Is there unholiness there? NO Is there unrighteousness there? NO.<br><br>Col 3:1  If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.<br><br>Col 3:2 Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth.<br><br>Col 3:3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.<br><br>Col 3:4 When Christ who is <strong>our life</strong> appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.<br><br>Col 3:5  <strong><span style="color: red;">Therefore</span></strong> [<strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> as a word of application since all of the above are true to us IN Christ</span></strong>] put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.<br><br>If you have been seated in the heavenly places IN Christ [Eph. 2:6], then seek to live a heavenly life here on earth.  The Lord Jesus [our position] when He was on earth was always the Heavenly One while He was here on earth. Notice the "IS" in the verse below:<br><br>[Now remember that He uttered these words while He was already here on earth] Joh 3:13 "No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is </strong></span>in heaven.<br><br>He was here on earth physically but He was also in heaven positionally.<br><br>If I am IN Christ then i am also with the Father in intimate closeness as anyone can be IN Christ. Way back in the Old Testament dispensation, no one can enter the Holy of Holies except the High Priest, and that once a year ony.<br><br>But now IN Christ i am with the Father. I am in His presence while I am here on earth now.  I am in His special presence as the Son. Not in the sense of His omnipresence which makes Him present before everybody, but in His special redemptive presence where only those IN Christ can avail themselves of.<br><br>Everybody is before God in His ominipresence but not every one is in His special redemptive presence. Only those who are IN Christ are of the latter. If you are of such presence Christian, what should our manner of life be before Him IN Christ?<br><br>This truth gripped and struck my soul that I was awed of its reality. This ought to make me walk carefully before God. I am in His presence and sin in my life is not fit with the special and divine presence I am in. How could i bring the stench of sin in His special presence? How could I bring in dirt and garbage before Him?<br><br>Christian live out what you are IN Christ. Always gaze upon these truths in faith.<br><br></div>
