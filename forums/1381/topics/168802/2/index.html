Because times are many when dry spells visit me. When the cheer of feelings cannot be heard. Wherein feelings run counter to what I must do.<br><br>I do not always feel like doing GodÂ’s will. I do not always feel like praying, reading GodÂ’s Word and ministering to a brother in need. Rather many a time I do those things on the basis of my WILLING not my FEELING. Had I anchored my obeying the Word of God solely on the spur and spark of my feelings I would not have obeyed God most of the time if not all the time.<br><br>Have you experienced purposely doing GodÂ’s will even though your feelings hollered: Â“No. I donÂ’t feel like it!!!!!!!!!!!!Â”? You did it even though you did not feel like doing it. You know what. ThatÂ’s God working in you. Your spiritual muscles get stronger every time you do that. It requires a lot of faith to do that. Our spiritual muscles do not really get that worked up if we are aided by the shove of our feelings.<br><br>Time will come when you will be put in a situation where you must choose what you must do as opposed to what you feel. Time will come when you will be placed in a situation where you must sacrifice your Â“IsaacÂ” than follow what your feelings dictates. When you do that. ThatÂ’s God working in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.<br><br>DonÂ’t miss to take advantage of those situations wherein feelings oppose what you must do by obeying what God wants in that particular situation. They train you for the big event.<br><br></div>

Until a point of no return is reached when the heart is so hardened, the conscience becomes soo dead,  the ear so deaf to the call of repentance, the eyes so blind to light that the state of the unpardonable sin is reached.<br><br>One of the terrifying statements in the Bible is this:<br><br>Isa 22:14 Then it was revealed in my hearing by the LORD of hosts, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Surely for this iniquity there will be no atonement for you, Even to your death</strong></span>," says the Lord GOD of hosts.<br><br>The iniquity in this verse speaks of the people's hearts so impervious and hardened to the call of repentance that they have reached in their hearts the point of no return.<br><br>It is not that God refuses to forgive, rather it is the people so hardened by sin that they will never accept forgiveness and mercy. They would rather wallow in sin than accept God's forgiveness.<br><br>How about you? Do you still feel the pangs of conscience in you and still want forgiveness? That's a good sign that you have not reached the unpardonable sin. Claim it now and repent.<br><br>For us believers, be warned of enjoying 'small' sins for it is still sin and can hardened your heart.

Colossians 1:27<br><br>How could a Christian live a Christ-like life in this fallen world?<br><br>Where a triumvirate of enemies dog his steps. There's the a) seductions of the world, b) the temptations of Satan and c) the inward pull of our remaining corruption, the sinful nature in us.<br><br>With all these, how could it be possible to live the Christ-like life required by God to us Christians? Does He know that the battle is overwhelming and seems like an up-hill climb for us?<br><br>The answer to all those questions are found in that verse my friend. The God who requires Christlikeness in us is also  the same God who does these very thing in us.<br><br>He knows that you are weak, He knows that you are no match against the world, Satan and the sinful nature in you. That 's why He came and indwelt you. What you need to do is to let Him live His life in you.<br><br>The reason why you fail and stumble and falter in the Christian life, the reason why you burn out spiritually is because you have been trying to live your life on your own strength and resources. Oblivious to the fact that there is a <strong>PERSON INDWELLING YOU</strong> ready to take over anytime you give Him the controls of your life.<br><br><strong>JUST LET HIM LIVE HIS LIFE IN YOU.</strong><br><br>How to do it?<br><br>In the front page of my Bible i wrote these words i have read in one of my readings. I wrote it down, first, to remind myself of it everytime i open my Bible and secondly, because it is an eloquent and clear statement of how to let the Lord Christ live His life in you:<br><br><strong> "Relate every thing, moment by moment as it arises, to the adequacy of what He is in you, and assume that His adequacy will be operative."</strong><br><br>The more often you do this the more often you will be Christlike. When this will become your habit, the higher you are in the sanctification ladder my friend.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you not noticed: Spiritual giants have always been men who have spent some time in seclusion and meditation.<br><br>Here are some personages in the Bible:<br><br>1)	Moses before he went back to Egypt spent years in the backside of the desert.<br><br>2)	David before he came into the public scene of Israel [to Â“shepherdÂ” Israel so to speak] spent sometime alone with God tending sheep in the hillsides of Judea.<br><br>3)	John the Baptist before his ministry spent some time in the desert alone with God.<br><br>4)	Paul before he turned public in his ministry spent some time alone in Arabia with God.<br><br>5)	The Lord Jesus Himself before the start of His 3 year ministry spent 40 days in the desert.<br><br>Why does the Church now in these latter days lack spiritual giants?

Most of us are willing slaves to the tube [T.V.]<br><br>I am not against T.V. of course. Watching T.V. per se is not sin or unlawful.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, why donÂ’t we talk about basic theology today? ThereÂ’s nothing wrong with theology as long as it can be shown to be biblical. You all know the meaning of theology right? A study of God.<br><br>At the risk of being rudimentary, I would like to talk about the Trinity. Why do we need to study about it? Well, because it is important to know who God is as taught in the Bible. Otherwise we would be worshipping other gods. A god of our own imaginations and makings. God said: Â‘thou shall not have any gods before meÂ’ Knowing who God is, is fundamental to worship.<br><br>Many of us are practically idolaters even though we believe that there is no other God but the God of the Bible. Many in our ranks think that God is an old man with a long beard up there in heaven. And if you think God is like that and worships God like that, you are committing idolatry my friend. That is not the God of the Bible. That is the god of your own making.<br><br>When the Israelites crafted an image of a calf in the skirts of Mount Sinai they did not intend to worship other gods beside Jehovah. No. They intended that calf to represent Jehovah. Listen to the words of Aaron:<br><br>Ex 32:4 And he received the gold from their hand, and he fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molded calf. Then they said, "<strong>This is your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt!"</strong><br><br>5 So when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow is a feast to the <strong>LORD</strong>."<br><br>They erroneously thought that Jehovah was someone like this calf [maybe from the influence of the pagan nation Egypt]. See that word Â“LORDÂ” there?<br><br>In Hebrew it is the name of God given to Moses before he went to Egypt for a rescue mission. YHWH that is. Jehovah or Yahweh or YeHoWaH. Clearly they did not intend to worship other gods other than YeHoWaH. But because of their error that God can be represented physically through symbols, they fell into great error and idolatry.<br><br>Time and space will not allow us anymore to discuss the Trinity. We will tackle that in the next post.<br><br><strong>Practical Application </strong><br><br>Knowledge of who God is, is paramount in the Christian life. The more you know who God is, the more blessed will be your worship.<br><br>Read your Bibles daily.<br><br>Here we see the error of other groups who excuse their images and statues as representation of God. But even that is clearly wrong as we have shown above.<br><br>I have nothing against these other groups personally. I do not have any quarrel with men. I can engage in a healthy debate with them, yes, but I have no personal ill feelings toward them. The God I know in the Bible commands me to love them.<br><br>It's just that, speaking the truth in love, they are committing what Aaron and the Israelites committed. Idolatry.<br><br></div>

The most brilliant facet, however, is trust!<br><br>Trust is something we have, and we decide what to do with it. We decide in whom or in what to put our trust.<br><br>We must remember Who delivered us in the past and know Who will deliver us in current troubles, then take our trust and put it in the right place, which is in God alone.<br><br>Trust has certain identifying characters. Trust is not upset, because it has entered into God's rest. Trust is not confused, because it has no need to lean to its own understanding. Trust does not indulge in carnal reasoning, it lets God be God.<br><br>In whom have you placed your trust? In what have you placed your trust? Is your trust in your job, employer, bank account, natural talents, or friends?<br><br>Perhaps your trust is in yourself, your past record of successes, education, or possessions.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Faith is now, but the manifestation IS IN DUE TIME. So don't become impatient.</strong><br><br>For you have need of steadfast patience and endurance,<br>so that you may perform and fully accomplish<br>the will of God, and thus receive and carry away<br>[and enjoy to the full] what is promised.<br>HEBREWS 10:36<br><br>THE HEBREW BELIEVERS were suffering deeply for their faith and the writer to the Hebrews was concerned that they not "fling away [their] fearless confidence, for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward" (Hebrews 10:35). Faith must look beyond the present moment and tomorrow and your lifetime, Faith looks to eternity. You are a Christian for eternity, not for time. Weigh the eternal rewards coming your way against whatever losses you may suffer in this lifetime because of your faith in Christ. There is no comparison.<br><br>By His grace continue to patiently believe His Word and hold fast to the truth. The things you have believed, continue to believe. If the storms gather against you and the darkness descends, remember that the morning will dawn. Let your hope hear the distant hallelujahs that proclaim the coming reign of Christ. Rest in the assurance that the kingdom of God will win the day, even if you must step into eternity to enjoy it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>God permits in His wisdom WHAT HE COULD HAVE altered or prevented in His power.</strong><br><br>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. (JOB 13:15)<br><br>WHO CAN IMAGINE the depths of grief or the suffering of the man whom God called "My servants Job"? His ten children perished. From head to toe his body was covered with boils and blisters. His staggering wealth vanished. His wife's only recorded words were a bitter directive to "renounce God and die!" Even his longtime friends, who should have brought comfort, and who should have known better, instead accused him of being a hypocrite in need of repentance. All because of Satan's hatred for Job, and because God was willing to allow Job's faith to be tested. "And the Lord said to Satan, Behold, he is in you hand; only spare his life"(Job 2:6).<br><br>As a believer, you know your faith will be tried, and Job's life demonstrates it can be tested to the extreme. You may taste of life's bitterness--you may taste more than you could have imagined--but hear God's words to your soul:"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose"(Romans 8:28 KJV). Come what may, know that through the Spirit's help God's purpose shall be accomplished. Rest in His unchanging wisdom!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>True Faith is timeless. It can only be INTERRUPTED by two things--doubt or manifestation.</strong><br><br>Jesus said, Take away the stone.<br>Martha, the sister of the dead man, exclaimed,<br>But Lord, by this time he [is decaying and] throws off an<br>offensive odor, for he has been dead four days!<br>Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you and promise you<br>that if you would believe and rely on Me,<br>you would see the glory of God?<br>(JOHN 11:39,40)<br><br>THE STORY OF the raising of Lazarus from the dead is a beauty. Martha truly believed Lazarus would not have died if Jesus had been there sooner. She believed in Jesus as the Christ, her Messiah (John 11:21-27). But Jesus was abouth to take her faith to a new level--a level that defied any hint of natural possibilities. Faith must move beyond the theoretical to where it touches your deepest need at a level that requires the supernatural.<br><br>If Jesus could have spared Lazarus before his death, why not believe He would raise him from the dead after four days? Why not move beyond "could" do it to "will" do it? Take His promise and rest in it. You will see the glory of God!<br></div>

As believers, we have a unique privilege, which is to remain in peace even when we do not understand what has happened, what is happening, or what is going to happen in the future. We can be content to know the One Who knows, even if we do not know the answer ourselves. We serve the All-Knowing God Who keeps one eye on us all the time. God is never surprised; He knows everything before it happens.<br><br>We should grow in trust not questions. We are generally more concerned with temporal things, and God is concerned with eternal things. Something may be God's will for us, but not His perfect timing. We must learn to wait on Him.<br><br>I had to learn early to lean on, trust in, and be confident in the Lord. Through experience, I have learned to say, "God, I do not know what You are doing, but I am sure You do. I trust You."<br><br>Trust God and by doing so you will maintain your peace.<br></div>

God's supernatural power began that process the moment you were born again. You were changed on the inside instantly. How successful you are in allowing this change to progress to the outer man is mostly up to you. We grow up spiritually just like we grow up physically.<br><br>What can you do to speed this growing process along?<br><br>Spend more time pursuing the things of the Spirit than you spend pursuing the things of the flesh. Become dedicated to the Word of God and to fellowship with Him. Be willing to pull aside from the busy things of life and get alone with Him, so He can guide you, teach you and share His likeness with you.<br><br>Have you ever noticed that if you spend time around people who have strong personalities, you will automatically be affected by them? You'll find yourself doing the things they do. Their mannerisms will rub off on you. You can't help it. They just influence you, especially if they are people you respect and admire.<br><br>The same thing is true in your relationship with God. If you spend enough time with Him, He's going to rub off on you! His ways will become your ways.<br><br>So make yourself available to Him by praying in the Spirit and worshiping and loving Him. Hang around His Word and the people who love His Word and live it.<br><br>Before you know it, you'll begin to notice yourself changing. You'll find your character becoming more like His. You'll begin to think like He does and talk like He does and even act like He does. His image will begin to shine forth in you!</div>

Prayer is a natural expression of a heart that is abiding in Christ-it is on your lips when you awake in the morning and flows naturally from you throughout your day.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Obey Today </strong><br><br>He who being often reproved hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.<br>Â–(Proverbs 29:1)<br><br>Some people have the mistaken idea that when the direction of the Holy Spirit comes to them, they can just ignore it for a while if they want to and then obey Him later in their own good time. They think to themselves, "I know what I'm doing is wrong. I know my lifestyle isn't right, but I'm just going to do it a while longer. Then I'll get things straightened out with the Lord."<br><br>Let me warn you, that is an extremely dangerous thing to do. Because God says that when you refuse His guidance, your heart grows hard. It's not that God's grace doesn't extend to you anymore. It's not that He wouldn't forgive you if you turned to Him. It's just that sin will callous your heart to the point where you can't hear Him calling.<br><br>That's what happened to the children of Israel. God would tell them what to do and they wouldn't do it. When He was trying to bring them into the Promised Land and He told them to go in and possess it, they flatly refused.<br><br>Of course, they thought they had good reasons for refusing. They were so full of fear and unbelief that they actually thought if they did what God said, they'd be destroyed. But, you know, it doesn't matter how good your reasons are for disobeying God. That disobedience will still cost you. It will still harden your heart.<br><br>The children of Israel ignored God's leading so often that He finally just sent them into the wilderness. They were so stiff-necked, He couldn't lead them into the blessings He'd planned for them, and He had to just let them wander around until all but two of them had died off. He had to raise up a whole new generation of softer hearted people before He could take them into the land.<br><br>Take a lesson from that and don't play around with sin. When God tells you what you need to do, don't put Him off thinking it will be easier to do it later. It won't be. It will be harder!<br><br>When the Spirit of God comes to correct you, follow His instructions and follow them quickly. Keep your heart tender. Obey the Lord!<br></div>

We live in a world that is not concerned about integrity. Often, the world is more concerned about quantity than quality.

Our standard should be much higher than the world's. There are certain things we wouldn't even think of doing, but there are too many compromises, even in the lives of God's people. There are things we do that Jesus would not do, and He is our standard of integrity.<br><br>If we want to enjoy prosperity, we must walk in integrity. Integrity is being committed to a life of excellence, as our God is excellent.<br><br>Integrity is keeping our word. Commitment is giving our all and finishing what we start.<br><br>Keep your word, even if it costs you. Be committed to integrity.<br><br>Count the cost before saying you will do something.
