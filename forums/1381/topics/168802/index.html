            <div class='col-md body'>Let me start:<br><br>Pr 1:7  Â“The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledgeÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…..Â”<br><br>Psalms 111:10 "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdomÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â”<br><br>Let us understand first three important things in these texts:<br><br>1)	What is the fear of the Lord?<br>2)	What is knowledge referred to here?<br>3)	And what is wisdom referred to here?<br><br><strong>I. Definition of terms</strong><br><br>1) What is the fear of the Lord? The fear of the Lord is the reverential fear from sinning against God. It is hating what God hates and loving what God loves.<br><br>2)What is knowledge referred to here? Knowledge here does not refer to any kind of secular knowledge but knowledge about GodÂ’s will.<br><br>3)What is wisdom referred to here? Wisdom is the application of knowledge. It is applied knowledge in short.<br><br>Our text could be combined as: Â“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge and wisdomÂ”<br><br><strong>II. Why is the fear of the Lord the beginning of knowledge and wisdom?</strong><br><br>Because once a person fears sinning against God and wants to do His willÂ….that person wants to know about what God hates and what God lovesÂ…..He wants to have KNOWLEDGE of GodÂ’s will. And when he gets hold of that knowledgeÂ…..he would then apply it to daily life [WISDOM].<br><br>Knowledge is knowing that there is a sign post on the side of the road that says: Â“NO LEFT TURNÂ”. Wisdom is heeding that sign post.<br><br>ThatÂ’s why if you continue the verse [psalms 111:10] it reads:<br><br>Ps 111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all those who do His commandments. His praise endures forever.<br><br><strong>III. Practical application</strong><br><br>A good deal of us have some measure of knowledge of what GodÂ’s will is. But we just donÂ’t apply it [IÂ’m often guilty of this to my shame]. We have knowledge yes, but we are often times unwise by not applying it.<br><br>Prayer: I pray that God will increase our fear of Him that we may do His will and not just read it in His word.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever experienced having doubts about the Bible? Have you ever felt that God somehow seemed distant from you? Have you felt in your prayer life like God has put the receiver off the hook?And thoughts race through your mind that: Â“hey maybe IÂ’m not a Christian or maybe IÂ’m not that mature of a ChristianÂ…..[or something like that].Â” Or you wonder if mature Christians ever felt like you do. Well youÂ’re in good company brother or sister. God knows how you feel. His saints have experienced it.<br><br>Doubts about the Bible? Your Galatian brethren went through it. The book of Galatians was written by Paul to quell wrong and heretical teaching being embraced by our Galatian brethren.<br><br>Ga 1:6 Â“I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,Â”<br><br>This was because false teachers have somehow succeeded in convincing the Galatian brethren [to some extent] that Paul was a false apostle of Christ, that Paul was only appointed by unscrupulous men but not Christ our Lord. Yup, they doubted PaulÂ’s apostleship and authority.  ThatÂ’s why in the very beginning of the letter you will see:<br><br>Ga 1:1 Paul, an apostle (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not from men nor through man</strong></span>, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead),<br><br>And now in our times, Satan could very easily inject doubts in your mind to doubt Paul, Peter, Jamesm Isaiah and the Bible as a whole by attacking the integrity of the Bible, it's accuracy and it's inspiration through anti-Bible books, through shows on T.V. or etc.<br><br>God seemed distant and somehow seems that He doesnÂ’t hear your prayers?<br><br>Ps 10:1  <strong>Why do You stand afar off, O LORD? Why do You hide in times of trouble?</strong><br><br>Ps 13:1 <strong>How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?</strong><br><br>Or HabakkukÂ’s:<br><br>Hab. 1:2 Â“<strong>O LORD, how long shall I cry, And You will not hear? Even cry out to You,</strong> "Violence!" And You will not save.<br><br>Yup, giant saints have experienced it too. And God knows it. He put it in His Scriptures. He knows how you feel.<br><br>So what do you do in times like these come?<br><br>1)	Continue on reading the Bible [if you have doubts about it]. Faith increases every time you keep on hearing GodÂ’s Word. What did Paul do when the Galatian brethren had their doubts? He wrote them a letter for them to read. Keep on reading it till the scale of faith and doubt tips off in favor of faith.<br><br>2)	If God seem distant and seemed to not hear prayer. What do you do? Let God know about it. Be honest about it to God. Tell Him about it [reverentially of course]. ThatÂ’s what David, Habakkuk and etc. did right?<br><br>3) a) <strong>Trust</strong>.<br><br>b) <strong>Rejoice</strong> in His salvation.<br><br>c) <strong>sing</strong> songs of worship to the Lord<br><br>d) <strong>remember</strong> His past answers and faithfulness.<br><br>ThatÂ’s what David did when he experienced it.<br><br>David says in verse 5 of Psalm 13 that: Â“But I have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>trusted </strong></span>in Your mercy..Â”<br><br>and Â“My heart shall <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rejoice</strong></span> in Your salvation.Â”<br><br>And verse 6: Â“I will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sing</strong></span> to the LORD<br><br>and: Â“Because He <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>has</strong></span> dealt bountifully with me.Â” [Â‘hasÂ’ indicates he looked to the past when God was bountiful with David].<br><br>Past blessings are signs that He will bless you again [especially if you are faithful].<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trapped in pornography and lustful thoughts and youÂ’re a Christian?<br><br>Maybe youÂ’re not busy. Maybe you havenÂ’t had fellowship with other Christians. HereÂ’s a formula for you to beat this thing. FLEE, PURSUE AND FELLOWSHIP with other prayerful Christians:<br><br>2Ti 2:22  Â“<strong>Flee</strong> also youthful lusts; but <strong>pursue</strong> righteousness, faith, love, peace <strong>with</strong> those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.Â”<br><br>We are given two imperatives in that verse up there by Paul. FLEE AND PURSUE.<br><br>What are we to flee from? Youthful lusts<br><br>Lust here of course does not mean sexual lust exclusively but it includes it. So it is pertinent to our topic. The word in the original here was used by the Bible writers to mean: lust for money which is greed, lust for power, lust for pleasure which is hedonism, lust for sexual union with one not your spouse and etc. Younger people unlike old people often have this surplus desires, even sinful desires since they have the energy and youth to pursue it.<br><br>What does Paul say? He says FLEE. The word Â‘fleeÂ’ in the original could mean: flee, run away; disappear, vanish. Why does it not say Â‘walk away from it or jog away from it?Â’ Because this kind of lust requires a radical and drastic action on your part. When sensual films or shows on T.V. or magazines parade before your eyes do something immediately about it. Do not wait till the thing melts you deep inside. If you cannot flee or run away from it change the channel. If you cannot do this, disappear or  vanish away from the scene of temptation. ThatÂ’s what Joseph did right? [Genesis 39Â”12-13].<br><br>If lustful thoughts enter your mind, do something immediately about it. Change your thoughts. Be busy. It is true that our thoughts sometimes dictate what we feel and do. But the reverse is also true [though many donÂ’t know about this] that our actions [especially consistent actions] dictate what we feel and eventually what we think. Act like a clown and eventually you will think and feel like a clown. Change your thoughts by continually doing somethng godly.<br><br>However, fleeing is not enough. Have you tried fleeing from pornography and lustful thoughts in masturbation and yet you were good only for some time. You eventually went back to it again? Why the relapse? ItÂ’s because you were just fleeing away from it with no direction. ItÂ’s like running away from the left and staying in the middle. When you flee away from it you must get busy by <strong>PURSUING GODLY VIRTUES.</strong><br><br>2Ti 2:22  Â“Flee also youthful lusts; but <strong>pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace</strong> with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.Â”<br><br>The word Â‘pursueÂ’ is in the present tense in the original. Present tense in Greek signifies a continuing and progressing action.<br><br>Occupy your time by continually and habitually developing godly character traits. Continually fill your mind with that goal. And do this with other godly Christians:<br><br>2Ti 2:22  Â“Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace <strong>with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart</strong>.Â”<br><br>You cannot beat this thing alone. You must enlist the help and prayers of other Christians. Find an accountability partner whom you can confide your problem and pray about it. Let him Â‘meddleÂ’ in your life by constantly checking how your doing. Allow him to be your keeper.<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I have heard of a story in the U.S. wherein authorities raided a house. They raided it because the inhabitants of the house where growing marijuanaÂ’s right inside cabinets. And that without using soil. I also heard of crew members growing vegetables right inside a submarine without using soil. A professor of this technology tried to sell tomatoes [grown from this technology] to McDonaldÂ’s, but McDonaldÂ’s refused because the tomatoes were just too big for their hamburgers!!!<br><br>Yup, maybe some of you may have guessed what IÂ’m talking about. HYDROPHONICS. The technology wherein it allows you to grow almost any kind of plant without using soil. However, in my observation, I realized that plants in whatever kind of technology you grow them are basically the same. Whether you plant them traditionally or hydrophonically, they need the same basic elements in order for them to grow strong and healthy. The formula remains the same. Put a plant in a right climate and provide it with the right kind of diet you will get a strong healthy plant.<br><br>Right climate + Right diet = a strong and healthy plant. In my reading, I noticed the same formula indicated in the Bible for the spiritual growth of a Christian.<br><br><strong>RIGHT SPIRITUAL CLIMATE + RIGHT SPIRITUAL DIET = A STRONG HEALTHY CHRISTIAN.</strong><br><br>In Psalms 1:1-3, the same basic formula is indicated:<br><br><strong><br>Right Spiritual Climate</strong> verse 1:<br><br>Ps 1:1  Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;<br><strong><br>Right Spiritual Diet</strong> verse 2:<br><br>Ps 1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night.<br><br><strong>Equals a strong and healthy Christian</strong> verse 3:<br><br>Ps 1:3 He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper.<br><br>Here read it again:<br><br>Ps 1:1  Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;<br><br>2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night.<br><br>3 He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper.<br><br>ThereÂ’s the formula. ItÂ’s up to you to apply it.<br></div>

You have prayed for his or her salvation yet he/she remains an unbeliever. Why donÂ’t you try another approach.<br><br>TRY EVANGELIZING WITHOUT SPEAKING A SINGLE WORD<br><strong><br><br>How is it done?</strong><br><br>1Pe 3:1 Â“Wives, likewise, be submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey [<span style="font-style: italic;">or believe</span>, italics mine] the word, they, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">without a word</span>, may be won by the conduct of their wives,</strong><br>2 when they observe your chaste conduct accompanied by fear.<br><br>The verse may primarily apply to wives who have unbelieving husbands but the principle is applicable also to all Christians who have unbelieving classmates, officemates, relatives and etc. The principle is: <strong>actions often times speak clearly than words. Godly living talks. </strong><br><br>You cannot convince someone to accept Christ as Savior and Lord, if they see in your life a life void of Christ. I believe it was the 18th century preacher Harry Drummond who said in effect: <strong>Â“Many sinners are kept outside the Kingdom of God because of the lives of those who profess to be inside the Kingdom of God.Â”</strong><br><br>Walk the talk so that you will have credibility when you speak the Word.

You wonder if God will ever forgive you and give you another chance. But then you think of the sin or sins that youÂ’ve doneÂ…you cower and lose confidence that you will ever be forgiven again and start over.<br><br>Why you forgot the promise my friend:<br><br>1Jo 1:9 Â‘If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.Â’<br><br>Or if you didnÂ’t forget this promise and you still feel the way I described aboveÂ…Â…it means you donÂ’t believe in this promise. Why is your sin greater than DavidÂ’s when he committed murder, adultery, manipulation and etc.? Is your sin greater than PeterÂ’s when he denied the Lord three times. Or you think that you have committed the unpardonable sin, the sin against the Holy Spirit? If you have committed the sins of David and PeterÂ….did God not forgive them ? He did right? He forgave them. What makes you think He will not forgive you.<br><br>Or if you think that you have committed the unpardonable sin. Well, apparently not my friend. Why? Because you are seeking forgiveness. The sin against the Holy Spirit is a condition of the heart that is so hardened that it is past feeling already. Numb to God. Numb to conscience. Numb to spiritual things. The person who has committed this sin is a person who will not seek forgiveness for good in his life.<br><br>Your case is different. You sought forgiveness. You want to be forgiven. That means the Holy Spirit is working in you. So what do you do to be forgiven? Confess your sins in repentance and claim the promise. You donÂ’t need a sign from heaven that you are forgiven already. You donÂ’t need a good feeling that you are already forgiven. What you need is a word from God. HereÂ’s the word: 1 John 1:9.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the primary differences between the first century Church and the 21st century Church is this sense of EAGER anticipation for the LordÂ’s coming. The 1st century church had an abundance of it which the 21st century Church have so little of. The former was so enthused and alert for the blessed hope while the latter has slumbered.<br><br>Ro 8:23 Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, <strong>eagerly waiting </strong>for the adoption, the redemption of our body [when the Lord returns].<br><br>1Co 1:7 so that you come short in no gift, <strong>eagerly waiting </strong>for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br><br>Tit 2:13 l<strong>ooking</strong> [expectantly] for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,<br><br>Are you eagerly awaiting for His return my Christian friend?

This hope was so real to Paul that he went everywhere witnessing and testifying about the gospel.<br><br>3)  Are you circumspect in your ways? Anyone who has this hope knows that when He comes, Christians would be in the Judgment seat of Christ where He will evaluate how we spent our Christian lives here on earth and give out rewards accordingly.<br><br>4)	This hope would give you endurance in suffering and difficult times.<br>[2 Corinthians 4:17-18]<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>You can gauge yourself of how much you trust God by how much you tell Him</strong><br><br>Ps 62:8 Â‘Trust in Him at all times, you people;Â’<br><br>Â‘Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for usÂ’<br><br>It is a universal law that you cannot truly pour your whole heart out on a person if you do not, at first, wholly trust that person. If thatÂ’s true with regards to our horizontal relationship with our fellowmen, thatÂ’s also true with regards to our vertical relationship with God. You cannot pour your whole self out to God if you do not completely trust Him first.<br><br>The phrase Â‘at all timesÂ’ in Â‘Trust in Him at all times, you people;Â’ signify completeness. God wants you to trust Him fair whether or bad whether. Rain or shine. In health or sickness. Good times or bad times. In employment or unemployment and etc. Show me a person who is like that and IÂ’ll show you a person who trusts in God completely. Show me a person who is like this and IÂ’ll show you a person who pours his whole heart out to God.<br><br>The word heart in Â‘Pour out your heart before Him;Â’ means the whole inner being. He opens himself out to God. His thoughts, his plans, his emotions, his frustrations, his disappointments, his victories, his failures, his sins and etc.<br><br>How much do you trust God my friend?<br><br>1)	Are you pouring all or are your pouring only some?<br>2)	When something comes up, what is your first recourse of action? Do you pray first before you fix the problem or do you fix the problem first and then pray? If the former, do you do this every time something comes up or some of the time only?<br>3)	WhatÂ’s your level of communication with God?<br><br>A book by John Powell entitled: Â“Why am I afraid to tell you who I am?Â” gives us the five levels of communication:<br><br>Level 5&gt; this is superficial communication. Or ClichÃ© conversation: Â‘Hi how are you?Â’ Â‘Where have you been?Â’ Â“I hope we can get together soonÂ” I like your dress very muchÂ”.<br><br>Level 4&gt; we repot facts to each other. Â“WE remain contented to tell others what so and so has said or done. We offer no personal, self-revelatory commentary on those facts, but simply report themÂ”<br><br>Level 3&gt; It deals with ideas and judgments.<br><br>Level 2&gt; it deals with feelings. Â“I am afraidÂ”. I feel happyÂ” I feel disappointedÂ”<br>[by the way, rarely do husbands and wives reach this stage, maybe that explains the misunderstanding and the breakdown in most marriages or homes].<br><br>Level 1&gt; most personal and intimate level of communication. Secrets, feelings and other deeply personal things take place here. This is gut level honesty. This is where marriages thrive. Fellowships become meaningful and prayer becomes deeper. ItÂ’s pouring your heart out.<br><br>WhatÂ’s your level of communication with God? Your level of communication with Him determines how much you trust Him.<br><br>Behind PaulÂ’s injunction to pray to God always is the call to trust God all the time.<br><br>Pour your heart to God my friend all the time, all of it.<br><br></div>

We Christians are ministers [Epe. 4:12-13]. Sometimes God allows things that squeeze our comfort zones to happen in our lives so that we can empathize, sympathize, be sensitive and therefore comfort other people who are in the same predicament as ours. Like you and me this brother, that sister, that new Christian down there, that long time Christian up there also has their own share of fears and doubts,  failures and weaknesses,  victories and strengths,  dissappointments and frustrations and discouragements. Like you and me they are also humans, though saved.<br><br>What a comfort it is indeed to have a warm, intelligent, sensitive and sympathetic human being to have on our side who went through the same things as we have in our days of misery and trouble.

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Isa 62:6 I Â‘have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; They shall never hold their peace day or night. You who make mention of the LORD, do not keep silent,<br><br>7 And give Him no rest till He establishes And till He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.Â’<br><br>These verses pertain to Israel when God will finally restore Israel in the land of promise during the Millennium when the Lord returns. He will rule all over the earth with peace, prosperity and righteousness for a thousands years with Israel as the top nation.<br><br>The statement Â‘I have set watchmen on your WALLS, O JerusalemÂ’ imply that Jerusalem or Israel has been laid desolate but not forever. The time will come when God will once again show favor to Israel [after the Church is completed Romans 11:25-26] and fulfill all His promises made to them.<br><br>God sets up watchmen or intercessors to remind Him always [day and night] of His promises He made to Israel and their fathers [Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David and etc]. It doesnÂ’t mean of course that God has a propensity to forget cognitively His promises like we sinful creatures do. God wants them to keep anticipating the fulfillment of His promises or to Â‘wait on the Lord.Â’ God is delighted and glorified when believers hang on His promises and anticipate the fulfillment of His Word. ItÂ’s worshipping Him.<br><br>Practical Application:<br><br>Though this promise is made to Israel only, this does not mean that we [Church Age people, Christians] cannot benefit from it. By studying it we can somehow get a glimpse of the character of God, of who God is. God is a God who wants to be reminded of His promises always. Remind God of His promises He made to you. Do it always in prayer. He is not irked by it. He delights in it.<br><br>Tips<br><br>1)	Know of whom the promise is made. Is it for a particular person? Is it made to a specific group of people [Israel]?  Is it made to Church Age people [Christians]?<br>2)	Know the time frame [if there is] of when  the promise will have fulfillment.<br>3)	Know if the promise has conditions in order to have fulfillment.<br><br>P.S. Rightly divide the Word of truth. Do not claim promises not made to you [member of the Church]. There are promises made to the Church and there are promises made to Israel. Mostly, promises made to the Church are spiritual while promises made to Israel are both spiritual and temporal and material. There are preachers who cite Deuteronomy verses as their basis that God wants them to be rich and wealthy when they will obey Him. But Deuteronomy verses are GodÂ’s promises to Israel, the people of whom He made the Old Covenant. These verses [Deuteronomy verses] would ultimately have fulfillment during the Millennium not during the Church Age.<br><br></div>

The word actually is neutral. It could be either bad or good depending upon which you are separated unto. You could be sanctified or separated UNTO a particular work like the Levites. Or you could sanctify yourself to  TO evil purposes. However, when speaking of the sanctification brought by the Lord Jesus, sanctification is a separation unto God from the world.

This is where God makes holy the sanctified sinner. You, see the moment we trusts in Christ we donÂ’t immediately become holy and godly perfectly. There are still traces of sin in us. God through His Holy Spirit does this character Â‘cleansingÂ’ in us. The Holy Spirit makes us like Him, holy. He is right there in us, working in us that we be holy. He is the One that gives us godly and holy desires, enabling and empowering us to live godly and holy lives only if we would just cooperate with Him. ThatÂ’s His part.<br><br>But before we think that holiness and godliness is something that we could just sit around and wait for it to drop on our lap, Peter gives us our side of sanctification.<br><br>5  But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge,<br><br>6 to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness,<br><br>7 to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness.<br><br>Peter says words that imply discipline: Â‘giving all diligence add to yourÂ….Â’ Yup, we must work to be holy. We must train ourselves to be holy. We must be diligent to be holy. We must be willing to be led by the Holy Spirit in His training for holiness. In justification, it is a work of one. God solely justifies us on the basis of our being in Christ. In sanctification [progressive], the work is of cooperation. We must submit our wills to the Holy Spirit. In any kind of sport, you wonÂ’t be in tip-top shape if you donÂ’t cooperate with the trainer.<br><br>God doesnÂ’t just want you to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, He wants you to be like Him. He doesnÂ’t just want you to have faith in Christ, He wants you to add to that faith the godly virtues of Christ.<br><br>5  But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge,<br><br>6 to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness,<br><br>7 to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love<br><br>Holiness does not only require time, it requires your DILIGENT EFFORTS. If you complain that you have been praying to God to change you and you still havenÂ’t got it yet. Ask yourself: Â“am I giving all my diligent efforts in it? Or am I just sitting around waiting for it to drop from heaven?Â” The trainer is always in the gym. Have you been diligent in going there?<br><br><span class="large"></span><span class="normal"></span></div>
