            <div class='col-md body'>Maasailand, a region in southern Kenya, was facing severe hardship. ThatÂ’s where a man named Joseph experienced firsthand both the joy and the cost of living generously. A long drought had made farming nearly impossible, and the lack of water had killed much of the livestock. Desperate for work, Joseph left home, hoping that he would find a means to support himself. He ended up in Nairobi, with a church community that helped him with food and a place to stay.<br><br>The church was attempting to raise funds for a new building, and the pastor challenged the congregation to give sacrificially. Joseph wanted to give, but he had nothing to contribute. He didnÂ’t have even one coin, or bread, or anything to place before God.<br><br>As Joseph wept at the churchÂ’s altar, he remembered that he actually did have a few possessions. He had his clothes. Leaving his shirt and coat at the altar, he walked away with nothing but an undershirt, his trousers, and his one pair of shoes.<br><br>JosephÂ’s story is similar to the woman in Bethany who washed JesusÂ’ feet with her hair and perfume. Both the woman and Joseph gave what they hadÂ—not under duress or out of an attempt to earn some favor from God. It was done simply, quietly, lavishly. They knew something I often forget: God is worth everything, even the shirt off my back.<br><br>At the time, Joseph didnÂ’t tell anyone about his actÂ—not even God. He thought that asking God to replace his coat and shirt would undermine the gift. GodÂ’s generosity, however, was not to be outmatched. Within days, He provided new clothes for Joseph.<br><br>Such actsÂ—shirts given and perfume poured outÂ—reveal the generous depths of the heart (Matthew 26:7). Are we willing to literally give the shirtÂ—or coatÂ—off our back? Â—Winn Collier<br><br>bottom line: Generosity is a reflection of the heart.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Matthew 26:6-13</span><br>6 While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, 7 a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on His head as He was reclining at the table. 8 When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. Â“Why this waste?Â” they asked. 9 Â“This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.Â” 10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, Â“Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to Me. 11 The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me. 12 When she poured this perfume on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial. 13 I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is Jesus the Only Way?<br><br>Rabbi Schmuley Boteach says, Â“I am absolutely against any religion that says that one faith is superior to another. I donÂ’t see how that is anything different than spiritual racism. ItÂ’s a way of saying that we are closer to God than you, and thatÂ’s what leads to hatred.Â”<br><br>Acts 3:14-20 and John 14:6 are viewed as arrogant, narrow-minded, and the epitome of bigotry by some people. In a day of religious pluralism and tolerance, this exclusivity claim is politically incorrect. Professor Rosemary Radford labeled it Â“absurd religious chauvinism,Â” while one Jewish rabbi called it a Â“spiritual dictatorshipÂ” that fosters the kind of smug and superior attitude that can lead to hatred and violence toward people who believe differently.<br><br>So, on what basis do we believe JesusÂ’ claim in John 14:6 to be true?<br><br>Â•Jesus is unique in His qualification. Peter proclaimed Jesus as the Â“Holy and Righteous OneÂ” (Acts 3:14), the Â“Author of lifeÂ” (v.15). He is the One the prophets foretold (v.1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. He is the Christ (v.20). He is the One whom the early church worshiped as God.<br><br>Â•Jesus is unique in His work. Jesus is the one who brings salvation. Other religious leaders are considered simply as teachers or prophets. But Jesus saves us from our guilt, from the addictive power of sin, and from the judgment we all deserve.<br><br>Â•Jesus is unique in His resurrection. Peter described Him as the one Â“whom God raised from the deadÂ” (Acts 4:10). The resurrection of Jesus lies at the heart of the Christian faith. Jesus is alive today, and we can know Him.<br><br>All truth is, by definition, exclusive. If truth does not exclude, no assertion of a truth claim can be made. The clear implication of JesusÂ’ statement Â“I am the way and the truth and the lifeÂ” is that anything that contradicts what He said is false.<br><br>We must show His love to all people, but we must also proclaim His truth. Â—Marvin Williams<br><br>bottom line: Jesus is the source of all truth.<br><br>Acts 3:14-20<br>14 You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. 15 You killed the Author of life, but God raised Him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. 16 By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is JesusÂ’ name and the faith that comes through Him that has given this complete healing to him, as you can all see. 17 Now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. 18 But this is how God fulfilled what He had foretold through all the prophets, saying that His Christ would suffer. 19 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, 20 and that He may send the Christ, who has been appointed for youÂ—even Jesus.<br><br>John 14:6<br>Jesus answered, Â“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A robber in England made a really poor choice in clothing. The bumbling thief wore a Glasgow Rangers soccer team jersey with his last name spelled out in large letters on the back!<br><br>Surveillance cameras recorded images of the guy committing his holdupÂ—and his name. One policeman noted, Â“[This guy] is obviously a million miles away from being a criminal mastermind.Â”<br><br>So, what do our clothes say about us? ThereÂ’s a reason we wear what we wear.<br><br>One reason may be to make a statement. But if our attire is Â“shoutingÂ” immodestyÂ—thatÂ’s the wrong message. We might as well have our name written on the back of our shirt with a few other words like Â“looseÂ” or Â“thought-life destroyerÂ” or Â“playboy.Â”<br><br>Music artist Rebecca St. James, known for her love for Jesus, recently said, Â“Modesty is . . . purity in action. ItÂ’s that heart commitment coming out in the way that youÂ’re livingÂ—the decisions youÂ’re making in what you wear. And I think some girls say, Â‘Yes, IÂ’m waiting. IÂ’m a virgin,Â’ and theyÂ’re hardly wearing anything.<br><br>Â“I like to wear . . . things that are modest and are not showing too much flesh and are not too tight. ItÂ’s a worthwhile battle, because I so believe in . . . not causing my brothers in Christ to struggle and lust.Â”<br><br>RebeccaÂ’s insights are not for females only. To honor God, women and men should dress in a way that will not cause members of the opposite sex to stumble.<br><br>Paul wrote, Â“Put to death . . . impurity, lustÂ” (Colossians 3:5). This means we are literally to wipe out impure stuff from our lives. If weÂ’re dressing in a way that causes others to have impure thoughts about us, weÂ’ve failed themÂ—and God.<br><br>The Â“clothingÂ” (v.12) other people should see is the beauty of Jesus and His character radiating from our face and actions. Modesty is part of that beautiful attire. Â—Tom Felten<br><br>bottom line: Dress for success? Modesty is best.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Colossians 3:5-12</span><br>5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 6 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. 7 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 8 But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 9 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 11 Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all. 12 Therefore, as GodÂ’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Handyman Genius<br><br>My father-in-law Pete is a genius. No, he didnÂ’t develop the theory of relativity. That was Einstein. He didnÂ’t write a brilliant tragedy. That was Shakespeare.<br><br>His genius is that of a gifted handyman. Just ask him about the ailing furnace or how to free up a stuck garbage disposal. His experience and intuition help him diagnose the problem and solution long before repairs take place. When my wifeÂ’s parents are due for another visit, itÂ’s not hard to turn it into a version of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.<br><br>Those of us who are not gifted with a mechanical aptitude are often mystified by the technical problem-solving of those who are. They have a gift we donÂ’t have. Yet we can learn from them. When Pete is showing me how to do something, I sometimes take notes. HeÂ’s equipping me to do the repairs on my own.<br><br>In the church we have spiritual leaders whose job it is to help equip us for ministry. In PaulÂ’s epistle to the church at Ephesus, he wrote about the equipping process: Â“It was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare [equip] GodÂ’s people for works of serviceÂ” (Ephesians 4:11-12).<br><br>The word used here for Â“equipÂ” is the same one used for the disciples mending their nets when Jesus called them into service (Mark 1:16-20). In their vocation as fishermen, the disciples understood that holes in the net meant losing fish. For the next few years, Jesus would mend holes in their ministry nets so they could be effective Â“fishers of men.Â”<br><br>If you donÂ’t know how to serve Jesus in a certain ministry, find someone who can fill in the gap. Watch how they use the Word, how they pray, and the way they work with people. Soon you will find that the Lord is using you more effectively in othersÂ’ lives. You just need to be equipped. Â—Dennis Fisher<br><br>bottom line: Get equipped to serve.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark 1:16-20</span><br>16 As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 17 Â“Come, follow Me,Â” Jesus said, Â“and I will make you fishers of men.Â” 18 At once they left their nets and followed Him. 19 When He had gone a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. 20 Without delay He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ephesians 4:11-16</span><br>11 It was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, 12 to prepare GodÂ’s people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. . . . 15 Speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is the Head, that is, Christ. 16 From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Heart of Grace<br><br>I wandered around the crowded restaurant looking for an empty table to put down the plate I had filled from the breakfast buffet. Finally, I spotted a couple sitting alone. I approached and asked if they would share their table. Soon my husband Tom arrived and we introduced ourselves to the couple and began to chat. As we completed our meal and the guys continued to talk, Grace leaned over to me and said softly, Â“Do you love Jesus?Â”<br><br>I responded with my biggest smile, Â“Yes, I do love Jesus.Â”<br><br>Now, we both smiled. We had made a connection and started talking easily about our mutual faith. We ended up spending a couple of hours together that morning as Grace told us how she had converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1987, how her husband had been saved, and how God had restored their rocky marriage.<br><br>As I thought about our conversation later, I wondered if it had taken any courage for her to ask me that question in that way. After all, she could have asked a Â“saferÂ” question: Â“Do you go to church?Â” or Â“Do you believe in God?Â” But Grace got right to the point. Â“Do you love Jesus?Â” It hadnÂ’t taken any courage for me to respond to GraceÂ’s question. After all, I knew I was in friendly territory.<br><br>In John 18, we read that after Jesus was arrested and was being treated brutally, His disciple and good friend Peter claimed that he didnÂ’t even know Him! Not just once, but three times. How often have believers in Jesus thought, I would never have done that! But for those of us who do not live in societies where Christians are persecuted, little is to be feared by stating that we love Jesus.<br><br>For us, courage lies more in our willingness to ask the question. Too many times, we hold back in apprehensionÂ—afraid of what? Offending? Embarrassing ourselves or the other person? Or maybe not wanting to abruptly end a pleasant conversation?<br><br>Not Grace though. Her courageous question reflected what flowed from her heart. The love and grace of Jesus. Â—Cindy Kasper<br><br>bottom line: Do you love Jesus?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">John 18:12-27</span><br><br>12 The detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound Him 13 and brought Him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. . . . 15 Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priestÂ’s courtyard, 16 but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in. 17 Â“You are not one of His disciples, are you?Â” the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, Â“I am not.Â” . . . 25 As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, Â“You are not one of His disciples, are you?Â” He denied it, saying, Â“I am not.Â” 26 One of the high priestÂ’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, Â“DidnÂ’t I see you with Him in the olive grove?Â” 27 Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dangerous Hope<br><br>I have recently faced a disconcerting personal reality: I am a cynic.<br><br>As I explored the whys of my sin, I became convinced that a cynic is one who has been wounded by hope, who has, as Solomon put it, had Â“hope deferred.Â” A deferred hope is one that has been dashed against the bitter cliffs of disappointed dreams and unfulfilled expectations.<br><br>The wisdom writer said, Â“Hope deferred makes the heart sickÂ” (Proverbs 13:12). Wisdom indeed!<br><br>Hope is a powerful emotion, but unfortunately, it ebbs and flows. At times ecstatic joy springs up in our heart, and hope flourishes. In other moments, distressing realities overcome us and hope languishes.<br><br>This dichotomy we live inÂ—between a flourishing and a languishing hopeÂ—is a normal part of the human condition. The tragedy, however, is when hope is not merely muffled but snuffed out altogether. Some of us have been disappointed one time too many. The pain of hoping has grown too difficult, and we have believed a fatal lie: Hoping is more dangerous than the dispassionate safety of never hoping at all.<br><br>When we believe this lie, we relinquish passion, desire, and a vibrant life. We become cynics and try to cut off hope before it can ever take root, before it can ever disappoint again. We nurture the belief that what we have experienced is all we will ever experience, and we opt for a safe, thin, and ultimately hollow existence.<br><br>Solomon reminded the cynic: Â“Longing fulfilled is a tree of lifeÂ” (Proverbs 13:12). The antidote to disappointed hopes is to open up space for desire, to make room for it . . . to hope for it. To hope in God.<br><br>ItÂ’s dangerous. The disappointment will escalate, and the price will be costly. But this risky hope is the only way to live out GodÂ’s destiny for us. Â—Winn Collier<br><br>bottom line: Live dangerouslyÂ—hope.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proverbs 13:12-16,19</span><br><br>12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life. 13 He who scorns instruction will pay for it, but he who respects a command is rewarded. 14 The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, turning a man from the snares of death. 15 Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the unfaithful is hard. 16 Every prudent man acts out of knowledge, but a fool exposes his folly. 19 A longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest turning from evil.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Feeling Intimidated?<br><br>People respond in different ways when theyÂ’re intimidated. Some look for easy escapeÂ—thinking that running away is the best option. Others employ the strategy of counterattack. Their best defense is offense. And others flare up with an outburst of negative emotions. They use strong words and body language to display their displeasure. So, which is the best response to pressureÂ—running, fighting, or reacting?<br><br>Timothy was under intense intimidation as a young pastor of a church. People were opposing his ministry. It must have been difficult for him to respond in the right way to those individuals. In PaulÂ’s letter to Timothy, he told him how to utilize the God-given Â“spirit of power, of love, and of self-disciplineÂ” (2 Timothy 1:7).<br><br>First, Timothy did not have to run, because God had given him Â“a spirit of power.Â” There was no situation in which God had put him that He hadnÂ’t also given him the ability to persevere. No matter how difficult the problems and people were, there was always a way of facing them with GodÂ’s perspective. Moving away from a difficulty for a while may be useful, but it ought to be revisited and resolved.<br><br>Second, Timothy didnÂ’t need to fight, because God had given him Â“a spirit of love.Â” There is often this tendency to fight and hurt the person who first hurts us. Timothy, however, understood GodÂ’s love, and sought the good of others. It would be difficult, but not impossible.<br><br>Last, Timothy didnÂ’t have to react negatively, because God had given him Â“a spirit of self-discipline.Â” A disciplined life and a sound mind will keep one from sudden ungodly outbursts of emotion. Instead, a person who possesses them will exhibit good judgmentÂ—even under extreme pressure.<br><br>LetÂ’s learn to exhibit courage, express love, and exercise good judgment when we are intimidatedÂ—thatÂ’s GodÂ’s way to handle it. Â—Lim Chien Chong<br><br>bottom line: Intimidation shows the cracks in our character.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 Timothy 1:1-7</span><br><br>1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, 2 To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 3 I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. 4 Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. 5 I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also. 6 For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 7 For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love, and of self-discipline.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Disappearing Daddy<br><br>A friend of mine takes his two daughters to play at the park near his house nearly every evening. Daddy watches as the older girl rides her bicycle around the park with her sister sitting behind her. The older girl is warned by her father not to pedal out of his sight. The playful girl, however, often fails to heed his words.<br><br>One day, my friend decided to teach his older daughter a lesson. When the girls rode away, he hid himself so that they couldnÂ’t find him. At first, the girls were happily cycling. But when they suddenly realized that Daddy was out of sight, the older girl started to panic and began to cry. She thought they were lost.<br><br>That was their fatherÂ’s cue to leave his hiding place. He hugged his girls, and explained why he had done his disappearing act. The next time they were at the park, the girls didnÂ’t ride too far away. The older girl smiled at her father and said, Â“Daddy, today I am being your obedient little girl.Â”<br><br>This incident reminds me of the way God disciplines us as a father disciplines his child. Sometimes it may seem as though He has disappeared from our lives. In reality, we have turned from Him and He has given us over to our own devices. He turns the blessing of His face away. He does this so we will learn our lesson and stop going our own way.<br><br>In Hebrews 12 weÂ’re urged, Â“Do not make light of the LordÂ’s discipline, and do not lose heart when He rebukes you, because the Lord disciplines those He lovesÂ” (vv.5-6). Rather, we should focus on the fact that His discipline molds our character (vv.10-11).<br><br>When we go through trials or temptations, we should always look to God and ask Him what He wants us to learn. Such times may seem painful but only for a short while. If we respond in the right way, it will help us mature in our faith. Â—Joanna Lim<br><br>bottom line: GodÂ’s silence may signal our need to repent.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hebrews 12:5-11</span><br><br>5 And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons: Â“My son, do not make light of the LordÂ’s discipline, and do not lose heart when He rebukes you, 6 because the Lord disciplines those He loves, and He punishes everyone He accepts as a son.Â” 7 Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 8 If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 9 Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! 10 Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in His holiness. 11 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spiritual Reupholstering</span></strong><br><br>When my wife and I bought a home 5 years ago, the former owner was in a hurry to hit the road. For whatever reason, he left us six attractive dining room chairs. We appreciated the unexpected gift and have used them often while entertaining guests.<br><br>Now that we have moved into a new home, these treasured chairs need a makeover to fit into the new color scheme. We needed the help of a competent upholsterer. Over the phone I asked him, Â“CouldnÂ’t you just put the new material over the chair?Â” He responded, Â“No, that wouldnÂ’t work. You will ruin the shape of the chair if you put new material over it.Â” A good upholsterer insists on tearing the chair down to its fundamentals and putting on new material.<br><br>That reminds me of the work of God in our spiritual growth. He isnÂ’t interested in taking our human efforts and improving on themÂ—in covering them over. The old sin nature actually has the ability to perform religious activity, but that isnÂ’t the work of the Holy Spirit (Romans 10:1-3). Instead, God intends to replace our character with whatÂ’s called Â“the new man.Â”<br><br>Paul understood the replacement principle in becoming like Jesus. His wording sounds like putting on new clothes. Â“Put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holinessÂ” (Ephesians 4:24). As we exchange our old attitudes, thoughts, speech, and behavior for that of Jesus-life, we find an amazing exchange taking place (Isaiah 40:31).<br><br>Inside each of us is the drive to Â“be good enoughÂ” in our own strength. Instead, God wants to reupholster us with the new man, made in the image of Him who designed itÂ—Jesus Himself. We do this by laying aside our old behaviors and yielding our hearts to the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:16; Ephesians 5:18 ). LetÂ’s put on the new self. Â—Dennis Fisher<br><br>bottom line: Put off the oldÂ—put on the new.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ephesians 4:17-24</span><br><br>17 So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 18 They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 19 Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more. 20 You, however, did not come to know Christ that way. 21 Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. 22 You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 23 to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reasons for All Those Names (Journey Thru 1 Chronicles)<br><br>Dalton Conley is a sociologist at New York University. He and his wife Natalie Jeremijenko have two children. They recently sought permission with the city of New York to change their 4-year-old sonÂ’s name to Yo Xing Heyno Augustus Eisner Alexander Weiser Knuckles Jeremijenko-Conley. Actually, a lot of that name was already his, but his parents added three more middle names. The little boy suggested two of the names, including Knuckles, the name of his fatherÂ’s childhood dog.<br><br>The boyÂ’s father, Dalton, explained that there are specific reasons for all those namesÂ—from honoring ancestors to setting expectations. At home, the boy with the lengthy title is known as Yo, and his sister is simply E.<br><br>The list of names in the first nine chapters of 1 Chronicles may seem like a bunch of long, boring, unpronounceable, meaningless names. These names, however, serve two practical purposes:<br><br>Â• Genealogies were important in providing the framework within which true Hebrews could establish their family roots, and by which religious purity could be maintained against outside influences.<br><br>Â• For us, these names reflect GodÂ’s providential design. Particular names (from Adam to Asher, including Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David) serve as reminders of GodÂ’s dealings in the past and the hope for the future Messiah. When we read these names, we can remember how GodÂ’s grace, love, mercy, care, discipline, and patience were evident among His people. When we come to these names in the Bible, we shouldnÂ’t skim over them; we should let the Holy Spirit remind us of GodÂ’s faithfulness to His promises and to His people.<br><br>As you contemplate your own family heritage, think of ways you can provide a positive spiritual foundation for generations to come. Spend time with other family members identifying spiritual markers in your familyÂ’s life. As you identify these markers, you will be able to see GodÂ’s providence and purposes in living color.

He was grounded from his bike for a weekÂ—no discussions. His mom was angry that he deliberately did something so dangerous. His disobedience was too much for her to brush off lightly.<br><br>The disobedience of Uzzah had inescapable consequences too. As the Israelites were bringing back the ark of the covenant, Uzzah put out his hand to steady it. When he touched the ark of God, he died immediately.<br><br>ItÂ’s easy to wonder why God got so angry with Uzzah, a man who apparently was simply trying to help. But it was pride that caused him to reach out for the ark. He thought he could get around GodÂ’s restriction (Exodus 25:12-15) and that somehow God Â“neededÂ” him to help steady the ark.<br><br>Our pride is the source of our disobedience to God too, and it can carry some serious consequences. Broken relationships, loss of a job, illness, and even death are just a few of the ways we may have to suffer if we try to make life work without relying on God, and living in humility and obedience to Him.<br><br>ItÂ’s important to fully understand what Uzzah did. He disobeyed God, who is kind, compassionate, merciful, and loving. HeÂ’s also holy. HeÂ’s God. HeÂ’s in controlÂ—we are not. He makes the rules, we donÂ’t.<br><br>ItÂ’s as clear for us as it should have been for UzzahÂ—we are to follow GodÂ’s plan in obedience. LetÂ’s live humbly and obediently before our Creator God.

So he died there before God. 11 Then David was angry because the LordÂ’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah. 12 David was afraid of God that day and asked, Â“How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*this post is for the 17th March*<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Got Kosher Yosher? (Journey Thru 1 Chronicles)</strong></span><br><br>IsraelÂ’s King David was concerned about being kosher and about having yosher.<br><br>The words not only rhyme, theyÂ’re related. For followers of the Levitical laws given by God to Moses, to do something Â“kosherÂ” is to do whatÂ’s fit and proper. But in his prayer, as he handed over the reign to Solomon, the aging King David was concerned that God would find integrity in his sonÂ’s heart. The Hebrew word for Â“integrityÂ” is yosher. To Â“have yosherÂ” meant that you did things straightÂ—you did what was right.<br><br>I have three sons. If I were to pray over them in a similar way as David did over Solomon, it would sound something like this:<br><br>Father in heaven, You alone are great.<br><br>Victory, power, glory, and majesty are only in You.<br><br>You made everything, so You own all things.<br><br>Whatever we give has always belonged to You.<br><br>We canÂ’t outgive You. We remember that life is short,<br><br>so help us make the years count for You.<br><br>Make us people of integrityÂ—<br><br>doing what YouÂ’ve taught us is right.<br><br>May we always act with godly motives.<br><br>And, Father, give my children a desire to obey You.<br><br>May their love for You never die. Keep them loyal to You.<br><br>I pray that theyÂ’ll continue always in Your serviceÂ—<br><br>giving You the praise and honor<br><br>for anything accomplished. Amen.<br><br>When David finished his prayer, Â“they all praised the Lord, the God of their fathers; they bowed low and fell prostrate before the Lord and the kingÂ” (1 Chronicles 29:20). Bowing is a kosher thing that compels us to see ourselves as servants.<br><br>When God looks within us, letÂ’s pray that HeÂ’ll find yosherÂ—that HeÂ’ll see us as people of integrity. Â—Dean Ohlman<br><br>bottom line: Integrity makes the smallest acts significant.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 Chronicles 29:16-20</span><br><br>16 O Lord our God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building You a temple for Your Holy Name, it comes from Your hand, and all of it belongs to You. 17 I know, my God, that You test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly Your people who are here have given to You. 18 O Lord, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of Your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to You. 19 And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep Your commands, requirements, and decrees, and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided. 20 Then David said to the whole assembly, Â“Praise the Lord your God.Â” So they all praised the Lord, the God of their fathers; they bowed low and fell prostrate before the Lord and the king.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Living Dangerously<br><br>IÂ’ve been living dangerously. Two years ago I let my anti-virus software subscription expire. Nothing bad happened, so I didnÂ’t renew it. After a few close calls, however, I finally decided IÂ’d better get it up to date.<br><br>Unbelievably, the very day I loaded and registered my new protection software, my computer was hijacked by spyware. I spent weeks trying to get rid of the invaderÂ—and trying to process my emotions. I felt as if IÂ’d been deceived. The product promising protection had made me vulnerable instead.<br><br>I considered removing the software, hoping I could return everything to normal. Before doing that, however, I made a discovery. The hijacker had not invaded my computer the day I loaded the software. Instead, the software I loaded that day simply blew the cover of the hijacker that had been lurking there, secretly performing its insidious work.<br><br>Something similar happens when we live dangerously in our spiritual lives. We drift away from God without any noticeable consequences. Assuming that our careless lifestyle makes no difference, we wander furtherÂ—until a few close calls scare us into renewing our relationship with God. But then suddenly life collapses, and we feel deceived. We turned to God expecting protection but got trouble instead. Slowly we realize that turning back to God doesnÂ’t automatically undo damage that started as a result of bad choices made while we were away from Him.<br><br>Even more important to realize, though, is that God is more than a spiritual firewall against harm. He has a purpose for His people above and beyond helping us avoid trouble. Through the prophet Isaiah, God told His people that He wanted them to be His partners in protecting others from trouble (58:6).<br><br>If all we want from God is protection from danger, weÂ’ll miss the important purpose God has for usÂ—the opportunity to be His partners in saving the world from real danger.

Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord? 6 Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? 7 Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelterÂ—when you see the naked, to clothe him, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood? 8 Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard. 9 Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry for help, and He will say: Here am I.</div>
