The fact that fearing hell and personal salvation isnt the main purpose - but an awareness of God, means that the approach to searching for new converts work on very different levels. Even in a state of missionary inactivity, it is not hypocrisy since in the first place Muslims arent allowed to judge who or who is destined to heaven or hell including among the unbelievers - for there is one examplar tradition that asserts a prostitue secured her place in heaven by saving the life of a dog dying from thirst in the desert.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, all unbelievers will go to hell - except that if they had been forgiven by God. Like the story above attested, we will never know their eventual place in the eyes of God, so it is an expression of vanity for us Muslims to judge somebody's worth. There are a few more traditions that asserts it,<br><br>A man saw a thorny branch from the road and removed it from the way. God became pleased by his action, forgave him and will bring him into paradise.<br><br>A poor mother with her daughters had some dates. She gave each to them, then brought hers to her mouth to eat it but her daughters wanted that also. She consequently divides the date she intended to eat between them. When the Prophet's wife related this scene to him, he said that God assured her paradise upon that act and rescued her from hellfire.<br><br>The thing to note is those acts arent related creed/beliefs, consciously thinking the consequences of heareafter or wanting to touch somebody's life. It was spontaneous moments where simple humanity was shown.<br><br>To add on, there are many planes of unbelief in Islam and to punish people for failing to accept a message that they know nothing about or that was inadequately delivered is utterly contrary to the divine mercy. Besides, the People of the Book, those who follow the scrolls of Abraham, the Torah and Gospels are spared from hell as well. So when the Christian does his/her missionary work, then good, go on, you are saving people by the way of Jesus. Lastly we do not subscribe to a permanent Hell, as it has been said, "A time will come in Hell when not a single man would be left in it."<br><br>Thus proselytizing isnt on the Muslims agenda at all but merely da'wah, a calling and invitation. Well now, Ill bow out of this discussion, just wanted to clear things out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, here again. *Slaps forehead* I have a feeling thats implying Allah can accept another God. But it is not so. The Quran nor any knowledgeable Muslim will never speak that the Books of Jews and Christians do not contain Truth. Its just that the Quran has superseeded, if i may say, a distortion of the true message. So this does not in any way invalidate the essence of Truth that is still remaining the Books.<br><br>*{Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.}*<br><br>*{Say: "O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you; that we worship none but God; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, lords and patrons other than God." If then they turn back, say ye: "Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to God's will].}*<br><br>*{…and you will certainly find the nearest in friendship to those who believe [to be] those who say: “We are Christians,” because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant.}*<br><br>Pardon me again for straying off course of this topic.</div>
