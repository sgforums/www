            <div class='col-md body'>may i add in...<br><br>Actually the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32) should answer the issue mentioned.  The act of murder is not doubt evil and heinous.  Certainly it's unforgivable to many.<br><br>If we view ourselves (everyone) as a child of God and look at how God is to us a parent, then we may get an idea why a murderer can be forgiven.  In many cases, parents are most willing to forgive their children when they acknowledge their wrongdoings.  Similiarly, if one truly repents before God, he will be forgiven.<br><br>The judgment of heaven and hell is directed to our rebellion against God.  Sin, no matter thievery, lies, murder, betrayal or any other forms is still regarded a sin to Him.  So if you have murdered, but in the end repented of your old ways and begin to walk in His ways.. then yes, you will go to heaven..  But if you call yourself a christian and wear a cross because it's cool and hip, then you've got it all wrong..<br><br>surely it's not fair to the family whose loved one was murdered.. but if one chooses to hold on to their grievances and not forgive.. Then this hate will also eat them up slowly.. no real act of punishment will ever be sufficient for them.. even if the murderer was torn up a million times, they will still not find justice..  justice in one sense comes with acceptance..<br><br>i think we are digressing from the first post?  i think many christians approach preaching in many ways. it can't be simply be put into (only) the two categories mentioned. maybe some tortured souls like to be force-fed.. but i think they are the minority <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
