This is not new and not uncommon today.<br><br>In the first place,<br>What is hypocrite?<br>A:Hypocrite is a person who indulges in hypocrisy.<br><br>And what is hypocrisy?<br>A: It is the practice of claiming to have higher standards or beliefs than is the case.<br><br>According to the definition above, I don't think group 2 are hypocrites. God make everybody unique. As you have said, grp 1 is more direct and vocal while the group 2 is more diplomatic. They just have different personalites and according to the faith they have, they serve God. Even among the apostles, not everyone is the same. You notice that in their books. For example, John focus more on relationship and love and also Jesus.  You can notice the different personalities among the over 40 authors of the bible as you study the bible.<br><br>As you study the bible, you may notice the different personalitites of each characters in the bible:<br>John the Baptise was eccentric to say the least,<br>Jonah was reluctant,<br>Thomas had doubts,<br>Timothy was timid,<br>Peter was impulsive and hot-tempered,<br>and so on ........<br><br>but God used each of them in His service.<br><br>I shall quote some verses for you:<br><br>It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. (Ephesians 4: 11-13)<br><br>27Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. 28And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. 29Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues[d]? Do all interpret? 31But eagerly desire[e] the greater gifts. ........(1 Corinthians 12: 27-30)<br><br>1Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. 2We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check. (James 3:1-2)<br><br>In conclusion, I still have to stress that God make each of us unique and "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28 )" All who believe in Him are called to serve Him differently according to the different personalities we have and the amount of faith we have. We don't have to imitate each other.<br><br>Rick Warren, The Purpose-Driven Life,<br>"You Were Shaped for Serving God."</div>

Because if you don't, you are going to hell. Your current fancies are errant. The only way to salvation is through Him. Accept Allah and you will be saved!", what will be your thoughts?<br><br>Before you speculate like above, try instead to understand the framework of other religions. Unlike Christianity, the other Abrahamic religions isnt much concerned with heaven and hell or of personal salvation as the only primary objective. It places too much emphasis upon one's personal spiritual expectation and maybe of others. This little story says it well.<br><br>A Yeshiva student approached a Rabbi. He said, "Rabbi I have a terrible problem." "What is your problem son?" "I no longer am able to believe in God." The Rabbi thinks about this and responds: "All right, but what does this have to do with being a good Jew?"<br><br>happyharvest has insight.

If not Jesus died for us is in vain! Remember the one who was crucified with Jesus. Initially, he despised Jesus and asked Jesus to proof himself.

Unlike Christianity, the other Abrahamic religions isnt much concerned with heaven and hell or of personal salvation as the only primary objective. It places too much emphasis upon one's personal spiritual expectation and maybe of others. This little story says it well.<br><br>A Yeshiva student approached a Rabbi. He said, "Rabbi I have a terrible problem." "What is your problem son?" "I no longer am able to believe in God." The Rabbi thinks about this and responds: "All right, but what does this have to do with being a good Jew?"<br><br>happyharvest has insight.
