Jesus Christ even challenged some of the rules stated in the OT when He spoke out against the Pharisees.<br><br>Basically, the OT is divided into the 5 books of the Pentateuch, which the Jews (practitioners of Judaisim) follow religious, the books of poetry/wisdom ie Psalms, Proverbs, Songs, Ecclesiastes, and then there are the historical books of Judges, Samuel, Chronicles and Kings, to be followed by the prophetic books, both major and minor prophets.<br><br>Books of laws as I'd mentioned are the rules for the Jews, these are probably practical if we were alive back then with regards to how we should live, but these are probably irrelevant in this present times;<br>Books of history provides us a glimpse of life in the OT, maybe even learning the culture of the middle east at the time, one only need to refer to a non-religious history book to validate if these are true or not;<br>Books of poetry is like wise saying that may be useful for some level of practical living (doesn't even need to be religious to follow them);<br>Books of prophets is a pronouncement of the future for the people in OT. Some prophecy came true and others are waiting to happen.<br><br>When everything is over in Malachi, it's over. The old covenant has passed and the new covenant arrived in John.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The laws which I have stated r explicitly mentioned by God himself to tell to the people. They r not laws added by the jews. From Deuteronomy 1-12, they r telling people the importance of the laws and from DT 13 onwards they r telling wat laws have to be followed, from moses mouth it was "laws", "decree" "commands" and he say it came from "God"/"Lord". Jesus says the law has to be followed, and the things listed in deuteronomy r part of the old laws. They were really followed and they were supposedly from god. Now u r forsaking it and claim they r jewish laws. Why don't u read the whole deuteronomy and tell me again why do u think these laws were not laws or why these laws were only made by jewish for jewish, not made by god for its people. After he finished saying all the laws for tat day, he climb down the hill, god is suppose to be pleased and show him a vision of the land his decendents is gonna get befiore he die. DT 33</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your reasoning not much better also, imho  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>There are no serious errors in SIS's logical deduction. His logical reasoning reads perfectly fine to me, though the premises could be debated. He was trying to show an internal inconsistency in the text.<br><br>SIS's technique is of a higher level than you. You made bold assumptions which you need to justify to a court of non believers. SIS just used "scripture to fight scripture".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

If they don't follow then they r not following god's orders  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>speaking about tat it bring me to the earlier statement tat<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">OT is totally impossible to follow in today's society, but the bible states tat it is very important and all its rules had to be kept. Most christians and catholic now simply turn a blind eye to a huge portion of it. IMO it do give the impression tat the bible is faulty and not perfect. </span><br><br>I don't know... I thought it is really obvious tat the bible do contains a lot of errors and contradictions... I mean even the 2 chapter of genesis there is already a contradiction of whether men is formed before animals or formed after animals. God even say make men in "our" image in genesis 1 which made me wonder how many gods r there as well....</div>

Jewish sources explain the  "us" to refer to God and His angels. Both faith agree that angels were created before mankind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I expected tis answer but it is just tat the idea of trinity makes it not really a single god but multiple ones. I mean <span style="font-style: italic;">single means one</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">multiple means not single</span>. There can't have a <span style="font-style: italic;">single</span> being tat is actually <span style="font-style: italic;">multiples</span>. Sounds more like a name for an organisation than an individual.<br><br>Just a question though, if god have many angels, does tis make it similar to the taoist idea of heaven where there r many many different deities and a ruler among them (jade emperor) So wat about saints ? If they goes to heaven now, then it really makes it similar to chinese mythology where Guan Yu, a famos general can goes there to become a deity as well...<br><br>Never mind, i guess tis is a pretty silly topic to debate about.<br><br></div>
