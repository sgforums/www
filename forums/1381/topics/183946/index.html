            <div class='col-md body'>This is more a question about history than religion.<br><br>See I was just thinking, during WW2 Italy was facist for most of it.

Did facist italy invade or threaten to invade the Vatican? Was some sort of pact or truce signed? And who was the pope during WW2?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting question. But isn't the Vatician city always operating as a separate city and the ruler is the pope and his council. THe Pope is highly respected in Italy and he dont usually interfere with politics because of these he shld be save during the war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hard to say. Popes have been heavily involved in politics and international affairs in the past, and they certainly have been threatened and even murdered in the past. Of course in more recent times, things have gotten more toned down. But u can never tell with those crazy facists, who knows they might have thought that they could use the Vatican to further their cause.</div>

I think, for whatever non-interference stance the Vatican took during WW2, and the Holocaust, John Paul has made significant attempt to make up for that mistake during the world war.<br><br>Second issue is on absolving the Jews of crimes towards Jesus, and discontinue the act of stating Christianity as a replacement or continuation of Judaism.<br><br>Frankly, put it this way, Hitler may has his warped views that the Jews were the scourges of Europe, but this view also has it basis in the two millenium prejudice against the Jews, or specifically the believers of Judaism.<br><br>Besides RC, do other churches or denominations ever take a step towards addressing this issue or make reconciliation attempts with the Jews?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Albert Einstein also praised the efforts of Pius XII and the Catholic Church after World War II: "Only the Catholic Church protested against the Hitlerian onslaught on liberty. Up till then I had not been interested in the Church, but today I feel a great admiration for the Church, which alone has had the courage to struggle for spiritual truth and moral liberty." Statement made in 1946 as quoted in Three Popes and the Jews by Pinchas E. Lapide (New York: Hawthorn, 1967), p. 251.<br><br>"The Catholic Church, under the pontificate of Pope Pius XII was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000, Jews from certain death at Nazi hands." **Pinchas E. Lapide, Three Popes and the Jews (1967).<br><br>"No Pope in history has been thanked more heartily by Jews. Upon his death in 1958, several suggested in open letters that a Pope Pius XII forest of 860,000 trees be planted on the hills of Judea in order to fittingly honor the memory of the late Pontiff because the Catholic Church under the pontificate of Pius XII was instrumental in saving the lives of as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands."<br>Pinchas E.
