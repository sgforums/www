              <p>Just a personal observation and no offence to the religion.</p>
              <p>I have been to a few cell group and gathering.</p>

              </p><p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I am just a random passerby that just chanced by this
              forum thread. I am advised against replying this but I am going to do so anyway
              since I am just biding my time.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Let’s start off with this little proclamation that I have: I
              am a Christian and I am damn Proud to be one. Despite the recent spate of
              events involving a few not very politically correct Pastors commenting on other
              branches of religion, my faith has not wavered. I am not going to start this
              thread with rebutting other people threads as you guys have done by flaming
              other people/religion/animals/corporations , let’s start off with the politically
              correct message first which is respecting other people faith and religion. Be
              it that you are a devout Buddhist/Catholic/Taoist, you have a right to practice
              or carry out whatever faith you have. So what if you practiced vampiric druidism
              (go check it out on the net, it is an interesting branch of faith =/), this
              does not give you the right to pass judgement on other faith. In these dark
              times where people can only hang on to tangible things for support, faith
              should be treasured and held on to when everything that you have is gone. By
              flaming other religions, it shows how much respect you have for yourself since
              you don’t even have the ability to respect other things that people treasure.
              As for the article above provided by Chester, shouldn’t we be happy for a
              fellow member of the society regaining his dignity by breaking the bonds of his
              drug habit? Is this the true facade of Singapore society? One where there isn’t
              any genuine love except the superficial one we feel when we have sex? I am not
              even bordering on any theological arguments here, just dwelling on the simple
              fact that we should respect each other’s faith.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span>Regarding all atheists
              and Gnostics out there, with reference to the comment made by <a href="../../../users/268213">LaMutha</a> on the subject of money.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">‘<span style="color: red;">You serious ? Hahaha. If its like
              this no one will want to study liao. Give jesus all your money and BOOM the
              next day your the next bills gate ! AWESOME GOD !<br> </span><br> <span style="color: red;">God keep his word and made that guy richer and richer ?
              DUM DUM ! Its becoz tat guy got wad it takes to earn that money. If you say god
              made him rich den wad is it called ? Black magic ?<br> </span><br> <span style="color: red;">Wake up everyone ! Face it people you got to work your
              ass to get to the top.</span>’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Have you really thought through when you type this? I guess
              the comments that we give when we are anonymous are the truest. I have
              testimonies whereby when Christians that have no money, they have no choice but
              to turn to god and He never fail. The source I am giving to back this up is not
              only my faith but this book as well titled “My Adventure in Faith” by Colton
              Wickramartne. It is about when he was younger and aspiring to be a pastor in
              Sri Lanka yet he has no money pay when he was in bible school. He fasted and
              prayed to god but he didn’t get any answer but what happened in the end is
              quoted in the book chapter 11 page 68 “Sister Pokorney didn’t even write a
              check. She had enclosed American currency and it was a miracle that it got
              through two nations postal departments. Her gift arrived right on time....God
              is never late. He is never early. He is always on time.” This passage left the
              greatest impression on me because this woman Pokorney doesn’t know the person
              Colton and yet God left her an impression upon her to send just this little
              amount of American dollars to him. It is not just pure LUCK that you are healthy
              and fine to the degree that you can sit down and write this crap down, boy. When
              you die , money doesn’t matter anymore, even more so in the face of dwindling
              natural resources that we possess.</p>

              <p>Continuing on from where i left off, regarding to the tithing part. Tithing is not compulsory, its not as if we are forced  to tithe. This is not Scientology that we are talking about. Lets face it , no one is perfect. Humans are not perfect and the organisation or the societal fabric that we weave , corruption is an age old topic, Even as christians , We tithe in good faith. If its to the point where the church misuses it, they are answerable to what they do , not the people that tithe in good faith. We humans are also scammed off money anyway by various ways , through advertisements advocating vices like smoking . Things like prostitution and gambling are also ways that we are scammed off money, we don't see people griping about it.

              <p>Yes, not arguing about beliefs or faiths, but arguing about the church. Do you agree with kong kee that we should donate till our hearts broke ? I mean donate till the point that we dont even have money for dinner. I agree with you that donation is not compulsory. So what are your views on the CHC ? Did you see how kong kee persuaded his followers to donate money ? Do you agree with his methods of asking for money ?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Honestly speaking , as a christian tithing is an act of faith . IF pastor Kong Kee chooses to misuse the funds given to him, he is not only going to be held answerable to the people of the church, not only to the goverment and the people of singapore but to God as well. It is his risks to take and he will definitely suffer if he misuses the funds. Of course you guys have the right to accept whatever faith you are going to practice, but ultimately religious tolerance is the only way to preserve this fragile peace that we take for granted in Singapore.

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>As my name suggest, I'm Samantha.I'm a Christian. After reading your rather insightful post and various replies, I've decided to reply.</p>
              <p>I sincerely apologise for anything that have caused  any of you to have such a negative view of us, Christians.</p>
              <p>It's my personal deepest regret that we're unable to meet you at your point of need, or had attempt to invite you to our fellowship and services purely out of a sense of duty or responsibiltiy.</p>
              <p>May God's peace and joy be in your hearts.</p>
              <p>God bless you.</p>
