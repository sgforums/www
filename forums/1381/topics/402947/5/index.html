              <p>Their attack on me is still ongoing .  They attack on no reasonable ground.   Just because I posted the article by SPH which stated kong hee and ho bought 13 units of condo they don't like it and started to attack.   I have told them to approach SPH , they are just barking at the wrong tree.   </p>
              <p>When I was a christian in the past, I did not behave like them.   I kept peace with non christians.</p>

              <p>I have no respect for this type of christians.    Respect be given to christians who are are pleasant, diplomatic, sensible and mature.    some christians simply go on fight and fight without basing on what god wants from them to attack people, this type of christians without repentence will definitely go to hell.   Have seen a number of this type of christians here in this forum.   evil doing and SElf righteousness are in them and self rigtheousness are sins</p>

              <p>Their attack on me is still ongoing .  They attack on no
              reasonable ground.   Just because I posted the article by
              SPH which stated kong hee and ho bought 13 units of condo they
              don't like it and started to attack.   I have told them
              to approach SPH , they are just barking at the wrong
              tree.   </p>
              <p>When I was a christian in the past, I did not behave like
              them.   I kept peace with non christians.</p>

              <p>let's talk reason before you fall into deeper intellectual sewage.</p>
              <p>if i were to attack u, would u think I would "implore" you to withdraw your statement as that would be the most fitting and honorable thing to do? </p>
              <p>Pointing out your mistake is not an "attack" on you. I'm sure your ego is not as fragile and little as that.</p>
              <p>For the record, the article by SPH did not state that the couple bought 13 units. You misinterpreted the article and repeated your error in several other threads. </p>
              <p>The statement in question, <span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: small; color: #800000;">"One is a group of individuals - including pop star Ho Yeow Sun and her husband, Kong Hee - who own 13 units. All signed the sale deal and said they wanted to participate in the hearing to ensure the sale goes through." </span>Nowhere does it mean that the couple singly owns 13 units. For the sentence to mean that way, you would have to remove the dash punctuations, e.g. "One is a group of individuals, including pop star HYS and her husband KH who own 13 units." So, for the last time, SPH article is correct, your interpretation is wrong - this is not an attack on you. </p>
              <p>If KH did wrong, the law will indict him. No point trying to sully his name and end up tarnishing your own reputation (or jeopardize your own karma), it's not worth it. Don't let your hatred blind you. </p>

              <p>I have meet christians to tell who are the evil and good ones.    Those nice christians will not engage non believers non christians in any attack.    Obviously, you do not like peace and be peaceloving/    For the sake i just posted article on kong hee by SPH you start to attack me tells how evil you are.   For this you definitely have no reasonable ground to accuse me and attack me but you go on with your evil doing.</p>
              <p>If you do not know the verse below then I will say you are a fake evil christian.  It is not whether is agreeable to me or not, it is what jesus said below:</p>
