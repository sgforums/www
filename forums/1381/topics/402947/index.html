              <p>I happen to read this article on why some people convert to christanity and I want to point out the misconceptions that these people have.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I used to go to lots of temples and pray in my house. I did 
                  everything. But nothing happened,' she lets on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The turning point came when colleagues invited her to a 
                  Christian discussion group, and the members touched her with their 
                  friendship and support. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'They will take care of me like I'm a princess. Wherever I 
                  go, they will call me 'ah noi' affectionately. They will ask 'ah noi, 
                  how are you?' and hug me. It's very loving,'' she says.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Should I not appear in fellowship, they will come to my 
                  office and encourage me. And when they speak, they will speak what is in
                   my heart.'</span></p>
              <p>This is a total misconecption. When christians ask you to go to church or cell groups, it is because they want you to go to church and donate 10% of your salary every month to earn your money.</p>
              <p>Only naive people will think that christians are being loving and encouraging when they are actually trying to cheat your money.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Other former Taoists speak of bafflement about getting explanations 
                  on dogma and itscomplex ritessuch as offering fruit to deities on the 
                  first and 15th day of every lunar month or burning incense paper on 
                  stipulated dates. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Christantiy also got alot of ruites to follow what such as confessing your sins, partaking of the bread and wine once a month etc.</span></span></p>
              <p>These taoist people are just lazy to find out about their religion and use this excuse.</p>

              <p>I also heard that one need to give certain percentage of your salary to the church.....why talk about money??? I thought it is willingness, you give money out from your heart. $1 or $2 or even 10 cents also good. But not certain percentage of your salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then I also heard that not all church pratices the above.</p>

              <p>Machiam like God will drop down money from heaven to give you like that.</p>

              <p> i totally agree with topic starter.</p>
              <p>christians shoot down other religion for the sake of promoting their own religion.</p>
              <p>rony tan was not the first to do it.</p>
              <p>i have been to victory family centre , the pastor also shoot down other religion, namely buddhist or taoism.</p>
              <p>it is shameful for them to do such a thing.</p>
              <p>Really shameful</p>
              <p>christians who resort to slandering others behind their back.</p>
              <p>Shameful</p>
              <p>christians who boast that they are children of the most high but chose to attack in the dark.</p>

              <p>I happen to read this article on why some people convert to
              christanity and I want to point out the misconceptions that these
              people have.</p>
              <p>Refer to the article down here</p>
              <p>http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_542107.html</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I used to go to lots of temples
              and pray in my house. I did everything. But nothing happened,' she
              lets on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The turning point came when
              colleagues invited her to a Christian discussion group, and the
              members touched her with their friendship and support.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'They will take care of me like
              I'm a princess. Wherever I go, they will call me 'ah noi'
              affectionately. They will ask 'ah noi, how are you?' and hug me.
              It's very loving,'' she says.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Should I not appear in
              fellowship, they will come to my office and encourage me. And when
              they speak, they will speak what is in my heart.'</span></p>
              <p>This is a total misconecption. When christians ask you to go to
              church or cell groups, it is because they want you to go to church
              and donate 10% of your salary every month to earn your money.</p>
              <p>Only naive people will think that christians are being loving
              and encouraging when they are actually trying to cheat your
              money.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Other former Taoists speak of
              bafflement about getting explanations on dogma and itscomplex
              ritessuch as offering fruit to deities on the first and 15th day of
              every lunar month or burning incense paper on stipulated
              dates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Christantiy also got alot of ruites to follow
              what such as confessing your sins, partaking of the bread and wine
              once a month etc.</span></span></p>
              <p>These taoist people are just lazy to find out about their
              religion and use this excuse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I used to go to lots of temples
              and pray in my house. I did everything. But nothing happened,' she
              lets on.</span></p>
              <p>The person who say this does not have a brain at all.</p>
              <p>There are also alot of christians who everyday pray and nothing
              happen what. Just because they pray at the temple and nothing
              happen than they want to change religion shows that you are a
              complete moron</p>

              <p>I think U are the moron instead, since when Taoism do good things to their followers, it have proved to me that Taoism is an ineffective religion, and probably more marriage problems are Taoist / Buddhist (Because I right here know it). BTW, even if the statistics dont show so, that is because a Taoist / Buddhist is too hard to even get a marriage! And whats the next, they have to concentrate on their carrers, which is practical but in the end...... Still <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>NOTHING</strong></em></span> !!! This is the time they should think either they should be a monk, convert to other religions, or continue as it is and become mad until ...... commit suicide as life sucks.</p>

              <p>Low moron. This is definitely not about Christanity, despite I am not a christian.</p>

              <p>Ok, this moron would not take in by this, then look at it in this way:</p>
              <p>1: You pay peanuts, you get monkeys, true enough, Taoism is crap and nonsense because all I see people who are divorced are Taoist in some point of time (Some changed to Buddhist, but.... whats for?). It is not like Christians got 0 divorce rate, but I saw happy marriages in christians more than unhappy ones (Unhappy means people who are married in name only and the heart long flew to somewhere else)</p>
              <p>2: Since when you see a Taoist / Buddhist got a true success people? Da Lai Lama or Aung San? What the joke! -- All these summarize you pay peanuts, you get monkeys</p>
              <p>3: Oh yes, they are definitely better than people in MLMs, who uses similiar approach.</p>
