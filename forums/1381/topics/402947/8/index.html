              <p>I think U are the moron instead, since when Taoism do good things to their followers, it have proved to me that Taoism is an ineffective religion, and probably more marriage problems are Taoist / Buddhist (Because I right here know it). BTW, even if the statistics dont show so, that is because a Taoist / Buddhist is too hard to even get a marriage! And whats the next, they have to concentrate on their carrers, which is practical but in the end...... Still <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>NOTHING</strong></em></span> !!! This is the time they should think either they should be a monk, convert to other religions, or continue as it is and become mad until ...... commit suicide as life sucks.</p>

              <p>I happen to read this article on why some people convert to christanity and I want to point out the misconceptions that these people have.</p>
              <p>Refer to the article down here</p>
              <p>http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_542107.html</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I used to go to lots of temples and pray in my house. I did everything. But nothing happened,' she lets on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The turning point came when colleagues invited her to a Christian discussion group, and the members touched her with their friendship and support.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'They will take care of me like I'm a princess. Wherever I go, they will call me 'ah noi' affectionately. They will ask 'ah noi, how are you?' and hug me. It's very loving,'' she says.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Should I not appear in fellowship, they will come to my office and encourage me. And when they speak, they will speak what is in my heart.'</span></p>
              <p>This is a total misconecption. When christians ask you to go to church or cell groups, it is because they want you to go to church and donate 10% of your salary every month to earn your money.</p>
              <p>Only naive people will think that christians are being loving and encouraging when they are actually trying to cheat your money.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Other former Taoists speak of bafflement about getting explanations on dogma and itscomplex ritessuch as offering fruit to deities on the first and 15th day of every lunar month or burning incense paper on stipulated dates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Christantiy also got alot of ruites to follow what such as confessing your sins, partaking of the bread and wine once a month etc.</span></span></p>
              <p>These taoist people are just lazy to find out about their religion and use this excuse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I used to go to lots of temples and pray in my house. I did everything. But nothing happened,' she lets on.</span></p>
              <p>The person who say this does not have a brain at all.</p>
              <p>There are also alot of christians who everyday pray and nothing happen what. Just because they pray at the temple and nothing happen than they want to change religion shows that you are a complete moron</p>

              <p>U want to compare with the world? Fine, but look, Asian is quite diverse, also got mainly Chrisitanity, Muslim and Atheist countries (From S.Korea &amp; parts of South East Asia, Middle East + Central Asia along with the other parts of South East Asia and Communist / Socialist countires) on top with Buddhism / Taoism. In which country of Asia have u seen a mainly Buddhist / Taoist country? O -- Burma, Nepal, and Bhutan are mainly Buddhist, and indeed they are more happy (Minus political repression in Burma, which is OT) despite not a developed / developing country. So whats for Taoism?</p>
              <p>And dont mention to me the weird looking country in South Asia (Very offensive)</p>
              <p>I think Taoist majority place is only at Hong Kong and Taiwan, which is considered as a minority when you look at it as China as a whole.</p>

              <p>U want to compare with the world? Fine, but look, Asian is quite diverse, also got mainly Chrisitanity, Muslim and Atheist countries (From S.Korea &amp; parts of South East Asia, Middle East + Central Asia along with the other parts of South East Asia and Communist / Socialist countires) on top with Buddhism / Taoism. In which country of Asia have u seen a mainly Buddhist / Taoist country? O -- Burma, Nepal, and Bhutan are mainly Buddhist, and indeed they are more happy (Minus political repression in Burma, which is OT) despite not a developed / developing country. So whats for Taoism?</p>
              <p>And dont mention to me the weird looking country in South Asia (Very offensive)</p>
              <p>I think Taoist majority place is only at Hong Kong and Taiwan, which is considered as a minority when you look at it as China as a whole.</p>

              <p>just wanted to clarify, i called you a cock teaser, i didn't say you carried balls. BIG difference. It's a fact, not opinion. You act as if you want to destroy the forum but cannot follow through and usually end up posting something stupid, start flaming or stir trouble. By the way, stop using words that i've used on you back against me (e.g. ad hominem, character assassination). Unoriginal. Try to come up with new stuff, it adds more amusement to your posts. </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">first of all, <strong>calling a character assassin out on his game isn't character assassination</strong>. <strong>it's stating a fact that is relevant to this thread.</strong> In the same, calling a troll out isn't trolling because by definition, a troll is out to throw the thread off topic (as you are currently doing). By doing so, i'm alerting others to the presence of this undesirable element. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">second of all, <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">IF</strong> i had really started out, as you lied, by claiming the above, i would really have trolled but i didnt, since what i've started my foray into this thread is to approve of what ed88 posted. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">if you're proud of being a troll, carry on by all means. i'm glad that you've come to terms with who or what you are, yet sad that you choose to continue at this level of existence. </p>

              <p>Twist and turn words and continous use of vulgarity and accusations are what the evil christians are best in doing.   Bring in non christians hoping to put me in the bad light, hahahhaha.  Unfortunately, all the non christians are attacked by the same person and he has the cheek to make use of them against me.   wahahhahhaha, this is what we called in Chinese zhu ba jie zao jin li wai bu shi ren!  When attacking on one issue can bring in other irrelevant issues to continue to attack.   When it comes to attack , anything goes, this is typical of evil christians.</p>
              <p>May they end up in hell and enjoy burn in the lake of fire.    God detests evildoing!    The Lord God wants all to repent and do his will obviously the evil christians refuse to obey God and continue with evildoing.</p>

              <p>No wonder then we have anti-christians here creating trouble..... they seems to have no place in this world ! They may be small in numbers but they really are loud and filthy mouthed idiotic liars and pest to society.</p>
              <p>Think should consider Atheist, Non Chrisitians, Christians and Anti-Christians.... at least then they feel they have a place somewhere and may help them get over feeling insecure...</p>
              <p>But why Non Christians must be grouped leh? can they not stand on their own?</p>
              <p>Maybe little fairy can enlighten...</p>

              <p>christians are large in numbers because it is the easiest religion compare with other religion. believe and will go to heaven, don't have to do anything and whether you follow the teachings or not does not matter.</p>
              <p>who cares whether non christians have a place on earth, large or small numbers. we only care whether our actions will have a place in heaven and not a place on earth.</p>

              <p>just wanted to clarify, i called you a cock teaser, i didn't say you carried balls. BIG difference. It's a fact, not opinion. You act as if you want to destroy the forum but cannot follow through and usually end up posting something stupid, start flaming or stir trouble. By the way, stop using words that i've used on you back against me (e.g. ad hominem, character assassination). Unoriginal. Try to come up with new stuff, it adds more amusement to your posts. </p>
