              not only to the goverment and the people of singapore but to God as
              well. It is his risks to take and he will definitely suffer if he
              misuses the funds. Of course you guys have the right to accept
              whatever faith you are going to practice, but ultimately religious
              tolerance is the only way to preserve this fragile peace that we
              take for granted in Singapore. With peace can our country grow , so
              unless you dont consider yourself as a singaporean , go start
              flaming and start a riot or something cause it just might happen.
              Then all this comfortable life we all take for granted come
              tumbling down like blocks of wood.</p>

              <p>Your first statement is misleading and please do not repeat that "tithing is an act of faith". It is not and you can google and find out the many explanations why it is not relevant. Don't mislead others especially non-christians. But I can accept if you says that tithing is widely taught to be an "act of faith" by some so called mega churches preaching prosperity gospel.</p>

              <p>you really lack the skills of reasoning. an appeal to ignorance
              will get you nowhere. show me what first statement i made before
              you claimed, "<span style="color: #333333;">those trolls
              will support religious intolerance by supporting rony tan/ being
              apathetic to his rants"</span></p>
              <p>hmm ... i'm beginning to realize that if you or rooney9 or any
              other cronies, roped in to help, think i'm making mindless rants,
              abstract statements or any other argument their intellect fails to
              help them understand, i actually find it a compliment. After all,
              to the village idiot, nothing makes sense to him since he is
              "mentally deficient and incapable of ordinary reasoning". My only
              concern is for you dunces not to pull other forumers down your
              intellectual sewage. </p>
              <p>gee i wouldn't know. i wasn't the one who was waiting for a
              reply to a thread that he had thrown off track. like i alluded
              earlier about u- pitiful life, meaningless existence</p>
              <p>Just before i leave, a parting thought for you. Did you know
              that the word "fool" in Psalm 14 of the Christian scriptures has
              the same root word (Greek Septuagint) as the modern word "moron"?
              Yet another example of scriptures being proven true! </p>
