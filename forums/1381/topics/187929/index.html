            <div class='col-md body'>whilst the role of apostle and prophet do not exist per se, I believe that the gifts of apostleship and prophecy do exist, these are gifts that when exercised properly, can serve to edify and build up the church. My two cents worth.</div>

Any differences? </div></blockquote>The Deacon has the basic powers of Holy Orders, and is allowed preach and confer blessings. Deacons aid the Priests and Bishops in any way that is needed. Deacons also serve the people, especially the poor and the needy. The Deacons also distributes Communion. They are like a bridge between the clergy and the laity.<br><br>The Priest has more powers. He is allowed to say Mass, hear confessions and absolve sins in the name of Christ. The Priest is always on standby for sick call, bringing Christ's peace to the those in their last moments.<br><br>The Bishop exercises the fullness of Holy Orders. The Bishop is the head of a group of parishes in a certain geographical area. He has the authority to ordain Deacons and Priests. All clergy and laity are subordinate to their Bishop. St Ignatius says, "Where the Bishops are, there is the Catholic Church."<br><br>In any case, one thing is certain: All clergy must be ready to die for their flocks, if need be. We must pray for our clergy always.</div>

I do believe they do serve a different functions. Personally, I don;t really think they are really needed, hence exist, but on the other hand I don't feel that its right to say they don't exist just because I don't think we need them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I think it is God's soveriegn right to give this gift or not to give to persons.<br><br>for me as an evangelical. i believe that revealations has ceased. The cannon is complete. but with regards to miracles and gifts of healing, i cannot say anything dogmatic for sure.<br><br></div>
