Another question is do the church exert peer pressure for regular believers for tilthing ? </strong></blockquote>The first part of your question is: Yes.... churches, like all religious and some social organisation are self-sustaining. Whether the amount of "substantial" or not depends on how the word is defined.<br>The answer to your second question is: it depends on the church. We are all well aware that some mega-churches in Singapore may have done it, whether as part of the church teaching or thorugh some overzealous leaders is debatable. My own church had never exerted any pressure, peer or pulpit, for regular worshippers to tithe.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I have heard a friend from a catholic church who felt compel to tilth.

            <div class='col-md body'>Think of the pay to go church in an ah beng point of view.<br><br>its like pay to get protected. some kind of protection money.<br><br>and y do i say this.... well there this chruch i went last time in geylang area, frd brought me there. when they started passing the offerings bag around i did not put in any money cos its my rights to decide if i shld donate anot. well things go fairly wrong for me for not donating. the members of the chruch started talking to me sacarstically and then in the middle of our conversation they would throw in some hints asking me to donate. Like"Hey u know our church is actually intending of expanding and provide better service for our fellow church members. But recently our treasurer said that there was a lack of funds so we couldn't do it in the near future." He also added " if only some of the newer members would do their part to help out, i believe God will definately shine on us" =.= sounds like full of crap to me. if u are a believer in God no matter where u go He will shine on u watching over u. He does not do that by judging on who donates or who doesnt.<br><br>Y do ppl attend church nowadays?  Peer pressure, see girls/guys. kena forced by parents or some1 related to them. attend church hoping to be forgiven of their wrongdoings but after church go gangfight. and the latest. go church learn singing. noticed the number of christian celebs in the chinese music industry? Guang liang, Pin Guan, Sun Ho, and the latest Superband Milo peng.<br><br>ppl in sg do not see the true meaning of attending church anymore. IMO, as a christian, u dun go around asking ppl if they wana join u in their sunday or saturday church 1 day and see if they like it or not. IF ur frds are interested, without u asking they will ask u themselves if they wana go. Dun go around pestering ppl after they have attended ur church once or twice then stopped going asking them to come back. they stopped because they have a reason. No use pestering. i beginning to hate christians sry but its true. the fugly side of this religion has finally shown its true colours.  sry to have offended those real devoted christians here. those devoted christians here, pls ask urself, have u ever once tried persuading a frd of urs to join u in the church or myb say come 1 day la see see myb u'll like it. i can bet with u, 99.9% will be yes.</div>

I am wondering why you use the word "Pay" since it gave non believers a wrong idea - and obviously they have the wrong idea.<br><br>It is nothing about Pay. It is the opposite - it is actually how much we "give up" since everything comes from God. And of course - this is from a view of one who believe in God.</div>

Like"Hey u know our church is actually intending of expanding and provide better service for our fellow church members. But recently our treasurer said that there was a lack of funds so we couldn't do it in the near future." He also added " if only some of the newer members would do their part to help out, i believe God will definately shine on us" =.= sounds like full of crap to me. if u are a believer in God no matter where u go He will shine on u watching over u. He does not do that by judging on who donates or who doesnt.<br></div></blockquote>You know, I am not sure which church you attended. My church makes it a point to announce that visitors are NOT REQUIRED TO contribute to the offering bag.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by boredandsleepy:</div><div class="quote_body">Y do ppl attend church nowadays?

Perhaps the problem is the amount of publicity churches do to promote their programme.<br>Each organisation (religious or not) will use to it's fullest, anyone who can draw crowd.... a church, in this sense, is no different.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by boredandsleepy:</div><div class="quote_body">ppl in sg do not see the true meaning of attending church anymore. IMO, as a christian, u dun go around asking ppl if they wana join u in their sunday or saturday church 1 day and see if they like it or not. IF ur frds are interested, without u asking they will ask u themselves if they wana go. Dun go around pestering ppl after they have attended ur church once or twice then stopped going asking them to come back. they stopped because they have a reason. No use pestering. i beginning to hate christians sry but its true. the fugly side of this religion has finally shown its true colours.  sry to have offended those real devoted christians here. those devoted christians here, pls ask urself, have u ever once tried persuading a frd of urs to join u in the church or myb say come<br>1 day la see see myb u'll like it. i can bet with u, 99.9% will be yes. </div></blockquote>Maybe I am in the 0.1 percent. Never invited anyone to my church.<br><br>Look at it pragmatically, if you go to a movie and the movie is good, would you recommend it to a friend? From the Christian stand point, Christianity is good so it is natural that Christians would recommend their church to their friends. It is not the other religious folks do not do that. Once I've been pestered by one guy who's into some Buddhist group to join him. I am not offended, it's a free world and anyone can invite anyone else into their programme.<br>I am not here to defend Christians who do one thing on Sunday and something else the rest of week and I am sorry for those who are down right offensive in their approach.</div>
