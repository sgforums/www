              <p>The above question pops up so often that I would like to dedicate a thread to it, and if it can be made a sticky thread (hello mods?) it would even be better!</p>
              <p>This question is a major objection that atheists put forward to justify their disbelief. Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), a famous British philosopher, in his influential little essay, <em>Why I am not a Christian,</em> put this forward as his first objection. Today’s atheists repeat the objection, including Richard Dawkins (<em>The God Delusion</em>).</p>
              <p>One of the most established principles of logic / science / reality is the principle of causality: something that has a beginning has a sufficient cause. The principle is not, ‘Everything has a cause’; Bertrand Russell misstated it. No, the principle is, ‘Everything <em>that has a beginning</em> has a sufficient cause’. Just a moment’s thought confirms this—something which had no beginning has no need of a cause. Furthermore, a cause has to be sufficient, or adequate. ‘You were found in a cabbage patch’ is not a sufficient explanation for your existence.</p>
              <p>Today’s atheists, who like to use words like ‘rational’, ‘reasonable’ and ‘scientific’ in describing their beliefs, believe that the greatest beginning of all—that of the universe—had no cause whatsoever! Some admit it is a problem, but they claim that saying ‘God did it’ explains nothing because you then have to explain where God came from. But is this a valid objection?</p>
              <p>The cause of the universe must have been non-material because if the cause was material / natural, it would be subject to the same laws of decay as the universe. That means it would have to have had a beginning itself and you have the same problem as cycles of births and deaths of universes. So the cause of the universe’s beginning must have been <em>super</em>-natural, i.e. non-material or spirit—a cause <em>outside</em> of space-matter-time. Such a cause would not be subject to the law of decay and so would not have a beginning. That is, the cause had to be eternal spirit.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the cause of the universe had to be incredibly powerful; the sheer <em>size</em> and <em>energy</em> seen in the universe together speak of that power; there had to be a <em>sufficient</em> cause.</p>
              <p>That sounds like the God of the Bible to me.</p>
              <p>Note that the Bible says, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=ESV&amp;passage=Genesis%201:1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Genesis 1:1</span></span></a>). Here God created time itself. Only One who is outside of time, that is, timeless, or eternal, could do this.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now to ask where someone who is eternal, someone who had no beginning, came from (‘Who created God?’) is like asking, ‘To whom is the bachelor married?’ It is an irrational question.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Dude, why are you avoiding my question? Who created man, if you say man created God? But let's take it to the higher level and sum it up at the universe level. Who created the universe? I've got a feeling that you will be like a broken CD repeating the notion that man created God without even attempting to answer the question.</p>
