Why have Holy Communion when one insists on having 'passover'?</div></blockquote>You don't have a clue about the significance of the corelation between the passover and holy communion right? You also do not understand the significance of the passover meal and the corelation to Jesus's salvation on the cross right?<br><br>Then celebrate this:<br><br>Leviticus 23<br><br>Feasts of the LORD<br>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 Â“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: Â‘The feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, these are My feasts.<br>The Sabbath<br><br>3 Â‘Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work on it; it is the Sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.<br>The Passover and Unleavened Bread<br><br>4 Â‘These are the feasts of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at their appointed times. 5 On the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight is the LORDÂ’s Passover. 6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; seven days you must eat unleavened bread. 7 On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no customary work on it. 8 But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD for seven days. The seventh day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no customary work on it.Â’Â”<br>The Feast of Firstfruits<br><br>9 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 10 Â“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: Â‘When you come into the land which I give to you, and reap its harvest, then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest. 11 He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted on your behalf; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. 12 And you shall offer on that day, when you wave the sheaf, a male lamb of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering to the LORD. 13 Its grain offering shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to the LORD, for a sweet aroma; and its drink offering shall be of wine, one-fourth of a hin. 14 You shall eat neither bread nor parched grain nor fresh grain until the same day that you have brought an offering to your God; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.<br>The Feast of Weeks<br><br>15 Â‘And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering: seven Sabbaths shall be completed. 16 Count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall offer a new grain offering to the LORD. 17 You shall bring from your dwellings two wave loaves of two-tenths of an ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven. They are the firstfruits to the LORD. 18 And you shall offer with the bread seven lambs of the first year, without blemish, one young bull, and two rams. They shall be as a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire for a sweet aroma to the LORD. 19 Then you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats as a sin offering, and two male lambs of the first year as a sacrifice of a peace offering. 20 The priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. 21 And you shall proclaim on the same day that it is a holy convocation to you. You shall do no customary work on it. It shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.<br>22 Â‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field when you reap, nor shall you gather any gleaning from your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.Â’Â”<br>The Feast of Trumpets<br><br>23 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 24 Â“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: Â‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a sabbath-rest, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. 25 You shall do no customary work on it; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.Â’Â”<br>The Day of Atonement<br><br>26 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: 27 Â“Also the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the Day of Atonement. It shall be a holy convocation for you; you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD. 28 And you shall do no work on that same day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God. 29 For any person who is not afflicted in soul on that same day shall be cut off from his people. 30 And any person who does any work on that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people. 31 You shall do no manner of work; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 32 It shall be to you a sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict your souls; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall celebrate your sabbath.Â”<br>The Feast of Tabernacles<br><br>33 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 34 Â“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: Â‘The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the LORD. 35 On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work on it. 36 For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD. It is a sacred assembly, and you shall do no customary work on it.<br>37 Â‘These are the feasts of the LORD which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering and a grain offering, a sacrifice and drink offerings, everything on its dayÂ— 38 besides the Sabbaths of the LORD, besides your gifts, besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings which you give to the LORD.<br>39 Â‘Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep the feast of the LORD for seven days; on the first day there shall be a sabbath-rest, and on the eighth day a sabbath-rest. 40 And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days. 41 You shall keep it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It shall be a statute forever in your generations. You shall celebrate it in the seventh month. 42 You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths, 43 that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.Â’Â”<br>44 So Moses declared to the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Palm Sunday.  To me, such celebrations, including normal day activities / events can always be well used by our Lord to refresh us, or give us a good message - messages to bring us closer to Him.<br><br>Like this Palm Sunday.  i believe God used a Pastor to talk about the "Palms" of God.  A true story was shared - which i thought is appropriate to share here.<br><br>There was this girl from Africa, whos parents died when she was at a young age. She was left with a big group of younger brothers to take care of.  There was practically no money to take care of the brothers - and so she considered some options - including prostitution.  But finally, she thought that prostitution is no go - because her parents are good Christians and would not have allow it to happen when they are still alive.  But then what can she do ? Her options are very limited indeed.<br><br>So she has to do little tasks which no one wants to do. One of those is the washing of clothes. She had to do many of those day in, day out - just to feed her brothers and giving them an education.<br><br>At the end of it, she managed to succeed - her brothers today received good education and are good men of faith. But all these are given at a cost - the cost of her health. Very soon, her health sccumbed to pure exhaustion.<br><br>At her deathbed, the girl ask to see a Pastor.  Upon reflecting on her life, she cried to the Pastor, saying that all her life, all she did was to wash other people's clothes. And if ever she gets a chance to go to Heaven, she is scared. She does not know what to say to God when she meet Him in Heaven.  What can she say ? What has she done ? All she has done is to wash clothes !<br><br>The Pastor says: "My child, perhaps you dont have to say a word. Just show God your palms, He knows all about you through those callouses of your roughen hands".<br><br>Indeed, when Jesus comes riding in on a donkey as King of kings, the Love of God for His people is revealed.<br><br></div>
