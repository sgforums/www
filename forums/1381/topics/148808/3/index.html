            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shade343:</div><div class="quote_body">But the phrase does not mention that it is WRONG to pray to angels. It is just against those who pray to angels and does not believe in jesus and think they know alot.</div></blockquote>Prohibition doesnÂ’t have to be explicit. Many prohibitions in the Bible are implied.<br><br>You do not see in the Bible explicitly and word for word that it is WRONG  to take cocaine or shabu or etc. But it is implied in 1 Corinthians 6:12, the first of the ten commandments, 1 Cor. 3:17 and etc.<br><br>About the issue of Paul not against the practice but against the praticee:<br><br>I beg to disagree, Paul was not primarily against those who pray to angels,<br><br>the Colossian Christians were influenced by false and erroneous teachings Â….these Colossian Christians began to practice what these Judaizers and Gnostics were teachingÂ…..he was not against his fellow brothers and sisters in ChristÂ…Â…he was against the practice of praying to angels and Jewish regulations taught by these erroristsÂ…Â…. Read the verse again:<br><br>Col 2:16 Â“So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths,<br><br>17 which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.<br><br>18 Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in false humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,<br><br>19 and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God.<br><br>20 Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulationsÂ—<br><br>From verse 16, he was against the practice of Jewish customs and regulations like eating certain kinds of food, drinking only certain kinds of drink and observing certain days stemming from outdated religious beliefs.<br><br>In verse 17, take note of the pronoun used by Paul, it does not say Â“whose are shadows of things to comeÂ…..Â” NoÂ…Â….but it says: Â“WHICH are a shadow of things to comeÂ…Â….Â”<br>Paul did not use the personal pronoun WHOSE but the NEUTER pronoun WHICH. Meaning he is not against the persons practicing these things but the practice itself. How could he be against these peopleÂ…Â…..some of them practicing such were his Colossian brethren. Christians are to love and not be against our brethren who commit mistakes. We  love the sinner we hate the sin.<br><br>In verse 18 he tackles the practices of  a) taking delight in  false humility  [taking delight in false humility doesnÂ’t sound like a person to me but a practice] and b) worship of angels. [Take note: it doesnÂ’t say Â‘worshipper of angelsÂ’ but Â‘worship of angelsÂ’ (the practice of it not the practicee)].<br><br>And it is made even clearer in verse 20 that Paul was not primarily against those who practice such errors but the wrong practices themselves. Look at verse 20 notice the verbs:<br><br>20 Â“Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though LIVING in the world, do you SUBJECT yourselves to REGULATIONS [ <span style="font-style: italic;">or practices</span>, italics mine]Â—Â“<br><br>These Colossians were being rebuked by Paul for they are LIVING, SUBJECTING THEMSELVES TO REGULATIONS OR ERRONEOUS PRACTICES. What practices or regulations? The ones mentioned above: a) Jewish practices and b) taking delight in false humility and the worship of angels.<br><br>One more thing about the statement that: "paul was not saying that it is wrong to pray to angels. He was just against those who pray to angels and does not believe in jesus and think they know alot."<br><br>Okay, granting without conceding for the sake of discussion that Paul was against people and not the practice itself.<br><br>Question:  "Why was Paul against these people?<br><br>" What was the reason why Paul was against such people?<br><br>"Was he against them for no reason at all?<br><br>Of course, the only logical answer to that is: Paul was against such people because of their wrong pracitces, right? And what are these wrong practices? Jewish religiosinism, taking delight in false humility and WORSHIP OF ANGELS,  right?<br><br>Question:<br><br>"When you are against someone because of his wrong deeds, are you not also implicitly saying that you do not approve of the deeds?"<br><br></div>

And based on the context of these verse [verses 2-3], we are sure to identify the beginning here as referring to the time when God created the heavens and the earth.<br><br>Question: Â“Did the Word already exist from the beginning?Â”<br><br>The verb Â‘wasÂ’ [Â‘in the beginning WAS the WordÂ…Â’] is quite telling regarding the answer to this question. Unlike the English language, Greek verbs emphasize more on the nature of the action than the time of the action as in the English. So Â‘WasÂ’ here tells not of when did the Word exists but what kind of existence the Word have.<br><br>In Greek, the verb Â‘WASÂ’ is in the imperfect tense, active voice. Imperfect tenses in Greek describe an action that is continuing in the past and still is continuing in the present. And not only is the verb in the imperfect tense but it is also in the active voice.<br>Active voices in Greek signify dynamism of the doer.<br><br>The long and short answer to our question would be Â“YES, Absolutely, the Word existed from the pastÂ”. The WordÂ’s existence could be described by the following characteristics based on the exegesis of the verb Â‘wasÂ’.<br><br>First:    The WordÂ’s existence antedates that of the creation of the world. It is said: Â“in the                                     	beginning WAS [imperfect tense] the Word.Â”<br><br>Before Genesis 1:1 the Word was already in existence.<br><br>Second: The Word was active in the beginning [based on the active voice of the verb 	 	Â‘wasÂ’]. The Word was not dormant and doing nothing in the beginning, no, 	rather the Word was active. And based on the following verses, we see the 	WordÂ’s activity; the Word was actively Â‘busyÂ’ in creation.<br><br>At this point someone would likely object and say: Â“No, in that verse the Word was the agent of creation, not the creator.Â”  True, but John 1:1 is not the only source of information about the pre-incarnate state of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have to consider also the whole counsel and teaching of the Bible regarding this area in other portions of Scripture. We all agree that the best commentary of the Bible is the Bible itself right?<br><br>The Bible teaches that the Word was indeed the agent of creation but it also teaches that the Word is also the active and direct creator of the world and not just a mere agent or instrument in creation:<br><br>Heb 1:8 Â“But to the Son [the Word] He [God] says: "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom.<br><br>9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions."<br><br>10 And: "You, LORD [referring to the Word] in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands.<br><br>11 They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment;<br><br>Before the creation of the world, the Word was. The Word existed from eternity.<br><br>II<br><br>Moving to the second point: b) the distinctive personality of the Word from the Father:<br>Â“in the beginning was the Word and the Word was WITH GodÂ…Â…Â…Â”<br><br>The preposition Â‘WITHÂ’ is the word pros in Greek in the accusative case. Pros in the accusative case in Greek means fellowship, harmony and intimacy.<br><br>Question: Â“Who was the Word in fellowship with, in harmony with and in close intimacy 		      with?Â”<br><br>Â“In the beginning was the Word and the Word WAS WITH GODÂ…Â…Â”<br><br>This verse is a blast against oneness theology. In order for them to justify their teaching they have to circumvent the pros in the accusative case in this verse. They have to do gymnastics with pros in the accusative case. The Word could not be God the Father because the Word was WITH the Father implying distinction of personalities between the Word and the Father.<br><br>Fellowship happens only between two persons AT LEAST. No one can have fellowship with oneself. Again the Bible gives further light regarding this [the Bible is the best commentator of itself]:<br><br>In every book of the Bible, the Lord Jesus appears either in type, shadows or in prophecy. In the book of Proverbs he appears as the wisdom that every man needs. In chapter 8 of the same book starting from verse 22 down to verse 29 we can see that Wisdom [ the Word or the Lord Jesus] was with the Father before the creation of the world, during and after. Wisdom further states in verse 30 that in the time of creation He was with the Father like a MASTER CRAFTSMAN. CraftsmanÂ’s craft is building and constructing right?<br><br>30 Â“Then I was beside Him as a master craftsman; And I was daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him,Â”<br><br>IsnÂ’t that a picture of harmony and intimacy?<br><br>III<br><br>Moving on to the last point: c) The Deity of the Word; Â“in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.Â”<br><br>What further clear statement do we need to have about the Deity of the Word.<br><br>Â“The Word was GodÂ”Â…Â…Â….Â”The Word was GodÂ”Â…Â….Â”The Word was GodÂ”<br><br>From this statement two things can be gleaned:<br><br>First: The Word has always been God from eternity<br><br>Again the verb Â“WASÂ” is in the imperfect tense in Greek. This means the Word was God from the past eternity, God at the time of JohnÂ’s writing this letter and still is God in the future eternity.<br><br>Re 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," says the Lord, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."<br><br>Second: The Word is not A God<br><br>Notice it does not say Â“the Word was A GodÂ” No, the Word was God.<br>In the original Greek there is no article Â‘aÂ’ for there is no article Â‘aÂ’ in Greek. The word Â‘aÂ’ is very, very significant to orthodox theology. Putting an Â‘aÂ’ before the word Â‘GodÂ’ in this verse commits two significant errors:<br><br>First: It is adding to the Word of God, the Bible. We are not to add something to His words.<br><br>Proverbs 30: Â“Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar.Â”<br><br>Second: It is a blasphemy against the Lord Jesus Christ. It borders to rejecting His deity.<br>It is making Him divine in contrast to His true nature and essence of being God.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ironside:</div><div class="quote_body">John 1:1<br><br>John 1:1 Â“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.Â”<br><br>Three points can be gleaned from the text:<br><br>a)	The eternality of the Word<br>b)	The distinctive personality of the Word from God<br>c)	The Deity of the Word<br><br>I<br><br>The eternality of the Word:  Â“In the beginning was the WordÂ…Â….Â”<br><br>The words Â“in the beginningÂ” take us back to Genesis 1:1 wherein there we can see the account of creation. And based on the context of these verse [verses 2-3], we are sure to identify the beginning here as referring to the time when God created the heavens and the earth.<br><br>Question: Â“Did the Word already exist from the beginning?Â”<br><br>The verb Â‘wasÂ’ [Â‘in the beginning WAS the WordÂ…Â’] is quite telling regarding the answer to this question. Unlike the English language, Greek verbs emphasize more on the nature of the action than the time of the action as in the English. So Â‘WasÂ’ here tells not of when did the Word exists but what kind of existence the Word have.<br><br>In Greek, the verb Â‘WASÂ’ is in the imperfect tense, active voice. Imperfect tenses in Greek describe an action that is continuing in the past and still is continuing in the present. And not only is the verb in the imperfect tense but it is also in the active voice.<br>Active voices in Greek signify dynamism of the doer.<br><br>The long and short answer to our question would be Â“YES, Absolutely, the Word existed from the pastÂ”. The WordÂ’s existence could be described by the following characteristics based on the exegesis of the verb Â‘wasÂ’.<br><br>First:    The WordÂ’s existence antedates that of the creation of the world. It is said: Â“in the                                     	beginning WAS [imperfect tense] the Word.Â”<br><br>Before Genesis 1:1 the Word was already in existence.<br><br>Second: The Word was active in the beginning [based on the active voice of the verb 	 	Â‘wasÂ’]. The Word was not dormant and doing nothing in the beginning, no, 	rather the Word was active. And based on the following verses, we see the 	WordÂ’s activity; the Word was actively Â‘busyÂ’ in creation.<br><br>At this point someone would likely object and say: Â“No, in that verse the Word was the agent of creation, not the creator.Â”  True, but John 1:1 is not the only source of information about the pre-incarnate state of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have to consider also the whole counsel and teaching of the Bible regarding this area in other portions of Scripture. We all agree that the best commentary of the Bible is the Bible itself right?<br><br>The Bible teaches that the Word was indeed the agent of creation but it also teaches that the Word is also the active and direct creator of the world and not just a mere agent or instrument in creation:<br><br>Heb 1:8 Â“But to the Son [the Word] He [God] says: "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom.<br><br>9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions."<br><br>10 And: "You, LORD [referring to the Word] in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands.<br><br>11 They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment;<br><br>Before the creation of the world, the Word was. The Word existed from eternity.<br><br>II<br><br>Moving to the second point: b) the distinctive personality of the Word from the Father:<br>Â“in the beginning was the Word and the Word was WITH GodÂ…Â…Â…Â”<br><br>The preposition Â‘WITHÂ’ is the word pros in Greek in the accusative case. Pros in the accusative case in Greek means fellowship, harmony and intimacy.<br><br>Question: Â“Who was the Word in fellowship with, in harmony with and in close intimacy 		      with?Â”<br><br>Â“In the beginning was the Word and the Word WAS WITH GODÂ…Â…Â”<br><br>This verse is a blast against oneness theology. In order for them to justify their teaching they have to circumvent the pros in the accusative case in this verse. They have to do gymnastics with pros in the accusative case. The Word could not be God the Father because the Word was WITH the Father implying distinction of personalities between the Word and the Father.<br><br>Fellowship happens only between two persons AT LEAST. No one can have fellowship with oneself. Again the Bible gives further light regarding this [the Bible is the best commentator of itself]:<br><br>In every book of the Bible, the Lord Jesus appears either in type, shadows or in prophecy. In the book of Proverbs he appears as the wisdom that every man needs. In chapter 8 of the same book starting from verse 22 down to verse 29 we can see that Wisdom [ the Word or the Lord Jesus] was with the Father before the creation of the world, during and after. Wisdom further states in verse 30 that in the time of creation He was with the Father like a MASTER CRAFTSMAN. CraftsmanÂ’s craft is building and constructing right?<br><br>30 Â“Then I was beside Him as a master craftsman; And I was daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him,Â”<br><br>IsnÂ’t that a picture of harmony and intimacy?<br><br>III<br><br>Moving on to the last point: c) The Deity of the Word; Â“in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.Â”<br><br>What further clear statement do we need to have about the Deity of the Word.<br><br>Â“The Word was GodÂ”Â…Â…Â….Â”The Word was GodÂ”Â…Â….Â”The Word was GodÂ”<br><br>From this statement two things can be gleaned:<br><br>First: The Word has always been God from eternity<br><br>Again the verb Â“WASÂ” is in the imperfect tense in Greek. This means the Word was God from the past eternity, God at the time of JohnÂ’s writing this letter and still is God in the future eternity.<br><br>Re 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," says the Lord, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."<br><br>Second: The Word is not A God<br><br>Notice it does not say Â“the Word was A GodÂ” No, the Word was God.<br>In the original Greek there is no article Â‘aÂ’ for there is no article Â‘aÂ’ in Greek. The word Â‘aÂ’ is very, very significant to orthodox theology. Putting an Â‘aÂ’ before the word Â‘GodÂ’ in this verse commits two significant errors:<br><br>First: It is adding to the Word of God, the Bible. We are not to add something to His words.<br><br>Proverbs 30: Â“Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar.Â”<br><br>Second: It is a blasphemy against the Lord Jesus Christ. It borders to rejecting His deity.<br>It is making Him divine in contrast to His true nature and essence of being God.<br><br></div></blockquote>errr.....and your point is?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
