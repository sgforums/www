              <p>That is why there is wars and so much violences happening around
              the world.</p>
              <p>Let me write out a scenario for you,</p>
              <p>Jimmy is a Catholic, he worships God and believe everything
              given to him, which include the 10 coms. According to this, he
              thinks that other religions are nothing but mere fiction. So,
              instead of respecting them, he thinks that Islam, Buddhism or
              whatever are nothing but pure talk.</p>
              <p>When other people from these religions hear about it, they will
              surely be angry and thus comes the racial riots.</p>
              <p>The point here is this, we must accept the existance of other
              religions, which means the existance of their Gods, but we can make
              a choice on which to believe. With this mentality, we can better
              respect and appreciate others and their religion.</p>
              <p>Nah I'm not from RCC or any organisation.</p>
              <p>Im just a decade-and-a-half Catholic who is quite piss at its
              current state of development.</p>

              <p>rcc means roman catholic church...</p>
              <p>well, with ur own scenario,lil jimmy here choose a god for himself and declare all other gods as false as being taught in his religion.however, he does not need to run ard to infm other ppl that their religion is false,incurring wrath..also, the bible teaches ppl to be meek.not over zealous like me.if jimmy is to do the word of God, he will preach to others meekly and let non believers see his pov..harsh method does not work..</p>
              <p>a true christian accepts that there are other religions and other gods..however they know that only Jehovah is the true living God as according to the bible.and will only worship Jehovah.</p>

              <p>Hi Danielhuang88, crimsontactics, wilsonhao,</p>
              <p>All of you have certain insights that Christianity has a history of violence and intolerance (eg the Crusades). The old testament also indicated the same, when God seemed to help and condoned the Isrealites' killings of others who are of of their same tribe. Yet, this seems so contradictary to Jesus message of love, gentleness, self-control. Is this the same God we are talking about?</p>
              <p>This is a contradiction that many Christians feel at the core of their beings,but as we are taught to love only one true God, we often try to ignore these contradictions. Yet there is a split in us - between reason and faith. This is the reason for my long post dated 6 Sep 12.47pm, to share that this does not have to be so.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, as Christians we are fearful of asking even basic questions about the origin of the bible. Yet it is strange when at school and at work, we have been trained to be logical and rationale and to look at evidence. When studying history, we learn to ask:"What are the cultural, personal biases of the authors? Who decide that these 66 "books" among so many circulating in history should be compiled into this thing called "the bible"? What were their aims?"</p>
              <p>My purpose is to provoke critical thinking. I have gone through this phase and even looking squarely and say yes, Christianity has a history of violence and some parts of the bible are very tribal and very violent. But realiseing this has made me love Jesus all the more because I know he is so different. He was the outcast of his day, he turned the established religious thinking up-side-down, he was a rabble rouser that said: "look, question yourself, what is your motive? is this just a hypocritical act? ".</p>
              <p>It seems you 3 have enquiring minds and a social conscience that defies the conventional radical, fundamental forms of Christianity. If you have time, perhaps you can take time to read these 2 books which I have found can be very useful:</p>
              <p> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A History of Christianity</span> by Paul Johnson published by Penguin (he is a Christian and an Oxford historian. The book is all text only and can be quite trying if you are not familiar with European history but he writes in a very colourful way and you will see how politics, including church politics,  have shaped Christianity to the form we see today.)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism</span> by John Selby Spong (He a Bishop of the Episcopal Church in USA -same as Anglican tradition. He is a liberal Christian theologian. In this book, he says that many ordindary Christians do not have access to scholarly works and modern day research on the origins of the bible, and here he tries to put it in simple laymen language to show you that we cannot take the bible literally. It is a very interesting read)</p>

              <p>the entire bible does not contradict itself even though it may look like it.think of it as knowing the diff qualities God.JC shows the side of God that is called love.in the OT where an eye for an eye is to show the justice side of God.having endless love will result in weakness and being partial.that is not a god to be worshipped.but having justice to reward the righteous and punish the wrong doers makes God righteous.</p>
              <p>in the Ot when we see God favouring certain tribes and aiding them to kill, one might feel he is cruel and evil.but we should see who are the ones being destroyed and how righteous they are.tink about the story of lot who ask God to spare his hands if righteous ppl can be found in the city God is to destroy.</p>
              <p>not all parts of the bible is to be taken literally of cuz.since many a times, it is clearly that certain parts are symbolic.certain times,it might not be that clear.so only when things happen, do we know if the prophecy has been fulfilled or not.</p>

              <p>Lol sry bout the RCC thing, i thought it was some kind of organisation. Didn't know the short form.</p>
              <p>About the meekness part, in today's society where free speech is bring promoted and everyone wants to present the POV, i'm sure my scenario is very likely to happen.</p>
              <p>The problem is this, accepting the religion does not mean respecting it. If you accept something that is false, would you respect it? Yes i know, such a thing should be quite straightforward, however, after a long period of time, you will still feel unease at having to accept something that you deemed false, right?</p>
              <p>And the worst part is when the opposite side thinks that our God is fake too -.-</p>
              <p>Then the conclusion I guess you all will know. So why not we just have the mentality that all Gods are real? It is much more easiler to respect a real thing.</p>

              <p>the entire bible does not contradict itself even though it may
              look like it.think of it as knowing the diff qualities God.JC shows
              the side of God that is called love.in the OT where an eye for an
              eye is to show the justice side of God.having endless love will
              result in weakness and being partial.that is not a god to be
              worshipped.but having justice to reward the righteous and punish
              the wrong doers makes God righteous.</p>
              <p>in the Ot when we see God favouring certain tribes and aiding
              them to kill, one might feel he is cruel and evil.but we should see
              who are the ones being destroyed and how righteous they are.tink
              about the story of lot who ask God to spare his hands if righteous
              ppl can be found in the city God is to destroy.</p>
              <p>not all parts of the bible is to be taken literally of cuz.since
              many a times, it is clearly that certain parts are symbolic.certain
              times,it might not be that clear.so only when things happen, do we
              know if the prophecy has been fulfilled or not.</p>

              <p>Lol sry bout the RCC thing, i thought it was some kind of
              organisation. Didn't know the short form.</p>
              <p>About the meekness part, in today's society where free speech is
              bring promoted and everyone wants to present the POV, i'm sure my
              scenario is very likely to happen.</p>
              <p>The problem is this, accepting the religion does not mean
              respecting it. If you accept something that is false, would you
              respect it? Yes i know, such a thing should be quite
              straightforward, however, after a long period of time, you will
              still feel unease at having to accept something that you deemed
              false, right?</p>
              <p>And the worst part is when the opposite side thinks that our God
              is fake too -.-</p>
              <p>Then the conclusion I guess you all will know. So why not we
              just have the mentality that all Gods are real? It is much more
              easiler to respect a real thing.</p>

              <p>as christians, when they accept christ as saviour and Jehovah as God, they deem all other religions as false..but yet, they accept the existence of false gods but that does not mean they have to go tear dwn every other temple of baal..instead, they can show others that their living God is true by their outstanding behaviour of applying bible principles.that will be a more politically correct move too.</p>

              <p>Maybe the opposite. The question at the end of the day is;
              should we defy one who gave us life and bring us up, or one who has
              created our ancesstors long ago</p>
