            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>what are the questions? I see if I can rebutt.</blockquote>Christians r not free to break all the OT rules. U know tis topic has really no clear cut answer. Jesus contradicts himself some times, Paul also contradicts himself on occasions, saints argued over it, denomination split by it and scholars debate over it. It really depend on wat section u wanna focus on in the bible. One part contradicts the other. So giving a  broad answer tat "OT rules r only applicable to jews" is not scriptually true. If u can give a satisfactory answer to tis, then scholars wouldn't argue over it even now.<br><br><blockquote>The way you expect everything to have a proper explanation, even you cannot be satisfy yourself to the very end of the age. And where did you learn that everything must be logical? Never heard of unexplained phenomenon? </blockquote>Not really. Sometimes people make me stumbled over logical arguments and I keep quiet after tat. I am not difficult to be satisfied.<br><br>Does everything have to be logical ? If u ask me, yes. Unexplained phenomenon doesn't means it is logically wrong, but just means there r unknown. But the things we know shouldn't be logically wrong.<br><br>For example in the bible, I did not ask why fire can drop from the sky or why god can seperate the red sea. Tis r unexplained phenomenon and I treat tat if god exists, then it is easy for him to do tat. However parts like OT contradicts NT, certain part of the bible cannot be right because it violates science etc r logical errors.<br><br>It is like saying he is so fat he cannot pass through a 10X10 meter doorway yet thin enough to go through the 2mmX2mm eye of a needle. The first part contradict the second and it is logically wrong. People can believe on the first part more and sat tis guy is fat. Some people focus on the second part more and say tis guy is thin. They can argue forever and no one know wat is really the case. Tis is because something is wrong with the statement.<br><br><blockquote>At least the Christian theologians made no attempt to bluff to cover up the inconsistencies of the gospels. </blockquote>Tat is true. But tat meant tat certain interpretation and sections r wrong. Tat means u can believe in the wrong things now. tat also mean the bible is not really guided completely by divine powers because there r errors in it.<br><br>U know how police tell if a witness is lying or not ? A peson can tell many stories but if he<br>1) contradict himself<br>2) defies facts and evidence<br>then obviously the police can know he is lying<br><br><blockquote>Tell me how to find witnesses for history that's a few thousand years old? ThatÂ’s also a logical question. </blockquote>It is not about finding witnesses, but the stories between different eye witness giving true accounts shouldn't contradict one another. It just give the impression tat either the eye witness r wrong or not telling true account.<br><br></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For me, there’s no
              significance in the genealogies of who…Joseph! For Believers, Jesus is Son of
              God.</span></p>
              <h4><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">Just
              like you, the people in those days would not believe in a virgin birth. So Mary
              must have a husband, Joseph. A jew’s</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;"> affiliation with the Jewish tribes, are traced through the father.</span></h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">Luke
              3</span></h4>
              <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Baptism and Genealogy of Jesus</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">23. </span>Now
              Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the
              son, <strong>so it was thought</strong>, of Joseph</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">At least read
              Matthew from 1-24 to understand that Jesus is Son of God, not Joseph.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One contributor’s
              explanation below seems to reconcile the discrepancy. Matthew follows the
              natural line of descent, while Luke follows the legal line of descent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because of the
              Jewish Levirite laws, both are correct, but in different ways. In Jewish law,
              if a man died childless, his brother was to marry the widow, and the first son
              born would legally be the dead man's heir (Deuteronomy 25:5-6). In the story of
              Ruth, we see that this was not limited to brothers; the nearest male relative
              willing to take on the responsibility would marry the widow. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The logical (and
              traditional Roman Catholic and Orthodox) understanding is that Joseph's mother
              was originally the wife of Heli, but that he died without offspring. His
              kinsman Jacob then took the widow as his wife, and she bore Joseph. So, while
              "Jacob begat Joseph", legally Joseph was the son of Heli. Both were
              descendants of Zerubabel, and apparently Jacob was the nearest kinsman to Heli
              willing to fulfill the Levirite duty. Matthew follows the natural line of
              descent, while Luke follows the legal line of descent. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To summarise, Heli
              was the legal husband of Joseph’s mother. He died and Jacob took over the duty
              as husband and was the natural father of Joseph but legally, Heli was father of
              Joseph. That’s Levirite laws.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Complex
              relationship but intriguing. </span></p>
