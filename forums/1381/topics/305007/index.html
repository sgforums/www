            <div class='col-md body'>Dr. Laura Slessinger is a well-known conservative talk show host. She has expressed very negative beliefs about homosexuality, and Wicca. She has firmly supported and advocated biblical morality on her TV and radio shows.<br><br>This letter is from an anonymous writer in response to one of her shows.<br><br>Dear Dr. Laura,<br><br>Thank you so much for doing so much to educate people regarding GodÂ’s<br>Law. I have learned a great deal from your show and I try to share<br>that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to<br>defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him<br>that Leviticus 18: 22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of<br>debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of<br>the specific laws and how to best follow them.<br><br>A) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates<br>a pleasing odor for the Lord (Leviticus 1: 9). The problem is my<br>neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I<br>smite them?<br><br>B) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in<br>Exodus 21: 7. In this day &amp; age, what would be a fair market price<br>for her?<br><br>C) I know I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her<br>period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev 15: 19-24). The problem is how<br>do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br><br>D) Leviticus 25: 44 states that I may own slaves, both male &amp; female,<br>provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of<br>mine claims this applies to Mexicans but not Canadians. Can you<br>clarify? Why canÂ’t I own Canadians?<br><br>E) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus<br>35: 2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally<br>obligated to kill him myself?<br><br>F) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an<br>abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than<br>homosexuality. I donÂ’t agree, can you settle this?<br><br>G) Leviticus 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if<br>I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading<br>glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20 or is there some wiggle room<br>here?<br><br>H) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair<br>around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by<br>Leviticus 19:27. How should they die?<br><br>I) I know from Leviticus 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig<br>makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br><br>J) My uncle has a farm. He violates Leviticus 19:19 by planting two<br>crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of<br>two different kinds of thread (cotton &amp; polyester blend). He tends to<br>curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all<br>the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.<br>24: 10-16). CouldnÂ’t we just burn them to death at a private family<br>affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws (Lev. 20:<br>14)?<br><br>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident<br>you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that GodÂ’s word is<br>eternal and unchanging.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is no uncommon (even here in SGforums) for critics of Christians to use Leviticus as source to put down Christianity.....<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Most Christians believe that Leviticus is the word of God, but generally do not consider themselves to be bound by all the laws prescribed by the text, due to the implied antinomianism in some passages of the New Testament, notably the letters of Paul. Most Christians consider 1 Corinthians 10:23-26, in which Paul directs followers to "eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience", to exempt them from following the dietary laws set forth in Leviticus.</strong></span><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus</a><br><br>For events that happened more than 4,000 years ago, one can only guess what the culture was at the point in time and the reason for God to allow some rather questonable practices to continue.<br><br>If social norms are different now from what was our parents' generation, can we expect less for hundreds of generations?<br><br>Having said that.... I believe there are still people who'd adhere to these laws, and if they find peace in that, sure, why not?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting. Someone has bothered to answer the questions.<br><br>Q.  When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odour for the Lord (Leviticus 1:9). The problem is my neighbours.  They claim the odour is not pleasing to them.  Should I smite them?<br><br>A.  No.  You need a Israelite priest to offer the sacrifice for you in the Temple in Jerusalem; you can't just do it yourself in your back garden.  You have a problem!  The Temple was destroyed in 70 AD.  But stop believing in the pleasing odour of animal sacrifices anyway, for it is written that the blood of bulls and goats can never take away sin (Heb 10:4).  You need to believe that the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross takes away all your sin, now and forever.  As to offering violence against your neighbours, that will have you hauled up in front of the magistrates for a breach of the peace and actual bodily harm at a minimum under any system of law, ancient or modern.<br><br>Q.  I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of uncleanliness (Leviticus 15:19-24). How do I tell? I have tried asking but most women take offence.<br><br>A.  This is to do with purity of worship in the Temple .  Not just sexual intercourse (we would all be agreed on that) but even touching a menstruating woman made the one who touched her unclean.  It has passed.  When the Temple in Jerusalem was sacked in 70 AD, as Jesus prophesied, it was already 40 years past its use-by date.  The sacrifice of Jesus in AD 30 (+/- a year or two) had rendered the doings of the Temple obsolete.  Even the veil of the Temple (which separated the Holy of Holies from the rest of Temple ) was torn in two (Matt 27:51) at His death.  Believe in His death and you will be forgiven.  Believe in His resurrection and you will live.  If the matter you raise still troubles you, you should avoid all contact with women other than your own wife.  And if you don't know when she is in what you describe as her period of uncleanliness, then heaven help you.<br><br>Q.  Leviticus 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to the French but not to the Scots. Can you clarify?  Why can't I own Scottish people?<br><br>A.  It doesn't actually say slaves, it says 'bondmen and bondmaids'.  People who were poor bonded themselves or their children to someone wealthy.  It was a form of social security.  It is also written (Exod 21:16) that anyone who steals a man to sell him shall be put to death.  So those Muslim slavers who took and sold black slaves to the white man were flat out of order and worthy of death.  Don't forget that the man who had slavery outlawed in Britain was William Wilberforce, an evangelical Christian.  Atheists were quite happy with slavery.<br><br>Q.  I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br><br>A.  It actually says 'maidservant' not slave.  I should have thought you were doing well enough at Capital not to have to sell your daughter as a bonded servant.  What a rotten dad you are, to want to get rid of her even though you can afford to keep her.  Daughters are precious.  So are sons, come to that.  You'ld have to be in pretty dire straights 3,000 years ago to sell your children as servants, but I guess they would at least get fed and housed then.  Anyway, back to your daughter.  I think you would do better to send her to college and then see if she can't get a job.  Mind you, most jobs today are just wage-slavery, aren't they?  We spend 45% of our time working for the tax-man.  Who can be totally free?  Only those who trust in Jesus and know the truth will be free, as it is written, 'The truth shall make you free.'  (John 8:32)<br><br>Q.  I have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obliged to kill him myself or may I arrange for our vicar to do it?<br><br>A.  Neither.  You need to remember that the ancient principle of 'due process' still persists in our law today, despite a succession of Home Secretaries, including dear David Blunkett, wanting to get rid of it as a bit of an impediment to the Government just locking up whoever they want.  So you can't go around putting people to death yourself, that is what we Christians call murder.  OK, if someone killed your son or raped your daughter, you might call it vengeance, but you have no personal interest in what your neighbour is doing, it just gets up your nose a bit.  Report your neighbour to the police, support your allegation with two witnesses, and see if the police can find a law against what your neighbour is doing.  They won't.  This country doesn't do a day of rest in any form any more.<br><br>Q.  Leviticus 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?<br><br>A.  This applies to the High Priest of ancient Israel, who entered into the Holy of holies once a year on the Day of Atonement.  I suppose God has a right to say who was going to approach Him in the Holy of holies.  But even if you are a cohen, (a) you won't find the Temple still standing today and (b) all that Temple ritual is past.  Jesus has been and has offered Himself for the sins of all who will believe in Him.  Job done.  Finished.<br><br>Q.  Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Leviticus 19:27. How should they die?<br><br>A.  God did not want His people looking like the pagan priests of the nations round about with dodgy haircuts and peculiar beards.  Getting your hair cut as such isn't wrong in the eyes of God.  Exekiel the prophet (Ezek 44:20) says that the rule for the priest is to have his hair cut neatly, not shave his head nor grow his hair stupidly long like what the pagans do.  Can't see this was a capital offence, though, even then.<br><br>Q.  I know from Leviticus 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br><br>A.  Clean and unclean animals are done away with by Peter's vision in Acts 10:11-15.  My advice if this really worries you is to play as a forward or a back, and not as a midfielder, as they do most throwing in and place-kicking, and certainly don't play in goal.  And don't handball either, as that is against the laws of the game.<br><br>Q.  A friend of mine feels that though eating shellfish is an abomination (Leviticus 11:10) it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.  I don't agree.  Can you settle this?<br><br>A.  They are different words in Hebrew, so your friend is right.  But in any case, the clean and unclean animals distinction has gone with Peter's vision.  So the New Testament abolishes the Old Testament food laws, although there are Christians who observe the Old Testament food laws not least for health reasons.  Shellfish, for example, don't half store up toxins  But the New Testament confirms that homosexual activity is an abomination.<br><br>Q.  My friend tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone him as commanded in Leviticus 24:10-16 ?<br><br>A.  Yes, because it is all a matter of due process.  You are a bit for taking the law into your own hands, aren't you?  Does your friend actually curse the Name of God like the man in Leviticus did?  Anyway, next you must find a judge and jury who will convict him.  Unless his blasphemy really is scurrilous, abusive or offensive to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible, and tends to vilify the Christian religion, you are unlikely to see a conviction in our land today.  Best let your friend know how offended you are and if he persists, get another friend.  He sounds a bad sort, anyway.<br><br>Q.  My uncle has a farm. He violates Leviticus 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend).<br><br>A.  Doesn't sound much of a farmer.  How is he going to harvest it?  Mind you, he could put a fence down the middle, then he would have two fields, and he could sow one crop on one side and the other on the other side, I suppose.  As long as his wife does not wear a mixture of wool and linen, she should be OK to go and take part in ancient Israelite society.  Back to the future!<br><br>Q.  Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws (Leviticus 20:14)?<br><br>A.  You don't half have a vicious streak.  Once again, in God's design for mankind, the State has the responsibility for the judicial death penalty, not the family.  God's law does not allow people to put members of their own family to death.  You are thinking of Islam and Hinduism.  Oh, and Britain today.  When our Parliament passed the Homicide Act 1965 and the Abortion Act 1967, they took away the death penalty from the guilty, by the State, where it belongs, and placed it on the innocent, within the family, where it does not.  Macabre or what?<br><br>P.S.  Another silly question was added later:<br><br>Q.  A reading of 2 Chronicles, 4:2 makes clear that mathematicians have for many years been under a misconception that the number pi (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter) was a transcendental number which is approximately 3.1415. The true value of pi, as the Bible makes clear in this passage, is actually 3.  Am I personally obliged to burn all maths textbooks, put to the sword as blasphemers all who propagate the false value of pi and forbid all false images of the true circle?<br><br>A.  Do you really think the ancients didn't know the value of pi?  What we have here is something us engineers call 'rounding'.  You really must deal with your bloodthirsty nature, though.  All this taking the law (or what you think it is) into your own hands just will not do.  And nit-picking over a couple of Biblical decimal points is not blasphemy.  My, isn't there some God-hating ignorance out there!<br>Click here for an in-depth article on the Value of Pi</div>

I find that the questions are very silly after I've read the chapters and verses in its context.<br><br>The books and chapters were(or are still valid) for the Jews that practiced strict Judaism. There are more than 600 commandments for Jews that practice Judaism.<br><br><strong>Gentiles or atheists need not observe these commandments.</strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>A) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates<br>a pleasing odor for the Lord (Leviticus 1: 9). The problem is my<br>neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I<br>smite them? <strong> Ans: Only the holy  priests were allowed to go to the altar to do it. Referring to the Jews only.</strong><br><br>B) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in<br>Exodus 21: 7. In this day &amp; age, what would be a fair market price<br>for her? <strong>Ans: For Jews only. She could be redeemed if she was not happy with her master. The master had not right to sell her to foreigners. Not bad.</strong><br><br>C) I know I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her<br>period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev 15: 19-24). The problem is how<br>do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. <strong>Ans: In those days no soap dah. It was about hygiene.</strong><br><br>D) Leviticus 25: 44 states that I may own slaves, both male &amp; female,<br>provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of<br>mine claims this applies to Mexicans but not Canadians. Can you<br>clarify? Why canÂ’t I own Canadians? <strong>Ans: Seems that the verses implied that it condoned slavery. The Jews could buy the slaves if there were pagans that would sell them. The Jews could not resell the slaves. </strong><br><br>E) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus<br>35: 2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally<br>obligated to kill him myself? <strong>Ans: For Jews only. </strong><br><br>F) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an<br>abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than<br>homosexuality. I donÂ’t agree, can you settle this? <strong>Ans: Not eating shellfish is not connected to homosexuality at all. Separate issue. Had to do with health that the Jews were forbidden to eat shellfish.</strong><br><br>G) Leviticus 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if<br>I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading<br>glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20 or is there some wiggle room<br>here? <strong>Ans: only applicable to healthy and fit Jewish priests who were the only ones to come close to the altar. Even ordinary healthy Jews were not allowed to approach the sacred alter.</strong><br><br>H) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair<br>around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by<br>Leviticus 19:27. How should they die? <strong>Ans: this was relevant to the Jews only. ItÂ’s like military instructions that all recruits must have crew cuts.</strong><br><br>I) I know from Leviticus 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig<br>makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves? <strong>Ans: Read from 1-8. It did not say the Jews could not keep a pig as a pet. They were forbidden to eat pork or touch a carcass. Again, it was about hygiene.</strong><br><br>J) My uncle has a farm. He violates Leviticus 19:19 by planting two<br>crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of<br>two different kinds of thread (cotton &amp; polyester blend). He tends to<br>curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all<br>the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.<br>24: 10-16). CouldnÂ’t we just burn them to death at a private family<br>affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws (Lev. 20:<br>14)?<strong>Ans: the laws are harsh but gentiles need not fear. They applied to the Jews only. A Jew who blaspheme his God was punishable by death.<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> laws are harsh but gentiles need not fear. They applied to the Jews only. </blockquote>Tis is one point which I have been debating in here before a long time ago.<br><br>God himself also told people following the rules r pleasing to his eyes and not following r displeasing to him. Even the early people of the church all followed the rules. Suddenly his other believers blatantly do not follow the rules and god is happy over it ? God really works in mysterious ways.<br><br>Jesus once say all the laws have to be followed and he himself followed them and so r his disciples. Jesus travel around jewish countries, talk to jews, performed miracles to jews, teach jews on the mountain, attend jewish festival, obey all judiasm rules and all the people who first believed him r all jews. He himself never seperate his believers into different categories and never say the rules have to go. He never say gentiles can forgo the rules. Then now christian conveniently classified themselves as gentile so they can relax on the rules. In fact jesus is always cautious about the gentiles. If u search the keyword "gentiles" during jesus time, he is always wary of them and thinking how they will get him. It only changes after paul come about<br><br>Matthew 10<br><span style="font-style: italic;">5These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. 6Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. </span><br><br>Suddenly christians, which is derived from jews say they have no similarity with them. To me, it is puzzling because u need to believe in some form of judaism first before u can be a christian. Tis is because jesus only has meaning if the OT exists. If u do not believe in OT, or some form of judaism, then jesus is not a messiah but a magician. If u do not believe in judaism and his messiah, why believe jesus is the judaism messiah ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> (christians believe jesus is the judaism messiah though jew themselves do not think so)<br><br><blockquote>For events that happened more than 4,000 years ago, one can only guess what the culture was at the point in time and the reason for God to allow some rather questonable practices to continue. </blockquote>Judaism still followed these laws isn't it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If the laws have an expiry date, then they shouldn't say it is unchanging forever.</div>
