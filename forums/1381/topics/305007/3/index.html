              <p>3. Told disciples, all believed her</p>
              <p>4. Peter come in first, found nothing then go back</p>
              <p>5. Jesus then appeared to Mary Magdalene</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now come the question, who went together with mary to the tomb ?
              Wat happened ? In Matthew jesus appeared to both Mary. In Mark,
              Mary got possessed by devils and Jesus met her then. In John Mary
              was crying out tomb then see jesus. In Luke jesus appeared to 2
              guys. SO wat really happened ? The story all contradict one
              another</p>

              <p>I tell you lah, you insulted me, you dumb schmuck. My comments are clear. If I leave no comment means it indicates that the point is correct as in the book.</p>
              <p>I'm going to take half day off this morning. I 'm going to post the relevant verses of the four gospels with reasons later. You are the one who's trying  to make the stories look silly, probably pulled out from some other like minded contributors' comments but you're not like them. They at least read through and then question the incosistencies. If they are wrong, so are you because you did not verify their questions and jumped to conclude that their speculation was without a doubt.</p>

              <p style="text-align: center;">Notes</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The authors were a tax-collector, a missionary, a Greek
              doctor and a fisherman. Each author had the liberty to omit details according
              to his purpose for writing the book. As they came from different background,
              the styles also differ.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The books were written at different times at different
              places and to present to different audience.- the Jews, the Romans, the Greeks
              and the Gentile Christians. The books also portray Jesus differently - as
              Messiah, servant of God, Savior of man and son of God. If all the books are in
              perfect agreement, anti-Christians will then allege conspiracy in the writers.
              The sole purpose is to discredit the gospels.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Four Gospels are about the birth, life, death and
              resurrection of Jesus Christ</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">After the death of Jesus,
              the stories were passed on through spoken words and it’s reasonable to expect
              some loss in accuracies. No one attempted to abrogate those verses to ‘improve
              upon’ the stories. The stories were written based on whatever the sources could
              mentally recalled - to the best of their abilities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><span> </span>After the books were completed, the numbers of words in each book
              were not the same. Another inconsistency?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">There is little disagreement between their accounts of the
              arrest, trial, death and resurrection of Jesus, and his commission to preach
              the Gospel to the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">To the Christians, these
              issues of ‘inconsistencies’ are unimportant as compared with the important
              message of Jesus Christ. Only the anti-Christians with axe to grind will use
              every means to discredit the Gospels.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Matthew
              and John were two of the twelve apostles with Jesus until his death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Mark
              and Luke were apostles of apostles. The books were written at approximately 30
              years after the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. After such a period of
              time, if the eye-witnesses failed the memory test, it’s forgivable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> One
              point that’s certain is Magdalene was the first to see Jesus after the
              resurrection. Only the book of Luke did not address this issue. There’s no
              provable contradiction for this point.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Some
              verses are specific in certain details and others are not.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If
              the points are mentioned in one book but not in another, it’s ambiguous and
              open to speculation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Any
              inconsistency that cannot be reconciled is incidentally insignificant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
              few events that are consistent in all four books are the most important to the
              Christians.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> John
              21:24-25 - Now it is this same disciple who is hereby giving his testimony to
              these things and has written them down. We know that his witness is reliable.
              Of course, there are many other things which Jesus did, and I suppose that if
              each one were written down in detail, there would not be room in the whole
              world for all the books that would have to be written.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> A
              bit of exaggeration here but it makes sense.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> I’ve
              decided not to post the verses of the four gospels here as it’s available on
              the internet. I used the NIV for verification.</span></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span>After the death of Jesus, the stories were passed on through spoken words and it’s reasonable to expect some loss in accuracies.

              </blockquote>
              <p>After saying tat "I jumped into their speculation without a doubt", u concede tat there is really an inconsistency and contradiction between the different books and agree with my speculation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. U just blame it all on the fact tat details r loss and so r accuracies after time. I don't know about u but I thought these books r probably written when the people r still alive. And these people r "spreading" the word meanwhile thus should be familiar with wat they witness. Matthew is speculated to be written about 40 while jesus is speculated to die about 33. Luke is about 80, john possibly 60 while mark is possibly earliest among the accounts. It is likely the authors still survive when writing them.</p>
              <p>Then in tat case how do u know the other part of the bible is intact. U admit tat some books lack certain points from another book and there is no way to verify its authencity. In tat case a lot of portion u read can be wrong <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> If u wanna go to detail, u will realise more inconsistency between the books. If the books contradicts one another, and u r expected to follow blindly, then wat conclusions can u derived out ? Nothing. It becomes your own religion where u believe wat u wanna believed.</p>
              <p>U can say the "anti-christian" just wanna grind their axe with christian but in actual fact they raised valid points. I think tat trivialising plus slandering people who asked these questions is really nothing more than cover up.</p>

              <p>4. How mary meet jesus (matthew: outside tomb, with another mary, before telling disciples. Mark: drive out 7 spririts from mary. Luke: never mention. John: mary cry outside tomb, after disciples left then jesus appeared)</p>

              <p>It is not about ommiting details. It is about completely different point altogether. U try to downplay it as though there is no contradictions but u failed. U cannot prove it.

              <p>Talking about human error into the bible, then u r in trouble. Which part is right or wrong ? Any part of the bible u read can be human errors.

If u go indepth, there r many more contradiction and logical flaws in the bible. Wat does it tell ?</p>

              Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven evil spirits. And she went and

              before them in their path, and said, "Peace be with you!" And they
              went forward to meet him and, clasping his feet, worshipped him. Then Jesus
              said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go now and tell my brothers to go into

              apostles. But it struck them as sheer imagination, and they did not believe the
              women. Only Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He stooped down and saw the linen
              clothes lying there all by themselves, and he went home wondering at what had

              them going off to Emmaus, a village about seven miles from Jerusalem. As they
              went they were deep in conversation about everything that had happened. While
              they were absorbed in their serious talk and discussion, Jesus himself
              approached and walked along with them, but something prevented them from recognizing
              him. Then he spoke to them, "What is all this discussion that you are
              having on your walk?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">24:18 - They stopped, their
              faces drawn with misery, and the one called Cleopas<span style="color: #0000af;"> </span>replied, "You must be the only stranger in Jerusalem who hasn't

              <p><em>Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him</em>.</p>
              <p>The above is exactly the same wording when they see jesus for the first time. Now u tell me they do not stick like glue and Mary is the one who saw it first. Says who ? U r adding in your own details into the passage which otherwise is not there. Look at who is not only dumb, but dishonest schmuck around here. If u read at it literally, they meet jesus together. Otherwise u have to prove they did not see together</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span>Was it possible that the other Mary was also present but Mark only focused on Magdalene who saw Jesus first?</span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>All the actions mentioned Mary herself and not with other people. If it is 2 people who tell the disciples at the same time, it doesn't make coherent sense tat she include one and not the other. Look at Matthew They say both women tell disciples. If u look at Luke, all the women tell all the people wat they experienced at the tomb. If u look at John. it do hint tat Mary is alone. Now u tell me Mary is not alone in Mark. Given the evidence tat there is not mention of other people, u have to prove tat out instead of speculating.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span>Luke did not say that any women had seen Jesus on their way back from the tomb. Neither did Luke said that the two men were the first to see Jesus after the resurrection on the same day. If there’s any contraction here, it’s purely speculation.</span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U failed to read properly. Luke 24:13</p>
              <p><em><strong>Now that same day</strong> two of them are going to a village called Emmaus</em></p>
              <p>It is the same day the women went to the tomb ! Dumb dishonest schmuck, r u convinced now ? And I never say tat in Luke the women saw jesus. I say they didn't. I say the first witness according to Luke r the 2 guys. Did u read at all, dumb schmuck ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span>What is important about who saw Jesus first? The stories said that he appeared to hundreds of people on different occasions.</span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I am proving there r bible contradictions and there r abundant of it. Tat becomes important. U know there r much more contradictions in the bible and if there r contradictions, anything u read from the bible can be wrong</p>

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Going by googoomuck reading ability, I can deduced who is the first witness to jesus resurrection</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Yes it is true</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>It is the Flying Spaghetti Monster !!! (to many cheers and clap)</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Why ? If u read the Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, NONE OF THEM SAYS the flying spaghetti monster is not present ! Since no one specifically mention tat line, then it means it is possible ! Tat is how googoomuck always say right ? If the bible don't mention it, he can play and twist and corrupt anything he like and just list it as "possible". Flying spaghetti monster is possible too then !</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Furthermore, if u look at Luke, John and Matthew, they never say the first people who see Jesus r Mary. Tat means the first person who witness it is someone else, and it is the flying spaghetti monster ! <strong>Just like wat googoomuck like to say. Mary appears to be alone, but no line saying she is alone, so it must means she is not alone !</strong> Wow ! Since these 3 books never say Mary is the first witness, then the first witness can be FSM ! So FSM is the first witness and googoomuck is wrong ! </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Why do the authors not include it in the bible ? It is because they forgot after some time... u know 20-30 years never write it out, their memory rusty etc. So they forgot to write accurately and leave out tis detail. U know they cater to different people and thought the details not important one... Since tis is expected, then we can expect the authors to leave out the flying spaghetti monster in their account too. U don't like wat I said ? Sorry, tat is wat googoomuck said about the authors. Don't blame me</span></p>
