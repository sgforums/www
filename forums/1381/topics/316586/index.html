              <p>A friend of mine who is attending a mega-church told me that their pastor is so well loved and he deserved every penny he is paid because of the work he has done for God. He moved thousands and brought thousands closer to God.....</p>
              <p>I wonder if the pastor can ever convert as many as a simple girl who relies soley on divine providence and guidiance. She have no fancy clothes, no fancy langauges, no fancy charismatic stage presence and certainly no fancy teachings of her.</p>
              <p>Everthing she does is according to God's will and she end up never had that BMW, condo and five figure salary....</p>
              <p>She even won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1979! Yes, this woman is Mother Teresa. You can read a brief account of her <a title="HERE" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1979/teresa-bio.html">HERE</a></p>
              <p>Well, you can judge for yourself who is doing God's will better when Jesus says that we here to serve and not to be served.</p>
              <p>Another similarity is that Mother Teresa started her own "The
                Missionaries of Charity" (like how the Pastor started their standalone church) but is was to help the poor and needy and never to enrich herself.</p>
              <p>You can actually convert much more from deeds and doing God's will than staging "fancy concerts" - what Jesus says to love your neighbour. Still thinking of out-building each other's church building?</p>
              <p>Just some food for thoughts.....</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts, I know for sure that there are many unsung heroes of God out there with a life story and testimonies that would rock the earth and put everybody squatting for awhile...Catholics or Protestants. At most they wrote a book on their life testimony.</p>

              <p>It is easy to feel close to God in happy times. Or in times of trouble.</p>
              <p>But to remain faithful your whole life time without consolation from God is something not short of miracle itself. It is a test of faith indeed. A battle which she won out.</p>

              <p>Pastors especially Protestant pastors who are allowed possesions do need money but they often put the limelight upon themselves. Which is actually very humane.</p>
              <p>It's much easier for us to adore a person than to worship God which is invisible and unknown. That's why so many do not believe in God in the first place. Though the American currency does. LOL. I guess all the American bills are going to heaven. LOL</p>

              <p>Actually, what scare me most is that most people who attend such services think that their blessings are tied to their tithing...the more you tithe, the more is your blessings. This I think is an insult to God as blessings are grace by God and can never be bought with money.</p>
              <p>They are taught by the pastors that they can ask God for anything (and to ask for the sky) since they have been "justified" by Jesus death and they are completely righteous in front of God.</p>
              <p>And to them, blessings = money (in terms of promotions, increment, bigger commissions etc..) but how many millionaires are there really in the church?</p>
              <p>How about building up their spiritual riches?</p>
              <p>Look at their testimony which almost always is about money....</p>
              <p>In life, there are up and downs...it is when the chips are down that the real test comes. Do you still have faith and trust in God when things are not going your way? Are you still willing to tithe?</p>
              <p>These are times when people leave the church thinking that God is not real....how sad?</p>
              <p>Which is why I think that such teachings are really not brining people closer to God.....in fact, they are driving people away ......forever and make them loose faith in God.</p>
              <p>My friend is "proud" to tell me that 10% of their collections are
              donated to charities - as such, they have done God's work. What do you think ?? and
              what happen to the other 90%?</p>

              <p>You are spot on......What Jesus taught is applicable to all religion in general. All he taught is humility and to love each other as how he loved us. What he described in The Last Judgement in the book of Mathew is exactly what Mother Teresa did. That is the reason why she is recognised internationally for her good work (by doing God's will).</p>
              <p>Perhaps, God is sending her to give us a living example just as all the Saints did before.</p>

              <p>Problem is, tithing is never about money in the first place. And, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tithing is not binding to all Christians and has nothing to do with faith</strong></span>. Personally, I think if one wants to give 10% 23.30% or whatever - it should be on one's own freewill.</p>
              <p>These churches has twisted it so much that they say tithing is a command from God and people who do not tithe feels guilty....</p>
              <p>They compound this by always using testimonies that someone gave and God return and the more you give (in money), the more God will give you back and that's blessings! And almost all their testimonies are about money..... You just have to go around checking and I am sure you know what kind of churches do that.</p>
              <p>To complete the insults (in my opinion), they use the money collected to pay themselves well and give 10% of their collection to chariities (from what I was told). They feel that they have done their part....I wonder what happen to ther other 90%.... trying to out-build one another and to finance someone's personal or business interest?</p>
              <p>Why are people flocking there? To get rich?</p>

              command from God and people who do not tithe feels guilty....</p>
              <p>They compound this by always using testimonies that someone gave
              and God return and the more you give (in money), the more God will
              give you back and that's blessings! And almost all their
              testimonies are about money.....</p>
              <p>Why are people flocking there? To get rich?</p>

              <p>Agreed with you fully. i think the fact that we're refering to such places as MEGAchurch is saying alot bout how things have changes church is just church God's church and that the most impt. when ppl ask which church do i go to i normally reply God's church. Why are we calling these places megachurch whats so special that they deserve the title "MEGA"?</p>
              <p>Is it based on the size of the building or the number of followers?? and do note i use "followers" rather than "believers".</p>

              <p>You selective lah. I don't remember any testimonies about money. I remember a testimony about good grades though, probably 'cos it is a youth service. Statistically, if there are many businessmen in the congregation, the chance of a money testimony is higher. You don't expect a businessman to talk about good O level results do you?</p>

              <p>Go and take a look and you will be shocked......I am not selective.....even if you just check out the fourum and you will see.....people claimed that they gave $1000 and few days later, employer mysteriously credit $5000 into his account (but never say why) and none of the other colleagues get......</p>
              <p>Give $70 and later get a job offer that pays 80% more! etc.....</p>
              <p>Everything I hear about the church is about money........and personally, I see my own friends changing....after going to such churches for a short while, he wants nothing more than monetary return (from God) and such are "blessings that we should enjoy".</p>
              <p>Beside money, they also teaches one to speak with plenty of bible verses (and it dosen't matter if they are quote dout of contec) making it impossible to communicate. Try talking about football.....</p>
              <p>By the way, if you give but no "return of investment", problem lies with your faith......</p>

              <p>Fully agree...God should come first when we go to Church. It's a community prayers to God and to hear God's Words.</p>
              <p>I started this thread just to share and remind others to reflect what they really want. Mega Churches is a good way to attract people who would normally not go to church and there is a little history that you can read <a href="http://www.blogpastor.net/category/church/megachurches/">here</a> (if you have any interest).</p>
              <p>But conversion should really come from living our lives as Christians should and reaching out to the community (like how Jesus do). Not building one's own personal interest using God's name....</p>
              <p>Some churches have mis-led and turn attention to misguided teachings leading to non-believers having a wrong impression of our faith. This will not help conversion or evangelization......</p>
              <p>Hope more people will reflect and choose wisely.......one sheep lost is one sheep too many.</p>
              <p>Christianity is about faith, hope and love. <strong>NEVER ABOUT MONEY....</strong></p>
              <p>God Bless all!</p>

              <p>At least we know now that the "pull" factor of mega churches is the entertainment......and the pastors do not need any formal training and ordination.....</p>
