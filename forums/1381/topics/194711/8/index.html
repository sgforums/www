A theologian will be more than qualified to entertain his enquiries.<br><br>I don't go round asking people on the forum on religious doubts because that would be an almost certain waste of time especially when wrong information can be given and verification of correct information on the web can be very tedious.<br><br>It is a similar situation to  having a very bad pain- would you actually log on the forum  to ask why you are having some agonising pain or would you go straight to a hospital where qualified advice would be given?<br><br></div></blockquote>1. Brey was not asking questions per se. Your reply should be reserved for people like SIS and skyfoo. (read the locked topic in CC)<br><br>2. Your analogy of the bad pain fails. A more appropriate analogy would be non life threatening every-day problems like acne or blocked nose.<br><br>A forum is a good place for discussion and learning. The one who reply can choose to do it seriously. If you do it seriously, people will be edified and your mastery of theology and language will increase.<br><br>Asking the clergy is good, but can be problematic. Imagine the email correspondence. I don't think they are that free to entertain your follow-up questions. Same for trying to fix an appointment face to face.</div>
