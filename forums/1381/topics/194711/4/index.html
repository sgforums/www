I don't think so. Just because Yehweh chose a particular race does not make Yahweh part of that race. Believing this is tantamount in beliving that the Hebrew race has pre-eminence over Yahweh.

            <div class='col-md body'>This one very interesting man...........................<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea</a><br><br>Separation of Easter from the Jewish Passover<br><br>After the June 19 settlement of the most important topic, the question of the date of the Christian Passover (Easter), was brought up. This feast is linked to the Jewish Passover, as crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus occurred during that festival. By the year 300, most Churches had adopted the Western style of celebrating the feast on the Sunday after the Passover, placing the emphasis on the resurrection, which occurred on a Sunday. Others however celebrated the feast on the 14th of the Jewish month Nisan, the date of the crucifixion according to the Bible's Hebrew calendar (Leviticus 23:5,John 19:14). Hence this group was called Quartodecimans, which is derived from the Latin for 14. The Eastern Churches of Syria, Cilicia, and Mesopotamia determined the date of Christian Passover in relation to the 14th day of Nisan, in the Bible's Hebrew calendar. Alexandria and Rome, however, followed a different calculation, attributed to Pope Soter, so that Christian Passover would never coincide with the Jewish observance and decided in favour of celebrating on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox, independently of the Bible's Hebrew calendar.<br><br>According to Duchesne,[13] who founds his conclusions:<br><br>on the conciliar letter to the Alexandrians preserved in Theodoret;[14]<br>on the circular letter of Constantine to the bishops after the council;[15]<br>on Athanasius;[16]<br>Epiphanius of Salamis wrote in the mid-4th Century, "Â… the emperor Â… convened a council of 318 bishops Â… in the city of Nicea. Â… They passed certain ecclesiastical canons at the council besides, and at the same time decreed in regard to the Passover that there must be one unanimous concord on the celebration of God's holy and supremely excellent day. For it was variously observed by peopleÂ…"[17]<br><br>The council assumed the task of regulating these differences, in part because some dioceses were determined not to have Christian Passover correspond with the Jewish calendar. "The feast of the resurrection was thenceforth required to be celebrated everywhere on a Sunday, and never on the day of the Jewish passover, but always after the fourteenth of Nisan, on the Sunday after the first vernal full moon. The leading motive for this regulation was opposition to Judaism, which had dishonored the passover by the crucifixion of the Lord."[18] Constantine wrote that: "Â… it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews, who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin, and are, therefore, deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul. Â… Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way."[19] Theodoret recorded the Emperor as saying: "It was, in the first place, declared improper to follow the custom of the Jews in the celebration of this holy festival, because, their hands having been stained with crime, the minds of these wretched men are necessarily blinded. Â… Let us, then, have nothing in common with the Jews, who are our adversaries. Â… avoiding all contact with that evil way. Â… who, after having compassed the death of the Lord, being out of their minds, are guided not by sound reason, but by an unrestrained passion, wherever their innate madness carries them. Â… a people so utterly depraved. Â… Therefore, this irregularity must be corrected, in order that we may no more have any thing in common with those parricides and the murderers of our Lord. Â… no single point in common with the perjury of the Jews."[20]<br><br>The Council of Nicaea, however, did not declare the Alexandrian or Roman calculations as normative. Instead, the council gave the Bishop of Alexandria the privilege of announcing annually the date of Christian Passover to the Roman curia. Although the synod undertook the regulation of the dating of Christian Passover, it contented itself with communicating its decision to the different dioceses, instead of establishing a canon. There was subsequent conflict over this very matter. See also Computus and Reform of the date of Easter.<br><br></div>

Paul even gave Peter, in public, a large and long-winded piece of his mind. It was not without precedent., then, when in later centuries saints, theologians, and others felt free to call various popes to task for behaviour or decisions that seemed contrary to the spirit of the gospel. For Paul, the underlying principle was that even Church leaders always must take the gospel as their ultimate standard.<br><br>About the year 49, what is sometimes called the council of jerusalem took place, and church historians call this the 1st church council. After many long and conflict-filled debates, Peter stood up to support Paul's position. Gentile converts, he said, should not be required to observe the Jewish Law. All that was necessary for baptism was faith in the risen christ, that is, a personal belief in and relationship with Christ and with the ekklesia, the Church or assembly of the faithful.</div></blockquote>when I read this, this event was mentioned in Acts 15<br><blockquote><br>Acts 15:1-2<br>1Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers: "Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved." 2This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.</blockquote>If we read further down,<br>1) it seems the dispute is not between Paul and the apostles, but rather its one between the gentiles christians (represented by Paul, Barnabas) and the the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees (not the Apostles).<br>2) this issue was brought before the Apostles and Elders for a descision.<br>3) There was no let down from Paul to Peter<br>4) Peter was the one who first stood up to relate to the conversion and the sending of the Holy Spirit to the Gentiles Believers (Acts 15:6-11), its only after the speach from Peter that the rest are willing to listen to what Paul have to say about the things God had done among the Gentile Believers.<br><blockquote><br>Acts 15:6-11<br>6The apostles and elders met to consider this question. 7After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. 8God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. 9He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. 10Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? 11No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are."</blockquote>The one that Paul oppose Peter is in Gal 2:11-21, and it happens in Antioch and not in Jerusalem, the reason is that its seems to Paul that Peter was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group and draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles (un circumcised).</div>
