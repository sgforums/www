A building is nothing but a physical  part of a church, not the whole - without the people ,without the faith  - a building is just well....a  building .<br><br>A church means the denomination as a whole when a person mentions the denomination i.e. Roman Catholic .<br><br>Calling one person's denomination a fallacy or accusing them of lies, does nothing at all except feud problems.<br><br>The bible is open to interpretation. You believe in what you want. I believe in what I want. We just practice tolerance , as in respecting each other's denomination, as all worship the same God regardless of doctrinal differences. Who is right or wrong - only God knows.  That is my point.<br><br></div>

You are casting rocks on people's beliefs and I do not believe you are without sin. </strong><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Your stance is unbiblical.<br><br>Going by your [flawed] reasoning, Apostle Paul would be the greatest rock thrower because:<br><br>1 Before he was converted, he ordered the stoning of so many Christians.<br>2. After he was converted, he wrote epistles, some of them containing his judging the beliefs of other Christians.<br><br>quote:<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The God that the muslims believe is named Allah but still the same God we all follow . They just believe that Mohammed is their prophet but they do say something as Jesus being another prophet, while we believe Christ is our saviour while the Jews believe the messiah is yet to come forth. Look at history . It is undeniable .<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Again, your argument is unbiblical.<br><br>They do not agree on the non-negotiable attributes of the Christian God. Period.[/b]</blockquote>Yes my stance is unbiblical in your terms.  Having said that ,the bible is always open to interpretation.<br><br>The apostles are human beings too and human beings are fallible. My point is that  Jesus said <strong> those who are without sin cast the first rock </strong>. Even he did not cast a single rock . However should a person wish to , they better make sure they can answer to God .<br><br>I am merely making statement based on historical facts .<br><br>The difference between the Jews , Muslims and Christians are:<br>Muslims believe that the true prophet is Mohammed<br>Jews believe that the messiah is yet to come<br>Christians believe that the Messiah came in the form of Jesus Christ and we also believe in the Holy trinity.<br><br>Look at the Koran , Torah and Bible and see the similarities for yourself.

They were from the Apostle's creed and that perspective would be better seen if you have just bothered to quote the whole comment.<br><br>definitions:<br>The word is used in two senses: the visible and the invisible church. The visible church consists of all the people that claim to be Christians and go to church. The invisible church is the actual body of Christians; those who are truly saved. The true church of God is not an organization on earth consisting of people and buildings, but is really a supernatural entity comprised of those who are saved by Jesus<br><br>And the part about church being defined in terms of denomination:<br>Roman Catholic: the Christian Church based in the Vatican and presided over by a pope and an episcopal hierarchy<br><br><strong> RC which brey brought in is the Christian Church based in Vatican and presided over by a pope and an episcopal hierarchy .
