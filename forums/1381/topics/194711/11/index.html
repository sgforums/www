Where can you get this living water? <strong>12Are you greater than our father Jacob</strong>, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?" (in my NRSV, 'father' is translated as 'ancestor')<br><br>So are Samaritians descended from Abraham? From Isaac? From Jacob?<br><br>If you want to play technicality, then I lose. But my original argument has to do with jews vs. gentiles.<br><br>For more information, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans</a><br><br>By the way, there is the Samaritan Pentateuch which is arguably closer to the Septuagint than the Masoretic Text:<br><br><blockquote>There are important differences between the Hebrew and the Samaritan copies of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. In about two thousand instances in which the Samaritan and the Jewish texts (Masoretic text) differ, the Septuagint (LXX) agrees with the former. For example, Exodus 12:40 in the Samaritan and the LXX reads, "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the land of Canaan and in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years." In the Masoretic text, however, the same passage reads, "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years." The New Testament, when quoting from the Old Testament, agrees as a rule with the Samaritan text, where that differs from the Masoretic text.</blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch</a><br><br>So the Samaritan Pentateuch is definitely not heretical by any standard. Hence I have pre-empted anyone from using the Muslims-and-Jews-also-children-of-Abraham argument as a counter-point.<br><br>I hope I have destroyed your present.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession."<br><br>23Jesus did not answer a word.

And when Jesus appeared in Israel, this was the kingdom He offerred to the Jews exclusively.<br><br>In this Kingdom however, there is a promise that if Israel will accept this Kingdom [by accepting their king] they would be a blessing to all the world [Gentiles]<br><br>When they rejected their King, this Kingdom was put on hold till the second coming.<br><br>4) the Kingdom of the Church<br><br>This was began in Pentecost and ends in the Rapture. All of those who belong to this kingdom will rule with Christ in the Mellinium.<br><br>5) the mixed kingdom form<br><br>All who profess [not necessarily converted truly]  that Christ is their Lord belong to this kingdom...this is what we call 'Christendom'<br><br>Mix because this is a mix group -saved and unsaved. Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons and  true believers belonging to different churches are in this group.<br><br>this is spoken of in:<br><br>Mt 13:41 "The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather <strong>out of His kingdom </strong>all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness,<br><br>During the second coming all the fakes in Christendom will be exposed.<br><br>6) The spiritual kingdom<br><br>all sinners from Adam to the last day who are truly repentant and converted belong to this Kingdom. The true converts now who belong to the Church belong to this kingdom. Those who are truly converted during Christ our Lord was here belong to this kingdom. Those who were converted during Israel days past belong to this kingdom.<br><br>Those who were truly converted during pre-Israel days belong to this kingdom. those in the Mellinium who are truly converted belong to this kingdom.<br><br>When the Lord Jesus was here he offered the promised kingdom prophecied in the OT. They [Jews] rejected it and so it was put on hold. Today the form of the Kingdom is the Church.<br><br>Note: there is an overlapping of kingdoms. The spiritual kingdom and the mix form kingdom and the universal kingdom overlap in whatever time frame they may be in from the Fall to the close of time.<br><br>for example: in these age. those who are trulu repentant belong to the spiritual kingdom and also belong to the Church. And since Satan works overtime now sowing tares, there is also the mix form of the kingdom but since God rules all in the universe, all these belong to the universal kingdom.<br><br></div>

I believe that Jesus was sent to save mankind and through his acts of tolerance, kindness and compassion, he probably hoped that  we would follow his examples so that more people will convert because of the nature of what he preached.<br><br>I don't recall reading  about Jesus correcting people on the name of God  or saying that Judaism is wrong. Remember Jesus, in human form , was born a Jew too except he was one with a higher power and purpose- the messiah , to unite all men in the belief of God and salvation regardless of whether they were jewish or not.<br><br>What I also believe is that Christianity branches out from Judaism - the faction of Jews ,and gentiles in those tumultous persecutory days, who believed that Jesus was the saviour , were in fact  our very first Christians. </div></blockquote>Because Yahshua did not need to, they knew the name of Yahweh... YHVH.<br><br>What you forget my friend is that the early "christian" church did keep the feasts and ordanances of Yahweh. Yahshua would not have taught any differnt.</div>

[b] You get your facts straight. </strong><br><br>Right and good in God's eyes doesn't mean that you can go around preaching your self righteous and petty  thoughts on how great you are in calling God "Yahweh" or how bad my punctuation is .<br><br><strong> My point in summary : Respect other people's beliefs and stop judging them . </strong><br><br>Remember what Christ said  to the Pharisees: let he who has not sin cast the first rock. You are casting rocks on people's beliefs and I do not believe you are without sin.<br><br>The God that the muslims believe is named Allah but still the same God we all follow . They just believe that Mohammed is their prophet but they do say something as Jesus being another prophet,  while we believe Christ is our saviour while the Jews believe the messiah is yet to come forth. Look at history .  It is undeniable .<br><br>God is known by many names . His true name cannot be uttered for it is powerful . Does not matter if God is named Allah , Jehovah, Yahweh,  Yehovah, God, Yeshua. God of the Jews , God of Moses , God of Abraham etc  . God is God - the almighty creator of heaven and earth and all things living .<br><br>My question to you is that DO YOU YOURSELF KNOW WHAT GOD IS ABOUT <strong> than </strong> what you think God is about? God is the creator  - yes most christians know that . God gave us our ten commandments - yes most christians know that .<br><br>What we also know is that all major religions also preach the same moral conduct that is required - goodness is universal - you do not need to know that lying is a sin, murder is a sin etc.  [/b]</blockquote>What I am getting at is that we worship YAHWEH, not allah, that is not the God of Abraham, nor is allah the God of Moshe.<br><br>Whilst religions preach similar moral values, from a "christian" viewpoint, only one thing will guarantee you your salvation, belief in YAHSHUA and thus having a personal relationship with YAHWEH.<br><br>Does it mean that because I do not agree with you, I am judging you?
