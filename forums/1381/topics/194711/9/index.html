The rest of the street christians ( as I call them) just tell me in not so many words that I better convert to their whatever beliefs and be rebaptised or else prepare to burn in hell since my soul won't be saved.<br><br>That is not how conversion or change happens - it does not matter how many people you can shove your beliefs down their throats or how many you can gather into one church   . It is how you act towards others that make people convert. Just like how Jesus and his apostles and his many martyred followers converted masses through their pacifism and actions til Christianity with all its many branches became one major religion of the world.<br></div>

The rest of the street christians ( as I call them) just tell me in not so many words that I better convert to their whatever beliefs and be rebaptised or else prepare to burn in hell since my soul won't be saved.<br><br>That is not how conversion or change happens - it does not matter how many people you can shove your beliefs down their throats or how many you can gather into one church   . It is how you act towards others that make people convert. Just like how Jesus and his apostles and his many martyred followers converted masses through their pacifism and actions til Christianity with all its many branches became one major religion of the world.<br></div></blockquote>I stick to the reformed position - Christians are to preach the gospel, conversion is done by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>And what is the gospel? I leave you to find out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Historically, Jesus and his apostles and their martyred followers did not convert through pacifism and actions.
