            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Icemoon:<br>quote:<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by vince69:<br>Icemoon, I give you a present, John 4, After Jesus' talk with the Samaritian woman, she believed, and because of her testimonies, many other Samaritians also believed, and He stays with them 2 days.<br><br>NOTE: Samaritians are not Jews.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Oh yea .. you 'd be surprised how I can wrangle myself out of this predicament.<br><br>You conveniently leave out verses 11 and 12 - "Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? 12Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?" (in my NRSV, 'father' is translated as 'ancestor')<br><br>So are Samaritians descended from Abraham? From Isaac? From Jacob?<br><br>If you want to play technicality, then I lose. But my original argument has to do with jews vs. gentiles.<br><br>For more information, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans<br><br>By the way, there is the Samaritan Pentateuch which is arguably closer to the Septuagint than the Masoretic Text:<br><br>quote:<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>There are important differences between the Hebrew and the Samaritan copies of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. In about two thousand instances in which the Samaritan and the Jewish texts (Masoretic text) differ, the Septuagint (LXX) agrees with the former. For example, Exodus 12:40 in the Samaritan and the LXX reads, "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the land of Canaan and in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years." In the Masoretic text, however, the same passage reads, "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years." The New Testament, when quoting from the Old Testament, agrees as a rule with the Samaritan text, where that differs from the Masoretic text.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch<br><br>So the Samaritan Pentateuch is definitely not heretical by any standard. Hence I have pre-empted anyone from using the Muslims-and-Jews-also-children-of-Abraham argument as a counter-point.<br><br>I hope I have destroyed your present.   [/b]</blockquote>What jews vs gentiles ? Are you jewish or are you gentile ?<br><br>How do you define a jew then?Have you undergone bar mitzvah? Do you eat Kosher food? Can you recite the Torah? Can you speak Hebrew and understand the rabbis in the siddur when they say the prayers in aramaic?<br><br>Of course we can use your quote of a samaritan who is a descendent of Jacob - read 21 and onwards but they are by blood lines hebrews in part. Can't be a jew unless you are born of a jewish aka Hebrew mother - that birthright according to the <span style="font-style: italic;"> halakha </span> you will be a jew.<br><br>Of course we can talk conversion which is very very hard  - however how many factions of jews (except maybe the progressive ones  ) would recognise you as a jew if you don't have that right by birth? Only if you marry a jewish woman then your child will be recognised as a jew but you - hard to say.<br><br></div>

You like me have your own agendas and your own opinions to put forth, what you call feedback I call criticism.
