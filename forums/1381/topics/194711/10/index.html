I leave you to find out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Historically, Jesus and his apostles and their martyred followers did not convert through pacifism and actions. You read the bible, how many conversions happened like that?</div></blockquote>Think about it. The New testament part of the bible tells us what the apostles witnessed ( like the crucification of Christ) , and their preaches about the teaching of Christ but it most certainly does not tell you much about the history of their lives and how early christianity went up against Pagan religions of the Great Roman Empire or other pagan religions of minority groups.  They died for their unrelenting belief in the Christian faith- peter was crucified upside down ( upside down at his request) . Those are actions.<br><br>Emperor Constantine used Christianity as a tool (wrong as it is but it started its very first steps into becoming a major world religion)  to unify the Roman empire as a result of  the actions of those strong believers who would not believe in anything else except God and would die for that belief ( non pacifistic action again) . Just historical facts- check it up , tis all.<br><br>Jesus is a pacifist who used actions to convert the masses - the mosaic law stated that an adultress had to be stoned to death - but Jesus forgave that woman and told her to sin no more. Jesus also said Love thy neighbour, and the famous "turn the other cheek" . Alot of these teachings are pacifistic in nature. That is just some of the pacifist actions that Jesus preached and did , according to the New testament of the Bible. He opened the Kingdom to the non jews through preaching christian ideals of love, kindness and humility. He did not fight the authorities who sought to crucify him.  Jesus performed miracles (another form of action)  and he did what he preached - forgiveness,love,  compassion and kindness towards each other - I call that actions of pacifism.  Aplenty in the bible for all those examples of pacifistic type of actions ...and the bible is used to spread to good words of our Lord. In the early days - maybe parts of what the apostles wrote to different areas they were in.<br><br>So what is the use of preaching without practising what you preach? Those very first christians who truly believed- through their actions - that is how Christianity became one of the world's largest religion. Right or not?<br></div>

The majority and influential were pagans.<br><br><blockquote>Jesus is a pacifist who used actions to convert the masses - the mosaic law stated that an adultress had to be stoned to death - but Jesus forgave that woman and told her to sin no more. Jesus also said Love thy neighbour, and the famous "turn the other cheek" . Alot of these teachings are pacifistic in nature. That is just some of the pacifist actions that Jesus preached and did , according to the New testament of the Bible.</blockquote>There is not much evidence from Scripture to suggest people were converted becaue of the said actions.<br><br>On the contrary, Jesus claimed he came not to bring peace but a sword. He also told the rich man to give up his wealth.<br><br><blockquote>He opened the Kingdom to the non jews through preaching christian ideals of love, kindness and humility. He did not fight the authorities who sought to crucify him.  Jesus performed miracles (another form of action)  and he did what he preached - forgiveness,love,  compassion and kindness towards each other - I call that actions of pacifism.  Aplenty in the bible for all those examples of pacifistic type of actions ...and the bible is used to spread to good words of our Lord. In the early days - maybe parts of what the apostles wrote to different areas they were in. </blockquote>Jesus did not open the kingdom to non jews, in fact you'll be hard pressed to find evidence of non-jews converted in the gospel by Jesus. It was Paul who opened the Kingdom to the gentiles.<br><br>Furthermore, it was recorded that John the Baptist had a sizeable number of followers and he led them to Jesus. And what was John's style of preaching? "Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand!" In other words, he used threats to convert.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>So what is the use of preaching without practising what you preach? Those very first christians who truly believed- through their actions - that is how Christianity became one of the world's largest religion. Right or not? </blockquote>The reason why Christianity became one of the world's largest religion is because of mass prostylesing (sp?) by the Roman Catholics like the Jesuits. They worked hand in hand with the merchants and colonizers.<br><br>In fact, I suspect Christianity experienced large growth during its dark period like the Crusades and Inquisition when pacifist actions were obviously not the norm.</div>
