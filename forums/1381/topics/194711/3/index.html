So do you think that God will change everything just because of us gentiles? No. If we choose God, then we also choose to be HIS people, just as the Jews are. We are grafted in to the true vine, and guess what the part that is grafted in takes on the properties of the vine itself and does not display any of its own properties anymore.<br><br>Going back to fundamentals is also going back to God's ways not just jewish ways. You cannot read the new testament without first accepting and acknowledging that the old testament applies.<br><br>Why can you not see that we are Yahweh's children, so we follow HIS ways.<br>Know this, when Pual was preaching, he was still very much aware of the commandments of Yahweh. </div></blockquote>The issue between gentile and jewish christians have been settled long long long long ago between Paul and Peter.

            <div class='col-md body'>I like this statement I found from the WEFC website,<br>' Chrysostom, an early church father, put it well when he said," In essentials, unity. In non-essentials, charity. In all things, Jesus Christ." Within the Evangelical Free Church there can be close Christian Fellowship even though there may be differences of opinion in some minor areas of doctrine"<br><br>What I understand this to be is that in major issues (essentials), there must be agreement.<br>example:<br>That we are justified and received salvation by the grace of God, through the works of our Lord Jesus Christ (which our works does not added to it, neither is our lack of works able to substract from it).<br><br>The Holy Trinity that God, Christ, Holy Spirit are three and also one<br><br>The absolute authority of the Bible as the written word of God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br><br>... etc<br><br>And in minor issues (non-essentials), there are room for differences,<br>example:<br>Water baptism, by sprinkle or immersion (my take is that this is just an outward expression of what had already taken place inside)?<br>Speaking in tongues, to speak or not to speak (my take is, if not comfortable, then don't)?<br><br>...etc<br><br>this is just my thought.<br>peace and God bless.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I have said before that the verse on "Judging" is totally misrepresented.
