            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys...<br><br>(1A) You reap what you sow, you get what you give. If you tithe you will receive more blessings from God. If you don't tithe, you cannot expect to receive the same amount of blessings from God against someone who tithes.<br><br>(1B) Offering is a very sacred duty for christians to comply. If you do not understand the meaning of offering. Please kindly refrain from giving. If you have a grudge against any of your brother, leave your offering at the side, make peace with your brother before giving.<br><br>(2A) Tongues roll out without order.<br><br>(2B) read 1 Cor 14<br><br>Please observe the contrast between (A) &amp; (B).<br>(1A) is telling the believer that the blessings we receive from God is proportional to the amount of money we give to the church. However we must know that God loves everyone equally. Whether we tithe of do not tithe, it makes no difference to God for he was hung on the cross for all. So that anyone who believes in him will have access to his Kingdom. In regards to (1B) giving to God 10% of our income is an order from God. However he want us to give correctly with the right mindset. How dare anyone bargain with God for his blessings with our worthless earthly currency. Let those who do this remember the story of Achan. Let those who do not do this remember the incident when Jesus said those who are without sin may throw the 1st stone.<br><br>(2A) is a typical scenario in some churches in the world now. Only the person who speak in tongues know whether is he really speaking with the manifestation from God or is he merely speaking in his own tongue. However I must remind that if he is speaking in his own tongue yet claiming to be Godly language is tantamount to poking fun at God. Let him answer for his own actions. (2B) states a chapter on the correct use of tongues. We are all mere fools if we were to look at the standard of God's borderless intellegence. How dare one pick on God's gifts and poke fun at it. Again let those who do this remember the story of Achan &amp; let those who do not do this remember the incident when Jesus said those who are without sin may throw the 1st stone.<br><br>God is omni-present, borderless powerful, absolute authority. Those who play around with his authority will ultimately pay the price. But it is not up to man to decide how much the price will be. But rather advise him like a brother on what is not to be done. If he does not listen after your advises, distance yourself from his acts. But maintain your brotherhood love with him and convince him not by mere words. Rather with real actions. So that when he sees it, he will be convinced. It is a tough route to take. But what is this compared to the humiliation and pains Jesus shouldered for a world of sinners.<br><br>I personally dun think I have a right to tell any christians off for doing wrong. Because I too am a sinner. But let those who failed to see the truth receive the true blessings from God to see. I was advised by church workers from Campus crusade but I insisted with twisted theories from the false teachings that I was right. But I was totally humbled and proven wrong time and again with the mercy of Christ. I was from charismatic church before. I have since distanced myself from the movement. And the best way to help another person is not via arguments. We are not up to the standard to challenge the devil. Only let God do what he wants and we do what we're supposed to.<br><br>God bless you all.<br></div>
