They had to convert their money into temple currency to purchase sacrificial animals and to pay the temple tax. The inflated rates and exorbitant prices infuriated Jesus.<br><br>(2) The stalls were set up in the court of the Gentiles section of the temple, thus hindering its purpose as a space for the non-Jews to come to worship God. Thus Jesus cried out Â“My house shall be a house of prayer for ALL NATIONS, but you have made it into a den of ROBBERS.Â”"<br></div></blockquote>commerce, in itself is not wrong. neither is trying to grow the church's investment.<br><br>the problem is that when such commercial ventures come into conflict with biblical teaching eg, renting of the church premises to activites such as seminars conducted by other religions.<br><br>the question of Rock Productions' (or whatever it is called) involvement with regards to the activity stated in this link<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=259564" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=259564</a> was never really answered.<br></div>

Heard of this story - the wolf in sheep's clothing?<br>I say: you are very naive and most of your postings show that!<br></div></blockquote>Lets say this pastor, all he does are things that glorify God. Does his intentions matter? Even if the intentions were bad(which is most probly not) while his actions are good, these actions would only manifest a good effect.<br><br>So does intentions(your wolf thing) matter if his ALL actions show a sheep?<br><br>In other words, so what if his intentions are anti-christ natured while ALL that he does is for christ.<br><br>Therefore, it is either you mistaken the actions or you mistaken your so-thought motive and this is my stand.<br><br>(This is my first time using the word 'manifest' so, you get what i mean...may be used wrongly...)</div>
