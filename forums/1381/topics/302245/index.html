            <div class='col-md body'>One morning, little Johnny asked his mum what is "making out". His mum told him to hide behind the curtain at night and see what his elder sister and her boyfriend were doing.<br><br>The next morning, little Johnny told his mum what is "making out":<br><br>"When big sis and her boyfriend came home last night, they sat on the cushion and started kissing each other.<br><br>Big sis was having a fever, cos she said she's very hot. Apparently her boyfriend is a doctor, he put his hand on her face to check her temperature, then into her shirt to check her heart beat.<br><br>Big sis's fever was getting worse, she was squirming and slid down the cushion. She was getting breathless and her boyfriend removed her bra to help her breathing easier.<br><br>Then big sis removed his pants and an eel jumped out! Big sis was swearing that its the biggest she's ever seen. I should have told her about those big eels down in the lake!<br><br>She tried to kill the eel by biting its head off, but the eel was still alive after 5 minutes.<br><br>Big sis then took out a mask and covered the eel's head. I think they're afraid that the eel will bite them.<br><br>Big sis sat on the eel to crush it. It must have hurt, cos she's screaming her lungs out. After grinding for 10 minutes, the eel was still alive!<br><br>Her boyfriend then climbed on top of her and they tried to squash the eel between them.<br><br>After a while, both of them stopped moving.
