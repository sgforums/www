              <p>I guess most Christians are still wondering how much God really participates in their life and many I think doubt that God works in their life.</p>
              <p>Well I have a really simple way of proving that God cares and it definitely works 100%. But do this not to test God(you must have faith here).</p>
              <p>You know most people dream and sometimes we have those nightmares or those uncomfortable dreams. Well if you're Christian and really believe in God do the following while you're having a nightmare or any uncomfortable dream:</p>
              <p>when having nightmare call out to God. You don't need to shout really a whisper in your heart would do. If you're having nightmare the nightmare would immediately stop and you would open your eyes and realize that it was just a dream. The point is the nightmare has been abruptly stopped.</p>
              <p>Sometimes when having an uncomfortable dream like for example being unable to move in the dream, you could also ask for God's intervention. If you ask to be able to move then you would be freed to move about in that dream if you ask to be freed from the whole experience you would wake up immediately.</p>
              <p>I know this may sound silly but like I said you must have faith when you try this. IMO this is the easiest way to see that God does work.</p>
              <p>I know many people would consider asking God's help while having a bad dream would be impossible as we have no consciousness in dreams but people who truly believe that there is God would carry that belief even into their sleep. The worse the nightmare the easier for you to remember to invoke God's help.</p>
              <p>I hope you remember what I told you here and practise it. Do not be scared by whatever you encounter in your dream.</p>
              <p>Well actually there is of course another more obvious way like driving demon out from your presence but.....like I said the dream is easier in terms that you do not need somebody to send you demon and such.</p>
              <p>Hope you grow in faith.</p>
