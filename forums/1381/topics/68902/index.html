            <div class='col-md body'>An issue that is currently debated relates to the use of masculine language and imagery for God. In the last few decades some have called for change in the masculine language we use for God. Advocates of this position usually argue that the Bible's references to God as 'Father' are metaphorical and there can be replaced. Masculine language may have been an acceptable way to communicate within the patriachal cultures of the past, but it is no longer appropriate in today's world. With respect to this issue, evangelical theologians would probably agree on a number of important points.<br><br>First, that God chose to reveal Himself as Father,Son and Holy Spirit. This language is not simply the product of human thought about God. Second, 'Father' is a designation that stresses the personal nature of the relations between Father,Son and Holy Spirit, and the personal nature of God's relations with His redeemed people. As such, it cannot be replaced by a less personal designation. It is not sufficient, for example, to name the persons of the Godhead simply as Creator, Redeemer, and Comforter. Third, the Bible's masculine imagery for God does NOT imply any kind of biological sexuality in God. The categories 'male' and 'female' are God's creation. God Himself transcends sexuality. That is why the Bible can occasionally use feminine imagery to speak of God (Isaiah 49:15,  66:13). Fourth, t5he kind of harsh patriachal authority that has often characterised human society should not be read into the biblical picture of God as Father. Human fatherhood, with all its imperfections and cultural variations, is not the measure of divine fatherhood( Matthew 7:11).  Fifth, in the mystery of the incarnation, the eternal Word was forever linked with the human race as the man, Jesus Christ. So in the case of Christ, we cannot abandon masculine language without throwing the reality of the incarnation into question.<br><br>(Doctrines of God - Naming and describing God by Tim Wiarda, Singapore Bible College)<br><br>to be continue...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.....continued<br><br>The primary issue here is not whether terms such as 'Father' and 'Son' are metaphors, but whether they are replaceable metaphors. Some concept only come to adequate expression by means of a particular metaphor; if you change the metaphorical expression in such cases, you change the concept itself. To address God as 'Father' is to acknowledge that he relates to us in a certain way. What happens to our concept of God if we change the metaphor? Let's say we only use a sexually neutral term like 'Creator' or 'Redeemer.' The problem with this kind of language is that it fails to convey the personal dimension of God's relationship to us- the way he loves us. Such terms are not wrong, but they are imcomplete. What happens if we call call God 'Mother'? Many suggested the mothe rimagery tends toward a pantheistic conception of God's relationship to the world. It suggests that the world emanated from God and that we are ultimately part of God. We are distinct persons, and can therefore relate to a transcendent God in a relationship marked by genuine love. It this is the case, then replace masculine imagery with feminine would lead to a change in the concept of God that He Himself has given us in the Scripture.<br><br>References:<br><br>"Can a mother forget the baby at her breast<br>and have no compassion on the child she has borne?<br>Though she may forget,<br>I will not forget you!"
