              <p>RIght i just got home from a trip to NTUC. I was totally freaked out by this old lady at the supermarket.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was with my Chinese friend (neighbour) and we fancied a drive (you know to go and eat and stuff late at night) and so we stop at the NTUC and I'm browsing through some foodstuffs for the family, and there is this old lady (about 40+ years) wandering aimlessly with her basket. So anyway, i don't care right? So i'm looking through the food while talking to my friend in mandarin (from CHina, PRC) about academic stuff. And i think this old lady starts looking at me in a weird way, just coz i speak mandarin.</p>
              <p><br>Anyway, so i smile and give a friendly nod, and she goes like;</p>
              <p><br><br>Old lady: WHERE ARE YOU FROM!?!? (in a creepy interrogative sort of way)</p>
              <p>[my chinese friend doesn't speak english properly, so she was out of the conversation entirely]</p>
              <p>me: erm... somewhere not here..</p>
              <p>Old lady: OH REALLY!?? WHERE?</p>
              <p>Me: erm.. europe?</p>
              <p>Old lady: Oh! Wow. Are you CHRISTIAN?!</p>
              <p>Me: Errr- nope, Definitely not!</p>
              <p>Old lady: Oh why? Why aren't you a Christian. I am one.</p>
              <p>Me: Err, Just don't believe in it, no1 does anymore, except the yanks and the Asians who think it is western to do so.</p>
              <p>(i have strong feelings about religion and i would have gone on a tirade lecture of how Christianity imperilled the political system of europe and flouted state authority and waged countless wars for corrupt practices of the former catholic church; BUT i chose not to, i could tell she was weird and i was trying to leave)</p>
              <p>Old lady: IS your father a Christian?</p>
              <p>Me: Ofcourse not. No [I am walking away now]</p>
              <p>Old lady: What abou your mother? IS she Christian?</p>
              <p>Me: ......</p>
              <p>Old lady: Why not?</p>
              <p><br>[i got so creeped out by the way she was looking at me, i just walked off, and she kept staring at me after that]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Weird..</p>
              <p>This is the sort of women i attract in Singapore HA HA HA!!! At 12 in the morning. Be careful when you do your late-night shopping rofl!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's a nice story i thought i'd share.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s to the old lady if you're reading this; or if your tech savvy son is, i didn't mean to be rude, but you were REALLY creeping me out with the christian nonsense.</p>

              because of some of their belief system are so illogical, like eternal hell for non believers, other religions are evil or satanic.
              
              a true religion will not accuse other religions as evil and false and that its own religion is true and one and only.

              also they think the end of the world is coming.
              
              I say until that day comes, heck with it. we have passed the year 2000, and we are still living to this present day 2009.
              
              I have other things to worry than worry about the end of the world.

              <p>Hoho! My friend tells me a story about what his friend did when she got approached by a christian man (30s) spreading religion at choa chu kang mrt some time ago.</p>
              <p>This friend, let's call her Carla, started retorting the man with the exact same question the man asked her abt religion.</p>
              <p>I guess it went something like this:</p>
              <p>Man: R u a christian?</p>
              <p>Carla: No.</p>
              <p>Man: Hav u been to a church... understd christiny abt how jesus sacrifice himself for us?</p>
              <p>Carla: No. I believe in buddhism.</p>
              <p>Man: Let me tell u abt jesus....blab blab</p>
              <p>Carla: I'm not into other religion, thanks for ur time.</p>
              <p>Man conts to pester on.</p>
              <p>Carla (pissed off): Why dun u believe in buddhism?Do u know u can reborn in buddhism? etc etc etc</p>
              <p>So it became a case of both trying to "convert" one another. Finally, the man shake head and walks off.</p>

              I remembered when I was in Melbourne many years ago taking a tram, an aussie guy came out to know and took out his notebook and invited me to his church and asked me for his details. that time i was quite young, didnt know how to reject or say no to him, so I just gave him a fake number.
              
              He took down my details and then left me alone and alighted the tram.

              he didnt wink or show any other body language when he approached me. I think he was more intent on inviting me to his church.
              
              on hindsight i should have said no, sorry mate, I am not interested, but if I said no, he would have preached to me lol in the tram.
