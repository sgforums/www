            <div class='col-md body'>1st of all pls dont flame me. My sincere apology if this thread cause some discomfort as i have posted similar question in the buddist side thread i am not finding trouble juz seeking some ans..<br><br>All religion talk abt faith, like me, if i happen to 'lost' my way and now in a grey area.. if u were in my position wad would u do? I have got some advice from the other threads and i am not using this as a mutiple choice to chose my faith. Just hoping to get some ans.<br><br>yes i have read abt histories of religion, i know the existence of christ and lord buddha cannt be denied so are all other religion hindu etc.. There are stories abt them all.. But how sure can we be that since pass down from long time ago, r we practising the 'true' way? Will be be practising distorted fact since it is pass on long ago? I used to be a buddist but i also respect other religion but i cant understand y suddenly i just lost my faith in these. Is it because my faith is not strong enough to withstand failure? If thats the case how do we make it stronger? I am not a christian but i do pray to him and ask him for forgiveness and pray safety sometime when i am down. I did the same in the buddist way. Am i being to fickle minded by praying to both that cause me to 'lost' my way?<br><br>Nw as i mention i m in the grey area, i m very very lost. If christ is son of god and more or less is a 'saint' y cant his disicple attain the same lvl as christ? I am really not very sure what is going on in me, apparently i am trying to seek out some impossible ans..<br><br>PS: My sincere apology if i have offend anyone with this..<br></div>

We are asked to live our lives like he did, and to die like him even. Not everyone will die nailed to a cross, but all will suffer a martyrdom of sorts, whether trying to conquer some addiction or facing unfair treatment at work. Through our daily living we are able to put the imitation into action.<br><br>If you are interested, I recommend you read The Imitation of Christ by Thomas Ã  Kempis.<br><br><a href="http://www.leaderu.com/cyber/books/imitation/imitation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaderu.com/cyber/books/imitation/imitation.html</a></div>

However, it is always this Strength within you that you have which will guide you. Now, this strength has no relation with any religions, because it is your own unique Strength.<br><br>So long as you have Virtues and Wisdom, you don't have to label yourself to a certain religion. You might already have Love itself, but you do not need a religion to 'certify' or affirm you that you are Love..<br><br>For me, my belief is believing in the Essence of All Teachings. Because so long as you feel from your heart, that it is beneficial to you, then go ahead.. Because it is what you truly believe in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>that's all.. please let me know should you have any questions over my reply.

Will be be practising distorted fact since it is pass on long ago?</div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">Dear me_a_clone,<br><br>long ago, many people in India felt just as confused as you. Because there were so many religious teachers who visited the towns, and they all insisted on their own beliefs and criticized others. And since everyone claimed that only what they say is true and the others are not, the people in the towns were very confused about who to believe. But when a teacher named Siddhartha Gautama passed by their town, they asked him for his opinion on what to believe, and this is what he replied:<br><br>It is only natural for you to doubt, to question. My advice to you is not to believe something just because that's what you always hear. Do not believe something just because it's been around for a long time. Do not believe something just because it's popular or because it's written in scriptures. Do not believe something based on your guesses or what has always been thought to be true. Do not believe something just because it sounds right to you or because you think that it has got be true. In fact, do not believe something just because the person who told you is respectable or has great abilities.<br><br>Only when you've really experienced something for yourself, and know that it benefits everyone and leads to happiness, stick by it, and when you've experienced something for yourself, and know that it causes harm, abandon it.</span></div>
