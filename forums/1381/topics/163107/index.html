You give what you see fit. Your gift to God is personal, it's between you and God.

I did not imply that one should give more or less.<br>One should give according to the attitude of the heart.<br>This is a more concerning factor in spiritual aspect.<br>For Money, in my perspective. I'll leave it to the Head of the church to settle.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> My money is a form of worship onto God. Period.<br>If i get this straight, everything regarding Christian Living will be set consistent. </span><br><br>e]While i agree that ppl can still worship God outside or in their homes, why cant they worship 24 hrs a day 7 days a week even at their workplace or homes?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Let's bring ourselves back to the topic yea?<br><br>Church tithing and offering comprises a few aspect. (again you may wish to differ)<br><br>::: Church Worshipper<br>::: Church<br>::: Spiritual issue of stweardship in possesions of wealth.<br><br>A christian can worship at home. But can the christian give his/her tithings and offerings in their own homes?<br>The medium to tithings and offerings is the church.<br><br>Likewise, The place to worship and gather among believers is the church.<br>Church is the medium to gather all worshippers in one goal. - To Give Please God in unison.<br><br><strong>The parallel is suppose to paint the picture: - that if one seems more generous and cheerfully in offering money, it should not at any reason to influence any others to do the similiar. Likewise it applies to Worship</strong><br><br>Tithing and Offerings - Money and expression of Love<br>Worship offerings - Time and intangibles/expression of Love.<br><br>It does relates yeah?</span><br><br>f]Worship not restricted to church bcos God not just found in church. So we go out into the world &amp; act like demons?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I need your definition of Church and Demons.<br>I can't find the link. Even with believers all worshipping in Church only(restricted). i don't see how they can go out in the world and act like demons.<br><br>This is puzzling, i'm eager to see a logic in this statement.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> I'm even more interested to know where you got this thought from </span><br><br>g]If we just worship God on sunday &amp; then worship other things on mon to fridays, then how can God still love you?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Frankly? You want the theology of God(MC's version)?<br>God will still love to the extend which is boundless - uncomprehensive.<br>Other than bringing/discussing about the wrath of God - we should have a common understanding that no matter what a believer does or sin,<br>It is the will of God to bring this believer back to HIS side.<br>It all boils down to love. </span><br></div>
