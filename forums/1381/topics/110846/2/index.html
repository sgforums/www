Mok was looking at ThamÂ’s expression, as if waiting for a response, but in his heart, he thought that he has won the argument. He has proven that an all-loving and all-powerful God could not have existed.<br><br>Then Tham broke the silence.<br><br>1SG Tham: Maybe God could have prevented the human tragedies but He did not, I donÂ’t know why. But then, it is not the only thing I donÂ’t understand. I donÂ’t understand how and why God created this world, and I donÂ’t know why He gave humans intelligence that has no equal among animals. I donÂ’t comprehend why when humanity failed Him and rebel against Him, He chose to send His only begotten Son to die on the cross so that those that believe in Him would not parish. Above all, I donÂ’t know why a sinful man like me can escape His wrath and instead, become a recipient of His grace.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This piece appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald. I think it helps understand a little better the mystery:<br><br>Waves of destruction wash away belief in God's benevolence<br>December 30, 2004<br><br>Compassion is the best response when humanity faces the problem of evil, writes Edward Spence.<br><br>"Why did you do this to us, God? What did we do to upset you?" asked a woman in India this week, a heart-wrenching question asked in common these past few days by Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Christians. Nothing could have prepared us for what happened when the tsunami unleashed its terror. So we seek answers where answers are hard to come by, in either secular or sacred realms.<br><br>Traditionally, the Judeo-Christian God, considered the most supreme and perfect being in the universe, has been ascribed the following necessary attributes: omniscience (all-knowing), omnipresence (present everywhere at all times and at once), omnipotence (almighty and powerful) and benevolence (all good and caring).<br><br>How, then, did a God as powerful and benevolent as this allow such a thing to happen? If he is benevolent then he cannot also be omnipotent, for a God who has both these attributes would have wanted to, cared to and been able to prevent such a catastrophe.<br><br>Perhaps, though omnipotent, He is not benevolent. That might explain why, although it was within His power to stop the tsunami, He simply chose not to: God has His own reasons and we are not to ask why. However, this answer will not suffice since by definition God is perfect. Being perfect, He must of necessity not merely be omnipotent but benevolent as well.<br><br>A possible solution to this problem, traditionally known as the problem of evil, was offered by the heretical Manicheans, who believed not in one supreme being but two: one good God responsible for all the good things in life and another bad God, Satan, responsible for all the evil in the world.<br><br>St Augustine, a follower in his early 20s, became an ardent critic of this doctrine, thinking a weak God powerless to defeat Satan was not worth worshipping.<br><br>Philosophically, if God is perfect, then there can be only one perfect God, not two. In any case, evil is an imperfection and thus not a characteristic that can be attributed to God.<br><br>If the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune are at play and the deaths caused by the tsunami are a cosmic payback in the form of karma, does that offer a solution, albeit a philosophical one, to the problem of evil? I think not. For how can children, some as young as a few months, who had not yet lived their lives, deserve to be punished so cruelly for their past sins - especially when they have not been offered the promised divine opportunity to atone for those sins through another life?<br><br>Even if solutions are forthcoming to these philosophical conundrums, humanely speaking they make little sense. Perhaps that is why some people remain sceptical about the presence of any divine providence ruling over us.<br><br>A compromise solution, between secular scepticism and a psychological need for the sacred, was offered by the Greek philosopher Epicurus. Although believing in gods, he claimed these divine beings would not want to diminish their heavenly happiness by mingling in the sordid affairs of mortals. For Epicurus, the gods were not crazy but simply indifferent to both human joys and sorrows. When it comes to social or natural evils, we are all alone.<br><br>But if natural disasters are merely random events caused by the uncaring and blind forces of nature, does this offer us any comfort or meaning in the face of the apocalyptic events on Boxing Day?<br><br>Even if our heads offer us such solutions, our hearts refuse to follow. For the problem of evil is an existential problem that confronts our own individual mortality and vulnerability to unknown and unexpected disasters.<br><br>Ultimately, heartfelt tears shed in earnest and with compassion, with offerings of charity for those who have suffered, are more meaningful than any theological and philosophical treatise on the problem of evil. Especially at Christmas when, according to the gospels, love is the single core message.<br><br>Perhaps this is the essence, if the legend is true, of what God learnt from us when He walked and suffered as a man among us. Ultimately, the problem of evil confronts us not as a puzzle to be solved but as a mystery to be experienced. And as Jesus and Plato before him indicated, the meaning of the mystery of life can be found only by experiencing another great mystery - the mystery of love.<br><br>Dr Edward Spence is a philosopher at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics, Charles Sturt University.<br><br><a href="http://phorum.phatmass.com/index.php?showtopic=26475&amp;hl=" rel="nofollow">http://phorum.phatmass.com/index.php?showtopic=26475&amp;hl=</a></div>

The scale of suffering that it has wreaked - 20,000 deaths and counting - shows that we share such dangers with our ancestors more fully than most of us realised.<br><br>An entirely understandable reaction to such an event is to set one's face against any large questions that it may raise. But this week provides an unsought opportunity to consider the largest of all human implications of any major earthquake: its challenge to religion.<br><br>A few days after the 9/11 attacks on New York, I had dinner with the Guardian's late columnist Hugo Young. We were still so close to the event itself that only one topic of conversation was possible. At one stage I asked Hugo how his Catholicism allowed him to explain such a terrible act. I'm afraid that's an easy one, he replied.<br><br>We are all fallen beings, Hugo declared, and our life in this world is a vale of tears. So some human beings will always kill one another. The attack on New York should therefore be seen not as an act of God, but as an act of fallen humanity. Then he paused, and added: "But I admit I have much more difficulty with earthquakes.";<br><br>Earthquakes and the belief in the judgment of God are, indeed, very hard to reconcile. However, no religion that offers an explanation of the world can avoid making some kind of an attempt to fit the two together. And an immense earthquake like the one that took place off Sumatra on Sunday inevitably poses that challenge afresh in dramatic terms.<br><br>There is, after all, only one big question to ask about an event of such destructive power as the one that has taken place this week: why did it happen?<br><br>As with previous earthquakes, any explanation of this latest one poses us a sharp intellectual choice. Either there is an entirely natural explanation for it, or there is some other kind. Even the natural one is by no means easy to imagine, but it is at least wholly coherent.<br><br>The tsunami took place, say the seismologists, because a massive tectonic rupture on the sea bed generated tremors through the ocean. These unimaginable forces sent their energy coursing across thousands of miles of water, resulting in death and destruction in a vast arc from Somalia to Indonesia.<br><br>But what do world views that do not allow scientists undisputed authority have to say about such phenomena? Where do the creationists stand, for example? Such world views are more widespread, even now, than a secularised society such as ours sometimes prefers to think.<br><br>For most of human history people have tried to explain earthquakes as acts of divine intervention and displeasure. Even as the churches collapsed around them in 1755, Lisbon's priests insisted on salvaging crucifixes and religious icons with which to ward off the catastrophe that would kill more than 50,000 of their fellow citizens.<br><br>Others, though, began to draw different conclusions. Voltaire asked what kind of God could permit such a thing to occur. Did Lisbon really have so many more vices than London or Paris, he asked, that it should be punished in such a appalling and indiscriminate manner? Immanuel Kant was so amazed by what happened to Lisbon that he wrote three separate treatises on the problem of earthquakes.<br><br>Our own society seems to be more squeamish about such things. The need for mutual respect between peoples and traditions of which the Queen spoke in her Christmas broadcast seems to require that we must all respect religions in equal measure, too. The government, indeed, is legislating to prevent expressions of religious hatred in ways that could put a cordon around the critical discussion of religion itself.<br><br>Yet it is hard to think of any event in modern times that requires a more serious explanation from the forces of religion than this week's earthquake. Voltaire's 18th-century question to Christians - why Lisbon? - ought to generate a whole series of 21st-century equivalents for all the religions of the world.<br><br>Certainly the giant waves generated by the quake made no attempt to differentiate between the religions of those whom it made its victims. Hindus were swept away in India, Muslims were carried off in Indonesia, Buddhists in Thailand. Visiting Christians and Jews received no special treatment either. This poses no problem for the scientific belief system. Here, it says, was a mindless natural event, which destroyed Muslim and Hindu alike.<br><br>A non-scientific belief system, especially one that is based on any kind of notion of a divine order, has some explaining to do, however. What God sanctions an earthquake? What God protects against it? Why does the quake strike these places and these peoples and not others? What kind of order is it that decrees that a person who went to sleep by the edge of the ocean on Christmas night should wake up the next morning engulfed by the waves, struggling for life?<br><br>From at least the time of Aristotle, intelligent people have struggled to make some sense of earthquakes. Earthquakes do not merely kill and destroy. They challenge human beings to explain the world order in which such apparently indiscriminate acts can occur. Europe in the 18th century had the intellectual curiosity and independence to ask and answer such questions. But can we say the same of 21st-century Europe? Or are we too cowed now to even ask if the God can exist that can do such things?<br><br>martin.kettle@guardian.co.uk<br><br>I'm an atheist myself, and I would like to hear your explanations as to why an all-powerful, all-loving God would choose to kill so many innocent people (including babies and children) and cause so much suffering.</div></blockquote>for the price of sin is something something....<br><br>-somewhere in the bible, some number.</div>

According to straits times, 1000 congolese were killed a day because they were starving or lack of health care. These people r probably much poorer than the people in maldives, sri lanka (coastal tourim area) and phuket which actually become rich due to tourism. They r in fact richer than their counterparts living in other province in their country. After the money and attention is given to these countries, these poorer (north korea, south america, africa) countries will have less of these funding. And now, after the waves, their livelihood is affected since people will start to think twice before going to beach resort again. In the end, it still make the world a worse place. If u talk about giving awareness and help, then u r dreadfully wrong since they r not really poor and there r poorer people around the globe. By killing these people, it appears to had used the worst possible method as well.<br><br><blockquote>Let's say God has a direct hand in the tsunami. Maybe the tsunami used to promote peace or whatever, some good thing.<br><br>... And the victims all go straight to heaven or paradise. Sounds evil, but considering this is a ticket to heaven and by default people don't get it.</blockquote>Promote peace ? If the natural disaster occured in iraq, then the effect will be seen better. Victims go straight to heaven... Then it just meant tat heaven is like any place on earth since the people there r very much like the people here. The only thing different is the decorations. Anyway according to the bible, the only way to heaven is still through christ, not through natural disaster. Unless u r going to say the bible lies or something...</div>

First he died not because he fight against enemies or something... he died because his father want him to ! His father wanted him to die ! He sacrifice his son to himself ! He could have just simply forgive but instead he kill and torture his son for watever reasons I do not know. Jesus couldn't really stop him and so he die. Then suddenly people say he is god and not the son of god ! So he actually commit suicide, acted as though he sacrifice himself, so as for him to forgive other people while role playing as 2 different people. U know wat, tis is a crazy story. The story makes more sense when he is powerless to stop the roman from killing him so he come out with some crazy story to make the best use of it.<br><br><blockquote>so when He offer me eternal life, it must be a trick.</blockquote>Because if there is eternal life, why hide it at all ? Surely he want people to know about it by telling in tales then in a moment of craziness hide all its evidence so people can not have grounds to believe ? Isn't it more believable tat it never exists ?<br><br><blockquote>I can't give any examples of His kind act either, cos I will reject every suggestion tat He is love.

Earthquakes and tsunamis existed way before the human race even started to populate the earth; tink bout the dinos why they suddenly disappear? Even till today we never fully understand the forces of nature not to say control it so why attribute it to God? Btw, for those who mentioned why Singapore was spared from the Tsunami i remenbered from one of my geography lessons way back in sch tat the earth's platonic movements r never stable; they occur ANYWHERE( again another forces of nature tat we do not understand) so it is perfectly possible tat Singapore can kena hit by earthquakes too juz tat till tis day it never HAPPENED yet. Also i dont see the relationship between God n this catrastrophe and whatever races involved; remenber tat b4 the westerners infiltrated China and other Asian countries many of the Asians DONT even noe who is Jesus, all i can say is stop linking Muslims or watever race to Christianity n watever bout Satan and God</div>
