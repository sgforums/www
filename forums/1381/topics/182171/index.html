If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. 16But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' 17If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.<br>18"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.<br><br>19"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. 20For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."<br></blockquote>normally, when we want to study/interpret the Bible, we will also need to look at the verses before and after it so that what we read/interpret will be keep in context from the rest of the passage<br><br>this passage is sandwiched between 2 parables, the one before this is on the lost sheep and how the farmer will to go out to look for it, the one after this is on the unmerciful servant.<br><br>Just before vs 18, Jesus is taking about the issue of someone who had commit a sin (not going to speculate what sin it is), and if this person absolutely refused to turn back.<br><br>Paul in one of his letters did mentioned this, its about a believer refusing to repent of a sin he commited (think its in Corintians, need to go check it out) and was excommunicated from the fellowship, eventually, this brethen did turned back and Paul urge the church to recieve him back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This verse 18 however is very interesting, as by its own, its very often quoted by the ultra-charismatics during their 'spiritual warfare' sessions as the scriptural basis to bind this/ bind that, or loose this/loose that.<br><br>while seeing the verses before it (on bringing a wayward brother back) and the verses after it (on forgiving a brother that had sinned against you) does not really jives with this. I can only conclude that the answer to this lies in verse 19-20. Its about coming together and praying/agreeing together in His name, and believing that as He had promised, He will be there mediating for us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mt 18:18 "Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will be bound in heaven,</strong></span> and whatever you loose on earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will be loosed in heaven</strong></span>.Â” New King James Version<br><br>Actually a case of mistranslation has occurred here. Another one of those inaccuracies in translation.<br><br>If you noticed the underlined words above, both are in the future tense: Â“will be bound in heaven and will be loosed in heavenÂ” in some of our English versions.<br><br>But notice a revision in the Modern King James Version about this verse:<br><br>Mt 18:18 Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall occur, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>having been bound in Heaven</strong></span>; and whatever you shall loose on earth shall occur, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>having been loosed in Heaven</strong></span>.<br><br>Why the revision? Which is a correct translation of the original Greek? Actually, in the original Greek, the words Â‘will be bound in heavenÂ” and Â“will be loosed in heavenÂ” are both in the perfect tense not in the future tense. Perfect tenses in Greek signify an action that is begun in the past reaching a point of culmination or completion and its effects linger to the present.<br><br>Thus to translate the original Greek as future tenses is inaccurate like in the case of the New King James and the NIV.<br><br>If i were to paraphrse this verse based on the tense of the original it would be something like this:<br><br>"whatever you bind on earth, make it sure that that which you bind is what is already bound in heaven, and whatever you loose, make it sure that that which you loose is what is already loosed in heaven."<br><br>This fact is attested by Greek scholars:<br><br>Kenneth Wuest, an eminent Greek scholar, rendered this verse as: Â“And whatever you bind on earth, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>shall have been already bound in heaven</strong></span>; and whatever you loose on earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>shall have already been loosed in heaven.Â” </strong></span><br><br>J.B. Phillips: Â“..whatever you forbid upon earth will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what is forbidden in Heaven</strong></span>, and whatever you permit on earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will be what is permitted in Heaven.Â”</strong></span><br><br>Charles Williams: Â“Â…..whatever you forbid on earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>must be already forbidden in heaven</strong></span>, and whatever you permit on earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>must be already permitted in heaven.Â”</strong></span><br><br>Dr. Isidro of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School ,Deerfield Illinois, USA, a greek scholar, rendered this verse in his translation as: Â“..whatever you bind on earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>shall be that which has been bound in heaven</strong></span>; and whatever you may loose on earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>shall be that which has been loosed in heaven.Â”</strong></span><br><br>The NASB translate it: Â“Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.<br><br>The Amplified Bible has it: Â“Truly I tell you, whatever you forbid and declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is already forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit and declare proper and lawful on earth must be what is already permitted in heaven.<br><br>In the act of disciplining a wayward and an unrepentant member, they are not to act arbitrarily, rather in the act of disciplining they should do this under the authority and guidance of heaven.<br><br>Guidance in seeking wisdom in disciplining a sinning, unrepentant member is obtained through prayer. So the next verse talks about prayer.<br><br>This is not an exclusive promise to the apostles only but to the whole church [whether that church be made of only two or three members]. We see this in 1 Corinthians 5 where the whole local church is to be involved in the discipline of an erring member.<br><br></div>
