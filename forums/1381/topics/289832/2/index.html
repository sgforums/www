Even if Jason said that I was the "previous owner", he has the last word.<br><br>Let me recount the sequence of events.<br><br>- I received a PM from Jason asking if I want to transfer the membership.<br>- I asked how the transfer is going to be conducted. Jason said I could nominate someone or he will maintain it as a public forum.<br>- I replied that I wish to let Eternal Hope remained closed.<br>- Jason said he is sorry to hear that I want Eternal Hope closed. He will open Eternal Hope as a public forum and hold elections.<br>- I asked if Jason will reopen the forum even if I wish that it is closed. I said that if that is his decision, I requested that future moderators be given more power.<br>- I asked if there were technical limitations to close or delete Eternal Hope.<br>- To my questions, Jason replied that future moderators can contact him or Fireice for any problems. There was no agreement to give moderators more power.<br>- He added that there are no limitations to how he can delete or close the forum.<br>- I requested to delete Eternal Hope entirely.<br><br>There was no reply after my last request. Two days later, we were removed as moderators.<br><br>To be fair, it is his forum. He can choose what he desires. It does not matter if you are a Christian forum, a chit-chat forum, an Aunt Agony forum. Any sub-forum is just another revenue generator.<br><br>It is my opinion that it does not matter if I do want Eternal Hope closed or not.<br><br>You are free to form your own opinions with regards to the whole situation.

Even if Jason said that I was the "previous owner", he has the last word.<br><br>Let me recount the sequence of events.<br><br>- I received a PM from Jason asking if I want to transfer the membership.<br>- I asked how the transfer is going to be conducted. Jason said I could nominate someone or he will maintain it as a public forum.<br>- I replied that I wish to let Eternal Hope remained closed.<br>- Jason said he is sorry to hear that I want Eternal Hope closed. He will open Eternal Hope as a public forum and hold elections.<br>- I asked if Jason will reopen the forum even if I wish that it is closed. I said that if that is his decision, I requested that future moderators be given more power.<br>- I asked if there were technical limitations to close or delete Eternal Hope.<br>- To my questions, Jason replied that future moderators can contact him or Fireice for any problems. There was no agreement to give moderators more power.<br>- He added that there are no limitations to how he can delete or close the forum.<br>- I requested to delete Eternal Hope entirely.<br><br>There was no reply after my last request. Two days later, we were removed as moderators.<br><br>To be fair, it is his forum. He can choose what he desires. It does not matter if you are a Christian forum, a chit-chat forum, an Aunt Agony forum. Any sub-forum is just another revenue generator.<br><br>It is my opinion that it does not matter if I do want Eternal Hope closed or not.<br><br>You are free to form your own opinions with regards to the whole situation. However, I think it really does not matter. You are just a statistic, a click count.</div></blockquote>thank you</div>
