The information I had was what I got a few years back when I PMed Jason or FI. I was told that nothing could be done then.<br><br>Following my announcement to close EH, Jason PMed me informing me that it is possible to transfer the forum to someone else or make it a public forum.<br><br>I asked a few questions regarding what can be done to EH. After some consideration, I had requested that EH be deleted entirely. Subsequently, there were no more replies. Chin Eng, ben1xy and myself were removed as moderator without notification.<br><br>Other than my decision leave EH because of my current priorities.  I think it is best to close EH because sustaining a Christian forum in sgForums is not feasible.

This argument from you just shows plain selfishness as well as ignorance. If it was my own forum (which I have), I wouldn't mind if others took over because my main aim was to share knowledge and know liked minded people, and especially since if I were like sillyme to want to wash my hands off totally.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 798:</div><div class="quote_body">yes, another person can open up a new forum. but pls refrain of using this name.</div></blockquote>The name can always be changed. You can always ask Jason to do that if it is a big concern.</div>
