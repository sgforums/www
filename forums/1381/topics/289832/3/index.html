There is no all-encompassing answer for everything.<br><br>in this case, by "destroying" EH does not mean that there can be no more Christian forums, so there is really no real loss to anyone.<br><br>by forcing EH to continue will end up with succession issue, appointed by someone who may or may not know the criteria for a "Christian" forum. If it is done this way, and as I'd said, if the moderator screws up, does it mean that admin is to be blamed? and by the way, what is the critera anyway??? Bear in mind the scope and depth in moderating a Christian forum. However if this forum is renamed to something else, say, SG Religion Forum, then maybe the issue is less jarring.<br><br>I'd rather let things go the natural way, let some (over)zealous Christian start something and let it go from there. This way, this individual is responsible for his own actions and there shall be no finger pointing.</div>

He is in the only position. T.T<br><br>Anyway lemme put forth an example, mabbe it might just help everyone understands a little better.<br><br>Supposing I am the owner of the a shopping mall. I rent out shops to you.<br><br>U rented and set up a moderately successful shop with a name that people are now aware of.<br><br>One day u stopped renting.<br><br>So in the interest of the general public, I took back your shop and reopen it.<br><br>And now I am advertising for new shop managers.<br><br>Clear ?<br><br>Now the problem is this. While I am still the owner of the whole mall, u had set up a successful shop with ur own brand name.<br><br>Now a few loyal customers are unhappy with the taking over of brandnames.<br><br>To the property owner, its not so much as an invasion of brandnames but rather a matter of continuing a flourishing business.<br><br>Thus, the unhappiness between the ex renter and loyal customers with the property owner.<br><br>As for ur question on why the interest in EH...its because recently Pumping Iron underwent a similar situation. I am just curious abt the results.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ferret,<br><br>not a bad example....<br>most of the salient points are there.<br><br>however may I put forth that the reasons for folks NOT wanting to delete EH are:<br>1.

Fear that maybe the new place is not popular enough to be bashed.<br><br>Aside from that, people who are genuinely interested in looking for Christian forums for information will sure be able to find such a place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I value every single member of our community that contributes and makes sgforums a more vibrant and exciting community. I value all the forum owners and moderators that provide leadership and help maintain peace and justice in our community.<br><br>I really wish I could've done a better job communicating with the previous forum owners. I really hate going against a forum owner's wishes - especially since they have contributed so much to the community - and I have had to reopen 2 forums recently as public forums because their owners decided to close their forums and delete all threads.<br><br>My reasons are simple: once an owner decides to 'close forum and delete all threads', he effectively stops contributing to the community, and instead, appears to start taking away from it. And if the owners/moderators are serious about breaking all ties with the forum, then there should be no reason for them to be upset that their positions in the forum are removed and it is made public.<br><br>Of course, it is rarely as simple as that and it is human nature for people to feel very attached and protective of their creations - just like a mother to her child. However, as pointed out by some others, a lot of people have contributed to this forum - not only the owners and moderators - I have contributed in my own small way as well. So when I see an owner decide to 'close forum and delete all threads', and there is no other way for me to change their minds, I will reopen the forums and hold moderator selections.<br><br>I hope this helps explain the reasons for my actions.<br><br>sillyme: I think 'Eternal Hope' is a great name for the forums.

Though I think it'll be good for EH to stay (I have suggested to sillyme previously), this should also be considered as an alternative. Laoda99 has already set up his own Christian forum. I think there is no need to delete this forum bcos there might be valuable topics and articles to refer back to time to time, just make this a 'closed forum' for all to read. As time pass by, people will move on to the next forum.</div>
