Did you know God painted this just for you?"<br><br>Bobby said, "Yes, God did it and he did it left handed."<br><br>This confused his grandmother a bit, and she asked him "What makes you say God did this with his left hand?"<br><br>"Well," said Bobby, "we learned at Sunday School last week that Jesus sits on God's right hand."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was once a man and woman who had been married for more than 60 years. They had shared everything. They had talked about everything.<br><br>They kept no secrets from each other except that the old woman had a shoe box in the top of her closet that she cautioned her husband never to open or ask her about.<br><br>For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, but one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover. In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box.<br><br>When he opened it, he found two crocheted doilies and a stack of money totaling $25,000. He asked her about the contents.<br><br>"When we were to be married, " she said, "my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doily."<br><br>The little old man was so moved, he had to fight back tears. Only two precious doilies were in the box. She had only been angry with him two times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with happiness.<br><br>"Honey," he said "that explains the doilies, but what about all of this money? Where did it come from?"<br><br>"Oh," she said, "that's the money I made from selling the doilies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HOME RUN<br><br>Bob was caught up in the spirit where he and the Lord stood by to observe a baseball game. The Lord's team was playing Satan's team. The Lord's team was at bat, the score was tied zero to zero, and it was the bottom of the NINTH inning with two outs.<br><br>They continued to watch as a batter stepped up to the plate whose name was Love. Love swung at the first pitch and hit a single, because Love never fails. The next batter was named Faith, who also got a single because Faith works with Love. The next batter up was named Godly wisdom.<br><br>Satan wound up and threw the first pitch; Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it pass, because Godly Wisdom does not swing at Satan's pitches. Ball one. Three more pitches and Godly Wisdom walked, because Godly wisdom never swings at Satan's throws. The bases were loaded.<br><br>The Lord then turned to Bob and told him He was now going to bring in His star player. Up to the plate stepped Grace. Bob said he sure did not look like much! Satan's whole team relaxed when they saw Grace. Thinking he had won the game, Satan wound up and fired his first pitch. To the shock of everyone, Grace hit the ball harder than anyone had ever seen. But Satan was not worried; his center fielder, the Prince of the air, let very few get by. He went up for the ball, but it went right through his glove, hit him on the head and sent him crashing on the ground; then it continued over the fence for a home run!<br><br>The Lord's team won. The Lord then asked Bob if he knew why Love, Faith, and Godly Wisdom could get on base but could not win the game. Bob answered that he did not know why. The Lord explained, "If your love, faith and wisdom had won the game you would think you had done it by yourself. Love, faith and wisdom will get you on base, but only My grace can get you home.<br><br>Ephesians 2 : 8-9<br>For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,<br>not of works, lest anyone should boast.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is a lovely one for a reminder and for the season....<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>He Became Man and Dwelt Among Us</strong><br>by: Louis Cassells, Source Unknown<br><br>Once upon a time, there was a man who looked upon Christmas as a lot of humbug. He wasn't a scrooge. He was a kind and decent person, generous to his family, upright in all his dealings with other men. But he didn't believe all that stuff about incarnation which churches proclaim at Christmas. And he was too honest to declare that he did.<br><br>"I am truly sorrry to distress you," he told his wife, who was a faithful churchgoer. "But I simply cannot understand this claim that God became man. It doesn't make any sense to me." On Christmas Eve, his wife and children went to church for the midnight service. He declined to accompany them. "I'd feel like a hypcrite," he explained. "I'd must rather stay at home. But I'll wait up for you."<br><br>Shortly after his family drove away in the car, snow began to fall. He went to the window and watched the flurries getting heavier and heavier. "If we must have Christmas," he thought, "It's nice to have a white one." He went back to his chair by the fireside and began to read his newspaper. A few minutes later, he was startled by a thudding sound. It was quickly followed by another, then another. He thought that someone must be throwing snowballs at his livingroom window.<br><br>When he went to the front door to investigate, he found a flock of birds huddled miserably in the snow. They'd had been caught in the storm, and in a desperate search for shelter had tried to fly through his window.<br><br>"I can't let these poor creatures lie there and freeze," he thought. "But how can I help them?" Then he remembered the barn where the children's pony was stabled. It would provide a warm shelter. He put on his coat and galoshes and tramped through the deepending snow to the barn. He opened the doors wide and turned on a light. But the birds didn't come in. "Food will bring them in," he thought. So he hurried back to the house for bread crumbs, which he sprinkled on the snow to make a trail into the barn.<br><br>To his dismay, the birds ignored the bread crumbs and continued to flop around helplessly in the snow. He tried shoeing them in the barn by walking around and waving his arms. They scattered in every direction--except into the warm, lighted barn. "They find me a strange and terrifying creature," he said to himself. "And I can't seem to think of any way to let them know they can trust me. If only I could be a bird myself for a few minutes, perhaps I could lead them to safety..."<br><br>Just at that moment, the church bells began to ring. He stood silently for a while, listening to the bells pealing the glad tidings of Christmas. Then he sank to his knees in the snow. "Now I do understand," he whispered. "Now I know why you had to do it."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something to remember and be thankful for....<br><strong><br>The Devil And The Duck </strong><br><br>There was a little boy visiting his grandparents on their farm. He was given a slingshot to play without in the woods. He practiced in the woods, but he could never hit the target. Getting a little discouraged, he headed back for dinner. As he was walking back he saw Grandma's pet duck. Just out of impulse, he let the slingshot fly, hit the duck square in the head, and killed it. He was shocked and grieved. In a panic, he hid the dead duck in the wood pile only to see his sister watching! Sally had seen it all, but she said nothing.<br><br>After lunch the next day Grandma said, "Sally, let's wash the dishes." But Sally said, "Grandma, Johnny told me he wanted to help in the kitchen." Then she whispered to him, "Remember the duck?" So Johnny did the dishes.<br><br>Later that day, Grandpa asked if the children wanted to go &gt;&gt;fishing and Grandma said, "I'm sorry but I need Sally to help make supper." Sally just smiled and said," Well that's all right because Johnny told me he wanted to help." She whispered again, "Remember the duck?"<br><br>So Sally went fishing and Johnny stayed to help.<br><br>After several days of Johnny doing both his chores and Sally's he finally couldn't stand it any longer. He came to Grandma and confessed that he had killed the duck. Grandma knelt down, gave him a hug, and said, "Sweetheart, I know. You see, I was standing at the window and I saw the whole thing. But because I love you, I forgave you. I was just wondering how long you would let Sally make a slave of you."<br><br>Thought for the day and every day thereafter: Whatever is in your past, whatever you have done -- and the devil keeps throwing it up in your face (lying, debt, fear, hatred , anger, unforgiveness, bitterness, etc.) whatever it is, you need to know that God was standing at the window and He saw the whole thing, He has seen your whole life. He wants you to know that He loves you and that you are forgiven. He's just wondering how long you will let the devil make a slave of you. The great thing about God is that when you ask for forgiveness, He not only forgives you, but He forgets - It is by God's Grace and Mercy that we are saved.<br><br>Go ahead and make the difference in someone's life today. Share this with a friend and always remember ... God is at the window!............</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okay.. no morals in this one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>There was this strange knocking sound coming from the local Catholic Church.  It was found to be the pipes which have fallen out from their housing, rattling whenever someone turned on the water.<br><br>So Father Nicholas called the plumber who happened to be Baptist to come fix the pipes.<br><br>The plumber came and shimmied into the ducts that held the pipes.  As he prepared to start work, he saw an old lady at the pews, on her knees in prayer with her rosary.<br><br>An evil thought ran through the plumber.. he was going so scare the old lady.<br><br>So, with all his might, he bellowed out:<br><br>"I am JESUS! Say what you would like and i will fulfil your wishes!"<br><br>The little old lady looked up and about but went back to her prayers.<br><br>Puzzled, the plumber bellowed again:<br><br>"This is JESUS! Speak! And your prayers will be answered!"<br><br>Again, there was no response from the little old lady who continued saying her rosary.<br><br>At this time, the plumber was pretty frustrated.  So with all his might, he roared:<br><br>"THIS IS JESUS!! I WILL GRANT YOU YOUR WISHES IF YOU SPEAK!"<br><br>At this, the little old lady scolded right back:<br><br>"Hush while I'm speaking to your Mother!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Aging in God's Economy<br>By Max Lucado</strong></span><br><br>Growing older. Aging. We laugh about it, and we groan about it. We resist it, but we can't stop it. And with the chuckles and wrinkles come some serious thoughts and questions about what happens when we die. Is death when we go to sleep? Or is death when we finally wake up?<br><br>Several years ago, I remember my young daughters falling asleep on the floor at bedtime. I would pick them up, carry them up the stairs and put them in their beds. Why? I knew it was time for them to rest, and I knew that rest was better up there than down here.<br><br>Doesn't God do the same? Doesn't he, knowing more than we, carry us to the place of rest he created? For God, death is no tragedy. In God's economy, the termination of the body is the beginning of life.<br><br>Can you imagine if one of the sisters objected to my decision to carry her upstairs? "Don't take her. We'll miss her. Please keep her here so we will all be together." How would I answer? "Oh, but she'll rest so much better in the room I have prepared for her. Besides, you'll be coming up yourselves soon."<br><br>By calling us home, God is doing what any father would do. He is providing a better place to rest. A place he has "prepared for us." Heaven is not mass-produced; it is tailor-made.<br><br>By the way, I've often thought it curious how few people Jesus raised from the dead. He healed hundreds and fed thousands, but as far as we know he only raised three: the daughter of Jairus, the boy near Nain, and Lazarus. Why so few? Could it be because he knew he'd be doing them<br>no favors? Could it be because he couldn't get any volunteers? Could it be that once someone is there, the last place they want to return to is here?<br><br>We must trust God. We must trust not only that he does what is best but that he knows what is ahead.<br><br>The problem with this world is that it doesn't fit. Oh, it will do for<br>now, but it isn't tailor-made. We were made to live with God, but on earth we live by faith. We were made to live forever, but on this earth we live but for a moment. We were made to live holy lives, but this world is stained by sin.<br><br>Trust that this world wears like a borrowed shirt. Heaven, however, will fit like one tailor-made.<br><br><strong>From A Gentle Thunder<br>Copyright 1995 Max Lucado</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MOUTH-TO-MOUTH MANIPULATION ---<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>In the coral reefs of the Caribbean lives a small fish known as the Kissing Fish. ItÂ’s only about two to three inches long. ItÂ’s bright blue and quick and a delight to behold. Most fascinating is its kiss. ItÂ’s not uncommon to see two of these fish with lips pressed and fins thrashing. They give the appearance of serious underwater romance.<br><br>You would think the species would be an aquarium loverÂ’s dream. They look energetic, vivid, illuminant, and affectionate. But looks can be deceiving. For what appears to be a gentle friend in the sea is actually a pint-sized bully of the deep.<br><br>Ferociously territorial, the Kissing Fish has laid claim to its camp and wants no visitors. His square foot of coral is his and no one elseÂ’s. He found it, he staked it out, and he wants no other of his kind near it.<br><br>Challenge his boundaries and heÂ’ll take you on, jaw to jaw. What appears to be a tryst is actually underwater martial arts. Mouth pushing. Liplocking. Literal jawboning. Power moves with the tongue.<br><br>Sounds funny, doesnÂ’t it?<br><br>Sounds familiar, doesnÂ’t it?<br><br>We donÂ’t have to go to the Caribbean to see that type of power struggle. Mouth-to-mouth manipulation isnÂ’t limited to the Caribbean.<br><br>Look closely at the people in your world (or the person in your mirror). You might be surprised how fishy things get when people demand their way. Kissing Fish arenÂ’t the first to use their mouth to make their point.<br><br>The tragedy of the Kissing Fish is that he sees so little. All his oral warfare gets him is the same view from the same patch of coral. Had I a word with him, had I a moment with the creature who is possessed with a passion to protect his own and keep out what is new Â… I would challenge him to look around.<br><br>I would say what I need someone to say to me when I get territorial about my opinions: Let go of your territory for a while. Explore some new reefs. Scout some new regions. Much is gained by closing your mouth and opening your eyes.</div>
