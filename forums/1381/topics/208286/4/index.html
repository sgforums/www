The Talmud tells that a gentile came to Shammai saying that he would convert to Judaism if Shammai could teach him the whole Torah in the time that he could stand on one foot. Shammai drove him away with a builder's measuring stick! Hillel, on the other hand, converted the gentile by telling him, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the whole Torah; the rest is commentary. Go and study it."</blockquote>Is Scriptural volatile? Are there not eternal truths contained in it?<br><br>Notice how the great Jewish sage Hillel replied - he did not say the Torah is about law, commandments, and punishments! Unlike the Christians ..</div>

This is actually "biblical":<br><br>1. The Jews in the OT were at the scripture stage. They bochup scripture at times, and even fell into idolatory. This was why the Jewish Kingdom (north and south) fell.<br><br>2. Fast forward to the turn of the millenium. We have many Jewish sects emerging. These people were at the mind stage. They understood scripture and had wisdom and knowledge, BUT<br><br>3. Jesus Christ was already at the heart stage. He had a heart, the Pharisees didn't.<br><br>If you are arrogrant, you will think people still belong to the lower stages. Need I say more? Protestants accuse Catholics of idol worship, and accuse virtually all other religions to be "demonic", "satanic", "idol-worshipping" etc. I dunno what stage is that, maybe prehistoric.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And the best part is .. they think Judaism is still about law, commandments and punishments.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> What a joke if you contrast with what Rabbi Hillel said about the torah on one foot.<br><br>Too bad the NT presents the Pharisees as a bunch of silly old men who hugged their Torah but not know the ways of God.
