In whole it teaches that tongues during that age, are gift granted by the Holy Spirit only for the authentication of the Apostles - Paul, Peter etc. The same chapter talks about the study of Prophecy being superior to tongues.<br><br>The end of Apostleship after Revelation teaches an immediate ceasation of Prophecy and tongue speaking.<br><br>The key is to read all Scripture with the context, and not taking verses and explaining them out-of-context.<br><br>This study of tongue speaking is one of the fundamental doctrine that differentiate churches. (We can hold a full 5 day camp just to focus on this doctrine). Nonetheless, i like to post this question to all for some thoughts since someone mentioned about the similarity of the tongue speaking and chanting of mediums.<br><br>If you agree that the chantings are not of God,thus of the Devil, when you speak or pray in tongues, how do you genuine know that the so called "spirit" is of God, and not of the Devil ?<br><br>I would like to hear the opinions.<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> I will be happy to give my opinions as long as it is understood that they ARE OPINIONS and does not represent any church in general.<br><br>I fear that "new-age" Christians leaders have been extremely liberal in extracting verses in support of their causes and fads.<br><br>Proponents of such beliefs will usually quote "new revelations" or such similar terminologies to enforce new methodology.<br><br>Similar, over the past few years, there was the emphasis of cell-groups, children's church etc. While there is really nothing wrong for one to join a cell group or to emphasize that children, too, should learn to worship. It becomes questionable, when a church which embarks in such activities theologise or spiritualise the activity.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> A supporter of a cell group church will quote that in Acts, Christians meet in house churches, hence the validity.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> A children's church proponent will quote a verse from the Gospel stating that Christ admonished the disciples who were pushing the children away.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> A practitioner of the children's worship will quote Miriam's song and tambourine routine (in Deuteronomy) to support the use of such a musical instrument plus banners and streamers.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> To take verses out of context is like to insist that we should all wear sandals 'cos Jesus commanded the disciples to shake the dust of the sandals when the leave the towns that do not take in the message.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Footnote: I am not against tongues, CGs, children's church, singing etc. I am just against the "theologizing" of programmes.<br></div>

Bible-believing Christians need to know the Word well and not theologised every Christian thing they see.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chin Eng:</div><div class="quote_body">sorry, maybe not so clear.....<br>What I meant was - a church or church leader/pastor wants a programme done, he quotes a verse and claims it is Biblical. Everyone is to follow because it is a command and if you don't follow, you sin.<br>Years back, when my church embarked on the CG ministry thing, there were lots of quotation from the book of Acts. There were claims that because the disciples back then had house churches, so should we. So everyone was placed into CGs, again because the disciples did it. To me, for most parts, Acts is a book of history. Things happened, period. Not to be misconstrued as a God-given commandment.<br>Then there was another incident where congregational members were told that they should NOT be serving (doing other things) during worship time 'cos that was the time to worship. Passage quoted was the Mary and Martha story where Martha complained about Mary not helping etc etc. The end result was that there were no more Sunday School teachers 'cos everyone believe in that particular preaching and decided that it was wrong to "work" during worship service.<br>Recently I was told that the purpose for learning "sign-language" for worship is so that we can "worship using our entire body". Just don't get it. It is not like we learn sign language to minister to the deaf and dumb. I'd rather learn Braille to worship quietly....<br><br>So at the end of the day, are verses used indiscriminately to push programmes and fads??? If it is so, isn't it using the Bible in vain?</div></blockquote>I think its good when our practices trace its background from the Bible. There's nothing wrong to quote a verse to everything we do..but do label church activities with scripture like labelling products in supermarket with price tags. If the Bible's examples have nothing to do with our present teaching and Christian ministry..then the Bible is merely another historically divine inspired book? I believe the age-less Word of God...as primitive as it may sound at times, is able to be put into usage today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is nothing wrong in tracing our beliefs to Biblical verses. The problem is when there is enforcement, meaning you got to follow or you are sinning, then it becomes questionable.<br>Simply put, worshipping on Sunday is an accepted practice. Occasionally we may miss it for some reason or other. No issue.<br>But when one says: you got to join a cell group because it is stated in the Bible in Acts, and if you don't you do not get baptised, married, etc, it becomes really, really warp.<br>Apparently one cell group in my church got killed by the pastor 'cos the cell group leader did not have the time to attend a cg leader's training.

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of tongues.... wat will they be thinking next<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everyone can speak in tongues man. It is gibbertish. Just try to make some sounds with your throat tat is not tangible and it is a "tongue". Interpreter ? why don't we do a litmus test ? Someone utter some "tongue" and recorded down on tape and write down its meanings. Let an interpreter listen to the tape and see if he can derive out the intended message. Can tis be achievable ? If not how does the interpreter "interprete" if he don't even know wat is he trying to say ?<br><br>"Tongue" as learning a new language ? Don't bet on it. I do not believe tat someone who had never hear Japanese or speak Japanese like natives can learn it within... well, one second. Is it possible ? Then all the people who had learned Japanese ought to shoot themselves for spending so much years of effort learning a new language. In fact most can't even manage to speak fluently in the new foreign languages after years of studies.<br><br>I end my mesage with a "angelic tongue". Hey, I can even write "tongue" !<br><br>"aks jgdfkjfg dhf dhfgfdj khgfjdhg fdjkg hdkj dkjfhkdjfgdf."<br><br>It means "World Peace"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi SIS, so that's what you know about bibilcal tongues, and you're certainly entitled to your opinion. While generously sharing with us your sentiments, I'd like to politely urge you to exercise restraint and respect, even if you cannot agree with or fathom the subject. I believe you are rational enough to comprehend this, and leash up your proclivity to ridicule.<br><br>The posting guidelines shall be ready to assist all soon. I may not have the time for lengthy exchanges / posts, but I'll avail myself to keep this ground hospitable. Thank you for your understanding.</div>
