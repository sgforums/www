Apostle Paul said he could speak with the tongues of angels. Can anyone understand angelic language? No. But we must be careful to distinguish between demonic utterances and speaking in tongues. People have heard of mediums speaking in demonic tongues. That's why traditional Christians say charismatics are actually demon possessed. They don't understand the difference bet angelic tongue and demonic tongue. They are both otherworldly.</div>

The disciples spoke in tongues and the people from other nations can hear them proclaiming Christ in their own language(taken from Acts) but in later part of New Testament, Paul refer to tongues as tongues of angels, heavenly language.<br><br>We cannot judge tongues as chemical test tests for substances and give clear results. Only the person to pray in that unknown language knows for himself whether is it real tongues or simply a human vonluntary act. That does not mean we must despise the Spirit's gift from now on.

Each has his own spiritual gifts. Besides the main 7 spiritual gifts (or is it more.. can't remember) , people can be given other gifts like pastoring or empathy,etc.<br><br>Even for tongues to be recognised, there must be certain creterias to be met... e.g.: there must always be an interpreter to intrprete what the person speaking in tongues is saying. this was what i learnt.<br><br>anyone can shed some insight pls?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently there are two forms of tongues. One, as in the day of Pentecost is manifested as dialects spoken by people with no prior knowledge of the spoken language. The other, is a heavenly language that needed translation to prevent abuse and fakery. It should be pointed out that while the speaking of tongues has been overly emphasized by some churches, it is not a sign of spiritual maturity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am very glad to have someone in this thread with the same sentiments and teaching.<br><br>If you read the whole context of the chapter, the tongues speaking in Acts 2 are tongues of dialects during the time of Acts, or in laymen terms, different languages like French, German, Dutch, Japanese if applied to modern day idealogy.<br><br>Once again if you read the whole context of 1 Cor 14, it talk about the so called "angelic tongues" of the Apostles. In whole it teaches that tongues during that age, are gift granted by the Holy Spirit only for the authentication of the Apostles - Paul, Peter etc. The same chapter talks about the study of Prophecy being superior to tongues.<br><br>The end of Apostleship after Revelation teaches an immediate ceasation of Prophecy and tongue speaking.<br><br>The key is to read all Scripture with the context, and not taking verses and explaining them out-of-context.<br><br>This study of tongue speaking is one of the fundamental doctrine that differentiate churches. (We can hold a full 5 day camp just to focus on this doctrine). Nonetheless, i like to post this question to all for some thoughts since someone mentioned about the similarity of the tongue speaking and chanting of mediums.<br><br>If you agree that the chantings are not of God,thus of the Devil, when you speak or pray in tongues, how do you genuine know that the so called "spirit" is of God, and not of the Devil ?<br><br>I would like to hear the opinions.<br></div>
