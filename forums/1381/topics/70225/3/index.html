I believe you are rational enough to comprehend this, and leash up your proclivity to ridicule.<br><br>The posting guidelines shall be ready to assist all soon. I may not have the time for lengthy exchanges / posts, but I'll avail myself to keep this ground hospitable. Thank you for your understanding.</div></blockquote>Right on Mod. SIS at it again.... which is why I refuse to comment on his current posting.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lork:</div><div class="quote_body">Anyone wanna share how to achieve it or receive it? Somebody??</div></blockquote>I don't speak in tongues personally and I have been a Christian for at least 24 years.<br>It normally happens in Pentecostal or Charismatic church. Pentecostal is a denomination, charismatic is a practice within established denominations. Usually it involves asking the Holy Spirit to enter and allow the Holy Spirit to use the human body as a vessel of praise and prophecy.<br>Problem is the over-emphasis of this one gift while there are other spiritual gifts. To add to the problem, there is no way to prove the authenticity and maturity of the speaker.<br>Even the Apostle Paul says don't bother with it..... so maybe we should just leave it alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, why is it when someone utter out some strange sounds r considered "tongue" and is considered holy ? If such incidents happened at Macdonald or some other public places, the people will be thinking tat u r crazy. I mean, even monkeys or animals know how to grunt or groan... How do u know it is not just ignorance utterance of "voices from devils" or something and it must be something "divine" ? I suggested some test to find out the reliability of the "interpreter". Wat is wrong with it ? If it really is true about tongue and the reliability of interpreter, then the interpreter should pass it with flying colour right ? Wat is the guidelines or criteria in choosing the "interpreter" anyway ?<br><br>So wat r u going to do ? Try to cover your ears and refuse to think "along" this line ? Trying to come up with "guidelines" to censored off different opinions ? Heard of the emperor's new clothes ? If some church says tat speaking glibberish is consider receiving "gifts" from holy spirits, it will be of no surprise tat suddenly scores of christians "claims" they can talk in "tongue". Otherwise why certain church have more "tonguer" than others ? Why do some period of history had more "tonguer" than others ? Is tis a christian propanganda ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am still not sure if stupidissmart is a Christian, but from his other postings in the other threads i assume he is not.<br><br>But can you see in his comments - though it was rather harsh - it is so apparent that the 'so-called' gifts of tongues is not only causing so much disagreement, it is stumbling non believers.<br><br>He gave his no-holds-bar opinions on tongues and I do agree with what he says! stupidissmart hit the very core of the problem. Is the tongue speaking "miracle" in the modern day charismatic churches of God,or issit just a fraud showing of holiness.<br><br>When someone new joins a charismatic cell group, when everyone starts to pray in tongue, what is he going to do?<br><br>Have you heard of people being threaten to speak in tongues when they are being told that, "Oh, you don't have the Holy Spirit in you thats why you can't pray in tongues." Cmon, how long will it take before this new chap succumbs to the mounting pressure before he starts his own babbling. It is then that his self-believe that "Hey, i have the Holy Spirit now." because the same cell group members will cheer for him and encourage him.<br><br>I know that i will incure much wrath here based on the common charismatic rebut of<br><br>"Thou shalt not judge" in John 8:7. (Look at the context of the scriptures guys,please , its is not talking about Christian judging - in fact Christian should judge each other to protect and warn each other from falling)<br><br>The interpretation of praying in tongues by the charismatic churches is so dangerous. If you can, steer clear of that because with proof from the scriptures, modern tongues praying/speaking is beginning to look like it's from the Devil.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To anyone interested in reading more about the charismatic movement, the following link has some interesting points. Do also take note of it's header that it uses "the Authorized Version of the Holy Bible (KJV)" This is an obvious reference to it's extremely conservative background.<br><br>http://cnview.com/on_line_resources/charismatic_movement_is_dangerous.htm<br><br>This site, nonetheless, has some good points on the issues of the charismatic movement.<br><br>I come from a church that is semi-charismatic, ie, one congregation is charismatic and another traditional. Outwardly speaking it seems that the charismatic congregation is extremely enthuisiastic in implementing "visions" in various neighbourhood projects, but inwardly, there are varying levels of emotional stress and tension. There are also vicious disagreement between members of the leadership.<br>The traditional congregation, on the other hand, suffers from a lackadasical attitude in being rather (too) comfortable.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fandango:</div><div class="quote_body">The interpretation of praying in tongues by the charismatic churches is so dangerous. If you can, steer clear of that because with proof from the scriptures, modern tongues praying/speaking is beginning to look like it's from the Devil.</div></blockquote>Actually there are varying charges on the charismatic movement having origins in pagan and shamanistic practices. I also have problems with "new revelations" that I hear from some pastors.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fandango:</div><div class="quote_body">Some charismatic says that tongues are angelic languages. Can someone enlighten me why do you need to speak in angelic languages when God can hear my prayer be it i pray in English or Chinese? Are you praying to God or are you praying to the angels? Think about it. Please provide scripture proofs.<br>Even angels speak to us in human language, consider Gabriel and the angel at the tomb.</div></blockquote>... the same way why some charismatic churches is teaching that we should worship with sign languages and the raising of banners and streamers and hitting tambourines during worship. Apparently based on some obscure OT verses on the song of Mariam.... Take one verse twist it around, and you get a new money making seminar for the young. This one is real. Organised by International Prayer Conference (not sure who they are) in June in ACJS (Barker Rd).</div>

And why do u think the "devil" is so dumb and not make anything tat briefly associate with God and then deceive everyone the other way ? It is not like Walt Disney cartoons where bad guys must look ugly and one look u will know he is a bad ass.<br><br>In fact why do u think Jesus is not a lie from the devil but from God ?

Whether Jesus is a liar or Lord...i have fully settled that question personally and i wont force anyone to believe just because i said so. The Bible and many things has proven and testified that He is Christ, the Son of the Most High God.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
