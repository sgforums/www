              <p>By around 1500 <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">BCE</span>, Mithra
                       worship had made it to the Near East...............</p>
              <p>Mithras and Christ were described as 'the Way,' 'the Truth,' 'the Light,' 'the
                     Life,' 'the Word,' 'the Son of God,' 'the Good Shepherd.'</p>
              <p> Mithras is often represented as carrying a lamb on his shoulders, just as
                     Jesus is and midnight services were found in both religions.</p>
              <p>Mithra's  virgin mother...was like the virgin
                     mother Mary while Petra, the sacred rock of Mithraism, became Peter, the foundation of the Christian Church</p>
              <p>Mithra took birth on December 25th and was born of [a] Virgin. He travelled far and wide and has twelve disciples....His symbol is the Lamb...</p>
              <p>Mithra is depicted as a sun disc in a chariot drawn by white horses, another
                  solar motif that made it into the Jesus myth, in which Christ is to return on a white horse. (Rev 6:2; 19:11)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mithra has the following in common with the Jesus character:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <div>Mithra was born on December 25th of virgin birth.</div>

              <li>
              <div>The babe was placed in a manger and attended by shepherds.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He was a great traveling teacher and master.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He had 12 companions or "disciples."</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He performed miracles.</div>

              <li>
              <div>He ascended to heaven.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>Mithra was viewed as the Good Shepherd, the "Way, the Truth and the Light," the Redeemer, the Savior,
                              the Messiah.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>Mithra is omniscient, as he "hears all, sees all, knows all: none can deceive him."</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He was identified with both the Lion and the Lamb.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>His sacred day was Sunday, "the Lord's Day," hundreds of years before the appearance of Christ.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>His religion had a eucharist or "Lord's Supper."</div>

              <p>Sir
                  Arthur Weigall says:</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm;">December 25<sup>th</sup> was really the date, not of the birth of Jesus, but of the sun-god
                     Mithra. Horus, son of Isis, however, was in very early times identified with Ra, the Egyptian sun-god, and hence
                     with Mithra...</p>
              <p>"The 25 December was observed as his birthday, the natalis invicti,
                  the rebirth of the winter-sun, unconquered by the rigours of the season."</p>

              <p>Actually it's Mithra who is a rip-off from Jesus.</p>
              <p>And they could be the same person who travelled to different places at different period of time and different audience remembered Jesus in different ways, mannerism, pronounciation of Jesus's name.</p>

              <p>Don't know who is still trying to deny the existence of GOD and using his human might and strength to bluff his way that GOD does not exist.</p>
              <p>But it's a clear fact that name changes and differs from country to country due to difference in languages.</p>
              <p>Still you are still unable to point out the so-called flaws and loopholes and do you know why?</p>
              <p>Because you're trying to use your human brain to defy a religion that has existed since thousands of years ago.</p>
              <p>And your lack of experience with GOD is really the real reason why you are a disbeliever of GOD.</p>
              <p>Religion can be written by man, but GOD has set HIMSELF inside every heart and soul of every men and women when HE blew a breath of life into Adam and Eve.</p>
              <p>And therefore all Humans inherited LIFE from GOD and we are all part and inheritance of GOD.</p>

              <p>C'mon, you know from your research (unless you didn't even bother to research and just swallowed someone's crap wholesale) that there are <strong>several fundamental</strong> <strong>differences</strong> between Mithraism and Christianity.</p>

              <p><br>Einstein said that because he could see the end of his time when he mentioned it.</p>
              <p>Do you think Einstein have no real dreams to do something that he really wanted to do in his lifetime?</p>
              <p>Einstein didn't want to be the scientist that everyone remembered him for, it was everyone's wish that Einstein continued down the path of science for their greater selfish gains.</p>
              <p>Only a small percentage of science were put into use for the good of all mankind. The greatest discoveries of science were being put into use for the destruction of all mankind.</p>
