              <p>Nope. The buddha is not the creator of the universe. According to buddha's teachings, the universe is everlasting with no beginning nor ending. Similar to all lives, there's no beginning nor ending. Maybe u should talk to His Holiness Dalai Lama. He went thru the cycles of birth and death 13 times and reincarnated as a "buddha" again. So there is no ending nor beginning. Everything is inter related to another and Karma is at work. The buddhists called it the Law.</p>

              <p>cannot...........Buddhism takes all the mystery out of all these religious stuff..........becoz there's no such thing as religion at all...........it's completely man-made................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the Buddha said.............'' in truth..............there are no Buddhas and teachings............''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>####   the phrase ''Buddha'' is simply used to distinguish him from the other non-awaken people..........the word ''Buddha'' has no meaning apart from that..........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>put simply...........everyone are just a collection of thoughts............ever-changing.........</p>
              <p>so to say you have a permanent soul or self is to say ...........a PC has a soul becoz it has Artificial Intelligence.......TOTALLY ABSURD............</p>

              <p><br>He's an ex-Buddhist eat Pork in temple then went crazy and seek Muslim but got kicked out then he went to Church and they offered him milk and cookies, then he du lan and he decided to wage war against all religions.</p>
              <p>So technically he's an ex-Buddhist out to create trouble in a Christian forum.</p>
              <p>He has already forgotten about what he had learnt.</p>
              <p>Shame on him, let's forgive him and all those sinners who chose to sin on purpose to defile the pure and one true religion, Christianity.</p>
