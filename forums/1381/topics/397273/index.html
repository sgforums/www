              <p>Joolead and Romanista,</p>
              <p>It is sad that various people have tried to reply you in good faith and with goodwill, but the two of you seem ever eager to reply with scorn and mocking when it is utterly unnecessary.</p>
              <p>It is not simply about being open-minded or even asking you to believe in the same thing. Not believing in it doesn't mean you have to disrespect and be scornful about it. I do not believe in other religions such as Hinduism but I do not insult it either.</p>
              <p>Also, despite the fact that people bring up to you their own experiences of people outside your stereotype or when the people themselves exhibit behaviour that doesn't conform to your stereotypes, you ignore it in favour of being hateful and encouraging continued attacks at Christianity as a whole instead.</p>
              <p>It's not like we are damning your every reply crude or not rude as saying you are satanic and are of the devil. There are those who have replied you in genuine good faith but you react directly with unwarranted hostility.</p>
              <p>As for Joolead's comments about heaven, hell and airplanes, heaven and hell are not physical places. But if you don't believe in things outside the physical then what is it to you?</p>
              <p>And about Christians 'cursing' you, the thing about saying you would go to hell as a non-believer is not cursing and wishing you go there. There is a difference in meaning, whether or not you believe hell exists.</p>
              <p>You are free to believe or not to believe whatever it is, but do note and understand of the many other Christians who have not conformed to your stereotypes or have not spoken back against you in anger. There those of us even here who respect your right not to believe, the least you could do is not be unnecessarily insulting towards people like that.</p>

              <p><em>For anyone posting or making comments here, whatever</em> <em><strong>faith or non-faith</strong> you may

               the arguement
                                      itself.</em></p>
              <p><em>To some people here more specifically and
               you know who you
                                      are. You try to make it seem as if you are being
               wronged or
                                      bullied, when your words and questions are more 
              aimed to provoke
                                      more than anything. It's even worse when you 
              know you can phrase
                                      things differently, yet you phrase it 
              deliberately to provoke, to
                                      anger, to incite ill-feeling. Yet you go about 
              accussing others of
                                      being trolls. The irony and hypocrysy of it all.</em></p>
              <p><em>Theological debate here is moot in any

                                      ultimately everybody here ends up in the same 
              state of belief or
                                      non-belief. In any case, so often the debate 
              goes haywire because
                                      of people who are all about the arguement and 
              conflict rather than
                                      really trying to exchange ideas and understand 
              the other. It's not
                                      just in this forum, it's in the whole of 
              sgforums.</em></p>
              <p><em>Ask yourself as well, are you just

               the person
                                      something. Provoking thought is one thing,

Thus, we are then worthy to be called his sons. And wait,....since all life comes from Adam and eve..den all incest liao lah? By your definition of blood releated...</em></strong></p>

              <p>eh, bible just mentions that when there are many disasters, judgement day will come (This refers to the end times)/ Take note that the end times started from AD 0 , so 2000 years had passed, let's us not fascinate about the end times and trying to predict, god forbid and no prediction will come true, we are not divine. So. seek him when you could</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the agony of Christians peraching to non christians, you all are just know little abt bible and talk like you know all, with your faulted understanding about bible, your thesis will definitely be faulted. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me urge all non Christians to attend bible study and understanding more about bible den talk here. =(</p>

              <p>Just because you don't believe in the belief of others means you have to disrespect it. Likewise because somebody chooses not to believe in any religion means he should be disrespected as well.</p>
              <p>At the very least, people have tried to answer you in good faith without insulting you or using crude language at you. Such matters of courtest are not about religion but as what a person should do in general.</p>
              <p>About pretending and hypocrite, then let me ask you again, do you truly believe all church-goers and all churches are the same? Whether or not you believe in their individual doctrines?</p>
              <p>Are you saying that the negative traits you relate to churches can only be found in churches and not in other organisations or associations?</p>
