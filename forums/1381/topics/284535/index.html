Man created God.<br>If you are serious about religion, then you must read history, anthropology and sociology. Throw out theology - it is just crap. Open your mind, do a comparative study, explore, search, research and search. Don't shut your mind, follow blindly a faith, go by family tradition, or subject to peer pressure. Most people who professed a religion actually know very little or if they do, simply learned by heart the bible, quran or sutra. These people can quote practically every word, verse and chapter of these 'holy' scriptures or books. But they all lacked one thing - common sense! When you put everything together, it seems that they all copy one another, twist them to suit their agenda or purpose and sell it to the masses like opium.<br>Remember this: if there is really a God, omnipotent and creator of all things - He will be greatly saddened by the madness of human, the atrocities and inhumanities that are worse than any beast that walked this earth. It will be one of His greatest regret and surely it is within His Power to end it!  But alas, there is no God. Man created the God to serve its own selfish purpose.<br>Note: I am talking about God, not about the philosophies of Buddha, Jesus, Confuscius, Aristotle or Mohammed. While some of the afore-mentioned became the 'founder' of present day religions, they are all humans, not god, not diety, not son of god, not the messiah or prophet or messenger of god. They invoked god, so that what they taught or said have credence. Today, you can also hear or see people doing the same but without much success. They can only be successful if they resort to evangelism, colonisation, forced conversion, crusade, holy wars, and lately terrorism!!!</div>
