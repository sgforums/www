              <p>For 2,000 years, Jews have rejected the Christian idea of Jesus as messiah. Why?<img class="inlineimg" title="Big Grin" src="http://www.sammyboy.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> <br> <br> It is important to understand why Jews don't believe in Jesus. The
              purpose is not to disparage other religions, but rather to clarify the
              Jewish position. The more data that's available, the better-informed
              choices people can make about their spiritual path.<img class="inlineimg" title="Big Grin" src="http://www.sammyboy.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Jews do not accept Jesus as the messiah because:<br> <br> 1) Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies.<br> <br> 2) Jesus did not embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah.<br> <br> 3) Biblical verses "referring" to Jesus are mistranslations.<br> <br> 4) Jewish belief is based on national revelation.<br> <br> At the end of this article, we will examine these additional topics:<br> <br> 5) Christianity contradicts Jewish theology<br> <br> 6) Jews and Gentiles<br> <br> 7) Bringing the Messiah<br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> 1) JESUS DID NOT FULFILL THE MESSIANIC PROPHECIES<br> <br> What is the Messiah supposed to accomplish? The Bible says that he will:<br> <br> A. Build the Third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28).<br> <br> B. Gather all Jews back to the Land of Israel (Isaiah 43:5-6).<br> <br> C. Usher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression,
              suffering and disease. As it says: "Nation shall not lift up sword
              against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore." (Isaiah 2:4)<br> <br> D. Spread universal knowledge of the God of Israel, which will unite
              humanity as one. As it says: "God will be King over all the world -- on
              that day, God will be One and His Name will be One" (Zechariah 14:9).<br> <br> The historical fact is that Jesus fulfilled none of these messianic prophecies.<br> <br> Christians counter that Jesus will fulfill these in the Second Coming,
              but Jewish sources show that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies
              outright, and no concept of a second coming exists.<br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> 2) JESUS DID NOT EMBODY THE PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF MESSIAH<br> <br> A. MESSIAH AS PROPHET<br> <br> Jesus was not a prophet. Prophecy can only exist in Israel when the
              land is inhabited by a majority of world Jewry. During the time of Ezra
              (circa 300 BCE), when the majority of Jews refused to move from Babylon
              to Israel, prophecy ended upon the death of the last prophets --
              Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.<br> <br> Jesus appeared on the scene approximately 350 years after prophecy had ended.<br> <br> B. DESCENDENT OF DAVID<br> <br> The Messiah must be descended on his father's side from King David (see
              Genesis 49:10 and Isaiah 11:1). According to the Christian claim that
              Jesus was the product of a virgin birth, he had no father -- and thus
              could not have possibly fulfilled the messianic requirement of being
              descended on his father's side from King David!<br> <br> C. TORAH OBSERVANCE<br> <br> The Messiah will lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance. The
              Torah states that all mitzvot remain binding forever, and anyone coming
              to change the Torah is immediately identified as a false prophet.
              (Deut. 13:1-4)<br> <br> Throughout the New Testament, Jesus contradicts the Torah and states
              that its commandments are no longer applicable. For example, John 9:14
              records that Jesus made a paste in violation of Shabbat, which caused
              the Pharisees to say (verse 16), "He does not observe Shabbat!"<br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> 3) MISTRANSLATED VERSES "REFERRING" TO JESUS<br> <br> Biblical verses can only be understood by studying the original Hebrew
              text -- which reveals many discrepancies in the Christian translation.<br> <br> A. VIRGIN BIRTH<br> <br> The Christian idea of a virgin birth is derived from the verse in
              Isaiah 7:14 describing an "alma" as giving birth. The word "alma" has
              always meant a young woman, but Christian theologians came centuries
              later and translated it as "virgin." This accords Jesus' birth with the
              first century pagan idea of mortals being impregnated by gods.<br> <br> B. CRUCIFIXION<br> <br> The verse in Psalms 22:17 reads: "Like a lion, they are at my hands and
              feet." The Hebrew word ki-ari (like a lion) is grammatically similar to
              the word "gouged." Thus Christianity reads the verse as a reference to
              crucifixion: "They pierced my hands and feet."<br> <br> C. SUFFERING SERVANT<br> <br> Christianity claims that Isaiah chapter 53 refers to Jesus, as the "suffering servant."<br> <br> In actuality, Isaiah 53 directly follows the theme of chapter 52,
              describing the exile and redemption of the Jewish people. The
              prophecies are written in the singular form because the Jews ("Israel")
              are regarded as one unit. The Torah is filled with examples of the
              Jewish nation referred to with a singular pronoun.<br> <br> Ironically, Isaiah's prophecies of persecution refer in part to the
              11th century when Jews were tortured and killed by Crusaders who acted
              in the name of Jesus.<br> <br> From where did these mistranslations stem? St. Gregory, 4th century
              Bishop of Nanianzus, wrote: "A little jargon is all that is necessary
              to impose on the people. The less they comprehend, the more they
              admire."</p>

              <p>Nobody created God. For if somebody or some entity had created God, then that entity would instead be God (and not the one being created). And if that entity was in turn created by another entity, then that other entity would be God instead (and not the entity that was created). This can go on but ultimately, it must stop somewhere, at a primary entity who first started the chain - who was not created by anyone. And we call this ultimate entity GOD. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>1)the believer believe that they will go to a better place "heaven" after dead.Does anyone been there before?(maybe some believer can try it and tell us,it not a sin since it fullfill god's purpose 1)can go to a better place and 2)agreat deed as the believer's organ can save other,too.)</p>
              <p>2)alot of asian pple believe it what happen(if there is really better place) if after dead they appear at pearly gate and st.paul or peter say:'sorry pal.you got the wrong religion. and hell you go.'</p>
              <p>3)since they believe in what believe in a so call powerful GOD ,why in the bible he chose to speak to some human to tell the other that he exist?why don't it just appear infront of people ?</p>
              <p>(may be that time they don't have any shrink to look up for.)</p>
              <p>4)the believer 's belief so call power GOD why are there recession (especaily in the country that believe it?) and poverty and sickness still around?</p>

              <p>fundamentally speaking..... do you believe in the existence of the supernatural realm?</p>
              <p>1. there are people who claimed to have seen ghosts and spirits.... so do ghosts and spirits exists?</p>
              <p>2. if there is pearly gate that turned away people that are in the wrong race, then the supernatural realm exists.</p>
              <p>3. in the Bible, God appeared in a column of cloud and a pillar of fire to the Israelites.., but since you don't want to quote the Bible as evidence, why bother to ask?</p>
              <p>4. when you jump from a 10 storey building, it is likely you will die, even if you are a Christian. The world operates on the system it has created, it will suffer the consequences of the system it has created. Very much the same, when Israel elected Saul as king inspite of the warnings not to, Israel suffered the consequences of that decision.</p>
              <p>who created God? you will have the chance to ask him when you meet him.</p>
