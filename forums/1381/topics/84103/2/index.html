            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>haiz..my friend stupidissmart..... you say that there is no God... So you tell me, what happens at the end of our life? Where do we go? Ok, assuming there is either a God or there is no God at all. 50:50. Would you rather take your chance and believe in something good? Or have no hope at all? </blockquote>Wat do u think will happen at the end of life ? Nothing. U just die. No fanfare, no heaven gonna to open up neither is there hell to swallow u in. Isn't tat wat everyone observes to a person who is dead ? If heaven and hell is real, why do they hide it from us ? Why make it so secretive tat no one can prove it's existence ?<br><br>In the case of believing in a religion, I have to iterate again u do not choose a religion just because it promise u the moons and stars. A lot of religion promises u moons and stars and the concept of heaven etc. So u choose one tat promise u the most "goodies" or one tat sounds the most logical ? I am sure other cults promise everything, even to have a chance of bcoming a deity yourself. Since there is a 50:50 chance of it to be true as wat u say, why don't u believe in tat religion ? Surely being a deity beats being a servant to one isn't it ?<br><br>IMO, for the case between christainity and science, I put the odds as 0:95. Christainity cannot be true since there r too much contradictions and too illogical, while science cannot add up to 100 percent for science because there is no absolute in the world. FYI illogical doesn't means supernatural forces performing feats, but reason (the reason for performing certain actions r dumb) and history(if such acts r true, then we should find certain artifacts tat tells of its existence) of performing such feats.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>What you want? A one day guided tour of heaven by Saint Peter? Or a one day free and easy tour of hell? </blockquote>I am asking wat is the rationale of hiding heaven and hell from us If u ask me, the best reasons is it doesn't exists. There is not even a sign or anything remotely close to suggets another place when one dies. Why ? If it exists, why don't they tell it straight to men in the first place so tat they can judge their actions better ? They want to be funny by telling it on tales in bibles and not showing the real world evidence out ?<br><br><blockquote>Close lah. A resurrected and eternally glorified body is close to a deity. And deity also got hierarchy one mah. Not listening to the Jade Emperor and involving in romance is a chargeable offense in heaven, isn't it?</blockquote>How about Nirvana from buddhism ? It appears tat it is a higher state than deities themselves.<br><br>For your taoist case at least they have free will and do special things like feasting peaches or got powers of their own to fly and help people. They manage to be a deity no matter wat your religion is before. In fact even if u r a fox spirit u have a chance to go to heaven too. They treat the jade emperor as a king and not as... god... He still give fair trials, debate and listen to his officials. God kill u without valid reason, send u to hell if u disobey him, doesn't give warning, doesn't have restraint on his power, isn't fair, treat men as mere slaves, sacrifice and torture his son to himself. He is very much a loner demanding attention... It is not really the same...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi worried99,<br><br>I apologise for this late reply as I have been tied up with work lately.<br><br>I am also from an Anglican church. I am also disturbed by some sermons in a certain Charismatic church. I know some of their preaching can be very radical and hardly acceptable to us.<br><br>I think it'll be hard to convince your girlfriend that the pastor's preaching is "dubious". Most important thing for you to do is to continually pray for her. Pray together and listen to whatever God has to say.<br><br>Many a times, we tend to pray that God will take away illnesses from us. We only want to the solution immediately. It's natural. But we'll never know what God wants us to learn from this experience. Pray for wisdom and perserverance. Pray that God will help you both through this difficult situation. Pray that there is strength in times of darkness. Pray for surefootedness in God. And await for God's answers.<br><br>The important thing is to be patient. Of course, please do go see a doctor for her condition. God gives help through many channels and doctors are definitely one of them.<br><br>To the rest, please refrain from going into discussions of your viewpoints of Chrisitianity. Worrired99 needs support, not a debate.</div>
