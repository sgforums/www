            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I went to this charismatic church in sg with my gf. At first I was very happy with the church as it preaches the message of the grace of our LORD Jesus, and i thought it gives people a lot of hope.<br><br>After a few months, I became very uncomfortable with the church. The Pastor actually says GOD ask him to anoint those businessmen in the church so that their businesses flourish and be living testimonies to GOD ( "BUSINESS MEN ARE THE MISSIONARIES OF THIS CENTURY...as DOORS ARE CLOSED TO MISSIONARIES" ) He also blessed couples in the name of the LORD, saying that he see visions of 'floating babies' during the anointing.  When a visiting pastor from australia came to sg to preach in the church, after he finished preaching, the same pastor who saw floating babies says something like this :" u noe what church, two weeks ago i was preaching abt LIFE in the LORD, and today what did the visiting pastor said? HE says abt life....This shows that we were both preaching in the holy spirit..."<br><br>Other instances include he and some other pastors talked abt people who grew new kidneys when they had kidney failures, and that in India a sermon of 70,000, there was actually 'holy chaos' when people with broken legs jump up and walk......a sick child with withered hands and in a fetus like position came up and walk after prayer....near dead person with cancer healed the next day after her relatives preached in tongues.....church member won a large sum of money legitimately after praying and writing personal letters to GOD everyday.....church member won NKF 0.75 million dollars condo... every week there are new miracles, some people grow new kidneys, cured of cancers when pray in tongues, something unheard of when i was in my anglican church.<br><br>Now the pastor says that "If you want to reap the full benefits of prayers, speaking in tougues is mandatory, not an option..." The sight of people falling down to the ground during healing sessions look very queen to me.<br><br>All this are too much for me. I told my galfriend abt it and she thinks I am pulling down her faith, drawing her away from GOD. I just want her to see some sense.<br><br>I am from an anglican background, and i have been warned of false prophets in the ending times. I am very uncomfortable with what i have seen / hear in the charismatic church.<br><br>How can I help my gf?<br><br>All these are too much for me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know why u r worried... the pasta talk COCk and too bad your girlfriend believes in it.<br><br>Maybe u can try to ask the pasta to justify his claims to the bible. Holy spirit is crap since no one knows if a holy host is around anyone. I can talk about life, love, kindness, hope, miracle now and sometime in future the pasta in your church will talk about it too. So does tat mean I have the holy ghost too ? If he do not justify his belief and u guys believe in it, then r guys r already pawns to his cults.<br><br>His talk about miracles closely resembles tat of 4D gambling addicts. I heard of 4D addicts claiming a family buying a 4D number because he dreams of it being the license plate of his car. And u know wat ? They strike ! 4D addicts also got story about someone praying to a hidden temple in a jungle and he buy the 4D number he get. U know wat again ? He strikes ! All these r just talk cock ! Every religion has tons of them ! A sick child with withered hands and in a fetus like position came up and walk after prayer ? Does his hand got healed ? Can he walk before ? A sick child of 12 years with no hands can surely walk too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Go any video of tis ? I wanna see it man ! Maybe he is the new Dalai Lama ! Can he fly or glow in the dark too ? Church member won NKF 0.75 million dollars condo ? Wat is the % of population in singapore tat is christians ? Wat does tat prove about god ? UNFAIR ! Wat do u think of an unfair god ? Anything than perfect !<br><br>No wonder why a lot of people r trying to speak about tongues now. Even the pasta say such a big piece of sh!t... As I said before, how do one knows if he is speaking glibberish or speaking in tongue ? Everyone can speak gibblish even monkeys and pigs. Let me ask, there r people tat speaks gibblish, it there one tat hear gibblish ? If no one can hears gibblish wat is the point of gibblish ? If there is really one tat is suppose to hear gibblish, then test him lah ! I am pretty sure he is just a fraud !<br><br>Why don't u challenge by asking difficult questions to tis pasta ? If u want maybe ask her to pose questions to tis forum and maybe someone like eng chin, icemoon or fandango can answer them. Seems like a start of a cult where the pasta got absolute powers. Maybe one day he ask your girlfriend to start a fire to a mosque and she may agree.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, actually i agree with the pastor, whoever he is la. looking in the christian perspective, missionaries are definitely closed in places like china. in fact, most people are reaching out in china under charity movements, or business.<br><br>i don't really see the issue here, after all, every christian should be a "missionary" of sort. we are asked to be disciple makers, to make disciples of all nations. so even if you are a student, you are supposed to be a missionary for God, wherever He place you.<br><br>businessmen are definitely a great potential to preach the gospel, we're in the "business" of saving souls.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>i've been to hong kong for mission, and they do have "gospel" businessmen, they get together during lunch to pray, then they hold parties and stuff, then invite their clients, and fellow businessmen, then preach there.<br><br>sorry, i only read the front part about businessmen being blessed and what your pastor said, didn't read all.<br><br>but i guess you should pray about it. ask God where He wants you to shine as his child. if God wants you to leave the church, He will definitely let you know. God bless!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>So issit Satay Pasta or Pasta Bolognise you're talking about? </blockquote>Tat is deliberately mis-spelled. If u want to treat it as satay pasta or French plaster, go ahead. I am sure most readers aren't as dumb to not know wat I am refering to.<br><br><blockquote>Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is an unforgivable sin. </blockquote>Then sue me.<br><br>I am still going to say justifying your speech or action only because u claim a holy spirit is around u is crap, and it will always remains as one.<br><br><blockquote>Or they got the number through their Luohan Fish? </blockquote>They have many such instances and they believe in it because such miracles had been achieved. Wat differences is believing in luohan fishes giving 4D than to believe in miracle treatment for cancer ?<br><br><blockquote>Then worried99 should anti-psycho his girlfriend to start a fire to the church. Then the pasta really Satay Pasta liao.</blockquote>The way this guy teaches is really very similar to wat the radical religious group is doing. He claims certain actions (speaking in tongues) had to be performed to show u r pious. Wat is the diff of promising one can go to heaven if they perform bombing ?</div>

The end result for her is probably the same whether she is a staunch believer or non-believer. It could have been much worse without Jesus ?

She is a faithful christian. I ask her:" You are faithful my dear, but why are u still not healed every week the pastor says u r..."<br><br>she told me:" It could have been much worse without Jesus."<br><br></div></blockquote>Erm.... I think for blood in urine should see doctor le... not sit there and wait for God to heal her... God will only help those who help themselves.... God had create human and human found science and thru science medicine... so shouldn't she just go see a doctor?? blood in urine could be caused by urial tract infection... just need some antibiotics...</div>
