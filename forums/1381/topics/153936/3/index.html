I must say the more 'modern' form of Taoism we currently know has similarities with Shintoism. In China, the teachings of Tao can be said to have started by Lao Tzu... in the beginning Taoism has no rituals nor rites nor was it a religion, but more like a philosophy. The only scripture that Lao Tzu had taught was the Tao Te Ching. But later many forms of rites/rituals/practise/worship/gods become part of Taoism. Thus Taoism becomes the indigenious religion of China.<br><br>Buddhism on the other hand, is neither like Shintoism nor like Taoism. It is not an indigenious belief rooted in local culture nor a religion. While Buddhism first started from India, its teachings has spread throughout the world, now increasingly in the Western countries. We also does not emphasize on rituals and rites, nor worship gods or spirits. The practise of chanting is also not a rite nor a ritual. This tradition of chanting started way back when Buddha passed into Parinirvana. After 3 weeks, a council of 500 enlightened monks met and recited the words of Buddha, the precepts, and so on. The teachings are orally passed down through the routine practise of chanting so that the words of Buddha are not lost... so the teachings are orally passed down in the very beginning. Later they are written on palm leaves, etc. It is only a few hundred years later that they are compiled into written text. The tradition of chanting continues until today.. so that we may be well versed in the sutras, understand the teachings of Buddha, attain realisation, and apply the teachings in our lives. Usually (depending on schedule) when I go to my dharma centre every weekend Saturday, before the dharma talk we would have a chanting + meditation session.<br><br>In the beginning, there were no images nor statues of Buddha. The first images/statues of Buddhas started several hundred years after the Buddha's passing into Parinirvana. We do prostration out of respect and reverence, also a way to lessen our 'ego-form', not to be mistaken as a form of worship. Buddhists generally do not worship any supreme beings.<br><br>The 4 dharma seals/3 dharma seals apply to all the authentic Buddhist traditions. What are the dharma seals? Impermanence, non-self, nirvana. But it is also said... that there are 84000 dharma doors towards enlightenment. An analogy: there are 10 gates surrounding the great palace, each gate leads to the same place (goal). Zen Buddhism is one of the Buddhist traditions, that focuses on the practise of Meditation &amp; Koans, in order to achieve Enlightenment/Self-realisation. It's direct lineage started from Buddha from India, and later an Indian monk Bodhidharma, the 28th Patriarch of Zen, brought Zen Buddhism to China. However it is not to be mistaken that all Buddhist traditions that practise meditation means they are Zen Buddhism.</div>
