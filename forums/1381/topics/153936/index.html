            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, So far I've hardly seen any Buddhist-turned-Christian converts... Buddhist as defined as having taken refuge in Buddha, Dharma, Sangha (not those IC-Buddhist or those who pray to gods [taoist practice] and claim to be Buddhists).

But evangelism is a big part of Christianity, because it is believed that Christianity brings salvation, so whoever's converted to become a Christian, has been saved. But Buddhism focuses more on your actions, on how to be a better person. Praising Buddha and worshipping Him often, does not necessarily bring you enlightenment nor allow you to attain Nirvana. Nor does it promise you a place in heaven. But practising what Buddha teaches, will bring you on the path to becoming a Buddha yourself. Which will take you out of the cycle of rebirth and death, into eternal peace and happiness.<br><br>I am most interested to hear from those of us who have explored both Buddhism and Christianity in depth, and decided to choose Christianity over Buddhism.</div>

They tried converting me though.<br><br>I don't have anything in depth to share (I'm sure you want to hear sharing about teachings, enlightenment etc of both religions).  I don't intend to find fault with Buddhist teachings as this will be very unfair to those Buddhists who live as a good person.<br><br>The thing is I just cannot bend towards Buddhism all because of a bad dream that I had when I was three or four.  The impression is still very vivid in my head.  I shall not share what the dream about.  After all it's just a dream that appeared to a four year old kid (me lah!).  Also when I told my dream to my parents and siblings, they got extremely offended and defensive.  They explained that I must have done something really wrong to have that dream.  But I was only four!  I guess I am just as stubborn as them lah.</div>
