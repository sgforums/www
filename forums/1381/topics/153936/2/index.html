Also the 1st Mandarin service in that parish.  I think in the beginning they added that timeslot to test water or what.  In the past, there were only services in the morning, one at eight and the other at ten.  After that, most people attend the early morning ones and then proceed to their respective meetings : Youth meeting, Choir practise etc.  I love Mandarin service and sermons.  All the more I supported him.  After a couple of years I went back to visit that parish, that time slot Sunday Service is packed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Protestants call a church a church. Unlike Catholic churches whose believers are more likely to live nearby, Protestant members hail from around the island.</div>
