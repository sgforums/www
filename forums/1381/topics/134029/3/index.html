            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>No, I am saying your assumption tat gays must be borned from gay parents are wrong. Gays can be from straight parents. </blockquote>Is this a strawman? I don't think I said that.<br><br><blockquote>U really need to give me the definition of frolicking, and then tell me wat animals actually frolick to the point where the sperms will fly. THey r gonna use the hooves/flipers/claws or use their mouth to make the other party ejaculate ? Tis is discovery channel at its best ! Please explain to me. </blockquote>I said the scenario is fictitious. If you want to use 'foreplay' instead of frolicking, go ahead. It still doesn't change my main point.<br><br><blockquote>If the chances is so little it can be ignored. It still boils down to the point tat animals r homo, they do not die out which is another sign tat it is natural </blockquote>Note that even though you see cases of homo, it is not the case the whole species is homo. So for course they don't die out. But I believe the one that is homo should die out, as in genes don't get passed down. Maybe by being homo, overpopulation is reduced .. haha .. so homo is good at the expense of the homos.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>But wat r we to say tat having sex in the anal is unnatural since it can really be physically done and animals r doing it. There is nothing man made involved isn't it ? </blockquote>The law says sodomy is unnatural .. lol .. dun ask me who is the law to say? If you believe in justice and equality, you need the law.<br><br><blockquote>U r not answering the question tat medically and biologically speaking homosexual is different from heterosexual. There r many studies tat show the brain structure from homo and hetero r different. Why don't u answer to tat ?  </blockquote>You just proven homos are more than a difference in sexual preferences?<br><br><blockquote>It is not black and white as one either like girls totally or guys totally. There r in between </blockquote>That is ok. Many people like power .. it is until you succumb to the dark side that is the problem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>You said that you cannot accept homosexuality because it is cleary not natural.</blockquote>One can argue along two lines. Trivially something can be natural, as in it exists in nature, but it brings no benefit to the organism itself (not referring to the species). In humans, if you are a straight homo, and if you don't do in vitro or ICSI, your genes die in your generation. I don't understand why anyone can call this natural? One can also argue it in the context of faith, blah blah .. this needs no explanation.<br><br><blockquote>Heng pointed out that diseases occur naturally. Now you say, diseases are acts of the devil. </blockquote>Once again, I don't want to speak for those believers of 'health and wealth' gospel. Wait they sue me for twisting their teachings I cham.

Before the Fall, there is no sin in mankind (even though the Fall of Satan preceded that of mankind)</div>

U believe in tat now right ?<br><br><blockquote>I said the scenario is fictitious. If you want to use 'foreplay' instead of frolicking, go ahead. It still doesn't change my main point. </blockquote>Wat is your mainpoint ? tat homo animals do not hav sex with each other but instead forlick with their hooves and it send a sperm through the narrow paasage of a female species and she got impregnanted ?<br><br><blockquote>Note that even though you see cases of homo, it is not the case the whole species is homo. So for course they don't die out. But I believe the one that is homo should die out, as in genes don't get passed down. Maybe by being homo, overpopulation is reduced .. haha .. so homo is good at the expense of the homos</blockquote>Tat brings back to the frist point of tis post. I don't care if it is good or nto for the species. I wanna ask u if it is natural or not. From your post here, it seems u believe it is natural and there r animals being homo and they supposedly be borned from straight parents. Whether it is good or bad, I don't care<br><br><blockquote>The law says sodomy is unnatural .. lol .. dun ask me who is the law to say? If you believe in justice and equality, you need the law. </blockquote>The law have changed to acknowledge gays is accepted. Some laws even approved gay marriages because recently medical facts have said they r natural.<br><br><blockquote>You just proven homos are more than a difference in sexual preferences? </blockquote>I have proven tat homosexual have a fundamental difference in their structure. It is natural. Tis fundamental structure difference is used to explain their sexual preferences.<br><br><blockquote>That is ok.

Why don't u state your personal belief and whether is dieseases natural or manmade.

They just never force u to do anything special or extraordinary liek going to church etc<br><br><blockquote>Sicknesses? did not exist before the Fall. So they are unnatural</blockquote>Tat is silly. Death does not exist before the fall too, so they r unnatural too ? Then if they r unnatural, the must be man made isn't it ?

Perfectly straight parents can give birth to individualk with the higher tendency to become gays. As long as there is people reproducing, there will be people becoming gays. Everyone have the gene to "make gays".<br><br><blockquote>I don't understand why anyone can call this natural?</blockquote>The structure of their body is different.
