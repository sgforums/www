I thought it was quite common sense actually ..<br><br><blockquote>Wat is your mainpoint ? tat homo animals do not hav sex with each other but instead forlick with their hooves and it send a sperm through the narrow paasage of a female species and she got impregnanted ? </blockquote>My point is you can't apply what happens in the animal kingdom to human beings like comparing apples with apples. Hell, the female praying mantis? eats up the head of its main counterpart, and that is considered natural. You can't say the same for human beings.<br><br><blockquote>Tat brings back to the frist point of tis post. I don't care if it is good or nto for the species. I wanna ask u if it is natural or not.</blockquote>It exists in nature.<br><br><blockquote>The law have changed to acknowledge gays is accepted. Some laws even approved gay marriages because recently medical facts have said they r natural. </blockquote>Not so much in Singapore.<br><br>I think gay marriages are approved in the name of liberty and not after medical research?<br><br><blockquote>Lets not just say something and when it went wrong, push the explaining to other group. Why don't u state your personal belief and whether is dieseases natural or manmade. No one had ask u about wat the health and weath people think </blockquote>It never went wrong, but I don't feel like doing any explaination for them. Moreover I am not suitable for the task.<br><br>Health and wealth people are xtians too, so it helps to examine their belief.<br><br>If you really want my personal belief, then you have to accept they have nothing to do with christianity. I don't want to grant anyone the chance to shoot a faith based on what I said.<br><br><blockquote>They do told. U r not a buddhist and u know about it. They just never force u to do anything special or extraordinary liek going to church etc </blockquote>How they tell you? Popular conception is often misconception. It is the same with people's understanding of the gospel too.<br><br><blockquote>Tat is silly. Death does not exist before the fall too, so they r unnatural too ? Then if they r unnatural, the must be man made isn't it ? Then reproduction is unnatural since tat doesn;t exist before the fall too </blockquote>If one defines natural as what is good and right before God, what is supposed to be happening etc, then only the pre-Fall period fits the criteria.<br><br>Death is unnatural too. God told the couple if they makan the fruit they will die. Why you think reproduction did not happen before the fall?<br><br><blockquote>Everyone have the gene to "make gays". </blockquote>Is the research conclusive enough to show the genetic basis of homosexuality?<br><br><blockquote>The structure of their body is different. U refuse to answer to tat point about tis found medical fact. </blockquote>Vague. What is the difference? They can still walk, run and talk like hetero.</div>

Swaab conducted the next noteworthy experiment in 1990.  This experiment became the first to document a physiological difference in the anatomical structure of a gay man's brain.  Swaab found in his post-mortem examination of homosexual males' brains that a portion of the hypothalamus of the brain was structurally different than a heterosexual brain.  The hypothalamus is the portion of the human brain directly related to sexual drive and function.  In the homosexual brains examined, a small portion of the hypothalamus, termed the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), was found to be twice the size of its heterosexual counterpart [2]. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">At the same time, another scientist, Laura S. Allen made a similar discovery in the hypothalamus as well.  She found that the anterior commissure (AC) of the hypothalamus was also significantly larger in the homosexual subjects than that of the heterosexuals [2].  Both Swaab's and Allen's results became a standing ground for the biological argument on homosexuality.  The very fact that the AC and the SCN are not involved in the regulation of sexual behavior makes it highly unlikely that the size differences results from differences in sexual behavior. Rather the size differences came prenatally during sexual differentiation.  The size and shape of the human brain is determined biologically and is impacted minutely, if at all by behavior of any kind. </span><br><br>More of tat website on nature do cause an effect.

Even without direct evidence of individual genes we could be confident in predicting that, like almost all aspects of behaviour, sexual orientation has multiple biological and cultural influences. As it is, there is a growing pile of evidence from multiple areas of research that give us an idea of exactly what the biological influences, both genetic and non-genetic, may be.<br><br>One gene in particular has been associated with male homosexuality. A gene on the X chromosome has been shown to be present in a significantly larger proportion of homosexuals to heterosexuals. It is clear that this gene is not "the gay gene" described by the media, as its presence of absence alone does not determine sexual orientation.<br><br>There are strong indications of a link between male homosexuality and the pre-natal environment, including birth-order and the mother's blood pressure and androgen (male hormone) levels, which can be traced back to an interaction of the mother's environment and genes (see below). </span><br><br>From wiki<br><br><blockquote>My point is you can't apply what happens in the animal kingdom to human beings like comparing apples with apples. Hell, the female praying mantis? eats up the head of its main counterpart, and that is considered natural. You can't say the same for human beings. </blockquote>However the animals do commit such acts, like homosexual. God created animals and ther r unfallen or have not sinned. They r in the form god always intended. He made animals gays, tat means he have little problems with homosexual. When u mention about praying mantis ripping off another head, to me, if a god exist tat create the praying mantis, the only conclusion I get is god is a cruel being to force another to kill another. If animals do it, it shows it is not cultural or manmade factors tat made certain people gay.<br><br><blockquote>Not so much in Singapore.<br><br>I think gay marriages are approved in the name of liberty and not after medical research? </blockquote>The bottomline is there r laws have accomodate gays marriage. So just quoting singapore laws is not useful. It could be after much medical research<br><br><blockquote>How they tell you? Popular conception is often misconception.

I believe tis definition is wat most people do know. If u define natural as wat is good in the period before adam fall, then reproduction is also unnatural and having sex with a heterosexual regardless of reasons is unnatural and a sin.

            <div class='col-md body'>Some may tell u that homosexuality is wrong based on the bible, but others may say that u have to read the texts according to its social context and not just read it literally. So what is right and what is wrong? Nobody can really say theirs is the most right. Ultimately whatever u do u are answerable to god urself. Let him say what is right/wrong.<br><br>I have seen somebody wrote in a local gay christian church website that he and his partner are bringing god into their relationship. Blasphemy? These pple may also have several verses in the bible to backup what they said, according to their own interpretation.<br><br>Think sometime people become bigots and hypocrites when they are quick to point out the flaws of others, without realising there are even bigger flaws in themselves.<br><br>Ultimately, people believe only what they want to believe. You will know whether u r right in time to come when u are being judged accordingly.<br><br>Christianity criminalised? Dun think it is the only one that criminalised in history. When Christianity becomes the Romans' state ideology, the persecuted christians become the persecutors when they got rid of the pagans. Is it right for anyone to persecute somebody else in the name of God? Only these people know what their real intentions are.</div>
