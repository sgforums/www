When not accepted by others, even by yourself sometimes, He is the one who always accepts you. Only believe, you are precious to him. Bring all you are suffering to His feet, only open your heart to be loved by Him as you are.

            <div class='col-md body'>when i say that humans lack basic humanity, it refers to the basic humanity of being more accepting towards their fellow humans, even if they're different from the norm. That, Ito_^, is the basic humanity u're lacking, and that is why i find u awful. Btw maybe u lack comprehension skills to ever think that i said anal sex is basic humanity. LEARN to READ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Icemoon, I have no faith in Jesus. Simply because he has allowed fanatics to hide behind his name for their own prejudices.<br><br>And I'll ask all of u now, if u think that homosexuality is unnatural, then what about transexuality? Seriously, why do you find the need to condemn anything that is not normal? Who even defines nature? Nature is understood thru science, and science is still at such an infant age where the human mind cannot be understood. Homosexuality has existed for thousands of years. What makes u so sure that it is a sin in God's eyes? The Bible is not, and was never an accurate direct memo from God. It was written by man who have coloured and polluted it with their petty prejudices. Would u stake everything u have on saying that the bible is 100% accurate, and is worded exactly as God willed? what if it is you who has been misled and u have been speaking out against God's will? Wouldn't you be the sinners then? Take some time out to think. Religion isn't about blind faith.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"when i say that humans lack basic humanity, it refers to the basic humanity of being more accepting towards their fellow humans, even if they're different from the norm. That, Ito_^, is the basic humanity u're lacking, and that is why i find u awful. Btw maybe u lack comprehension skills to ever think that i said anal sex is basic humanity. LEARN to READ"<br><br>from what i gather, you are saying humanity doesn't seem human at all, because   accepting anti-social people isn't the most common traits of humanity. this basic humanity that you imagined is only hot air.<br><br>you are saying, its alright to have sexual love between guys even if its not sexual and repressed?<br><br>or should we pretend that we love everyone and accept what we ourselves feel is wrong? than the catholics would be much better and honest by stateing what they can stand and what they cannot stand clearly instead of delluding themselves like drugged hippies.<br><br>fine, so i lack the comprehension to read and do not have that basic humanity and i am awful than so be it. at least i am honest to myself to take my stand on issues.<br><br>HOMSEXUALITY ROTS. and your basic humanity is bullshit.[/quote]</div>

Would u stake everything u have on saying that the bible is 100% accurate, and is worded exactly as God willed? what if it is you who has been misled and u have been speaking out against God's will?

Until you can give me a convincing explanation that homosexuality chances survival, you die die also must accept homosexuals are not "natural", literally. Come on, they violate the first principles of an organism - reproduction. And sexual preferences is geared for that, assuming genes come from male and female.<br><br><blockquote>what if it is you who has been misled and u have been speaking out against God's will?
