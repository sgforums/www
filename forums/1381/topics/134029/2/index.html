Do you need me to quote the dictionary to prove frolicking is not having sex? </blockquote>U really need to give me the definition of frolicking, and then tell me wat animals actually frolick to the point where the sperms will fly.

It is something like bees picking up pollens. By the way, pollens are the male sex cells in plants. </blockquote>So u mean the female pick up the sperm and stuff it up to her ovary ?

There is nothing man made involved isn't it ?<br><br>U r not answering the question tat medically and biologically speaking homosexual is different from heterosexual. There r many studies tat show the brain structure from homo and hetero r different.

They all sin in the same area isn't it ? BTW as said before, there is a sexuality test where people have varying degree of attraction to certain sex. It is not black and white as one either like girls totally or guys totally. There r in between<br><br><blockquote>You seem to confuse being natural as being good</blockquote>Natural means it is an act of god tat cause the person to be such. Yet god appears to condemn such people. Isn't tat punishing someone for an action u had done ?<br></div>
