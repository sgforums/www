I will not simply take any pastor's " god tell me to tell u this" message easily. This is dangerous as pple in big charismatic churches seem to take the word of their senior pastor as absolute, esp when the pastor says it is from god.<br><br>No pastor, whether Anglican, Presbyterian or any mainstream church, has told me "god tells me to tell you this". And this should be taken with extreme caution. IMHO, pastors with sound theological background do not say "god tells me to tell u this" readily. This shows that theological education for pastors is necessary and not just a conviction by what one believe is the holy spirit.<br><br>And I would like to reiterate the fact that pastors of megachurches, have a greater responsibilty to check what they want to preach to their flock, becoz what they said will influence a lot of people at one time. There is no use apologising for mistakes later becoz the harm is already done.<br><br>And again to the "MacChrist" strategy of attracting believers, it will only not keep believers in church.
