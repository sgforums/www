            <div class='col-md body'>To add on, this question been lurking in my mind for sometime<br><br>What are the defining morals and virtues required of Christians?<br><br>Is it like what St Thomas Aquinas said, courage, temperance, justice and prudence, and above all, faith, hope and charity?<br><br>The intention of the question is pretty simple. Observing this forum for sometime, its disturbing to note a significant number, who proclaim and advocate morality using God as their authority, and try to potray themselves as just, would also engage in acts of cunning, deceits, unjust labels of others, defamations, and even indulge in emotional extremes.<br><br>Not only do they embroil themselves in anger and hate, they also perform a certain amount of unjust actions on others, such as false accusations, not dealing with the issues but would rather perform personal attacks etc etc...<br><br>Is it right, therefore, to ignore, deny, or refuse to do a soul searching exercise, on all these deeds, use God and the Bible as a shield, and continue doing these acts? Are these deeds considered moral in Christianity? In fact, would it allow so called 'pious' Christians, who want to achieve a place in heaven, but are willing to commit sinful acts in his lifetime.<br><br></div>

Did it sustain or relapse?<br><br>Most of the ailments cured which I heard in charismatic church here is stiff/pain on parts of the body which I cannot confirm.<br><br>Think Benny Hinn also tried to raise the dead from TV evangelical program. Is that biblical? Obviously not.<br><br>Anything that is extra-biblical (e.g God tells me) and depend on "voices" is dangerous. I personally believe the only pple who hear audible voices in their heads are schizoprenic. God's message usually comes in more indirect way, at least for me.<br><br>What I am trying to emphasize here is not to cause division, rather than alert pple to the fact that some things said by charismatic pastors are unsound. As Christians we should not be afraid to speak up for things that are not right.<br></div>

If what the pastor says is not in the bible, it is extra-biblical and must be take with caution. I always do that in church but I doubt pple in big charismatic churches do, as they always say:" Pastor XXX says" rather than what the bible says.<br><br></div>
