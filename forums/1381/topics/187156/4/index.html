They also teach things which are valid to our spiritual growth. I never did agree. I said, all churches are teaching the wrong thing. Acutally, there is nothing wrong with what the Charismatic church teaches, neither are the teachings of the mainstream churches wrong. Each has a different revelation. But the point i am making is there is wrong teaching in the churches already. In ALL churches, not just the charismatics, if you want to point the finger, just go digging in the RC church, plenty of heresies there already.
