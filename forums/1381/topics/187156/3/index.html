May I know what are the wrong things taught by mainstream churches?

They also teach things which are valid to our spiritual growth. I never did agree. I said, all churches are teaching the wrong thing. Acutally, there is nothing wrong with what the Charismatic church teaches, neither are the teachings of the mainstream churches wrong. Each has a different revelation. But the point i am making is there is wrong teaching in the churches already. In ALL churches, not just the charismatics, if you want to point the finger, just go digging in the RC church, plenty of heresies there already. If you want to know my gripe, then read through the various threads in this forum. I have spoken at length about it.<br><br>You mean you believe in God's healing. It does not have to come through holy communion.<br><br></div>

But the point is this, God desires to bless all of us as His children. The reason for this is given in deut 28, so that all the peoples of the earth shall see that we are called by the name of our God.<br><br>If you want to stay poor, be my guest. Though I would not wish it upon you. I believe as a child of God, I am prosperous in every area of my life, not just in my wealth.

I will not simply take any pastor's " god tell me to tell u this" message easily. This is dangerous as pple in big charismatic churches seem to take the word of their senior pastor as absolute, esp when the pastor says it is from god.<br><br>No pastor, whether Anglican, Presbyterian or any mainstream church, has told me "god tells me to tell you this". And this should be taken with extreme caution. IMHO, pastors with sound theological background do not say "god tells me to tell u this" readily. This shows that theological education for pastors is necessary and not just a conviction by what one believe is the holy spirit.<br><br>And I would like to reiterate the fact that pastors of megachurches, have a greater responsibilty to check what they want to preach to their flock, becoz what they said will influence a lot of people at one time. There is no use apologising for mistakes later becoz the harm is already done.<br><br>And again to the "MacChrist" strategy of attracting believers, it will only not keep believers in church.
