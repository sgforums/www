Does it glorify man instead of glorifying god? Does it claim to have a new messiah after Christ? Does it allow me to edify myself and grow to be a better christian? Is it in-line with what I already know and learnt in church?<br><br>or<br><br><strong>What kind of salvation it preaches? (by faith/christ's merits, by works/own merit?) </strong>Does it contradict the basic tenets of Christianity - the divinity of our lord Jesus, triune god and so on....<br><br>it just branches out from the simple principle....hope it help u?]</div>
