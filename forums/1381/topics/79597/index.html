All rights reserved. www.charismamag.com </span><br><br><strong>Derek Prince, Charismatic Author And Bible Teacher, Dies in Jerusalem</strong><br><br>The former atheist, educated as a scholar, was a forerunner of modem teaching on prayer and the biblical restoration of Israel<br><br><span class="small">By Eric Tiansay and Adrienne S. Gaines </span><br><br>Internationally known author and charismatic Bible teacher Derek Prince died of heart failure Sept. 24. He was 88. Prince had suffered from a series of chronic illnesses in the last several years and died in his sleep at his Jerusalem home, a statement from Derek Prince Ministries said.<br><br>Prince, who had lived in Israel off and on since the 1940 s , had a teaching and healing ministry that spanned some six decades. His daily radio program, Today With Derek Prince, currently reaches more than half the world and includes broadcasts in Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Malagasy, Mongolian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish and Tongan.<br><br>A controversial though popular Bible teacher known for his logical and reserved teaching style, Prince wrote more than 45 books about the Holy Spirit, faith, marriage, deliverance ministry, healing, prayer and fasting, and God's desÂ­tiny for Israel. His The Spirit-Filled Believer's HandÂ­book has been translated into more than 60 languages.<br><br>"I really believe he is going to be remembered as one of the leading teachers in the charismatic renewal, and one who helped save the charismatic renewal from extremes," said author Stephen Mansfield, who is writing a biography about Prince and was with him days before he died. "He always tried to ensure that his teaching was solidly biblical."<br><br>But Prince did not set out to be in ministry. As a university student he was a philosopher and self-described atheist.<br><br>Born in India of British parents, he was educated in England as a scholar of Greek and Latin at Eton College prep school and at the University of Cambridge. He held a fellowship in ancient and modern philosophy at King's College, Cambridge. While serving with the British army in World War II, he began to study the Bible and became a Christian.<br><br>After being discharged from the army in Jerusalem at the end of the war, Prince witnessed the return of Jews to Israel from around the world and interpreted it as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Israel's restoration became a main focus of his teaching. His books Our Debt to Israel, The Last Word on the Middle East and The Destiny of Israel and the Church have informed Christians of their scriptural responsibilÂ­ities to Israel and the Jews.<br><br>"He was an example ... for many believers throughout the world," said Batya Segal, who with her husband, Barry, leads Vision for Israel ministry. "He had a tremendous passion for the Word of God, for the land and people of Israel."<br><br>In 1945 Prince married Lydia Christensen, a Danish missionary more than 26 years his senior. He became father to her eight adopted daughtersÂ—six Jewish, one Palestinian Arab and one BritishÂ—and the couple later adopted another daughter in Kenya.<br><br>The Princes immigrated to the United States in 1963 and pastored a church in Seattle. In the early 1970s Prince began to teach about the need for Christians to pray for national leaders, and helped found Intercessors for America (IFA) in 1973. Prince's book Shaping History Through Prayer and Fasting is still one of the IFA's best sellers, said President Gary Bergel.<br><br>"Many people don't know how much influence he had on the prayer movement," Bergel said. "That initial teaching really set the course of our ministry."<br><br>Though well-known for his teaching on deliverance ministry, Prince is also remembered for his participation in the controversial discipleship, or "shepherding," movement in the 1970s. As reports of control and manipulation began to circulate, Prince eventually withÂ­drew from the movement he began with Don Basham, Ern Baxter, Bob Mumford and Charles Simpson. He pubÂ­licly repented for his involvement, saying, "I believe we were guilty of the Galatian error: having begun in the Spirit, we quickly degenerated into the flesh," WorldNet Daily reported.<br><br>Pentecostal historian Vinson Synan said that although Prince never regained the level of popularity he had before 1977, he had widespread influence in the charismatic renewal and his "well-organized teaching" filled a void for many charismatics.<br><br>Prince's first wife, Lydia, died in 1975, and in 1978 he married Ruth Baker, a single mother to three adopted children. She died in 1998 in Jerusalem, where the couple moved in 1981.<br><br>Prince is survived by 11 children and an extended family of more than 150.<br></div>

All rights reserved. www.charismamag.com<br><br><strong>Kenneth Hagin Sr, Dead at 86, Was 'Father of Faith Movement' </strong><br>The prolific author founded the Rhema Bible Training Center<br><br>By J. Lee Grady<br><br>Prominent charis m atic Bible teacher Kenneth Hagin Sr. died on Sept. 19 after collapsing five days earlier in Tulsa, Okla., where his worldwide ministry has been based since 1966.<br>He was 86.<br><br>Known internationally as the father of the Word of Faith movement, Hagin began his ministry in Texas in 1949 and later moved to Oklahoma to establish the Rhema Bible Training Center in the Tulsa sub u rb of Broken Arrow. He was considÂ­ered a spiritual father by many well-known charismatic ministers including Kenneth Copeland, Joyce Meyer, Jerry Savelle, Keith Butler and Casey TreatÂ—and by thousands of pastors and evangelists who either graduated from the Rhema school or were influenced by his books and recorded teachings.<br><br>"When I heard Kenneth Hagin teach the Word 47 years ago it totally changed my life," said Marilyn Hickey, whose ministry in Colorado has reached milÂ­lions through television and conferÂ­ences. "Of all the influences in my life, he influenced me the most. I learned from him that the Bible is applicable and powerful."<br><br>International evangelist Christie Moore of Twin Falls, Idaho, got her Bible training by listening to Hagin's tapes and by attending a Rhema-aftiliated church where the pastor based his serÂ­mons on Hagin's messages. "[ Hagin's] teachings on faith and the gifts of the Holy Spirit laid the foundation for my ministry. There's no way I could have been released into my call without those teachings," Moore said.<br><br>Hagin focused his message on healing and faith. He eventually formed a netÂ­work of churches, the Rhema Ministerial Association International, which now serves 1,440 congregations. Most of them emphasize biblical prosperity, healing and the power of positive confession.<br><br>Hagin's many books provided instruction on the use of spiritual gifts. His own dramatic encounters with God in visions led him to write I Believe in Visions and I Went to Hell.<br><br>His best-selling book was The Believer's Authority, which has sold more than 1 million copies. In all, more than 53 million copies of his 125 titles are in circulation, a Rhema spokesperson said.<br><br>"Brother Hagin had a divine assignÂ­ment, and that was to teach God's people about faith," said Billy Joe Daugherty, pastor of Victory Christian Center in Tulsa. Although Daugherty did not gradÂ­uate from the Rhema school, he took classes there in 1978 after he and his wife, Sharon, prayed for God to show them how they could receive Bible training.<br><br>"The message of faith changed our lives," said Daugherty, whose church is now one of Tulsa's largest.<br><br>In total, more than 23,000 students have graduated from the Rhema school and it has campuses in 13 other nations.<br><br>Hagin's doctrines were sometimes critÂ­icized, most vehemently by D.R. McConnell in the 1988 book A Different Gospel. But neither Hagin nor his son, Kenneth Jr. Â—who currently pastors the 8,000-member Rhema Bible Church in Tulsa and leads the Rhema ministryÂ— rarely addressed their critics or responded to accusations. In fact, Hagin wrote a favorite phrase in his Bible that said: "The Bible says it, I believe it, and that settles it."<br><br>In a statement, Kenneth Hagin Jr. said his father did not simply practice what he preached. "He preached what he lived. His great legacy of faith will live on in the countless lives that have been healed, touched and changed through his ministry," Hagin Jr. said.<br><br>Hagin Jr ., 64, will continue to lead the Rhema church as well as all other facets of the Hagin ministry, which include Faith Library Publications, the Faith Seminar of the Air radio program, and the Rhema Prayer and Healing Center.<br><br>Because Hagin Sr. experienced divine healing during his youth, he placed speÂ­cial importance on healing and wanted all Christians to know that they had spirÂ­itual authority over sickness. Numerous testimonies of healings have been pubÂ­lished in Rhema 's magazine, The Word of Faith, which currently has almost 250,000 subscribers.<br><br>A ministry spokesperson said Hagin collapsed after eating breakfast on Sept. 14. He was admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit, where he stayed until his death. His wife, Oretha, son Kenneth Jr. and daughter Pat Harrison were by his side. Hagin Sr. also had five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.retirementwithapurpose.com/images/article/kjktributebb/1.jpg"><br><br>On July 19th, 2003 at the age of 81, Dr. Bill Bright went home to be with the Lord. Three years ago we were told he was dying with a terminal lung condition, pulmonary fibrosis, but when we received the call an hour after he died, it was still a shock.  Our first response was, Â“Oh, our father is gone.Â”<br><br>Marvin reported to Dr. Bright for over 25 years and we knew and loved him and Vonette very well.  All the staff of Campus Crusade for Christ, International will miss him dearly.<br><br>Since his death we have talked much about how he inspired and cared for us. He was truly a man with faith in a big God. The following are a few of the memories we have of him.<br><br>* Dr. Bright was obedient to the vision God gave him in his early 20's - to help fulfill the Great Commission.<br><br>* The materials he wrote were always transferable - so anyone could use them and teach others how to use them.  This resulted in a worldwide movement.  Over 1.6 million Four Spiritual Laws have been printed and there are 25,000 staff and thousands of volunteers in 170 countries.<br><br>* He was obedient to the Holy Spirit's promptings - often when we were going through a particular challenging time, he would call and say, "I felt prompted to call you today - is everything okay?<br><br>* He always pointed us to the sufficiency of God - when we needed his counsel on something, he would usually say, "Oh, you know how to do that better than I."  Then he would pray with us - direct us to the sufficiency of God.<br><br>* Dr. Bright was available - whenever we asked him to speak at conferences, whether in Canada or world wide, he would always come.<br><br>* He cared for his staff - many times, when one of the staff were sick or had lost a loved one, we would call and encourage them.  To my knowledge, he always took the time to call.<br><br>* He began his talks by praising the Lord - as a new staff I was inspired when, during staff conference the morning after a flash flood in Estes Park, even though he did not know if Vonette was dead or alive, the first words from his mouth were a Psalm of Praise.<br><br>* He was honored by the world by receiving the Templeton award - he promptly gave the million dollar award to the Prayer and Fasting movement.  He was very generous.<br><br>* He encouraged us - when we came up with new initiatives.<br><br>* He (they) was fun - we enjoyed having dinner with them and we discussed many things.   He (us too) was always on some kind of diet, Vonette saw to it that he took many vitamins pills.<br><br>I recall one conversation when I asked him, "If God has appointed the day we are born and the day we die, will dieting, exercise and vitamins prolong our life, or only enable us to have a better quality of life?"<br><br>Another time during a meal, I asked him, "How can you tell if you are hearing from God, or if it is your own imagination because it is something you want?Â” We had many interesting conversations.<br><br>There are so many aspects of his life that pointed people to God. Dr. Bright was truly a man of God.  We loved him very much and will miss him, but at the same time we are rejoicing because he is with the Lord.<br><br>Father God, we thank you for Bill BrightÂ’s life, for his intimate relationship with You.  He modeled a life of faith and obedience.  He loved you deeply. Father, may those of us who call ourselves Christians follow his example.  Amen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LAST WORDS OF BILL BRIGHT BEFORE HIS DEATH<br><br>My beloved family, friends, staff members and partners in the gospel:<br>I embrace you with the love of Christ. I want to share some things with you because I love you. Even in my death the Holy Spirit can use me to glorify the Father. I would be remiss not to share what He wants. So thank you for these moments.<br><br>First, I am experiencing what I have longed for since I met Jesus in 1945, when I asked Him into my heart. I fell in love with Him deeply as He revealed Himself through His Word. For all these decades my greatest joy has being in His presence and serving Him alongside Vonette. Today, I am experiencing God face to face in ways so magnificient that they cannot be described in words. For 'no eyes has seen, no ear ha heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love Him' (I Corinthians 2:9).<br><br>So I offer you the same advice that Jesus offered His disciples in John 14:28 when He said they should rejoice at His going to be with the Father. Rejoice with me because I am no longer in this earthly tent. I am in the presence of the living God, satisfied at the deepest core of my being. And rejoice with me because I have finished all He called me to do. It has been a magnificient adventure to serve alongside my precious Vonette for over 50 years. Together we have raised two sons who love God. They,their godly wives and our four grandchildren have been our joy.<br><br>God has laid a message on my heart for you all. For you not yet believers: seriously look at the magnificient offer of love and forgiveness that God extends you. Before this day is over, receive Jesus as your Savior and Lord. Consider that God loves you and offers a wonderful plan for your life. Take seriously that because each of us is sinful and separated from God, we cannot know and experience God's love and plan. Know that Jesus Christ is God's only provision for man's sin. Through you can know and experience God's love and plan for you. Finally, you must personally receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then you can know and experience God's love and plan. Those four points are the heart of God's good news to humanity. If you do not yet know Jesus Christ personally, please consider those points.<br><br>For you who know Jesus Christ personally I have a word for you: Do not settle for mediocrity. You are a child of God of the universe. Surrender to Him. Become His slave. I can assure you, after more than 50 years of experience, there is no greater adventure than following Him. He cares for you. Take Him at His Word. When Vonette and I signed a contract in 1951 to become slaves of Jesus, we did so with the utmost confidence that 'everyone who ahs left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for [His] sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life' (Matthew 19:29). It made perfect sense that since He created the heavens and the earth, died on the Cross for our sins, and is obviously far more intelligent then we, His ways are better than ours. So we turned over everything to Him. I can say equivocally that you will find no greater joy than in total surrender.<br><br>Finally, I want to pray for you. For you who know Jesus, I pray you would follow Jesus as a fully surrendered slave. And for you not yet following Jesus but considering the four points I shared earlier, I pray you would invite Christ to forgive your sin so you can begin a relationship with Him.<br><br>If someone needed to meet the Savior or be encouraged to walk with Him more intimately, then I didn't want  to waste the opportunity. What I have believed by faith I am now experiencing in reality. I now see my Savior with my own eyes and I hear Him with my own ears as I worship Him in a way I have never understood. This is a good day for me. I pray it will be a good one for you. God bless each of you.<br><br>Bill Bright<br>Founder of Campus Crusade for Christ<br>{1921-2003}</div>
