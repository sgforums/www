            <div class='col-md body'>EVANGELICAL THEOLOGIAN MAKES BIBLICAL CASE FOR GAY RIGHTS<br><br>Louisville, KentuckyÂ—Taking on the most divisive issue in the   church today the former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Jack   Rogers, argues unequivocally for the ordination and marriage of people who are   gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) in Jesus, the Bible, and   Homosexuality: Explode the Myths, Heal the Church.<br><br>A life-long   evangelical and a respected theologian, Rogers argues that fidelity to the Bible   demands equal rights in the church and society for people who are LGBT.   Jesus, the Bible, and Homosexuality describes RogersÂ’s own change of mind   and heart on the issue; charts the churchÂ’s well-documented history of using   biblical passages to oppress marginalized groups; argues for a Christ-centered   reading of Scripture; and debunks oft-repeated stereotypes about gays and   lesbians.<br><br>Â“The best methods of interpretation, from the Reformation on   down through today, call upon us to interpret the Scripture through the lens of   Jesus ChristÂ’s life and ministry. Using this method we see clearly that Jesus   and the Bible, properly understood, do not condemn people who are homosexual,Â”   Rogers writes in a stirring conclusion that is sure to provoke   debate.<br><br>Jesus, the Bible, and Homosexuality was released   this March by Westminster John Knox Press to widespread attention and acclaim.   Yesterday, Rogers was the featured guest on KQED San FranciscoÂ’s Â“Forum,Â” which   skyrocketed sales on Amazon.com. And next week, Rogers will begin a national   book tour with more than twenty speaking engagements confirmed.<br><br>The book has also received glowing reviews from some of AmericaÂ’s   foremost religious leaders:<br>Â· Â“This is an extraordinary book,   arguably the best to appear in the long, drawn-out debates within churches over   homosexuality,Â” says J. Philip Wogaman, former senior minister at Foundry United   Methodist Church (where Bill Clinton worshipped) in Washington, D.C. Â“Rogers   frames the issues on deep biblical and theological grounds, challenging   superficial readings of Scripture. The book is wonderfully relevantÂ… It is a   gift to all of us.Â”<br>Â· Â“This book is simply   wonderfulÂ—an intelligent, well-researched, amazingly helpful contribution by a   person of faith to one of the most difficult debates of our time,Â” declares   Joanna Adams, pastor of Morningside Presbyterian Church in   Atlanta.<br>Â· Â“RogersÂ’s arguments are   relentless, accurate, and devastating to those who claim that there are serious   scriptural, doctrinal, or confessional reasons to deprive LGBT people from full   participation in the life and ministry of the church,Â” states the Reverend Elder   Nancy Wilson, the Moderator of the Metropolitan Community Church.<br>Â· Â“Rogers adds immensely to those   who argue for the full inclusion of gay and lesbian people in the church and in   the clergy,Â” says the Right Reverend Gene Robinson, Bishop of New Hampshire,   Episcopal Church. Â“His experience in and reflections on the Presbyterian Church   (U.S.A.) will be useful to people of ALL mainline denominations. Especially   helpful was his analysis of how Â‘otherÂ’ theories (natural law, complementary   body parts, etc.) are superimposed onto scriptural texts without any scriptural   basis. For those who truly wish to know what the Bible does and does not say,   this is a real find.Â”<br>*****<br>Westminster John Knox Press is the trade and academic publishing imprint of   the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share some thots:<br><br>Repent John 2 &gt;&gt; The best way to ask yourself is: Do I get attracted to the same sex more? Do I get sexually attracted to the opposite sex? Criteria include racing pulse, pupil dilation, etc (won't go deeper for the respect of the other forummers). Homosexuality is about sexual orientation, not about whether you have had sex with the opposite sex. You will be classified as gay as long as you still cling on to that sexual orientation. And it's strange to say that you are not born gay (non-nature) and you had not "experience" any gay lifestyle (non-nurture), but you feel gay, these statements contradict. The best way to describe your situation now is "You are gay, but never experience gay sex (and most likely never will) and you do not "accept" yourself as gay".<br><br>shade343 &gt;&gt; We have had many exchanges before on this issue. And it's strange that you can still categorically announce that gays are not borned without considering the evidences supporting it being the case. The theory of social impact has lesser and lesser influence, if you are willing to look at how psychoanalytical (Freud's) theories were debunked.. and how gays are still in existence of countries in which they are subjected to "death" penalty by just being gay.<br><br>CE &gt;&gt; Definition of gay is not correct. I know that I'm gay since maybe 10-11. Have always known of my own attraction to guys, but never really engage in anal sex until 29. The impression that gays must be more sexually dependant, you need to have sex before you are considered gay is not right. Acceptance of one's own identity is the "step" towards experiencing who you really are. Not the other way round.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One question: Are the Biblical quotations refering to (1) people who are attracted to and fall in love with members of the same sex, or (b) people who have sex and other intimate activities with members of the same sex?<br><br>(a) may lead to (b) sometimes but they can be unrelated in other cases. And are we making the distinction in our discussion?</div>
