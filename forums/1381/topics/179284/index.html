It is an abomination. 23 Nor shall you mate with any animal, to defile yourself with it. Nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it. It is perversion.</strong> 24 'Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for by all these the nations are defiled, which I am casting out before you. 25 For the land is defiled; therefore I visit the punishment of its iniquity upon it, and the land vomits out its inhabitants. 26 You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations, either any of your own nation or any stranger who dwells among you 27 (for all these abominations the men of the land have done, who were before you, and thus the land is defiled), 28 lest the land vomit you out also when you defile it, as it vomited out the nations that were before you. 29 For whoever commits any of these abominations, the persons who commit them shall be cut off from among their people. 30 Therefore you shall keep My ordinance, so that you do not commit any of these abominable customs which were committed before you, and that you do not defile yourselves by them: I am the Lord your God.' "<br><br>Romans 1:26-32:<br><br><strong>26 For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. 27 Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. </strong>28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, F3 wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, 30 backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, F4 unmerciful; 32 who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them.<br><br>This time no more questions. No more grey areas &amp; yet people sin all the more! The bible is very clear on where homosexuality &amp; bestiality stand, unlike gambling &amp; masturbation. So who is the greater sinner here?

So in realistic terms, a person who does not have a religion will NOT consider it a sin.<br><br>As always, topics here are discussed under the POV of Christian doctrine. Under the Christian doctrine that spans the OT and NT, homosexuality is a sin.<br><br>So if one is discussing this under some "new age" than the sin issue will not happen. Here, Johnnie, is talking from his POV as a Christian and as a (former?) gay individual, where both are in direct conflict.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As I had said many many moons ago in another universe, the argument is not whether being gay is natural or not, but whether being gay is in conflict with Christian doctrine.</span></div>

From what I know, Jesus has never condemned any homosexuals. If jesus didnt, why should christian doctrine be biased against them? Then again thats my POV.
