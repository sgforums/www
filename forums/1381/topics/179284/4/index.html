I am always having problems with verses like this above. Should we blame God for what happened to us since God allowed it? There are many verses where it says God allowed certain bad things or permitted bad things or caused bad things to people. There are also many verse in the bible which says everything is predestined by God even Christ's death! Even many things predicted by God thru His prophets which came true!<br><br>I also asked myself what if Adam didn't sin? I also asked myself what the heck is all my suffering about? I also asked why are all these bad things happening to people around the world? Doesnt God care at all? So many questions...</div>

Do I get sexually attracted to the opposite sex? Criteria include racing pulse, pupil dilation, etc (won't go deeper for the respect of the other forummers). Homosexuality is about sexual orientation, not about whether you have had sex with the opposite sex. You will be classified as gay as long as you still cling on to that sexual orientation. And it's strange to say that you are not born gay (non-nature) and you had not "experience" any gay lifestyle (non-nurture), but you feel gay, these statements contradict. The best way to describe your situation now is "You are gay, but never experience gay sex (and most likely never will) and you do not "accept" yourself as gay".<br><br></div></blockquote>Hello earthlings73. You see mine is a complicated issue. How can one know whether he is born gay or not anyway? Similarly how can one know whether he is born diabetic bcos he isnt diabetic until he becomes one much later? Like you said, you felt gay at 10-11. I also felt gay at 12-16. But i wasnt gay before that so how would i know gayness was inborn or bred or neither?<br><br>I overcame it by the blood of the Lamb when i became a Christian at 16 yrs old. I am no longer gay but i didnt practise gayness when younger so how can i call myself gay when i never even had sex with a male before? You see the complicatedness of my issue here? I could have been a bi for all you care.<br><br>I am now attracted to the opposite sex but bcos of certain things that happened in my life during 12-16, i cant function properly towards the other sex socially. It's true that i sometimes felt gay in front of other men but i dont like the idea of that.<br><br>I just want to tell u i am not born gay but bcos of certain things that happened in my life when young that i felt gay. I am not gay now but i still sometimes have awkward feelings in company of men.</div>

Even saying that idolaters will be given over to a debased mind. So all the taoists, buddhists, muslims, hindus, idol worshippers including those who worship S'pore Idol or Star Idol or Campus Idol or money or sex or fame etc will be given over to debased minds &amp; unclean passions. So it's amazing how the world has not gone completely crazy yet bcos majority are worshipping idols in one form or another. So Paul indirectly condemned ALL idolaters!</div>
