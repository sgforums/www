            <div class='col-md body'>Was Abraham committing adultery by having sex with Hagar? Was Isaac commtting adultery by having two wives? Were David &amp; Solomon also committing adultery by having hundreds of wives &amp; concubines? The original law was to have one wife from Adam's time. So is it bcos of this that's why so much problems arise? Could it be applied to this era &amp; time? As an auxiliary support for my m***turbation column, could having m***turbation affect relationships with spouses, people, family, friends etc? Bcos m***turbation can allow one to have multiple "sexual" partners in imagination. So like what Jesus said, we committed adultery already by having so many partners thru lust. So could this have an adverse effect on our relationships not to mention sin hurts our bodies &amp; souls etc? Pls discuss lively.</div>

So i was saying even in Noah's time, he was observing marriage to a single partner. But the rest of the world corrupted themselves sexually even with angels &amp; homosexuality. So there is a parallel to now. Sexual immorality is rampant with multiple partners, so what do you think God will do? That's why humans got further corrupted &amp; the marriage institution was destroyed temporarily until Christ came. We are still in Babylon but we will come out of it soon. This world's systems will perish &amp; only those who trust in Christ's saving blood alone will be saved bcos who can stand in the final day?</div>
