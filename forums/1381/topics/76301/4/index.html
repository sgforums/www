I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ"<br><br>-Philippians 3:7-8<br><br>I would like to summarise all that we have discussed so far and this thread shall come to a close. Silly, M and I have explain all we have and presented the Scripture and teachings in its simplicity. Acceptance or rejection of this teaching is not our primarily concern when we answer, just to help clear some doubts.<br><br>Here are some mainpoints Christianity teaches:<br><br>1. Salvation is provided solely through Jesus Christ and no one else.<br><br>2. Salvation comes from the grace of God and accepted by faith. Never to be attained by works.<br><br>3. Salvation though offers freely to all is in a way limited. Limited means it is not automatic applicable to all and must be received personally.<br><br>4. The redemptive work of Christ on the cross, His one perfect sacrifice is completed and fufils righteousness and love in every way.<br><br>5. Rejection of Jesus Christ equals the rejection of His saving work on the cross and thus His Salvation provided. </blockquote>Since the scripture itself says so, then maybe next time please rephrase all the wording such as "Jesus has wash the sin of all men" when obviously all it does is wash the sin of believers. It should be rephrase till "Jesus has wash the sins of believers only". <strong>Men includes buddhists and muslim etc who will feel insulted since u said it as though they r already believers</strong>. And please do not treat his death as a "gift" to men any more. It is a contract if u ask me.<br><br>And this post has successfully brings me to another "can of worms". Wat is the attitude of christians toward believers of other religions ? A monk has devoted his life to his religion. They refrain from eating non vegetarian food and lead a life of poverty. I can say tat they r not less pious compared to people from other religions.<br><br>So according to bible, when they die will they still suffer in hell ? If so, WHY ? Is he wrong in selecting buddhist as his religion since this world is so messy with so much unknowns ? Can u blame people of other religion to continue believing in their religion ? Why should god be so cruel and punish them equally just because they do not "pray" to him. Why does believing in him is so important ? Are non believers any lesser mortals with lesser morals ?</div>

They say ALL MEN will be saved by Jesus death <strong>BUT</strong> IT ONLY INCLUDES BELIEVERS. It is directly saying ALL MEN r believers.

Maybe buddhist is the one with the right interpretation of the world state and not christians. Wat if somewhere in some scripture, it mentioned "u can only go to nirvana if u r a believer, otherwise u go to purgatory (tis is just an example, there is not such unequal treatment written in buddhism which makes it more noble and sensible)". So now wat ? Believe in buddhist and "may" end up in "Christian hell" or believe in Christian and end up in "buddhist purgatory" ?<br><br>If it is free, then it won't force people to make a choice. Whether u r buddhist or taoist, u can still go to heaven. However it is not the case. U r being forced to make a stand which may makes u end up in "purgatory". R u going to tell me they didn't "lose anything" because their religion is fake ? Wat if theirs is the true religion and yours is not ? He had lost an equal chance just because he has "accepted" the gift. Is this gift "free" then ? NO ! They have paid a price which is an equal chance to attain "nirvana" and avoid "purgatory".<br><br>Let me give u an example of wat is "free". If u do good deeds, no matter wat religion u r, u get to go to heaven and your sin is "graded" equally compared to people of other religion.<br><br>NOT<br><br>I only give "special priority" to believers. The others can just rot in hell for all I care. I don't even care if they had lead a pious life serving other religion neither do I care if this christian I am going to receive had committed a lot of sins. The most important criterion in my eyes is whether is he a believer or not. The rest is secondary<br><br><blockquote>It is a gift in the sense you do not have to work for it. You just have to accept it. </blockquote>It is like a job. U can only take one job at a time. If u plainly just "accept" tis job, it means u have waste your opportunity to work in other careers. It is not free. Being "free" doesn't force u to select only one option and reject the rest.</div>
