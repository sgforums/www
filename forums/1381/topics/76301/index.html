            <div class='col-md body'>Yes He did, with or without your believing in Him.  He died for all, He took all our sins upon Himself.<br><br>Now if you are wondering, why should I believe to get the so called salvation since He already died for me?<br><br>You see, God is a gentleman.  He said in Rev 3:20, "Here I am standing at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to dine with him and he with me."<br><br>He gave and respect our freewill.  He doesnt want to barge into our lives just like that. He wants us to accept Him when we truly understand the magnitude of His love and sufferings for us.<br><br>Why should He want to come in? God is a Father.  All fathers desire a relationship with their children.  Now imagine if I were to not acknowledge my father on earth and wants to continue to stay in his house and a share of the inheritance, isnt that a bit unfair? Likewise, isnt is fair that after all God has done, He only desires that we call Him, ABBA Father and acknowledge Him as such.  All God wants from us is a realization of His love and come back to Him as His children.<br><br>Knowing about God is different about Knowing God.  Knowing about Lee Kuan Yew doesnt make you his son/daughter and thus, you wun stay in his house nor share in his inheritance.  Likewise for God.</div>

Nope. You still ARE a criminal.<br><br>You know the story of the 3 blind men all their lives who came upon an elephant for the first time?  The 1st felt legs and decided that an elephant is short.  The 2nd felt the tusk and decided the elephant is hard and sharp.  The 3rd felt the tail and thought the elephant is just like a snake he felt some time ago.  We all know they are wrong, but to them they think they are right because they only touch on one part of the bigger picture.<br><br>The point is that we can come up with thousands of examples which only tries to disprove a certain element of a bigger picture.  It is unfair to do that.<br><br>You see, my fren, maybe you are new here, maybe you are not.  But the fact is I stand on this<br><br><strong>IF, you BELIEVE in what GOD has done, then all the questions you are asking is valid.  BUT, if you DO NOT believe at all, why should all these matter to you?  So DO YOU BELIEVE or NOT?  If you do believe but just found it difficult at times, then I would gladly try to answer you.  If you DO NOT believe and are asking these questions, I would say 'fren, go. Because you already got the answer.</strong><br><br>Anyway, you owe A money and B paid for you. yes you dun owe A any more money but you owe B now.  So now if A is God and you owe God and B is Jesus who came down to pay your debts and Jesus is asking "Acknowledge me as your saviour".  He is asking only for that, an acknowledgement and belief that He is your saviour.  Isnt it fair for you to accept his request of B, since B paid your debts?  I am sure you know you should be grateful to B.<br><br></div>

He is omnipotent isn't it ? Why resort to sacrificing, especially by slowly torturing and killing his son ? Does god get anything from it ? Is he a sadist that deprive happiness from watching his son being tortured ?

He has every means to be set free and escape punishment by the Roman soldiers..but one will again discover He Himself walked into the situation of being killed.

Why do God have to kill him just to forgive us when he can just directly forgive us ? Why someone need to sacrifice, much like the pagan Gods who require virgins  ?<br><br><blockquote>It's like telling me that Lu Bu is 2.3m tall. </blockquote>That is a brillant anlogy ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
