            <div class='col-md body'>Now, is that an acceptable request in the first place ? Everybody sh!t. Why ask u to do something which it cannot be done ? It is like a general asking his soldier to flap his arms to fly. No matter how obedient the soldier is, he cannot do it ! Should he be punished for doing something which he cannot performed ? Is that a reasonable request in the first place ?<br><br><blockquote>He loves U and make His Son the atoning sacrifice</blockquote>Why sacrifice his own son ? Wat is the logic ? It is like someone owe me money and to clear the debt, I kill my own son !??! Doesn't tat sounds so absurb ??<br><br>Maybe next time a general should say to all his soldiers "All of u do not breath ! If u breath I will kill u !" After tat he shot his son dead and say "He dies for u all, now u all can breath"<br><br>Wat do u think ?<br><br>1. IMO the general's request for not breathing is ABSURB. Can anyone not breath ? Can men not sin ? Why punish men for doing something tat is not achievable in the first place ?<br><br>2. Second he is cruel and kill his son for NOTHING. He could have just retract his order in the first place. Why can't God just forgive people sin directly instead of killing his own favourite son before forgiving ? I am asking why do God want to do this ????<br><br>3. Third he made himself and his son seems so noble though he had done something ridiculously absurb through 1 and 2. Same as Jesus.<br><br><blockquote><br>If you are the murderer and you are sentenced to death, can you ask a stranger to die in your place ?<br><br>No. Neither do you ask Christ to die in your place. It is a gift, remember<br></blockquote>I don't see your link with the question I ask other than "No". A gift by killing himself ? Sounds to me like satanism or something... Maybe next time u open a door and your best friend commit suicide in front of u as a gift to u.<br><br><blockquote>SInce we are all born to be sinners, why do we need to be "punished" ?<br><br>You can think it like that.

Do you think karma is justified, using your argument above?<br><br><strong>Why can't God just forgive people sin directly instead of killing his own favourite son before forgiving ? I am asking why do God want to do this ???? </strong><br><br>Don't give us the red herring lah. Clearly, you just don't want to acknowledge the overflowing love of G-d. You can't believe why G-d will sacrifice his son over people like us. So you focus on His cruelty instead.<br><br><strong>Oh cool... wat is your link again ?!?! </strong><br><br>You have no excuse. Even if you're NOT born a sinner, you still will sin in your life. This is the link.</div>

Nobody even knew, nobody even cared, everybody saved. already settled.<br><br></div></blockquote>Your idea of perfect is that it is automatic and forceful. Your idea of perfect is like to do something and applies to it to ppl even when ppl dun accept. It is like GST....ppl dun want and yet u include in the price. That is your understanding of perfection? God do not force people into something...thats His character since the beginning....He will always provide a way out and whether the ppl choose Him its their call....however that does not mean judgement will not arrive after that.<br><br>Perfect means complete and without error and needs no further amendments to the work previously done. Perfect score...full score...need we to take a second test to get better marks? No..its perfect 10/10.<br><br>Jesus died and rose again for the salvation of mankind. In one person, who is both fully God and fully Man sin is punished, justice met and love of God poured out. Punish sin..there u have...He was punished on our behalf because the actual punishment is too harsh for us to bear. Justice met...there you see, sins have to be punished no matter what....nothing as to strike it off because God is just and holy. Love of God...yes because Jesus substitute is in the punishment..the penalty which we deserves is being inflicted upon Him on the cross.<br><br>After that, no human need to do anything or is able to do any things such as good works etc to earn salvation. It cannot be done. His work is perfect and all we need to do is to accept Him and recieve that salvation in which He already provided. If one is so against Him...how can he accept that gift.<br><br>When i say i hate durian..i wont eat it.</div>

It is the same as sh!ting and breathing. To be alive is to sin. more than 10 billion people have lived in this world and none of them do not sin. So why punish people just because they sin ?
