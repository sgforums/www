            <div class='col-md body'>I<blockquote>n the very beginning, I already said you were an orphan. But you twisted my analogy and invented a foster father. My original was and still is - IF you believe that man to be your father, then you cannot believe another man to be your father. The crux is, the christian worldview entails the one and only G-d YHWH. So if you believe in it, there's no reason why you can also believe in the polytheism of other religions. Unless you're an irrational person. </blockquote>Why can't I twist the story a bit ? Why do u set all the rules and I follow them ? Why don't u treat it as a new analogy tat I had came out with asked back to u. Is tat wrong ?<br><br>The crux is, why does he have to demand people to believe in him ? Doesn't tat make him sounds egoistic ? For other religion they never classified people according to wat u believed in. They just say "if u did a bad deed, tis will happened to u watever your religion is". Why Jesus death is a totally different scenario where he state a condtition tat people have to believed in him before being saved ? Is tat free ?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Why doesn't he "saved" people regardless of their religion ? ... He demand people to believe in him THEN he give out help. The word THEN in the previous statement is very important. It is a condition</strong>.<br><br>This question is related to another common question - does G-d listen to prayers of unbelievers? Many protestants will tell you ... no. </blockquote>I don't see your point. Wat is the relationship ? Please elaborate.<br><br><blockquote><strong>However there is not wat the bible or catholic says about baptised. They say tat if babies are not baptised and die, then they will go to limbo. </strong><br><br>Physical baptism is still a 'work'. It is external 'action action' only. G-d looks at the heart, not by appearance. </blockquote>So wat is your conclusion ? The catholics are wrong in saying unbaptised child go to limbo ? Limbo is just a story to scare people into baptising their children so they become "rightfully" christians ?<br><br><blockquote>Rubbish. If this is so, why did the Hebrews sacrifce the lamb to G-d every year? </blockquote>They sacrificed because God is easily "bribed" by giving it a lamb. From genesis<br><br><strong>3. And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the [b]fruit of the ground </strong>an offering unto the LORD.<br><br>4. And Abel, he also brought of the <strong>firstlings of his flock and of the fat</strong> thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:<br><br>5. But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.[/b]<br><br>They give to make God happy. God like men to <strong>kill</strong> lambs for sacrifice and not like "vegetarian" stuffs. Poor Cain... both of them give the fruit of their labour to God but he punish Cain for... well... no good reason....  How can Cain knows God like to kill lamb and not take crops ?<br><br><blockquote>When I say free, I mean you don't have to work for it, like doing good works</blockquote>When means free, it is without charge. Clearly it is attached with a condition tat make it "costly" to some people.</div>

SO baptise is not needed ? The ritual is unnecessary ? SO all christians who read tis shouldn't waste your time baptising children since it means nothing.<br><br>Tat is another question I need to ask... why do u take "John the baptised" words as truth since he appears to be only mere humans. Does God left out details when he "wrote" the bibles and need people to fill it in in future ? Is he not worried of possible abuse since he already have a great feeling tat men are sinners ?<br><br><blockquote>We cannot simply assume that children are "<strong>innocent</strong>" and are therefore <strong>exempt</strong> from the penalties of sin. The Bible teaches clearly that infants are in a state of sin and need to be regenerated. They, like all humanity, can be saved <strong>only</strong> through <strong>Christ</strong><br><br>While Christ's endorsement of childlike character is not a denial of sin nature, the Bible does seem to teach that compared to the sins of adults, infants and children possess a "relative innocence."<br><br>The persistence of this debate has been aided by the fact that the writers of Scripture did not explicitly comment on this subject<br></blockquote>From your website... it appears tat they seems to have brought out a lot of biblical contradictions. Up till now no one seems to be sure wat happened when babies die. It even say when u r born, u have sinned. Why ???!?!? They have no motives ! If sinning is as certain as being born, then God might as well just punish us in the first place... wait we r already punished by having death and pregnancy and work etc... Will we been free of punishment even when we believe ? Nope.<br><br>The conclusion is dissappointing either. The author has nothing to show and only says tat<br><br><blockquote>It is my conviction, however, that although infant salvation is not taught explicitly, based upon the justice and character of God, infant salvation is an implicit certainty</blockquote>I do not want merely his words or hope or expectation. Does he know God well ? Does he think like God ? God has justice ? Where do u see tat ? He condemned men to be sinners when they r borned, kill people just because he is not respected, kill indiscriminately, kill to show people an example, kill to test people etc.<br><br>SO HOW ? Wat is your stand ? The website shows nothing but biblical contradictions. Why don't u explain yourself ?</div>

Its not wrong to not go to church. It is not necessary to go to church, but people do. I really dont know why the holy spirit doesnt live in the person when he or she is born. That is why I continue studying the bible and reading stuff to learn.<br><br><blockquote>Tat is another question I need to ask... why do u take "John the baptised" words as truth since he appears to be only mere humans. Does God left out details when he "wrote" the bibles and need people to fill it in in future ? Is he not worried of possible abuse since he already have a great feeling tat men are sinners ?</blockquote>The bible is the inspirired word of God. I do not believe that God would let people make changes to his word. And in the end of Revelation its says that whoever makes changes will be punished.<br><br><blockquote>From your website... it appears tat they seems to have brought out a lot of biblical contradictions. Up till now no one seems to be sure wat happened when babies die. It even say when u r born, u have sinned. Why ???!?!? They have no motives ! If sinning is as certain as being born, then God might as well just punish us in the first place... wait we r already punished by having death and pregnancy and work etc... Will we been free of punishment even when we believe ? Nope.<br><br>The conclusion is dissappointing either. The author has nothing to show and only says tat </blockquote>No one is sure what happens when babies die. No one is sure what happens when they die. Trust in the word of God. Original sin is inherited. Nope, we are not fee od physical death and all that when we are punished but 80years in eternity is just like a speck of dust.<br><br><blockquote>I do not want merely his words or hope or expectation. Does he know God well ? Does he think like God ? God has justice ? Where do u see tat ? He condemned men to be sinners when they r borned, kill people just because he is not respected, kill indiscriminately, kill to show people an example, kill to test people etc.<br><br>SO HOW ? Wat is your stand ? The website shows nothing but biblical contradictions. Why don't u explain yourself ?</blockquote>No one knows the mind of God. Men choose to sin. God kills? Lol, so far I have not read a piece of news saying God had killed someone. Then the age long question comes on why God allowed men to sin. I dont know and I believe these question will be answered in heaven.<br><br>My stand is that babies do go to heaven from what I've read in the bible. In revelation, Jesus comes and raptures children and believers. That is one reason I believe children go to heaven.<br><br></div>

You are also the one suggesting a worldview based on santa claus and tooth fairies are as believable as the christian worldview. My answer to them is to evaluate their worldview, and if you want an answer why shouldn't we choose tooth fairies over Jesus, it is common courtesy you introduce us the santa claus and tooth fairies worldview. But obviously you never do that. Moreover, the christians here have, in their replies, discuss about their worldview. Hence I don't see why I have to do it and invite more rebuke from you. </blockquote>For your info, I am suggesting FAITH is irrational. It is the same as kids believing in tooth fairies and santa claus. These 2 groups do not have strong evidence to believe in them but they just believe in it anyway. Why do I have to give out "world view" or "window view" to say tat ? I am only talking the the issue of BLIND FAITH, and tat is it ! I am not comparing BETWEEN religion, I am talking about the notion of using FAITH as a shield or answer to anything which cannot be answered in your religion.<br><br><blockquote>Oh ya, in case you're still dumb and haven't turn clever, my worldview is not necessarily the christian worldview.

I don't know tens or twenty replies. Now u say your world view is not the christian one ? Wat is your world view then ? Why ask me for my world view ? So tat u can attack on it ? Why not give us your world view ? Because u r scared I will tear it all down and humilate u ?

The emperor has "blind faith" tat the tailor is correct. He never <strong>check it out, question or confirm </strong>himself. The kid believe things just by the simple notion of "seeing is believing".
