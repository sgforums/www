Is in the genesis isn't it ? How do u interprete the lines in bold above ? Why do u deny that they met out these "punishment" just because we eat the fruit of wisdom ? So if God really want to forgive men sin, why doesn't he forgive Adam and Eve and stop all these pain in pregnancy and work and death ? If he didn't create these sufferings who did ?<br><br><blockquote>How can you ever know anything ... except the famous Cartesian implication that you have a mind? </blockquote>Seems u have acknowledge tat nothing physical has change, then why r u so confident his words is true ? Nothing change, no evidence given, nothing. All jesus did is just say when he die he will wash our sins away. Any Tom Dick and Harry can say tat. They do not need to prove anythign either.<br><br><blockquote>You think what ... goddess Nu Wa making clay dolls ah? Duh</blockquote><blockquote>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them</blockquote>Than wat is the purpose of God creating men ? Instead of just being sacastic and hit selected lines, why don't u tell me the reason they create men ?<br><br><blockquote>I suppose nobody will, other than what was revealed</blockquote>SInce nobody know him or why he does things, I suppose it is equally likely tat God is a devil in disguise since he is a "prince of lies" and "divine" while men r "foolish" and cannot see through his deceit. Go and ponder about it.<br><br><blockquote>Hmm, this is actually a theological question. You have to ask yourself what's the biblical definition of sin. If you ask me, I'll say it is just "missing the mark", or 'het' in Hebrew. </blockquote>SO jesus say he will wash our sins. SO wat he does ? Wash the "marks" and give us perfect grades ?<br><br><blockquote>In the OT, sacrifice was using the blood of the lamb.<br>Read the previous line. Clearly, it is not a case of pure human sacrifice</blockquote>U r not reading correctly. WHY SACRIFICE JESUS in order to forgive men ? I am not talking about lamb or ritual ! I am asking why God kill Jesus to forgive us when he can directly forgive us ! Wat is the logic behind it ?<br><br>A general say to all his soldiers "All of u do not breath ! If u breath I will kill u !". After tat he saw his son and shot him dead. He then say "He dies for u all, now u all can breath"<br><br>Wat do u think ?<br><br>1. IMO the general's request for not breathing is ABSURB. Can anyone not breath ? Can men not sin ? Why punish men for doing something tat is not achievable in the first place ?<br><br>2. Second he is cruel and kill his son for NOTHING. He could have just retract his order in the first place. Why can't God just forgive people sin directly instead of killing his own favourite son before forgiving ? I am asking why do God want to do this ????<br><br>3. Third he made himself and his son seems so noble though he had done something ridiculously absurb through 1 and 2. Same as wat Jesus gone through.<br></div>

So if babies aren't baptise and die, will they go to hell or limbo ?<br><br>I thought some christians say if one do not know anything about jesus and thus fail to become a christian. It is no fault of his and he still get to heaven. A baby couldn't have know anything, which of course include religion.

I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ"<br><br>-Philippians 3:7-8<br><br>I would like to summarise all that we have discussed so far and this thread shall come to a close. Silly, M and I have explain all we have and presented the Scripture and teachings in its simplicity. Acceptance or rejection of this teaching is not our primarily concern when we answer, just to help clear some doubts.<br><br>Here are some mainpoints Christianity teaches:<br><br>1. Salvation is provided solely through Jesus Christ and no one else.<br><br>2. Salvation comes from the grace of God and accepted by faith. Never to be attained by works.<br><br>3. Salvation though offers freely to all is in a way limited. Limited means it is not automatic applicable to all and must be received personally.<br><br>4. The redemptive work of Christ on the cross, His one perfect sacrifice is completed and fufils righteousness and love in every way.<br><br>5. Rejection of Jesus Christ equals the rejection of His saving work on the cross and thus His Salvation provided.<br><br></div>
