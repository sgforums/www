Although you said that there are toes like organs, i didn't read of the account in the 29+ evidence website.

I am sure you come across people with finger like structure growing just infront of their ear right? Genetic yes. Evolution, dun think so.<br><br>I thought i seperated the tail and the tailbone into two seperate paragraphs to allow the differentation on the topic. Anyway, i pop by the site you recommanded and found this comment:<br><br>"A well-developed tail is characteristic of the human embryo in the second month. Ususally during the third month the tail regresses and disappears as an anatomic external feature. Occasionally the tail persists and grows with the rest of the body.

Wat I meant is before human eretus. The ancient ancestors r believed to walk on 4, have a tail and damn lot of hairs. Chimps and monkeys r not our ancesters but u can picture it as something similar and bigger<br><br><blockquote>if anything, they are probably slightly younger<br>than the sun, which doesnt make a difference compared<br>to the 45 billion years of the sun's age. </blockquote>the order is the most important. Whether is it younger<br>by even a day, it just meant the order is wrong<br><br><blockquote>And God made the two great lights; the greater<br>light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule<br>the night: he made the stars also.</blockquote>He specifically say tat he made the sun and moon on<br>the fourth day. Before tat it is just light and<br>darkness. Now we r talking about sun, not light<br><br><blockquote>The AnswerInGenesis site did explain about the<br>legs of the whale and the myths surrounding it so it<br>speaks for itself. </blockquote>I am asking u. Why will a whale without a leg grow a leg out ? Mutation <strong>can only occurs </strong>on body parts tat we have. U can grow a finger out of your eye or 1000 eyes on your face and it is mutation. U agree with me on tis part ? If u do not have this part or organ in part of your body, u can't possibly mutate it. If u grow a horn, fin or have a tail, which a human shouldn't have, it means tat these body parts r "hidden" from wat normal human look like. In other words, the most logical explanation is tat we human used to have these body parts in our genes before, tat is why it is possible to mutate it out in our body. Otherwise why will a whale have toes when it shouldn't have it in the first place ? A normal whale doesn't have a leg or foot, much less a toe isn't it ? A whale with a leg and toes appear it because it had mutate a body part in its body, which is the hidden leg in its gene doney years ago. Doesn't tat prove tat macroevolution exists ?<br><br><blockquote>Most of these examples are of whales with<br>femurs, tibia, and fibulae; however, some even include<br>feet with complete digits. </blockquote>U can find tis passage there. digits = toes if u want<br>to know. Check the dictionary if u need<br><br><blockquote>"A well-developed tail is characteristic of the<br>human embryo in the second month. Ususally during the<br>third month the tail regresses and disappears as an<br>anatomic external feature. Occasionally the tail<br>persists and grows with the rest of the body. Tails as<br>long as 23 cm have been reported" </blockquote>Tat is the thing, why will men have tail ? It have a tail because it is again a hidden part of the body. Normal men don't have tails isn't it ? A tail appears out because somewhere in our line of evolution we r a species with tails<br><br><blockquote>If the Flood did happen, there will definately be seasonal changes. </blockquote>40 days can't make out a season for 4000 rings which need 4000 years<br><br><blockquote>They gave nobel peace price to Araafat but i dun think he created any peace. But i agree that carbon dating is a revelation but its accuracy is still contested, not only between evolutionist and creationist, but between scientists</blockquote>They certainly give out a lot of nobel prize accurately isn't it ? Most of the nobel prize for physics or chemistry or engineering is given to the right person. Nobel prize for peace is different because frankly politics is dirty. Just because it had given the wrong nobel prize to a person who perform the right deeds at tat time doesn't mean the whole nobel prize is flawed. His contribution at tat time is undeniable.<br><br>The accuracy is mostly accepted because it is a standard means of finding age of an old artifact. As said before if the age lies below 50,000, we can expect it to be right. If they found a pottery at a pyramid, wat do u think is the means to find the age of tat tomb ?<br><br><blockquote>With so many loopholes in the theory of evolution, if you consider creationism as a religion, i think evolutionism can be classified as evolution. </blockquote>I don't really understand your english here. However so much evidence point to the fact tat evolution exists. It is considered science.<br><br>Strangely though... <strong>why does creationist spend so much effort to pull down evolution, a science yet do so little to find evidence tat prove creationism </strong>?<br><br><blockquote>One last thing, i think that even without the Theory of Evolution, biology, physics, chemstry, astonomy and all fields of science can still function and serve their purpose today. Remember all of them were started even before the Theory was brought about by Charles Darwin. </blockquote>No one say tat without evolution these science r not substantiated. U believe in science like physic and chemistry right ? Why not believe in evolution which is studied and debated for many years, very much like physics and chemistry, than believe in a book which not one can verify, prove or if it is found wrong, modified its content ? U have no complains against physics and chemistry just because it do not go against the bible ?<br><br><blockquote>Whether evolved or not, what is more important is to know that man was made in the image of God. And that we all should respect one another, because God lives in everyone of us.</blockquote>Then god must have look like a... well... primate because we look like primate many years before.</div>

No one challenge the land before thus it is the best place to breed and feed isn't it ? U might as well ask why does some basteria feed on decomposing sh!t and not seek to eat good food like abalone or lobster ? It is because if they feed on decomposing sh!t, there r little competition for the same food. If an animal manage to survive on land, surely it will have a great advantage by not fighting for food with the many creatures in the sea. Heard of the mudfish ? They r a kind of fish tat can swim but when needed, they can climb out to land and last for 2 months there.

God lost his imagination ?<br><br>If u want evidence, then it can be seen from the DNA structure, again found in 29+ evidence of macroevolution.<br><br><blockquote>According to the theory of common descent, modern living organisms, with all their incredible differences, are the progeny of one single species in the distant past. In spite of the extensive variation of form and function among organisms, several fundamental criteria characterize all life. Some of the macroscopic properties that characterize all of life are (1) replication, (2) heritability (characteristics of descendents are correlated with those of ancestors), (3) catalysis, and (4) energy utilization (metabolism). At a very minimum, these four functions are required to generate a physical historical process that can be described by a phylogenetic tree.<br><br>If every living species descended from an original species that had these four obligate functions, then all living species today should necessarily have these functions (a somewhat trivial conclusion). Most importantly, however, all modern species should have inherited the structures that perform these functions. Thus, a basic prediction of the genealogical relatedness of all life, combined with the constraint of gradualism, is that organisms should be very similar in the particular mechanisms and structures that execute these four basic life processes. </blockquote>Anyway u can read on if u want. But the basic fact is all lives appears to have similar function regarding to the 4 basic characteristic of lives. If there is one species tat was found without adherring to any of these basic characteristic, then it can be a strong evidence against evolution. However too bad no such beings r found.<br><br>Anyway there r a lot of evidence tat shows all lives seems to be have diverge out from a single cell. If u ask me, it seems to be a better evidence than the bible which has lost its credibility with its many contradiction and mistakes.</div>
