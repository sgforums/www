One major assumption is that the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere has always been constant, and its rate of decay has always been constant. Neither of these assumptions is provable or reasonable. Present testing shows the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere has been increasing since it was first measured in the 1950's. This may be tied in to the declining strength of the magnetic field. </div></blockquote>The ratio of C12 and C14 in the atmosphere does affect the accuracy of carbon dating. Calibration is carried out to correct this. This is done by comparing the results with other indicators (eg. tree rings). Of course, this will raise the question about the accuracy of tree rings method.<br><br>The half-life of C14 is about 5730 years. After 10 half-lives, the amount of C14 gets very small. So for samples more than 50000 years old, other radiometric methods are used. These methods also use the principle of decay of radioactive isotopes. It is true that these dating methods depend on constant rate of decay. To prove that the rate of decay is constant. We would have to travel back in time to observe the rate of decay. The scientists do this by observing supernovae. These events may happened millions of years ago but we are observing them now because they occur so far away that the light takes millions of years to reach us. By observing the radioactive decay of supernovae light, the evidence points to a constant rate of decay. Then of course, we are assuming that Einstein is right that the speed of light is constant. While we know that our scientific knowledge is not perfect, it is the best approximate we have.<br><br>The alternative is to use the Bible, which I do not consider as a good alternative. First of all, the Bible did not explicitly state the age of the Earth. Any implications on the age of the Earth are subjected to intepretations.

That is where the danger lies. Because, when we feel that we are not accountable to God, we will do whatever we wish. This is also why many people do not wish to believe in God even when they are persuaded that He exists, for they do not wish to be accountable to Him.</div>

BTW wat purpose does large eyes have over small eyes ? Do u see more things with large eyes ? smaller eyes may means having lesser probability of getting sand into them...<br><br>During a certain part of time, maybe it do serve its purpose.

They get to have happiness is doing romantic things, happiness from the happiness of the lover etc. Your lover is real.

It is commonly known as the tail bone because is the last column of the spine down near the buttocks. The bone, like the "hind-legs" of the whale, have 6-9 muscles connected to it that controls the mucles of the anus. If you remove that bone, you will be like a free flowing chocolate cake machine.

I don't know man.. wat is your explanation on a whale to develop out a foot with toes ? Surely a reproduction system can't have toes ?<br><br><blockquote>As for the tail on the child, the site did say that it is very uncommon.

But having an organ tat was never found in the body before is diffcult. Tis is not about the tail bone, it is about a tail. For the tail bone, they just name it "tail bone", and it is nothing about tails mentioned here. They r talking about tails here, not tail bone and it is a bit... wierd to talk about tail bone when the things they r discussing is tail. They have already accounted for mutated spine bones in the passage <span style="font-style: italic;">Pseudo-tails are not true tails; they are simply lesions of various types coincidentally found in the caudal region of newborns, often associated with the spinal column, coccyx, and various malformations. </span> The focus on the article is not about these pseudo-tails<br><br>As indicated in the passage, these real tails r can <span style="font-style: italic;">move voluntary</span>. Please take a look at the picture. These picture will explain the difference between tails and tail bones.<br><br><a href="http://www.vh.org/adult/provider/anatomy/AnatomicVariants/SkeletalSystem/Images/19.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vh.org/adult/provider/anatomy/AnatomicVariants/SkeletalSystem/Images/19.html</a><br><br>And surprisingly, these tails appears to be inherited. It appears to occur down a line of families. They even have a good explanation on the genes found on human tat support the growing of tails, NOT tail bones. For human, they develop another gene tat will remove the tail in the later stage of growth.<br><br><blockquote>About the chromosomes, what i wanted to highlight is that there is such a huge difference in the DNA structure of living things and it will really out of this world to say that all this living things came from a single bacteria millions of years ago.

If it is one billion to one, it is actually pretty high.<br><br>about the example of a chimp and human. When the molecular difference changes by these 3 molecules, they just die and their faulty genes is never pass down to decendent, aka extinct. BTW gene r develop to make the species "fitter", thu they r not probably going to developa gene tat will kill them. The rest of the unevolved species will evolved in other ways and some will form human while the other will form chim. Know of genetic algorithm ? Although it is a programing code and nothing link with bio, but evolution bio works in a similar way but in a more efficient manner. The random occurances or changes of a possible answer can give out solution faster than other calculation even when the probability of this is little.<br><br><blockquote>I don't belive any one can live to past 200 years old now. But back then in the Noah's time, yes</blockquote>The whole issue is u claiming the "air becomes bad" after the flood and saying tat in the past people lived for hundreds of years while we now can live up till 100 at most. When noah clearly can live 350 years before he dies, isn't tat a clear proof tat the air do not goes bad and dinosaur do not die because their nostrils r small<br><br><blockquote>There must be millions of pores on the skin of the earth worm</blockquote>true, but the air has never gone bad so your assumption is wrong<br><br><blockquote>Counting of rings may not be accurate because there is a thing called dead rings. Could be caused by atmospheric changes, (Hey, the flood!), climatic changes (The flood again.). </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>U don't even believe in the counting of rings ?!?! U know why ring is accurate to count age ? they r develop because they grow differently during the different seasons. It can only fail due to seasonal difference, NOT a flood, climatic or atmospheric difference. It will not form a ring or lesser rings because the flood doesn't last for thousands of years. Com'on man, please don't anyhow throw away tis ancient and accurate way of assessing age for trees anyhow. U just wanna throw away any method of counting age just because all accurate ways of accessing age points to the fact tat the earth is older than wat bible predicted ? Surely radio and tree rings have result tat r similar. U still wanna throw it away ?<br><br><blockquote>Talking about petrified trees, many petrified trees are found stuck vertically in 3-4 layer of rocks where each layer was supposed to be formed only through millions of years. </blockquote>So ? Tat is why it is accurate isn't it ? U mean trees still grow under layers of rocks ? These rings r a true indication of its age before it dies isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>As with carbon dating, i just want someone to tell me how would a scientist determine which one shows a correct result since the percentage of right and wrong estimate seems to be like 50-50. </blockquote>Who says the odds r 50-50 ? The odds r 99 when it is done by an expert, using a suitable specimen in an professional condition. U think scientist r dumb and do not argue on such high inaccuracies if it is so ? Someone even win a nobel prize for finding cardon dating ! The data fround after radio of a tree and the number of rings found r found to match. Surely tis is an verified means of assessing age ?<br><br><blockquote>Finally, i also want to know how the very FIRST bacteria, the ancestor of ALL living things, was formed</blockquote>No one knows for sure. But do u know how does god get created ? We do not know how the first bacteria is formed, but it doesn't means we give up and just rely on supernatural to explain stuffs. If we keep using supernatural to explain stuffs, men r very little from animals then. If we don't know we try to find it out. Tat should be a good starting moltivation to find the truth. Not just don't search at all and rely on theories tat were never proven or verified. BTW scientist r pondering on a few possible reasons for why life begins. It is hard to perform the experments out and even if the did so, they may have to try for billions of times before life can occur. They also have a natural apprehension tat religion will slam them hard, much like wat happened in the olden days.<br><br></div>
