            <div class='col-md body'>U have everything to lose man.. money tat can be used to buy another flat, time wasted in going to church and effort into praying to nothing. I know people going to church every wed, fri, sat and sun for church activity. Friday is for cell group, wed for some mid week thingy, sat and sun for church. Too much money is spent too. Each time they go, it is hours spent. Not only do they have to pay 10% of salary, they also have to pay for additonal stuff everytime they go to church. Everytime they r there, they will ask for more money. And whenever for watever reason they ask, these guys will pay 200 for it ! I don't know man.. tat sounds like a real cheat case ! Frankly as a freethinker, I feel tat time and money is already limited, wat is more christian !<br><br>Salvation goes to christ believers ? Sorry man, as wat raven aid, everyone dies.

I mean before they become christian, they can use the time in any way they want. U want to sleep, fine, u want to have an outing with your children also fine. U want to just play video games also fine. But now they r forced to spend time even when their exams r coming or it is the only free time they had. It is no longer free.<br><br>It is the same about the money too. They could have the luxury of spending the money in watever they want before. But now, they r forced to donate tis money whether they like it or not. They could have spend it on upgrading their computer, buy a new flat or a new car. But now, they have no choice in how they spend the money and all the money just disappeared from their pockets forever.<br><br><blockquote>Yah lor, at first he say purpose of life is to attain happiness, then when people happy happy give money, he complained. wat to do?</blockquote>The only problem I have is they r cheated by it. Time and money is an important part of their happiness u know.</div>
