            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>all creation is created within the six days, so there won't be new species popping out to eat old ones</blockquote>So u mean one day before there is no life on earth and the very next day suddenly every life appear ? They need to produce thousands of such animals for each species at one go as they need the food to sustain it. If tat is the case, then it should be easy to find evidence since a lot of fossils will point to the same age. Why can't they find it ? The bones found r not even approximately close. From study on fossils, they found tat as age goes by the living things become more and more complex. This shouldn't be true since very complex animals such as wolves, dinosaurs and donkeys should be found at the same time.<br><br><blockquote>The oldest rocks we find on the earth are about 4100 Mya, and they are devoid of any life. For the next 2000 million years, rocks from the Archean have no multicellular life at all, just prokaryotes. Then, 2100 Mya, appear the first fossils of eukaryotes (single-celled organisms with a nucleus). For another 1000 million years, there is still no evidence of multicellular life. The first hints of the existence of multicellular organisms comes from trace fossils of tiny worm burrows, found in sandstone dating at 1100 Mya.<br><br>Near the Precambrian/Cambrian transition, only 580 Mya, in the Ediacaran and Burgess shale faunas we finally find the first fossils of multicellular animals. However, they are very unusual, small, soft-bodied metazoans, and most are superficially unlike anything found today. Precisely as we would expect from the standard phylogenetic tree, the earliest fossils of multi-cellular life are very simple sponges and sea anemone-like organisms (sea anemones and jellyfish are both cnidarians). Around 20 million years later, we find the first evidence of simple mollusks, worms, and echinoderms (organisms similar to starfish and sea cucumbers). Another ~15 million years later, the very first vertebrates appear, though most people would strain to recognize them as such. They are small worm-like and primitive fish-like organisms, without bones, jaws, or fins (excepting a single dorsal fin).<br><br>As we progress through the Phanerozoic, life gets progressively more similar to modern biota. In the Cambrian (~540 to 500 Mya), we find predominantly invertebrate sea organisms, such as trilobites, sponges, and echinoderms. During the next 100 million years sea life is dominated by invertebrates and strange jawless fish, which besides chordate worms are the only vertebrates around at the time. More familiar jawed fish only appear during the late Silurian, about 410 Mya. Ninety percent of the earth's sediments, up until the Devonian (~400 Mya), are devoid of any land animals.<br><br>During the Devonian, we finally find the first evidence of insects. For the next 100 million years, through the Carboniferous up until the Permian (~300 Mya), there are no land reptiles, no birds, nor mammalsmdash;only amphibians and insects. The land is covered by fernsmdash;no pine trees or oaks or anything resembling them.<br><br>During the Mesozoic (from 250 to 65 Mya) life is dominated by monstrously large reptiles, the dinosaurs. The predominant plants are unusual gymnosperms, like the cycads. Nothing even resembling a modern mammal is found until the Jurassic, about 190 Mya. Even then, these "mammals" are small and appear half-reptile/half-rodentmdash;far removed from the large megafauna yet to come. Ninety percent of the sediments on the earth which contain fossils of living organisms have no evidence of flowersmdash;these appear for the first time just before the Paleocene (~65 Mya). Likewise, the earth's record of life is devoid of any hardwood forests until the beginning of the Cenozoic (~65 Mya to the present).<br><br>During the Cenozoic, mammals and birds finally come to prominence on the land, much as we find today. By the Pleistocene (2 Mya), the earth's biota closely, yet imperfectly, resembles what we presently find on the earth. Notable exceptions are the recent megafauna that covered the continents with organisms like mammoths, giant sloths, and saber-toothed tigers (Futuyma 1998, pp. 130, 169-199). </blockquote>The complexity is found to be increasing with time, not stagnant as present. isn't tat evidence tat life isn't created in a single day ?<br><br>So u must have believe tat the whole galazy is created within 6 days. Do u think the earth and sun is created within one day then ?<br><br><blockquote>there won't be new species created after the six days because it's been done and completed. sign, sealed, delivered. i don't deny that animals can adapt to the environment. they may develop longer limbs, etc.. i.e. things can be created yet still dynamic to adapt.<br><br>anyway, if there are new species formed. then it's in the area of evolution, not creation. </blockquote>So u believe tat god will not create any new species out ever again ? I had said before, if u find a new species tat was never found before, tat will confirm creationism. But the truth is tat they don't even try. U believe in microevolution. Do u believe in macroevolution ?<br><br><blockquote>p.s. if DNA are exactly the same, they are the same species. fishes and men have different DNA. so to prove animals with a different DNA makeup is actually quite easy.</blockquote>The point is not about totally same, but about it being similar. Why will it be similar to the point of more than 80% ? Doesn't tat support evolution ? Or god just cut and paste all DNA codes for convenience ?<br><br>Plant evolution has been studied thoroughly. U do not know it because creationism do not target them for argument.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God made the world in six days, so there's not sudden influx of life. In anyway, we're talking about an almighty being, it's not surprising how He can create all these things at the blink of the eye.  God is not limited to our human minds.  I'm not sure why the fossils were not found, maybe one day we'll all know the answer.  This calls for patience.<br><br>Genesis was recorded some time after creation, surely all the details cannot be captured.  Also, technology wasn't so advanced as the present time.  If God had revealed so many details of the galaxy, thermal theorems, creation of space and time, formation of galaxies, planets and beyond, the people of that time would have a difficult grasping the bible.  It has to be simple and true.<br><br>Yes I believe that no new creation would be formed (except to be "reborn again" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">).  DNAs are similiar in nature not just because it is in inherited.  I'm sure a creator of living beings would have recognised the basic necessities to survive and population, i.e. the four functions you have mentioned, and would have included during the period of creation.  Hence, there will be similarities in the DNA composition.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong.  New species have been found from time to time.  It's not that they are created, popped out of nowhere.  It's just that they are difficult to find and there places still unexplored.  So even if a new species is found, it neither supports evolution nor creation because it may just mean that they were undiscovered.<br><br>I'll let the others contribute for now =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, let me summarise your view<br><br>u do not care if the earth is young or old. U only care tat it is created by god. Why u do not care is because the evidence point to the fact tat the bible is wrong. U say it is not wrong, because the 6 days tat was used <span style="font-style: italic;">explicitly</span> written in the bible doesn't mean 6 days ?!!? They put 6 days there just to refute other people religion ?!?? If u ask me, either the bible tries to copy other people religion or something must be wrong with god's english as days means days. The use of the word "generations" is probably just a thought by christians who realise tat the earth cannot be young...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>U doubt it cannot be proven ? Maybe u r right because to be blunt... u find excuses for its mistakes... bible also suggected tat the earth is flat and sun revolves around earth. I bet u can come up with sayings tat twist its literal meaning to something totally different. If u do not read the words in the bible literally, everything in it becomes undefined. U can say days actually meant generation. Maybe in future some can even say "days" meant papaya, banana or saseme street.</div>

Why can't u think about it from another angle tat it just meant christainity does not exists ? Wat evidence do u have saying tat it do ?

Tat depend on wat is your definition of chaos and order. Do u know tat there is no such thing as absolute position but only relative position ? The absolute position tat we learn during school r also in refernece to a point of interest. Now almost everything is moving (asteriod, stars etc) in a way tat mathematically say tat they come from a common point. Earth is continuosly moving around the sun and on its axis and also following the movement of the sun. Sun is moving around the milky way. Gravtiy caused all these movement. Things near to the edge of galaxy r still moving at the speed of light. Newton law of motion is used to justify big bang, there is no problem to it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I've read of Hawkings and Einstein and science-related articles (I wanted to be a physicist when I was young).  And as I agreed, there are many things that we do not know.  But that does not rule a creator out of the whole picture.  This creator would have set in place physical laws in which the creation should operate.  But because he is divine, he would have the powers to intervene the events that take place in the process of creation.<br><br>I would never have the knowledge to make a sensible or convincing argument of the second law of dynamics, nor talk about the findings from Cosmic Background Explorer.  These are just things I read from the source (credit goes to google, etc).  In anyway, each camp will have their "valid" points of argument.<br><br>Again all these things scientists have discovered may be true, but I restate again, it does not rule out creation by a divine being.<br><br>But not having all knowledge of everything and how it came about doesn't stop one from taking a step of faith in acknowledging the beauty of God.  For who has heard of believers accepting God as their father because he figured how God created the world?

I mean as people know more and more about science, they tend to know tat supernatural phenomenon r getting more and more... false...

He test people by killing their whole family, he kill almost the whole race of men just because they r not good in his eyes, he kill off the first born of the egytians just because they do not listen to him and he cursed the whole human race to speak in different language just because they wanted to cooperate in building a tower. Why do U think I felt he is sadistic etc, is because he really is a bit... sadistic... He really create evil isn't it ? He really punish men for being sinful isn't it ? Everyone sins isn't it ? According to a christian website, when u r born, u have already sinned. Then isn't the analogy of forcing everyone to swim and punish them when they r wet true ? He create sin, make it such a way tat everyone sin then punish people because they sin. Is there anything wrong with tis saying ? U better hope tat u r not his son as he will probably crucifixed u as a sacrifice to himself. </span></div>
