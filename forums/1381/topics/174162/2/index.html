You are made right with God through the blood of Jesus only.<br><br>It is because you are already made right with God that you then do the good works. Faith must come first, not works.<br><br>As part of the articles of catechism in the part about penance it says that it is only when the priest gives you absolution then will you receive God's forgiveness. This makes your forgiveness dependent on a man and not Jesus. God's forgiveness to us in not controlled or conditional upon a mere man forgiving us. It is conditional upon us accepting His Grace and what Jesus did for us.<br><br>Doing penance is doing something which is decided by the priest who "determines" how bad your sin supposedly is... sin, is sin, little sin, big sin, it is all the same to God. It is sin, God does not measure sin. So who gave this man the right to determine the depth of our sin and then set for us the appropriate work to receive our forgiveness? This then makes what Jesus did for us to no effect. If we could work for our forgiveness, then we would not need Jesus. Even in the OT, the Isrealites only atonement and forgiveness for sin was a pure sacrifice. This is God's way and it still has not changed.<br><br>In the bible Jesus says, I have not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill the law.<br><br>It also says that in the articles of catechism, that doing this penance contributes to our forgiveness of our sins. Works have never and will never contribute to the forgiveness of our sin.<br><br>The articles of catechism also demand satisfaction, that the sinner "expiate" his sin by doing works. Our sins were already "expiated" when Jesus died for us.<br><br></div>

You are made right with God through the blood of Jesus only.<br><br>It is because you are already made right with God that you then do the good works. Faith must come first, not works.<br><br>As part of the articles of catechism in the part about penance it says that it is only when the priest gives you absolution then will you receive God's forgiveness. This makes your forgiveness dependent on a man and not Jesus. God's forgiveness to us in not controlled or conditional upon a mere man forgiving us. It is conditional upon us accepting His Grace and what Jesus did for us.<br><br>Doing penance is doing something which is decided by the priest who "determines" how bad your sin supposedly is... sin, is sin, little sin, big sin, it is all the same to God. It is sin, God does not measure sin. So who gave this man the right to determine the depth of our sin and then set for us the appropriate work to receive our forgiveness? This then makes what Jesus did for us to no effect. If we could work for our forgiveness, then we would not need Jesus. Even in the OT, the Isrealites only atonement and forgiveness for sin was a pure sacrifice. This is God's way and it still has not changed.<br><br>In the bible Jesus says, I have not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill the law.<br><br>It also says that in the articles of catechism, that doing this penance contributes to our forgiveness of our sins. Works have never and will never contribute to the forgiveness of our sin.<br><br>The articles of catechism also demand satisfaction, that the sinner "expiate" his sin by doing works. Our sins were already "expiated" when Jesus died for us.<br><br></div></blockquote>Please quote which part of the Cathecism. Thank you.</div>

To do Penance is to accept God's grace to live a holy life. To do Penance is to accept the fact that Christ has already paid the price of your iniquity.<br><br>Thing is, Confession is only for those who have repentant and contrite heart. Those who go in there but do not actually repent are paying mere lip service. They are not only unforgiven, but also sin additionally.<br><br>Christ gave priests the authority to forgive sins and He acts through them. All this is only possible because of His death and rising.<br><br>Just because you have been forgiven does not mean that you don't have to suffer. It's like if someone goes shoplifting, no matter how sorry he is, he still has to learn from his mistake. He may get off with a light penalty, but nevertheless he has to pay for it somehow. This is the law, and the same applies to the law of God. Like you said, Christ did not come to abolish the law. Justice must still be served, because God is Good and Just. The only thing is, we don't have to suffer the eternal consequences if we repent.<br><br>However, we still must suffer the temporal consequences. It's like if we are lazy and don't study for our tests, we cannot ask God to forgive us and let us pass. Yes, He will forgive us, but he wont let us pass the test as a reminder to us. The Penance would then, be to go for remedial classes.<br></div>
