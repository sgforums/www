You are not bad enough [and never will be bad enough] to lose it.<br><br>Question: about that last statement: Â‘never bad enough and never will be bad enough to lose itÂ’ does it mean then that after I am saved I can live as I please-even to the point of repudiating the faith and embracing Satan as my lord-does it mean that I am still saved?<br><br>Cheap grace says :Â”Yes!!! You are still saved even if you will make Satan as lord of your life and not the Lord Jesus.Â” Cheap grace is when a person says I am saved and no matter how I live doesnÂ’t change that at all. Even if I turned atheist and curse God all my life till I die.Â”<br><br>Saving grace says: Â“No. it only reveals your true condition. It means you were never saved in the first place.Â”<br><br>Salvation is being saved from the penalty of sin, the power of sin and ultimately from the presence of sin. PENALTY, POWER AND PRESENCE. Cheap grace is a grace that doesnÂ’t saved from the POWER of sin. ItÂ’s not true salvation.<br><br>Though the Lord Jesus ChristÂ’s saving grace is free. It is not cheap. It doesnÂ’t mean that since you are saved-from the penalty of sin which is the lake of fire- that you are now free to sin. That you were given a license to sin. No. Not at all.<br><br>True saving grace also changes and sets free the heart so in love with sin. From the enslaving power of sin. It not only saved us from the lake of fire, it also saved us from the lordship of Satan to Christ Lordship.<br><br>Joh 8:34 Jesus answered them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin [as a lifestyle and a way of life] is a slave of sin.<br><br>That is a picture of a person still not saved. He is still not freed from the penalty of sin because he is still not freed from the power of sin.<br><br>But- hereÂ’s saving grace talking about freedom from the POWER OF SIN.<br><br>Joh 8:36 "Therefore if the Son makes you free [from sin], you shall be free indeed.<br><br>Saving grace changes not only your destination-hell. It also changes your heart disposition-from the power of sin.<br><br></div>
