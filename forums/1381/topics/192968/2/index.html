            <div class='col-md body'>cont'<br><br>The human dilemma that we are in right now is that we have never been in a lower point. People say sometimes, "Don't worry, we have got out of situations like this." Oh, no! We haven't. Don't you fool yourself. We've never gotten out of situation like this. You know why? Because we have never been in a situation like this. That's why!<br><br>We've never had difficulties like this. We've never had this plague of divorce. We've never had a million girls under 16 becoming pregnant, like last year. What did they say the night before last on the news, "Tonight 20,000 girls over the nation will get pregnant." Sex is a sport. Immorality is an accepted way of life.<br>People say there are fewer divorces than last year. Well, how do you expect any more when they don't get married? They did get married at one time and got divorced. They don't even bother to get married now, just live together. Have a baby, so what? "We agree to part," that's it. So we are a broken nation. Never, never in our history did we need revival more than today, the day in which we live.<br>But you don't wish revival... there is no such thing.<br><br>People say to me all over the country, "I am interested in revival." I say, "Yes, so are a million other Americans."<br>I find all kinds of people interested in it. I don't find many people burdened for it. People are very interested in revival, but we don't start to break the fallow ground. We don't prepare the way of the Lord.<br><br>I remember as a little boy I used to go to bed at night with a candle... you never had that joy, did you? I remember thinking how many other candles you could bring and light off that candle? I wonder and I wonder. I never found an answer, but I often used to wonder.<br><br>It was Charles Wesley who wrote the hymn,<br>"See how great a flame aspires, kindled by a spark of grace.<br>Jesus' love the nations fires, sets the kingdoms all ablaze.<br>To bring fire on earth He came, kindled in some hearts it is,<br>Oh that all might catch the blaze, all partake the glorious bliss."<br><br>Jesus said, "To bring fire on earth have I come." Did you hear anybody preach on that text? What kind of fire? Well, surely not hell fire. Holy Ghost fire!<br>The most devastating fire of all is not the fire that consumes a building. It isn't even the fire of hell.<br>The greatest, most devastating fire, is the fire of God. We say, "God is love, God is love, God is love..."<br>And yet our God is a consuming fire. "Who shall abide the day of His coming," Malachi says. "He is like a refiner's fire."<br>Mathew 3:16, "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire." But you see, that aspect is not stressed in the day in which we live.<br><br>Everybody talks about the baptism. So what do you mean by the baptism? There is a baptism with the Holy Ghost and Fire. Not just with the Holy Ghost, but with Fire. When He comes He will "thoroughly purge His floor and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. Which, again,<br>can happen individually,<br>or it can happen in a church,<br>or it can come and work through a whole community<br>or it can work through a whole nation.<br><br>There will be a thousand people who, if you get a heart and a vision, will say, "Oh, you've got tunnel vision." Hmm? Well, I think the one reason why the Apostle Paul conquered... and triumphed... and out-smarted us... and out-suffered us... and out-prayed us... and out-sacrificed us... and out-preached us was because he settled for one thing: "This one thing I do."<br>You've got to have one vision,<br>You've got to have one heart,<br>You've got to have one purpose,<br><br>"This one thing I do..." I sell out to God's will totally.<br><br>Well, what does this become? Well, I believe this thing becomes an obsession, as I was saying to a brother this morning. For fifty years I've wept, and I've prayed, and I've groaned, and I've read, and I've fasted, and I've met with guys for nights of prayer, and days of prayer, and days and days of prayer, for revival. There isn't much sign of it. Well, are you sure? You see, prayers never die.<br>"What are these under the altar? The prayer of saints." You never pray a prayer that is born of God without it being on record with God. God never wastes anything. Do you think you and I have prayers born of grief, born of anguish, born of desire to see an overthrow of iniquity, (for after all that is what revival is) and you think God will let them die?<br><br>Now again, the shadow of darkness and death is over this generation like nothing we've ever had before. And yet, the greatest tragedy of all is this: a sick church in a dying world. We have neither the vision nor the passion, nor at this moment, the intention of setting our house in order -- "to break the fallow ground" -- to prepare the way of the Lord.<br><br>My hope is that as we go on here we are not just going to gather information and statistics about revival, but that we are going to individually seek personal revival.<br><br>Leonard Ravenhill<br>___<br><br>One of my favourite modern preacher other than A.W Tozer.<br>A personal mentor though we've never met.</div>

'Tell me,' he said, 'How can I get the air out of this glass'<br>One man answered, 'Suck it out with a pump.'<br>Moody replied, 'That would create a vacuum and shatter the glass.'<br>After many suggestions, Moody smiled, picked up a pitcher of water, and filled the glass with water. 'There he said, all the air is now removed.'<br>Then he went on to explain that victory in the Christian life is not by sucking out a sin here and there, but rather by being filled with the Spirit.<br><br>"Out of 100 men, one will read the Bible, the other 99 will read the Christian."<br>D.L. Moody<br><br>Those who know God the best are the richest and most powerful in prayer. Little acquaintance with God, and strangeness and coldness to Him, make prayer a rare and feeble thing.<br>-E. M. Bounds<br><br>Our ordinary views of prayer are not found in the New Testament. We look upon prayer as a means for getting something for ourselves; the Bible idea of prayer is that we may get to know God Himself.<br>-Oswald Chambers<br><br>The essence of prayer does not consist in asking God for something but in opening our hearts to God, in speaking with Him, and living with Him in perpetual communion.<br>Prayer is continual abandonment to God. Prayer does not mean asking God for all kinds of things we want; it is rather the desire for God Himself, the only Giver of Life,<br>Prayer is not asking, but union with God.<br>Prayer is not a painful effort to gain from God help in the varying needs of our lives. Prayer is the desire to possess God Himself, the Source of all life.<br>The true spirit of prayer does not consist in asking for blessings, but in receiving Him who is the giver of all blessings, and in living a life of fellowship with Him."<br>- Sadhu Sundar Singh<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE DEVOTION OF HEARING - My Utmost For His Highest<br><br>"Speak; for Thy servant heareth." 1 Samuel 3:10<br><br>Because I have listened definitely to one thing from God, it does not follow that I will listen to everything He says.<br>The way in which I show God that I neither love nor respect Him is by the obtuseness of my heart and mind towards what He says. If I love my friend, I intuitively detect what he wants, and Jesus says, "Ye are My friends."<br><br>Have I disobeyed some command of my Lord's this week? If I had realized that it was a command of Jesus, I would not consciously have disobeyed it; but most of us show such disrespect to God that we do not even hear what He says, He might never have spoken.<br><br>The destiny of my spiritual life is such identification with Jesus Christ that I always hear God, and I know that God always hears me (John 11:41).<br><br>If I am united with Jesus Christ, I hear God, by the devotion of hearing all the time. A lily, or a tree, or a servant of God, may convey God's message to me. What hinders me from hearing is that I am taken up with other things.<br>It is not that I will not hear God, but I am not devoted in the right place. I am devoted to things, to service, to convictions, and God may say what He likes but I do not hear Him.<br><br>The child attitude is always, "Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth." If I have not cultivated this devotion of hearing, I can only hear God's voice at certain times; at other times I am taken up with things - things which I say I must do, and I become deaf to Him, I am not living the life of a child. Have I heard God's voice to-day?<br><br>--Oswald Chambers</div>
