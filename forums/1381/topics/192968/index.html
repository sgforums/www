It does tell us the background of how Men 'fall short of the glory'.<br>However, there is a greater purpose which believers failed to see. God desires and seeketh for His people even though they have turned away from Him. Truly! It was shown in many passages of the Old Testament - that God is ever faithful and wants His people to draw near to Him.<br>His desire and The Fall costed Him His Son - Jesus.<br><br>I hope all Christians will redefine their 'Christianity' and if there is a need for churches to seek 'regeneration' or 're-encounter', they should.<br>Only by living out the Love and Fear of God that the World can witness the works of the true and living God.<br><br>Even in Genesis, it was shown clearly.<br>If ever any Christian were to ask God, 'What do you want (which i can give)?'<br>His answer will always and ever be 'I want your heart...your willing heart'<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

The best and safest way to deal with these truths is to raise our eyes to God and in deepest reverence say, "0 Lord, Thou knowest."

It has no words. It has no words because no words exist.<br>No words exist because no words are needed.<br>There are no ears to hear them., no eyes to read them. The Author is alone.<br><br>And so he take the great pen and begins to write. Like an artist gathers his colors and woodcarver his tools, the Author assembles his words.<br><br>There are three. Three single words. One of these three will pour a million thoughts. But on these three words, the story suspend.<br><br>He takes his quill and spells the first. T-i-m-e.<br><br>Time did not exist until he wrote it. He, himself, is timeless, but his story would be encased in time. The story would have a first rising of the sun, a first shifting of the sand. A beginning . . . and an end. A final chapter. He knows before he writes it.<br><br>Time. A footspan on enternity's trail.<br><br>Slowly, tenderly, the Author writes the second word. A name.<br>A-d-a-m.<br><br>As he writes, he sees him, the first Adam. Then he sees all the others. In a thousand eras in a thousand lands., the Author sees them.<br>Each Adam. Each child. Instantly loved. Permanently loved. Toeach he assigns a time. To each he appoints a place. No accidents. No coincidences. Just design.<br><br>The Author makes a promise to these unborn: In my image i will make you. You will be like me. You will laugh. You will create. You will never die. And you will write.<br><br>They must. For each life is a book, not to read, but rather a story to be written. The Author starts each life story, but each life will write his or her own ending.<br><br>What dangerous liberty. How much safer it would have beem to finish the story for each Adam. To script every option. It would have been much simpler. It would have been safer. But it would not have been love.<br>Love is only love if chosen.<br><br>So the Author decides to give each child a pen. 'Write carefully,'' he whispers.<br><br>Lovingly, deliberately, he writes the third word, already feeling the pain.<br><br>E-m-m-a-n-u-e-l<br><br>The greatest mind in the universe imagined time. The truest judge granted Adam a choice. But it was love that gave Emmanuel, God with us.<br><br>The Author would enter his own story.<br><br>The word became flesh. He, too, would be born.<br>He, too, would be human.<br>He, too, would have feet and hands.<br>He, too, would have tears and trials.<br><br>And most importantly, he, too, would have a choice.<br>Emmanuel would stand at crossroads of life and death and make a choice.<br><br>The Author knows well of the weight of that decision. He pauses as he writes the page of his own pain. He could stop.<br>Even the Author has a choice. But how can the Author not create?<br>How can a Writer not write?<br>How can Love not love?<br>So he chooses life, though it means death, with hope that his children will do the same.<br><br>And so the Author of Life completes the story. He drives the spike in the flesh and rolls the stone over the cave. Knowing the choice he will make, knowing the choice all Adams will make, he pens, ''The End,'' then closes the book and proclaims the beginning.<br><br>''Let there be light!''<br><br>- Max Lucado</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by klydeer:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi MC, May i ask what do you mean by "Revival" ? Does it mean going back to the origins of Acts 2 ?</div></blockquote>Lecture I<br>by Leonard Ravenhill<br><br>Revival......another definition would be to recover, repair or restore.<br>Hosea 10:12 says: "Sow to yourself in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek the Lord till He come and reign righteousness upon you."<br><br>What is fallow ground?<br>Fallow ground is ground that has been fruitful, and then it has been plowed over, and no seed has been sown in it, and therefore it has become unproductive.<br><br>Notice, there is a human emphasis here -- it says<br>that we are to break up -- you break up your fallow ground.<br><br>Now take another aspect of it here in Psalm 85:6 "Would Thou not revive us again: that Thy people may rejoice in Thee." So, there is an absence of joy, of vitality -- there is an absence of ecstasy.<br><br>The very word "revive" presupposes life. You can only revive what has already had vitality -- life that has become sick, weak, or apathetic. I think the nearest analogy I can give you is a recent case of a man who apparently drowned. He had been under the water for an incredible amount of time. Then somebody pulled him out and worked and worked on him, and eventually life came again. This is actually what it means to revive,<br>It means to revitalize.<br>It means to restore lost power.<br>It means to recover lost energy.<br><br>In the Acts of the Apostles 3:19 we read, "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord." Whatever else we say about revival we have to recognize this, that revival is an act of mercy in the sovereignty of God.<br><br>There is a vast difference between revival and evangelism. When we speak of revival in America we think of church advertising, "Our revival will begin next Sunday night at a certain time and it is going to finish the next Sunday night at a certain time." Obviously this is something purely mechanical, it is something which men have engineered.<br><br>I think that one of the offenses of revival, in the historic sense, is that it cannot be organized. As Doctor Tozer said, "When revival comes it changes the moral climate of a community."<br>You can have revival that covers a church -- Spurgeon had that.<br>You can have a revival that covers a city.<br>You can have a revival that covers the whole nation -- and I am thinking in this context more than in the other contexts (though sometimes revival spreads from here to there -- like fire spreads.)<br><br>Revival cannot be organized -- evangelism can be organized.<br>Revival cannot be subsidized -- evangelism can and usually it must be.<br>Revival cannot be advertised -- evangelism can.<br><br>It may cost millions of dollars, as it often does, to have one of our huge,<br>modern, so called revivals. You have to pay vast sums of money<br>for time on TV, for example -- perhaps a million dollars a night.<br>That's incredible, that's unthinkable to me in<br>the context of Biblical revival, or even historical revival.<br><br>Why doesn't revival need to be advertised? For the simple reason, that fire is the most self advertising thing that there is, whether it is a physical fire or a revival fire. It draws people like a magnet.<br><br>To bring this down to modern technology -- revival cannot be computerized.<br>There is information that you can put in computer and presto, you get the answer predicting an outcome according to the facts that were put in. But you cannot computerize or predict revival. There are periods in which one thing predominates.<br>Sometimes revival is totally taken over by sorrow.<br>Sometimes revival is totally taken over by joy, ecstasy 'till you don't know<br>whether you are in the flesh or whether you've gone out of the earth.<br>Sometimes revival is taken over by stillness.<br><br>There are times when you go to a prayer meeting and the power of God is there.<br>There is stillness and you feel it is creative. You feel,<br>"Now something is building up around here, somebody is going to<br>come out shortly with a heart bursting... with some agonizing prayer..."<br><br>Revival cannot be rationalized. Again, one of the offensive things about revival is you can't put your finger on the spot, usually, as to how or why or where it began.<br>It is supremely an act of God.<br>You find a man would go with a series of messages to a community and before long that community is alive, it's throbbing. He goes to another town with exactly the same group of men, the same type of prayer is poured out, the same sweat and soul travail and there is no response.<br><br>You can't predict and you can't organize revival. Why? Because you can't organize where the wind is coming from. The Spirit, the wind, bloweth where it listeth. If you say it's going to come this way, it comes that way. If you say God's going to use that man, very often He doesn't even bother with that man. Revival so often comes through unknown characters.<br><br>I don't think the world has ever been in a greater sense of turmoil than it is in this moment. I don't think our nation has. Whatever we shall say about revival we have to recognize this: There are three things about natural life: conception, gestation, and birth. You can't alter the program. There has never been revival, that I can trace, that has not been preceded by agonizing prayer. You might say, "I haven't got to that stage yet of agonizing prayer. How does is come?" Well, it comes through VISION.<br><br>If we are really going to get a concept of revival we have to get a vision of God's sorrow over sin. We have to get a concept of how, day by day, we offend God. As a nation we offend God in millions of ways.<br>When I was praying in the Bahamas one day, I saw a great column of smoke, which happened to be coming from tires that were being burned. It was as black as could be, and over there I saw a wisp of smoke going up from the ground. I didn't think much of it until about a year after, I was praying and the Lord said, "That volume of black, thick smoke is like the volume of sin that goes up every day." All the blasphemy, all the unbelief, all the dirty stories, all the lying, all the deception, all sex-perversion, all drunkenness -- this tremendous column of iniquity goes up in the sight of God. And here you have a little wisp -- of what? That is the praise that God gets out of His people. If we are going to realize how much we need revival we need to recognize the dimension of sin. We have to recognize that sin offends God.<br><br>Psalm 85:4 says, "Turn us, O God of our salvation and cause Thine anger towards us to cease. Wilt Thou be angry with us forever?" Psalm 80 verse 3, "Turn us again, O God, and cause Thy face to shine." Notice, it's repeated again in verse 7 and in verse 19, "...cause Thy face to shine." "...cause Thy face to shine." You know, I think one of the awesome tragedies of our day is this: the people of Israel could not live if God turned His face away from them and seems now we cannot live if God turns His face on us!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cont'<br><br>The awesomeness of God's presence... The awesomeness of God's majesty...<br>We've had meetings, in the last month particularly, where I would sit down at the end of the meeting. I didn't know what to do with it, and the pastor said, "Well, I can't handle a meeting like this, what do you do?" The invasion of God's power was so awesome that there was no way that you could handle it, so you just let the meeting ride itself out. We were having meetings five hours long, beginning at seven at night and finishing at midnight. College students came, and university people, and business people. When God comes, our social distinctions don't matter, our intellectual distinctions don't matter. There is an overwhelming sense that God is dealing, not with my intellect, not with my body, not with my emotions so much as with<br>the inner man... the inner being... the inner temple which He wants to indwell.<br><br>Isn't it amazing that with all the Iatola Khomeni has done, he has done some good things. He kicked liquor out of the country. Our president daren't do that. Last week he called his whole nation to five days of prayer and fasting. Do you think we have anybody in Washington who has enough insight to do that? With all the talk of spirituality they don't have enough sense to do that.<br><br>Joel speaks about the priests, the ministers of God. Look at Joel 1:13, "Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl ye ministers of the altar, come lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God." Go over to verse 12 of the 2nd chapter, "Turn ye now even to Me with all your heart and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rend your heart, and not your garments." Come down to verse 17, "Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare Thy people, O Lord, and give not Thine heritage to reproach."<br><br>Now, how do you get to that state? There is no way you can jump to that level in ten minutes.<br>It is an operation.<br>It's a process.<br>It's a preparation.<br>There has to be an individual breaking up of fallow ground in me. What is there in my individual life that obstructs the flow of the Spirit?<br>If you are going to break up fallow ground you have to get your own life into a state of discipline -- and we are the most undisciplined generation of believers ever. There is no way of getting to revival unless previously there comes brokeness.<br><br>What God wants is not to fill up empty pews.<br>He is not concerned about filling empty churches,<br>He is concerned about filling empty hearts.<br>And empty lives, and empty eyes that have no vision;<br>Empty hearts that have no passion,<br>And empty wills that have no purpose.<br><br>Have you ever thought about the enormity of the Jewish system? A great monolith of priests and Levites, and offerings and sacrifices, and new moons and Sabbaths, and Urim and Thumin. Then suddenly God puts one solitary individual there and he has one commission. "You go and prepare the way of the Lord."<br>But he has all this against him:<br>At least 2000 priests, a senior priest and elaborate temple.<br>A system of buying and selling cattle and other things for sacrifice.<br>An outer court, where you could come to a priest and tell him of your sin and<br>your guilt and he would make an offering for you.<br>And this fellow comes and he is saying that<br>The religious system is all obsolete<br>That God is going to manifest Himself independent of all of that<br>And that there is Somebody Else!<br>They say, "You must be the man." He says, "Oh, no, no, no! I am not the One. I am just coming to prepare the way of the Lord."<br><br>Now think of the sorrow of God after Adam failed.<br>Think of the sorrow of God after the whole system that He'd inaugurated failed.<br>Think of something which may be even more awesome still:<br><br>Think of the fact that 2000 years have lapsed since Jesus came and did<br>a full work of redemption... and the church is still dragging its feet<br>today!<br><br></div>
