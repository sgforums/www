Then u says tat the all the rules meant tat student should treat other students well. So if the student cheats, he is not breaking the rule since treating other students well does not means u cannot cheat in exams. U r clearly and blatantly breaking the rules of the 10 commandments by believing other gods and not keeping the sabbath day holy. However u totally ignore tat point and says tat being good to neighbour is enough. They r not obeying the 10 commandments because they had clearly broke them. And about jesus, he taught 2 things. If u only follow one of them, u r not following him at all. It is like saying there r 100 rules to follow in a school, u have to follow all these 100 rules, not just follow any one of them and think u r safe.<br><br>1.

If tat is the case god should have summarised it out at tat time. He is suppose to be perfect and therefore can express wat he wants. R u thinking tat he cannot express wat he thinks properly ?

So u should believe the science up till then. However personally I think tat somewhere the line everything was created out of nothing. Tat statement is not science now since it was not verified nor got evidences to say it is true. Tat is just my personal opinion of wat really creates out things. But if u say tat the big bang is created by god, which is another un-verified nor got evidences to show it is true, then I can also come up with my logic tat everything was created out of nothing, since even god need to be created and only "nothing" can avoid being created.</div>

We need to recignise Him, read His word, praise Him, and eventually fall in love with Him for all His wonders in the world become much more evident to us. This is what we do. Perhaps you can condemn but we wun defend ourselves because is what we believe.<br><br>Second commandment... what Jesus meant is to express God's love towards others. To follow Jesus means is expressing God's love to others, the feelings of compassion as well as humilty.<br><br>The 10 commandments are VERY explicit. But do you TRULY understand it? Remember the Bible has been handed down from generation to generation and those translations have unintentionally lost some of the emphasis/clarity of some words. HOWEVER! We are all guided by the HOLY SPIRIT. God is perfect. Its us who cant even comprehend the Bible. Even some of those scholars are tearing out their hair in frustration answering atheist scientists... anf in fact why not try emailing them your questions? Emailing a pastor or bishop can really help too! Because they understand the Bible much better than us.<br><br>Its like asking a primary school kid that a live electric wire is dangerous and why birds sitting on them does not get fried?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  nevertheless, we are glad to answer your questions to the best of our ability.<br><br>Keeping the Sabbath Day HOLY, what does it mean? The Jewish had a long list of laws like no work should be done on the Sabbath Day. Jesus went against that and healed a man on the Sabbath and essentially signed his death warrant (though alot of more events were to happen). Sabbath Day is a day of rememberance of God. We just celebrate it by going to church, singing songs of worship to him to celebrate knowing God and to recognise Him. We are also tempted to serve in the various ministries every Sunday, be it welfare, be it simple tasks, be it part of the service itself?<br><br>well thats my interpretation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>i wun bother arguing about this Sabbath Day thingy because for most, its just another Sunday. but hor, it doesnt mean only on the Sabbath then i wear my halo? its more like a very special day we Christians are called to celebrate our rebirth.</div>

U might as well say tat black is related to hair and hair is related to sadako and sadako is related to japanese so being black is being japanese. The conculsions u got is wrong since keeping the sabbath day is not only to love god but also to do ctions to show how to love god.

The verses and your conclusion don't match<br><br><blockquote>Loving God comes first. We need to recignise Him, read His word, praise Him, and eventually fall in love with Him for all His wonders in the world become much more evident to us. This is what we do. Perhaps you can condemn but we wun defend ourselves because is what we believe. </blockquote>so non-believers go to hell or go to heaven ? They clearly do not love god since they don't believe he exists. BTW why will one eventually love god when all in the bible it shows how harsh he is to men<br><br><blockquote>Second commandment... what Jesus meant is to express God's love towards others. To follow Jesus means is expressing God's love to others, the feelings of compassion as well as humilty. </blockquote>Jesus also meant tat love to god is still needed. He also states tat god is a harsh master tat is not easily pleased.<br><br><blockquote>The 10 commandments are VERY explicit. But do you TRULY understand it? Remember the Bible has been handed down from generation to generation and those translations have unintentionally lost some of the emphasis/clarity of some words. HOWEVER! We are all guided by the HOLY SPIRIT. God is perfect. Its us who cant even comprehend the Bible. Even some of those scholars are tearing out their hair in frustration answering atheist scientists... anf in fact why not try emailing them your questions? Emailing a pastor or bishop can really help too! Because they understand the Bible much better than us. </blockquote>So wat r u trying to say ? The bible is wrong after 2000 years ? Then the NT can be wrong as well since it is also very old. The wording and your whole religion is founded on words tat have lost its accuracy and relevance over time ? Holy spirit ? Maybe the part about being guided by holy spirits is wrong too. There is not such things as holy spirits, it is just some badly translated verses over time. God is perfect ? How can he when the words he said had to change over time when he claim it does not ? How can he when he can't write the bible so tat everyone can understand it ? So christianity is a religion where the bible can only be interpreted by the few priviledge people like bishop or pastor ? God do not like mentally challenged people to read the bible ? The mentally challenged people had to be in a greater rick of being non-believer since they can't interprete the bible ? It is purposelly made difficult so nobody really understand, even scholars ? I don't know how to otherwise phrase tis para other than asking like tis<br><br><blockquote>Keeping the Sabbath Day HOLY, what does it mean? The Jewish had a long list of laws like no work should be done on the Sabbath Day. Jesus went against that and healed a man on the Sabbath and essentially signed his death warrant (though alot of more events were to happen). Sabbath Day is a day of rememberance of God. We just celebrate it by going to church, singing songs of worship to him to celebrate knowing God and to recognise Him. We are also tempted to serve in the various ministries every Sunday, be it welfare, be it simple tasks, be it part of the service itself? </blockquote>So wat does Jesus went agains the jews means ? Another bible contradiction ? Sunday is celebrated by songs and church for some christians but for non-believers they probably do the thigns they wanna do. They r not keeping sabbath day holy. U can't keep it holy by not doing anything different from normal days<br><br><blockquote>but its ya tone. i assume cos u sound rather bitter and resentful to us. we feel rather hurt. this previous post really had a vast improvement in tone. try to be friendlier to us and we'll be too happy to share what we believe. please do not judge us cos of what we believe in. look at what we do instead. if we didn't really harm you or attack you, perhaps you could try to be frinedlier to us. its an incentive to continue talking to you.</blockquote>My tone is the same in every other places, not just in eternal hope.

It is not just about wat your heart believe in, it is about believing in the truth. Your faith is verifiable and to me, it appears to be verified to be wrong, like young earth or evolution etc. Therefore it can be seen whether it is real or not. But strangely to me, most just ignore the facts it is proven wrong and they believe in it anyway.<br><br><blockquote>God has a plan for everyone we believe. so i'll leave it to Him.
