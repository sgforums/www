The Catholic Church has, on the other hand, given me a perceptivity of what the bible teaches : Love and Peace.<br><br>What also touches me about the Catholic Church is the way they address the Protestant Church.  In some sermons, the Priests will refer to them as "Our Seperated Brothers".  This loving name for the Protestants was advocated by none other than our late Pope John Paul II.  </div></blockquote>I could see that u r a great protestant. At least deep down, u know what the Catholic churches practices, Love and Peace. Every mass, we pray for our brothers and sister in Christ.<br><br>I am a Roman Catholic. But, to be very honest with u, there are things that I disagree with RC, i dont intercede through Mother Mary. But, then why i am still a RC? Simple, becoz they love. Not a speech of a priest and pope that criticize another protestant. Look what what Jesus said before," those who things u nvr sin, pls throw the first stone". So, i really piss off for those protestant that they think that they are damn holy. Mother Theresa, work with the sick, the poor, until a good ripe age. honestly, if i would go to india and africa to deal with these ppl , i would fall sick and die. By God's Grace, she had a good health till old. Mother Theresa loves, the Pope loves. By that, i could see a image of God in them.<br><br>Yeah, some might criticize the office of Pope. Dun forget, the Pope need to synchronize all the RC churches. I believe in unity, not division. Protestants are too divided. Becoz there is no "leader", there born churches like the charismatic type, and like those of City Harvest. No one could guide these churches, except the pastor themselves. If, IF City Harvest church aim is to collect money and get rich from ppl, i wont be shock that the paster is not even a believer, good money to earn. In City Harvest church, u can make donation with Cheque, and even NETS!! Again, this is where no one , no leader can control them. I could also easily set a church up and earn money. I dun need to work. This is where, i see the importance of Pope.<br><br>Another thing is that, protestants, they convert ppl by "force", like intterogation", without realising. The pope and theresa convert ppl by love. The person who assasinated him, a turkish guy was touched by the pope's love and forgiveness. That he, the ASSASIN even cried during the pope's death. THat is the power of love, that Jesus would want us to show. For those who criticize the pope, the pope still love them, but from my humble opinion, the pope has done so much and love so much, to those PASTOR who criticizes him, please wake up, do u thing u had contributed ur life to God more than him, and love more than him. Then, who r u to criticize. By scolding, condemning, and not by love?? If that is the way God wants u to spread his love, go on.<br><br>Conclusion, that's y i am a RC, though i dont follow some of thier doctrine.</div>

And then I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> a Protestant.  Now I have returned to the Catholic faith!  .  Yay!  <img src="http://www.beatlelinks.net/ubb/smilies/thumbsup2.gif">  Cuz I don't believe in memorizing the bible and don't do the words. In the past, all my friends memorize the verses by hard that they can just quote without opening up the bible.  I couldn't do that.  I just couldn't bring myself to do that, cuz I don't agree with that at all.<br><br>It's ok that you don't agree with certain things in the Catholic Church.  I don't either.  Eg.  they not allowing female priests and certain abortion issues.  Nevertheless, I still respect the Church's decisions and stand in these issues, instead of opposing and criticising the church (I just dun want to be another hero wannabe like Martin Luther).<br><br>It is sad that some pastors are simply jealous of the Catholic Church to the extent of making up or distorting church history and brainwashing their members.  I went thru that before.  They could even lie about the Protestant Church being the apostolic church while the Catholics were the one who broke away from the main stream.<br><br>Many choose to avoid doing charities by quoting verses from the bible that says "Faith alone will lead you to heaven".  They conveniently ignore what St James said.  But the Catholic Church emphaisize a lot on that.  That's why you see around the world, there are so many orphanages, and homes that were opened by the Catholics.<br><br>I am really touched by the way of the Catholic Church.  It is thru the works that I understand the bible better, instead of forcing myself to memorize every single word in the scripture.<br><br>Last time, I was a fervent Protestants who supported all the christian rallies.  But one fine day, I attended one near Chinatown and the pastor (an ex taoist/buddhist) spent the whole night criticising other religions.  That was the very last time I supported such event and one year later, I made my own way to the Catholic Church, without anyone bringing me there.  I walked to the Catholic Church nearest to my old place to attend Mass.  After a few months, I went straight to the Priest to ask him for help as I wanted to receive the Confirmation.</div>

Lets say u ask wat cause the big bang. Some scientist believe in explosion of a primeval atom tat created it. Tat if u ask wat create the explosion of a primeval atom, lets say u get the answer to be "bla bla bla" and if u keep on asking, u will reach the conclusion tat everything is created out of nothing. Wat do u think the end answer for it all will be then ?<br><br><blockquote>not evolution, if man really come from apes... WHY then, there are still so many monkeys, gorrilas, orang utans, and chimpanzees around? </blockquote>tis has been answered for probably a few hundred times here. If u want the answer to everything about evolution and creation, u can refer to the past threads in here.<br><br><blockquote>Charles Darwin, who wrote the evolution theory believed in God before he died. and said all that he written are false theories. </blockquote>The Darwin deathbed story is false. And in any case, it is irrelevant. A scientific theory stands or falls according to how well it is supported by the facts, not according to who believes it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Shortly after his death, Lady Hope addressed a gathering of young men and women at the educational establishment founded by the evangelist Dwight Lyman Moody at Northfield, Massachusetts. She had, she maintained, visited Darwin on his deathbed. He had been reading the Epistle to the Hebrews, had asked for the local Sunday school to sing in a summerhouse on the grounds, and had confessed: "How I wish I had not expressed my theory of evolution as I have done." He went on, she said, to say that he would like her to gather a congregation since he "would like to speak to them of Christ Jesus and His salvation, being in a state where he was eagerly savouring the heavenly anticipation of bliss."<br><br>With Moody's encouragement, Lady Hope's story was printed in the Boston Watchman Examiner. The story spread, and the claims were republished as late as October 1955 in the Reformation Review and in the Monthly Record of the Free Church of Scotland in February 1957. These attempts to fudge Darwin's story had already been exposed for what they were, first by his daughter Henrietta after they had been revived in 1922. "I was present at his deathbed," she wrote in the Christian for February 23, 1922. "Lady Hope was not present during his last illness, or any illness. I believe he never even saw her, but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief. He never recanted any of his scientific views, either then or earlier.

Not really a "torture chamber". </blockquote>I can certainly find many verse in relevation tat states tat hell is a fiery lake where they keep the devil and demons etc. So hell is a holiday inn ?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i did explain about the dangers of taking the Bible out of context. would you compare Adolf Hitler to Julius Caesar? Different times, different scenarios. And things would be done very differently. For example, in Exodus, the LORD God made Isaac's wife appear before Abraham's servant as a lady drawing water out of a well. It might form the bedrock for today's romantic relationships where we may believe that God has chosen a partner to complement us. But does that mean we need to go scoping for every lady near a well? Here, you are referring to the book of Deutronomy. If you were to look at the NT with a fresh perspective, you might notice Jesus Christ did no such things? Who came later? Jesus. At a different time. Because times had changed. </blockquote>So the bible has an expiry date ? It is only relevant from year 1 to 2000, then it need another revision ? As said before even Jesus say tat every word of the OT remains relevant after him. and it will remain relevant forever<br><br>Matthew 5:18<br>'In truth I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even the smallest stroke of a letter will pass away from the Law.'I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven<br><br>Jesus did no such things, but he say tat the laws is still valid. They r at different times but jesus say tat it is forever. So why isn't the book of detronomy valid ?<br><br><blockquote>why refer to OT? OT is irrelevant because Jesus did not exist then. Not joking here. For example, consider our laws? During the time of the British, there were many laws regarding the usage of horses (obviously no motorcars then). All these laws no longer exist. Would you say we reinstate them and make them applicable to all recreational horses (i.e. the ones at the Turf Club)? hope u get to see my idea here. Even during the OT times, the priests can't even harm Jesus. Why? Thou shalt not murder were one of the commandments Moses brougt down! </blockquote>Frankly, if there is no OT, Jesus can be consider as a lier since it is the OT tat says a messiah will appears. Even jesus says tat OT is relevant. Thou shall not murder, but in the OT there r a lot of death penalties such as stoning women.<br><br><blockquote>Err, if you dun acknowledge God exists. Your soul go to a place where there is no God. I would not bother describing that place for I have acknowledged Him, and that knowledge would be irrelevant. The place is described in the Bible anyway... i think its called limbo according to catechism. Its a place where there is an absence of God. </blockquote>I thought limbo is for un-baptise children tat die ? BTW limbo isn't suppose to be much better than hell  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>If you do acknowlegde God exists... you have a heavy responsibility already for you are expected to live a life worthy of Him for when you come before Him, you will be judged. By not who you are. But of your faith. A lackluster faith leads to impurity in the heart. For Jesus warned that there were some He would not acknowledge despite their proclaimations of faith. </blockquote>actually why don't u ask yourself whether does it make sense to judge people by faith and not by actions. I mean he dissappear, hide in such a way tat u can not have concrete reasons to believe in him and then punish u for not beliving in it ?<br><br><blockquote>And i think u misunderstood me. If the person does not acknowledge God, God does not exist to his knowledge, his/her soul will take up permanent residence in Limbo (IIRC). If a person acknowledges God, he/she will be weighed. He/she will have to undergo the fires of purgatory where his past deeds will be held accountable. Its a test of the purity of faith. What's good of a faith based on lip service? God is fair. I believe stongly, though a murderer may reach Heaven's door, if he's not truly repentant, he will be punished severely. Even if he's repentant, he need to make good the misdeeds he did. </blockquote>where do u read tat non-believers go to limbo ?<br><br><blockquote>God is perfect! God never changes! But we do! Our world changes! Our status quo keeps changing! Thats why Heaven is paradise because there is true happiness and its constant! I mean during Moses' time, a burning bush would be considered something miraculous... but that effect would be lost on us today? Even so, our hazy skies would hide the star that led the 3 wise men to a lowly manger one clear night? Its us who change. God accomodates us by making His laws all the more clear to us for us to understand His laws in out current culture and timeframe better</blockquote>The OT say tat its teaching is timeless. The NT say tat OT is still relevant. Then u tell me tat times have changed and god have to keep up with the changes. Then isn't tat rebuking the whole bible ?<br><br><blockquote>err what facts did i omit? everyone DURING and AFTER Jesus' time, MUST believe in Jesus to be saved. For He paid the ultimate price.... to die for our sins. There is a distinction made between unbelievers and people who have not heard of Jesus Christ. unbelievers are those who do have a choice to believe in Jesus Christ! but they intentionally refuse it. those people who are unaware of Jesus like people in remote areas... God did send missionaries to spread His word. He cared! However the Bible does not mention about those who unfortuately do not hear the word of the LORD... thats for the missionaries and we Christians to answer to God </blockquote>And wat happen to the people before jesus ? Why do the people who had heard of jesus yet do not believe in him had to go to hell ? Wat happen to the people who had not heard of jesus ?<br><br><blockquote>Unfortunate. But does it mean they'll go to Hell? But if you are holding the Bible.... would a section on what would happen to those who do not hear the Bible be irrelevant? </blockquote>wat happen to them ? Sorry I don't really get u<br><br><blockquote>I don't think ntu_slacker is saying that the OT is irrelevant. I think the issue is to respond to another writer's regular reference to OT's law. In that sense, it is irrelevant because the laws in the OT is no longer relevant to us in a practical sense.</blockquote>why is the OT not relevant in a practical sense when the bible says it is ?<br><br><blockquote>And IMHO, most of the things in the OT ARE now made irrelevant by the arrival of Jesus Christ. And Jesus did not just do away the OT, He brought it out of mothballs and breathed new Life into God's Word. The Bible was no longer God-inspired or records of the saints of old (some may argue Abaraham, Moses etc arent saints but u get the idea)... but a real life account of the life of the people living with the Son of God.</blockquote>As said before, jesus say tat the old laws of OT r relevant. Every stroke of it is approved by him himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Com'on man... throughout all the stories in the bible, it had told believers to treat god as though he is his master. Adam was God's gardener, Abel and Cain have to offer things to them, if one offer the wrongs things he got cursed, the people in noah's time died simply because they do't look good inhis eyes, tower of babel destroyed because he do not want men to be united, led the people in Moses time in circles just because they made a golden cow, job was described as being good to god because he kept singing his praise and treat himself as a humble slave towards him and even jesus use a parable to describe god as a harsh king. U have to obey god as though u r a slave. Even in the above, the bottomline is tat christian have to obey god as though they r slaves.<br></blockquote>Of, course God must be treated as he is master. But that treatment is out of love. Jesus used harsh parables for emphasis. The bottomline is that true Christians obey God out of love.<br><br><blockquote><br>Loving god is different from loving your neighbour. U have to fulfil both parts in order to follow jesus<br></blockquote>Through loving your neighbour you express love for God, thus both parts are fufiled.<br><br><blockquote><br>So in short after all these nonsense u agree tat non-believers go to hell ecause they do not obey the 10 commandments and they do not have any relationship with god.<br></blockquote>Well, I didn't expect this from you to claim that this is nonsense. I've never insulted  any of the reasons you give as nonsensical.<br><br>In short, I believe this:<br>1.For non-believers they fufill the two commendmants when  they love thier neighbour thereby obeying all 10 commendmants. Hence they are eligible for heaven.<br><br>2. More , importantly, even a Christian which means both faith(prerequiste) and faith inspired works, who has led the best possible life is only saved,by the grace of God.<br><br><blockquote><br>Loving god is different from loving your neighbour since, as said before they r totally different. Being good to neighbour is being good to the people around u, tat is mainly doing good deeds. Being good to god is by obeying and having some relationship with god. It is 2 criteria. People can be good to other people simply because they believe in other god, and tat breaks the 10 commandments.<br></blockquote>Love for God can be expressed in loving one's neighbour. There is a vast difference between <strong>being loving</strong> and <strong>being good.</strong> People cannot love and break the 10 commandments at the same time.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>allow me to interrupt.  it serves no purpose going at it point by point.  there are in total over 400 commandments from GOD.  not just the 10 that most people know.<br></div>
