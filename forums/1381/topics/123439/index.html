The Law written in their hearts is the knowledge of right and wrong. Perhaps God's judgment of those without a proper knowledge of Him is included there where it says that they will be judged according to their own consciences that "bear witness, and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them." All I know is that God will do what is right and the only way to have your sins forgiven is through Jesus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>A non-Christian who was unable to accept Christ because nobody prayed for him, nor bothered to share with him about Christ, is excused. He can go to heaven, provided he tries to live a good life the best way he knows of. </blockquote>okie, I read the bible and nowhere in it does it give tis idea. I have read about the white throne judgement and the phase tat "the only way to heaven is through christ and also comments tat no men can go to heaven without christ since all men r borned guilty etc. So pardon me for asking where do u get the above conclusion ?<br><br><blockquote>MAN A is a someone who does alot of good deeds but refuse to receive Christ.<br>MAN B is a murderer, rapist and arsonist who decides to receive Christ. </blockquote>wat about man a do a lot of good deeds and no one knows ? Wat if man b commit murder and nobody knows as well ?<br><br><blockquote>So, just as this while are living, we are given rewards and punishments according to the laws of this world, so are there 'laws' or 'criteria' to grant us "entry" to heaven.<br><br>And the only 'criteria'? To accept Jesus as Lord and Saviour. </blockquote>if u ask me, tis doesn't really help in making the people do good deeds. If according to your laws, then it is really true tat hitler like christian can go to heaven and mother theresa like buddhist will go to hell. Christian can really go around killing people or do anything they want as long as they believe in jesus.<br><br><blockquote>If Jesus is real, you would go to heaven as Jesus promised.<br><br>If Jesus is fake, do you have anything to lose?<br><br>Having said that, I am not asking people to "PLAY SAFE". What I am saying is give Jesus a chance. He will show you He is real when you accept Him. If down the road, you really really think that this Jesus thingy is a load of crap, then just heck it and leave. It is easy if you think that Jesus is fake. But my challenge to my friends is, but what if what Jesus had been preaching is true?</blockquote>if buddhist is real then u can have a chance to obtain nirvana<br><br>if he is fake, u have nothing to lose.<br><br>However there r probably many religions in the world and I guess no one can afford to make so much mistakes in their life (if only one is true). U join A, and they tell u u will go to heaven if u believe in them. U see B they also say the same thing. Isn't it better to choose the "right" one to go from the start ? My advice is to scan through the events they depict and whether does it make sense to u. If u join too hastily u may end up brainwashed like the people who had joined cults. BTW, if muslims is true, then all christians is gonna suffer forever in a horrible way<br><br><blockquote>It is never okay to use God's name in vain and use it for their own selfish motives.

It will not be a surprise if the reader of the scripture interpretes tat fighting "just" wars r accepted.<br><br></div>
