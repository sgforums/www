However I think for most Christians, it is the acknowledgement that there is a God, and this God took the form of a man to be punished for the sins of mankind. The issue of the eternal life is a by-product of this acknowledgement. Sometime or other we all die, so there is no issue on death in itself. It is what comes after death that is the big question mark. We believe that there is a hell and there is a heaven. Either way, a person's soul continues on forever, so in that sense, either way, there is no "death".<br>I quite like the way heaven and hell is portrayed in the movie "Constantine"...</div>

Your question may be a contradiction in itself because you seem to acknowledge that God created man but is saying that he has an ulterior motive to do so. I think one should assume that the Bible is the world of God or it is not. There is no in-between. The reason is simple: who can tell which verse is true and which verse is not?<br><br>Religion has existed since the beginning of time and Christianity is not even the oldest. One might as well question why the ancient Greeks, Romans and even Chinese practice polytheism. There is probably a good reason why religions started and one way or other, it has remained relevant to those who embraces such religion. Of course, to anyone else, it might be foolish to do so.<br><br>The visual picture of Christianity is influenced both by Biblical teaches as well as traditions handled down through generations. Sometimes such views evolve sometimes it does not. One interesting view is the visual image of Jesus. Traditionally, Jesus is pictured to be white man, pale complexion, long face and wavy hair. Note that the Bible never described Jesus' physical features. Any images that we have came from some renaissance paintings done in Europe, hence the European features. It is more likely that Jesus is dark skinned, rough and wrinkled complexion (due to the sun and sand environment), and probably rounder face (most Jewish man at the time is like that). So, does understanding this invalidate the Bible? Probably not.<br><br>There are many opinions on the story of Creation found in Genesis. The absolute view is that everything happened as written. The philosophical view is that the ideology or message is more important that the details. So does this invalidate the Bible? Not to me... Because Genesis is not meant to be read as a history book. Other books not to be read as a history book: Song of Solomon and in my opinion, Job. I will be happy to discuss with you further on how the Bible is to be read.

At the most he justified his actions at certain moments by drawing parrells with Christian literature. After he came to power he closed down Christian churchs and set up his own church.<br><br>But more importantly, if someone claims he is doing for God, then:<br>The action cannot contradict the commandment of loving one's neighbour, if it does that person certainly is not doing it for God.<br><br></div>

But it does strike me strange that if you have never and don't intend to read the Bible, on what basis are you trying to understand the how Christians think? In reality, devotions and chapels in school only scrap the barrel on how one should read the Bible. But as I'd said, I respect your decision, and I was not even remotely trying to convert you, it's just another way to exchange ideas and opinions.<br><br>Your second question - you know, that bothers me too, up to a point. I have been to quite a few Christian funerals (some are relatives) and there is very little hint of sadness in them. Sure the emotion about missing someone is present, but usually such emotions are rather subdue when compared to those of other beliefs. Obviously if the deceased is a young person, the grieve is more, the human (natural) part kicks in and grieve sets in. But usually after everything is over, the feeling and comfort of the assurance that the loved ones is in paradise brings peace to the grieving. My own grandfather died of cancer. On his death bed, he has this peace and smile that I can still remember after more than 10 yrs. He was not able to talk, but his hands moved and made the symbol of wings and smiled at me. He seemed to be telling me that that very night, he will die. And he did. Was I sad, sure, I loved my grandpa very much, and I missed him Was I glad, yes, because according to the Christian belief, he went to heaven....<br><br>It would have been exceeding insensitive to have a party at a funeral, even though we are assured of our salvation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed, you can see the differences in the explanantion of SingaporeMacross as compared to the others in this thread. The teaching of the Catholic is really not of the Bible. I think majority of fundamental christians are holding their breath on the appointment of the next pope because he may be the false prohphet of the Antichrist which will bring the religions of the world together. The Harlot riding the Beast is almost clear now.<br><br>As for predestinantion, it is mentioned in the bible in Ephesians 1:4-12. Many people, and even christians, have difficulty accepting these verses. I think Chin Eng can do a good job to explain this.<br><br>I can answer some questions mentioned here. But foremostly, I must declare that my answer is coming from the angle of a fundamental Presbyterian. others may vary:<br><br>1. Will a man be in heaven even though if he has never heard the gospel or know about the existance of God.<br>Ans: No.<br><br>2. Will a man, who committed the most serious crimes, enter heaven when he dies.<br>Ans. No. Unless!...he repent of his sins and allow the Lord Jesus to come into his heart, then will he be saved. Something like this happened in US a few years ago. There was this prostitute who was sentenced to death for killing 8-9 men that she engaged by the road side. While in prison, she heard the gospel and the way to salvation and it touched her heart greatly. A few hours before the fatal needle, she confessed and repented of all of her sins and the great burden in her heart was lifted and knew at that moment that she will see her Saviour in heaven after she died. She took the needle while singing a hymn she learnt in the prison.<br><br></div>

Many charismatic churches only teach about God's love and love and love and love. But the most fundamental of God's characteristics is the Christian God is a God of Judgement and Covenant.<br><br>There are many christians that lead a very sinful life but yet they say "God is loving, He will forgive me." Of course that is true, but they should also remember that that, "Yes, God will forgive me if i really confess and repent my sins, but i will also receive my judgement from God in due time."</div>
