How do u encapsulate tat into loving your neighbour ? Personally i see nothing about loving neighbours to keeping the sabbath day holy<br></blockquote>err Jesus didnt only say "Love your neighbor". In the parable of the Good Samaritan, a teacher of the law asked Jesus for what God wanted of us in order to be born into eternal life. The man said "`You must love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul. Love him with all your power, and love him with all your mind. And you must love your neighbour as you love yourself.'" but was puzzled who was his neighbor. Our neighbors, in the Christian context, are all of mankind. You even. Even Saddam Hussien, Osama etc. its a tough choice but note in Jesus parable, He deliberately used the context of a Samaritan helping a Jew (?) for during that time there were *lots* of bad blood between these two.<br><br>to sum up,<br><br>" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." (Matthew 22:37-40 NIV)<br><br>we can never take God's word for granted and therefore should not quote them piecemeal. always consider the context of the situation.<br><br>thanks and god bless!</div>

Shit happens when we try to play God. Don't you feel that you are judging other people by over generalising them as immoral, filthy, pagans? First and foremost, Jesus taught us NEVER to judge,<br><br>The Jews might be justified when they wanted to kill Jesus to preserve the sancity of God's name. But did they? I tell you, those Jewish priests were overly concerned with their high position and society... and too terrified to consider the prospect that God is now opening up and becoming a free for all. The Jewish people simply acted out of blatant selfishness and arrogance. Various examples i can cite include the blissful ignorance of the poor and needy while living in ivory towers, trying to entrap Jesus, denouncing a man of true faith and SIGNS/MIRACLES which they are unable to duplicate. What Jesus felt was those Jewish elders were too concerned about tradition rather than the reason/heart behind it or to put it succintly, the right thing to do.<br><br>I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).<br><br>Did it says that coming to the Father means entering Heaven and basking there? Jesus had warned us on several occassions that when we come before the Father Himself, we will be weighed. I believe in Purgatory despite being a Methodist. There will be a time when we have to atone for our venial sins (not mortal meaning sins that do not go against the concept of pro-life)<br><br>concerning Deutronomy, i suggest taking the Bible in chronological order... as in New Testament after the Old. just IMHO... because i feel that God has softened substantially after He sent His only begotten Son for us to die for our sins. He would never like to see us destroy ourselves but help ourselves be what we truly are meant to be. And when Jesus was on Earth, he did not destroy anyone! Even the false prophets who denounced His divine powers as of Satan's were rebuked. That was the very most Jesus did.<br><br>again, Jesus said these very words,<br>I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).<br><br>because he was speaking to a crowd gathering around him. Would you think people in the crowd would dismiss him as a raving lunatic if He were to say things like "But those people who havent heard of me - this is what will happen to them". Jesus is always to the point. And He did have the uncanny ability to communicate. I think it would be irrelevant to Him to include people not in his listening audience. It was in His priority to save people who saw, talked, ate, interacted with Him.<br><br>When Jesus was crucified, and suffered and finally died... During Pentecost, if im not wrong, He appeared before all His disciples and urged them to go forth and spread the word. It brought the wave of the Christianity we know of today... our knowledge of our salvation has been brought to us by the missionaries. and the missionaries did not just stay in one capital and just sent out pigeons, telegrams, tv broadcasts... but instead "WENT FORTH" and "SPREAD THE GOSPEL" for we now were guided by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>hope these helps, SIS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>god bless and have a great day!</div>

Personally i see nothing about loving neighbours to keeping the sabbath day holy<br></blockquote>Belief in God is not the mere acknowledgement of GodÂ’s existence. It is to follow the commandments of God and the commandments of God, to put it simply, is to love as Jesus said.<br><br><blockquote><br>Tat is strange, I thought the laws apply to all christians.

In tat case when jesus appear to the jews, they really r right to kill him since he is really telling of a completely different version of god.<br></blockquote>I think you have misunderstood what I stated. So let us take a look at it again:<br><br>Â“If you hear it said about one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you to live in 13 that wicked men have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods" (gods you have not known), 14 then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among youÂ”<br><br>This passage first and foremost talks about a group from the Israelites to whom God revealed himself to going against him. And on top of breaking a commandment made known to them about not worshiping false gods, they lead other Israelites to do the same.<br><br>For Christians, the same would apply. Any baptised Christian knowing this commandment of God and breaking it does the same thing as what the Israelites did. So yes it applies to Christians as well.<br><br><blockquote><br>then how about tis verse<br><br>I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).<br><br>so we forsake tis verse from jesus himself ?<br></blockquote>What does it mean to follow this way and truth of Jesus? It comes back to obeying  JesusÂ’ commandment to love.<br><br></div>

In the parable of the Good Samaritan, a teacher of the law asked Jesus for what God wanted of us in order to be born into eternal life. The man said "`You must love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul. Love him with all your power, and love him with all your mind. And you must love your neighbour as you love yourself.'" but was puzzled who was his neighbor. Our neighbors, in the Christian context, are all of mankind. You even. Even Saddam Hussien, Osama etc. its a tough choice but note in Jesus parable, He deliberately used the context of a Samaritan helping a Jew (?) for during that time there were *lots* of bad blood between these two. </blockquote>do u show love to your neighbour when he send people to hell ? Probably all muslim, taoist hindis goes to hell if christianity is right. Tat isn't very loving if u ask me.

If u want u can probably hear many touching stories tat speaks of being fillial etc if u read these stories as well.<br><br><blockquote>gosh. thats too extreme. the thoughts you have about killing people, burning all their possessions... thats too extreme. Shit happens when we try to play God. Don't you feel that you are judging other people by over generalising them as immoral, filthy, pagans?

U ask people not to judge, but the law clearly ask people to judge people. So how can one keep both verses true at the same time ?<br><br><blockquote>The Jews might be justified when they wanted to kill Jesus to preserve the sancity of God's name. But did they? I tell you, those Jewish priests were overly concerned with their high position and society... and too terrified to consider the prospect that God is now opening up and becoming a free for all. The Jewish people simply acted out of blatant selfishness and arrogance. Various examples i can cite include the blissful ignorance of the poor and needy while living in ivory towers, trying to entrap Jesus, denouncing a man of true faith and SIGNS/MIRACLES which they are unable to duplicate. What Jesus felt was those Jewish elders were too concerned about tradition rather than the reason/heart behind it or to put it succintly, the right thing to do. </blockquote>if u just read the OT, they already provided ample laws to kill jesus. They tell them to kill off any person who claim they r prophets and lead the people to other religion, which jesus truly does. U say they r selfish etc, tat is because u do not choose to see the picture from the other side of the story. Why don't u answer according to the OT at tat time, does the priests have the right to kill jesus ?<br><br><blockquote>Did it says that coming to the Father means entering Heaven and basking there? Jesus had warned us on several occassions that when we come before the Father Himself, we will be weighed. I believe in Purgatory despite being a Methodist.

He would never like to see us destroy ourselves but help ourselves be what we truly are meant to be. And when Jesus was on Earth, he did not destroy anyone! Even the false prophets who denounced His divine powers as of Satan's were rebuked. That was the very most Jesus did. </blockquote>Isn't god perfect and don't change with time ?

It was in His priority to save people who saw, talked, ate, interacted with Him. </blockquote>U can omit facts but u can't state something which is wrong.
