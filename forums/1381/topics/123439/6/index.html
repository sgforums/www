            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>do u show love to your neighbour when he send people to hell ? Probably all muslim, taoist hindis goes to hell if christianity is right. Tat isn't very loving if u ask me. U show me tis parable for wat Rolling Eyes</blockquote>err  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  first i show u this parable cos earlier on u said<br><br>stupidissmart:<br><blockquote>Personally i see nothing about loving neighbours to keeping the sabbath day holy </blockquote>Jesus commanded us to love God AND our neighbors. Two commandments. Not just one. And loving our neighbours is out of obedience and love of God. So the second <strong>can</strong> encapsulate it.<br><br>Can i ask you where in the Bible it states that God will send other religions to Hell? Is Hell even a place to speak of? Hell is merely the absence of God and Jesus Christ. How do you even reach Heaven if you refuse to acknowledge it exists? Even Jesus Christ explains that Hell is the absence of joy and happiness. Not really a "torture chamber".<br><br>And furthermore, we are not God. Why do you wish to use our yardstick as a mere mortal to judge someone who we Christians can't even describe in tangible wordly terms?<br><br><blockquote>if u ask me, u just see only the verses which u agree and totally ignore the other parts of the bible. Frankly if u read the quran, hindu, buddhist scripture and consider only the things tat made sense to u, they too will sound good. If u want u can probably hear many touching stories tat speaks of being fillial etc if u read these stories as well.</blockquote>honestly i feel insulted. i believe in the entire Bible. its the word of God. and may i know why i do give you the impression that i ignore parts of the Bible? i may hear stories, real life accounts, touching stories, and they are proof to me there are some good in this world. Sometimes the Holy Spirit speaks to us through events, works, and even in the most adverse of situations!<br><br><blockquote>Tat is extreme right ? U don't have to blame me for it, it is written in the bible as such. I didn't write tat verse down. U ask people not to judge, but the law clearly ask people to judge people. So how can one keep both verses true at the same time ? </blockquote>i did explain about the dangers of taking the Bible out of context. would you compare Adolf Hitler to Julius Caesar? Different times, different scenarios. And things would be done very differently. For example, in Exodus, the LORD God made Isaac's wife appear before Abraham's servant as a lady drawing water out of a well. It might form the bedrock for today's romantic relationships where we may believe that God has chosen a partner to complement us. But does that mean we need to go scoping for every lady near a well? Here, you are referring to the book of Deutronomy. If you were to look at the NT with a fresh perspective, you might notice Jesus Christ did no such things? Who came later? Jesus. At a different time. Because times had changed.<br><br><blockquote>if u just read the OT, they already provided ample laws to kill jesus. They tell them to kill off any person who claim they r prophets and lead the people to other religion, which jesus truly does. U say they r selfish etc, tat is because u do not choose to see the picture from the other side of the story. Why don't u answer according to the OT at tat time, does the priests have the right to kill jesus ? </blockquote>why refer to OT? OT is irrelevant because Jesus did not exist then. Not joking here. For example, consider our laws? During the time of the British, there were many laws regarding the usage of horses (obviously no motorcars then). All these laws no longer exist. Would you say we reinstate them and make them applicable to all recreational horses (i.e. the ones at the Turf Club)? hope u get to see my idea here.  Even during the OT times, the priests can't even harm Jesus. Why? Thou shalt not murder were one of the commandments Moses brougt down!<br><br><blockquote>why not ? Rolling Eyes U mean the person who cannot go to his "father" can stay in heaven with him ? </blockquote>Err, if you dun acknowledge God exists. Your soul go to a place where there is no God. I would not bother describing that place for I have acknowledged Him, and that knowledge would be irrelevant. The place is described in the Bible anyway... i think its called limbo according to catechism. Its a place where there is an absence of God.<br><br>If you do acknowlegde God exists... you have a heavy responsibility already for you are expected to live a life worthy of Him for when you come before Him, you will be judged. By not who you are. But of your faith. A lackluster faith leads to impurity in the heart. For Jesus warned that there were some He would not acknowledge despite their proclaimations of faith.<br><br>And i think u misunderstood me. If the person does not acknowledge God, God does not exist to his knowledge, his/her soul will take up permanent residence in Limbo (IIRC).  If a person acknowledges God, he/she will be weighed. He/she will have to undergo the fires of purgatory where his past deeds will be held accountable. Its a test of the purity of faith. What's good of a faith based on lip service? God is fair. I believe stongly, though a murderer may reach Heaven's door, if he's not truly repentant, he will be punished severely. Even if he's repentant, he need to make good the misdeeds he did.<br><br><blockquote>Isn't god perfect and don't change with time ? So the other people who had lived in the harsh laws of OT victims ? </blockquote>God is perfect! God never changes! But we do! Our world changes! Our status quo keeps changing! Thats why Heaven is paradise because there is true happiness and its constant! I mean during Moses' time, a burning bush would be considered something miraculous... but that effect would be lost on us today? Even so, our hazy skies would hide the star that led the 3 wise men to a lowly manger one clear night? Its us who change. God accomodates us by making His laws all the more clear to us for us to understand His laws in out current culture and timeframe better</div>

If everyone can be saved regardless of whether he believe in him or not, he shouldn't tell people tat only people who believe in him can be saved. Isn't tat lying ? </blockquote>err what facts did i omit? everyone DURING and AFTER Jesus' time, MUST believe in Jesus to be saved. For He paid the ultimate price.... to die for our sins. There is a distinction made between unbelievers and people who have not heard of Jesus Christ. unbelievers are those who do have a choice to believe in Jesus Christ! but they intentionally refuse it. those people who are unaware of Jesus like people in remote areas... God did send missionaries to spread His word. He cared! However the Bible does not mention about those who unfortuately do not hear the word of the LORD... thats for the missionaries and we Christians to answer to God<br><br>Unfortunate. But does it mean they'll go to Hell? But if you are holding the Bible.... would a section on what would happen to those who do not hear the Bible be irrelevant?<br><br>my evidence He cared for everyone... and really wanted those who were unaware of Him to accept Him... thats my point, sis<br><br><blockquote><br>quote:When Jesus was crucified, and suffered and finally died... During Pentecost, if im not wrong, He appeared before all His disciples and urged them to go forth and spread the word. It brought the wave of the Christianity we know of today... our knowledge of our salvation has been brought to us by the missionaries. and the missionaries did not just stay in one capital and just sent out pigeons, telegrams, tv broadcasts... but instead "WENT FORTH" and "SPREAD THE GOSPEL" for we now were guided by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>And the point is ?<br></blockquote></div>

The Catholic Church has, on the other hand, given me a perceptivity of what the bible teaches : Love and Peace.<br><br>What also touches me about the Catholic Church is the way they address the Protestant Church.  In some sermons, the Priests will refer to them as "Our Seperated Brothers".  This loving name for the Protestants was advocated by none other than our late Pope John Paul II.</div>
