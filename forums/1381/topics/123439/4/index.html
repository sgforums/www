Those Christians that you have seen are the reason why others here in the forum call Christian hypocrites.<br><br>Many so called "Christians" continue to lead life that are surrounded by smoking, drinking, cursing, swearing, lying, clubbing, pre-marital sex etc. We don't know if they are truely saved. Only when they meet God one day, and if God tells them "I do not know thee. Thy name is not in the Book of Life." then shall we know the truth.<br><br>One thing is for sure, that you know someone is truely saved is when he/she is changing their lives, turning away from their vices. Christians will never be sinless but Christians must sin less.</div>

Who in this group actively attempt to live the Christian life and who does not, is not something that others CAN prove or question. For advice here is, why not focus on those who live their life in an exemplary manner and disregard those who do not.

Some people pretend to be righteous and engage in endless religious debate on the superiority of their faith. I really do not see the need to go that way. At the end of the day, only upon our death then can our belief can be proven. At that point, there is no one to verify that one is correct or wrong - except God himself, assuming He exist. For me, I have chosen to believe he exist, and what I believe, I believe to be true. That being the case, to me, then I will try very hard to lead my life worthy of that belief.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">it is needless to criticise other religion.

The only group(s) of people I may be more vocal on are: people in my own faith that skew our (Christian) core beliefs to suit their personal agenda, and people (including Christians) who take potshots at other faiths. I do not even agree with people who whacks Catholics (BTW, I am not a Catholic). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Christianity NOT about the self-righteous or the holier-than-thous, it's about the constant struggle to live a life that is worthy to be a child of God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Huh ?!?! Wat do u mean ? So is the 10 commandments wrong ? God had given the message to moses isn't it ? So christian should ignore the teachings in the OT completely ? How do u encapsulate "u can only believe in one god" and "remember the sabbath day and keep it holy" to loving your neighbour ?<br></blockquote>I brought up the 10 commandments because you made a refrence to the commandment of "Believing only in 1 God". This commandment was for Israel who God revealed Himself to. For Christians the same would apply.<br><br>The NT's commandment of loving one's neighbour encapsulates the OT in the sense, that if you follow the 10 commandments you are follwing Jesus's commandment to love one's neighbour and vice-versa. Take for example from the 10 commandment:<br>not to bear false witness against your neighbour.<br>By not bearing false witness you love your neighbour.<br><br><blockquote><br>Okie, than how about tis Deuteronomy 13<br><br>If you hear it said about one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you to live in 13 <strong>that wicked men have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods" </strong>(gods you have not known), 14 then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you<br></blockquote>I highlighted the line that says "wicked men among you". These wicked men are from the tribes of Israel, therefore they have recived the commandment not to worship any God except the Lord Himself and yet they go against it. It is not so much about non-believers as it is about people to God revealed Himself to going against Him.</div>

However, as i made myself clear before, i am not a opportunist who takes potshot at Roman Catholics because i am in no position to judge the individuals.
