Here the concept of god was based on fear, as they are unable to understand these are not acts of god, but natural phenomenon.</p></div>

              <p>but why is god so cruel as people sacrisfise lambs, sheeps and something even human beings or babies to them. this is against nature and immoral.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Long time ago, a sheep was crying and could talk when a priest was about to cut its throat to sacrifise to the so called god. The priest was alarmed and shocked that a goat can cry and talked. So the priest asked him why was he crying? The sheep said he was not sad because he was about to be sacrifised. He was relieved and happy that this will be his last birth as a sheep. Many lifetimes ago he was also a priest sacrisifising sheep to the god. After he died, he was reborn as a sheep for 500 lifetimes to be sacrifised. The priest was so shocked on hearing that, as he was thinking, if I sacrifise the sheep, I will also be reborn as a sheep to be sacrifised in future rebirths. He then repented and put down the knife.</p>

              <p>in every culture and every locale, peopel worship. although they
              often do not know what they are worshiping. they is a good reason why
              they are at least making that attempt. within every person there is a
              feeling that there is some kind of higher being over him. that is call
              conscience. God gave man conscience so that we can tell right from
              wrong. animals do not have conscience, they do not know whether wrong
              is done to them or not. you don't see animals worshiping God, they
              don't have a moral standard. why are human rights are so important
              around the world? why do people all around the world have a standard
              moral code that is so similar? this is an innate knowlege of right and
              wrong called conscience that is given to man. conscience of knowing
              that there is a God when we see his creation, while this isn't the only
              way how God reveal Himself to us.</p>
              <p>in acts 17, when Paul arrived in Athens, he noticed the city was full of idols.</p>
              <p><em>Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For
              as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I
              even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what
              you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. Acts17:22-23</em></p>
              <p>the

              <p>I dun want to go further with you on your religion. I just dun accept the creationist paradigm because its create blind faith. All you need to do is to believe in god, blah blah blah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to me, science revealed far lot than the bible. I know that lightning is not acts of god to punish me. earthquakes is the movement of tectonic plates movements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not saying religion is no good, but science really dispel so many myths. do the ancient people given the benefit of the doubt? no, they were equally as ignorant as society and technology then were not advanced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, this world has known so many god religions in the past, present and future, whether there is one god or many gods, they exists in every cultures. Do you know that there are some 300 plus god religions in India alone. </p>

              <p>ok let's not debate, but have you ever wonder where will you be after you die? is it really over after this life? can science prove that? you don't have to tell me but please have a thought about this. it might not be an important matter for some, but if you value your own soul you might want to think about this.</p>

              <p>ok let's not debate, but have you ever wonder where will you be after you die? is it really over after this life? can science prove that? you don't have to tell me but please have a thought about this. it might not be an important matter for some, but if you value your own soul you might want to think about this.</p>

              <p>for ur info, science is investigating and collating on evidence on rebirths for the past 20 years or longer. does that answer your questions on afterlife.</p>
              <p>I have my views on afterlife, thank you. I know some of the religions in this world, like Hinduism, Buddhism,Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Bhagavad Gita. I suggest you go read up a little bit about them to gain an understanding, the gist of it will do, so I do know what I am talking about.</p>
              <p>PS: Pls dun go around and tell other people you are worshipping wood, gold, satanic or whatever, like some of your overzealous believer does, or telling non believers you are going to hell. How would you feel if other faiths were to preach to you in the street according to their faiths.</p>

              <p>i know where you are coming from. before i am a christian, i was an atheist, a hardcore science freak, i hated christianity because they thought that this is the only religion that can save, superior or whatever. well i also studied all other religion, i thirst for the truth and had the hunger to seek after it. finally i came to a conclusion that there is truly no other who can save other than Jesus. how did i come to the conclusion, it's a long story... but i can understand how you felt too as that's where i came from as well. hell i was an even worst non believer for i had cursed God and yes i even worshiped satan directly. was in a black metal band which glorifies the devil, sex, violence and rape. i did all sorts of nonsence.</p>
              <p>but in the end we all have to make the decision. i wasn't forced, i humbly made mine. it wasn't an easy desicion for me, i have to leave my old friends and my old life and by the grace of God i made it. in that time i met alot of overzealous christians as well and now thinking about my past i can't believe i am a christian zealous for God too. we christians can be offending but if you give Jesus a try, let Him come into your life and you will understand why we are like that. they are bad christians but to be fair there are also good ones. </p>

              <p>i used to be an atheist and through the experience of preachers came the knowledge of such. so rather than worshiping God, i had made the foolish choice to worship satan. i had that false kind of freedom as they preaches to do what i like. well that's my past.</p>
              <p>to force means to do things against other's will. what christians do is to share the gospel to non believers, whether they want to recieve it or not is their choice. but there are also those who do things their way with "gun point", those are probably new christians who are eager to share their faith. we all make mistakes, we are not perfect.</p>

              <p>yes I do know why christians want to spread the gospel to non believers, to save them from going to eternal hell, this I know.</p>
              <p>I suggest you read about the world's major religion, so as to dispel any misconception you may have on them.</p>
              <p>I can briefly summarise for you here. all god religions are all souls, salvation thru god, heaven and hell. Taoism and Buddhism are not religions. Taoism is about yin and yang relationship, Tao (Way), tao de ching principles. Buddhism core beliefs are salvation thru self (enlightenment and Nirvana), no Self or Soulessness, rebirth etc.</p>
              <p>Hinduism also have rebirth concept, transmigration and their god.</p>
              <p>The Buddha is not a god though.</p>
              <p>As for Islam, they regard Jesus as a prophet. there are 5 pillars in Islam. They believed that Islam is a further extension of Christianity and that Prophet Mohammad is the last prophet.</p>

              Hell is God's plane just like the earth, heaven and the world of the dead.
              There is a common misconception among the general Christians and non Christians alike that hell is the place where satan and its angels reign. WRONG! Hell is the place of punishment for the damned souls and for satan and its angels. Satan and its angels can only reign in the hearts of those evil and wicked people they don't certainly own their own plane.

                                                  <p>thats the cruz of the matter, cos christians believe all the
                                                  evil were created by satan? that means no evil exists before the
                                                  betrayal, then how come Lucifer can become evil when there are no
                                                  evil that existed, thats highly illogic.</p>

              Actually it is highly logical but it's just that you fail to see it.
              And I'm a Christian and I don't believe man can make excuses of their evil ways and deeds and blame it on satan.
              The fact that man can be damned to hell is a proof that man is responsible for his own doing.

              I just would like to point out that though God reigns from heaven He is everywhere. God is in my heart as He is in yours and everyone's else. God is in everything, in the drawer, in the lunchbox, in the church hall, in the prison cell and torture chamber,  in raging seas, in quiet lakes, in the deepest valley, in the highest mountain, in the darkest forest, in the hottest desert, in the air, in every plane in every heart, in every emotion, in every desire, in every thought, in every dream, in every prayer, in every fantasy, in every lie, in every word, in each dead, in every place, in every plane, in everything living seen and unseen, in every time, in the past, in the present, in the future, in before time and in after the end of time.
              
              <br><br>
              God knows each of us MORE than we know ourselves
