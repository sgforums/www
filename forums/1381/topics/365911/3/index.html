              <p><br>Maybe you need to think deeper about the question.</p>
              <p>If that is the case then I suppose Jesus would be kind of like Mr. Rogers, your general nice guy... this is quite obviously not the case.</p>
              <p>I do not by any stretch of the imagination, think that God is safe and nice. There is a difference between being Good and being safe.</p>

              <p>this is a verse from the bible..cant remember which was that..but this is what YHWH/JHVH has said...anyone touching you is touching my eyeball..simply put..he takes it personally when his children are hurt..he doesnt just wanna try feeling the hurt..he put himself in the hurt..according to the bible..He has dealt personally with individuals..even nations...so i dont see how your comment stands in terms of biblical views..other views then anything can be said.</p>

              <p>Not all people who has a personal experience with God will
              choose to believe in God. Some people (namely me) may have receive
              dreams, visions, and even prayer answers from God and still choose
              finally to disbelieve in God in the end.</p>
              <p>For me, I think God exists. I just don't worship him. That is
              due to my belief in him as a powerful but evil god. I think he
              distorts the bible by telling the story of the bible only from his
              perspective.</p>

              <p>The thing about God in the bible is interesting as he displays emotions not unlike humans..it is because of Him thats why humans have such emos too..his righteous fury is incurred when he sees injustice..he is someone who cannot stand that..would you stand be wronged??how much more would he feel isnt it??</p>
              <p>compassionate he is..because his fury is always short..he not only is slow to anger but also easily turned away from it..even to the point of feeling regret that he had being angry..if he aint compassionate, would he had cared or felt that way??he could just destroy everything and rebuild everything again..and again..but he let our puny asses live on..</p>
              <p>the cities that were destroyed by him..well kinda deserve it..take Nineveh for example..a city of bloodshed and violence not by bible viewpoint only..but by history..</p>
