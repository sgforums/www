              God is not created. God is the creator of all things. He existed before the beginning of time and knew the very end even before time began. He knows you and me and everyone else before we are even born. He knows each of us MORE than we know ourselves. He knows EVERY detail of our life even ones that we have forgotten.

Here the concept of god was based on fear, as they are unable to understand these are not acts of god, but natural phenomenon.</p>

              <p>Not all people who has a personal experience with God will choose to believe in God. Some people (namely me) may have receive dreams, visions, and even prayer answers from God and still choose finally to disbelieve in God in the end.</p>
              <p>For me, I think God exists. I just don't worship him. That is due to my belief in him as a powerful but evil god. I think he distorts the bible by telling the story of the bible only from his perspective.</p>

              Of course but you can't deny what has been given to you. That's the only difference while most people still struggle with their faith or from time to time doubt God, few others who have personal experience with God already pass that struggle of whether God exists and alive and working though they do not know everything about God but they know and witness the fulfillment of the words that is God's promises in their life.

              <p>in every culture and every locale, peopel worship. although they often do not know what they are worshiping. they is a good reason why they are at least making that attempt. within every person there is a feeling that there is some kind of higher being over him. that is call conscience. God gave man conscience so that we can tell right from wrong. animals do not have conscience, they do not know whether wrong is done to them or not. you don't see animals worshiping God, they don't have a moral standard. why are human rights are so important around the world? why do people all around the world have a standard moral code that is so similar? this is an innate knowlege of right and wrong called conscience that is given to man. conscience of knowing that there is a God when we see his creation, while this isn't the only way how God reveal Himself to us.</p>
              <p>in acts 17, when Paul arrived in Athens, he noticed the city was full of idols.</p>
              <p><em>Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. Acts17:22-23</em></p>
              <p>the athenians had such an innate knowledge of God that along with their pagan idols they also worshiped an unknown god just to make sure no gods were missed. Paul then directed them to the one true God. they didn't have to be convinced of the existence of God.</p>
              <p><em>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. Romans 1:18-20</em></p>

              <p>have you ever felt angry because of certain injustice being done to somebody. that's a good kind of anger. you see someone get bullied you don't just go " oh, i'll be kind to let those bullies off." </p>
              <p>God the Judge of the world will see that sinners will recieve their judgement since he is just. just like a good judge in court will see that criminals will recieve their punishment since the judge is good.</p>
              <p>anger and be bad also, like murder can be a result of anger from someone lacking self contol.etc etc</p>
