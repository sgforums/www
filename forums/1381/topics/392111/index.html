              <p>Nicolas Notovitch wrote of a lama who speaks about
                  <strong>Saint Issa</strong> at the monastery.</p>
              <p>Now someone mentioned in the comment section that Jesus' name in Hebrew would be "Yehoshuah". "Yehoshuah" being translated to "Issa"...sounds unlikely isn't it? And are there other evidences to prove it other than Notovitch who claimed that a Lama showed him ancient Buddhist scripts which spoke of a Saint Issa?</p>
              <p>This kind of issue can be exploited by people as shown in your second link.</p>

              <p> Notovitch claimed to have been shown a “Life of Issa” at Hemis
              Monastery in Ladakh. It was supposed to have two volumes. <strong>It could

              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>And is this part of Jesus' life so irrelevant that the "HOLY" book of Christianity omitted it all together? Or maybe the "HOLY" men who would later compile the books chose to omit it?</p>

              <p>did you read the links carefully ? the scripture said Issa was a
              great prophet,could perform miracles and was tortured to death. how
              many prophet were there during that time ? you mean besides jesus
              christ, there was another greater man than jesus christ and like
              jesus, tortured to death ? i really don't know, so i ask you ?</p>

              <p> Notovitch claimed to have been shown a “Life of Issa” at Hemis Monastery in Ladakh. It was supposed to have two volumes. <strong>It could never be found again.</strong></p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>And is this part of Jesus' life so irrelevant that the "HOLY" book of Christianity omitted it all together? Or maybe the "HOLY" men who would later compile the books chose to omit it?</p>

              <p>i really don't know because i also just came to know about these links. the 2nd link said someone saw the evidence again of Issa in Tibet in 1938.</p>
              <p>well, the links said the life of jesus christ from age 12 to age 29 was omitted in the bible. why, i also do not know. whatever i know about the lost years of jesus christ are all from these 2 links.</p>

              <p>these 2 links said jesus traveled to india, tibet etc. to learn buddhist teachings, that is why there are many similarities between these 2 religions. i will not say is copying but rather learning. but how true, i do not know. i am just curious but not serious in finding out the truth and i think will never will. i just find them interesting.</p>

              <p>well, it is not a matter of making sense, it is the evidence that said so. if what being said was true, i will have a better opinion of jesus christ. he was indeed a great man who was humble enough to learn from others. the pastors and his followers of today have much to learn from him.</p>
              <p>instead of going round calling other religions satanic, why not be as humble as  jesus who learned the good things from others.</p>
