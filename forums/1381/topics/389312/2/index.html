              Singapore. A place bad for your soul.<br>
              Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
              <br><br>
              Truly, life in Singapore is detrimental to your spirit; if you can leave Singapore with your family, it would be the best thing you ever did, not just for yourselves but especially for your children.
              <br><br>
              Living in Singapore, one may not realize this, but any time out of Singapore would tell you this.
              <br><br>
              A life in Singapore is best described as one where you go to work and fend for your family while Lee Kuan Yew's government decides everything else for you. They build flats for you, decide where you live, what jobs you can have, what salary you will receive, whether you should be fired or employed, in other words everything; and your job is simply to go along with anything they do to you.
              <br><br>
              Even if you disagree, there is nothing you can do, since the 2 miserable opposition Members in Parliament, are in effect PAP members, out of which 82 are Lee Kuan Yew's men, and they are incapable of doing anything for you.
              <br><br>
              Fear consumes your life. If you openly criticize the government, you may be arrested or all sorts of other harm real or imaginary may befall you. This dampens your spirit, this stifles your enthusiasm and you turn yourself into a frustrated caged animal, devoid of humanity.
              <br><br>
              Your children fare no better. Terrified parents instill a similar fear in their children, fear of authority, fear to question and the necessity to conform one's actions to suit their political masters.
              <br><br>
              In the end both parent and child have deformed and maladjusted personalities, with all the goodness of humanity, courage and integrity extracted. You end up as lesser humans compared to others elsewhere in the world.
              <br><br>
              You can see this everywhere in the island. In any meeting, Singaporeans dare not publicly speak or raise questions. In school Singapore students are never seen to ask any questions or comment on anything. In a public place, if you hear a child speak to her parents, it is probably not a Singaporean child.
              <br><br>
              A Singaporean spends his entire lifetime conforming his actions and speech to what his masters want to hear. Success depends on being recognized as a conformist, not as a rebel.
              <br><br>
              And that is why Lee Kuan Yew and his friends hate Gopalan Nair. He simply refuses to be like everybody else. He is not supposed to be criticizing the judiciary, his Attorney General, his newspapers and his dictatorship. Similarly he hates Dr. Chee Soon Juan and his political party because he too refuses to conform to his liking. This sort of criticism and activism is unacceptable to him, and so he punishes us.
              <br><br>
              But the rest of the Singaporean population are not punished because they behave as expected of them, as compliant obedient souls.
              <br><br>
              This sort of living, I can tell you is bad for you and bad for your children. This submissive attitude will carry over in every other aspect of their lives anywhere else in the world. Singaporeans will not succeed in competition with an American or Australian worker with this sort of mentality. They will lack leadership qualities and most of all they will not have the human qualities that one would like a human to possess. They could of course, live as obedient sheep to serve the Lee Kuan Yew family but as human beings anywhere else in the world, they would be complete flops.
              <br><br>
              That is why Gopalan Nair is a far superior human being than the vast majority of Singaporeans who live their timid lives. Dr. Chee Soon Juan and the handful of human rights activists with him too are the exception because unlike the vast majority of Singaporeans they have integrity and courage, qualities that one admires in a human being.
              <br><br>
              You know I have been regularly telling Singaporeans to rise up and protest these injustices in Singapore in Singapore Dissident. As an example of the Singaporean mentality, let me tell you that I had numerous letters asking me to come back to Singapore to lead them! Any other person from any other country would not have asked me to do that; since they can protest by themselves if they want and they surely don't need me. A Singaporean it appears, is incapable of doing anything unless he is led!
              <br><br>
              Another example of the Singaporean is this. They say that I only dare to write criticism of Singapore from abroad; but I wouldn't dare to do it there. Yes, it is true because I would be imprisoned by Lee Kuan Yew if I did. However as for them from within Singapore, they prefer to do nothing at all except to challenge me to return, something which I am banned from doing anyway by the Singapore government.
              <br><br>
              And what is the best example of their mentality is they say all these things hiding under false pretences! Not a single Singaporean is prepared to identify himself in their letters!
              <br><br>
              Therefore for your own good and that of your families, if you can get out of the place, you should do it. Make your home in a free country where your children can walk tall as human beings, not having to hide from some bully like Lee Kuan Yew. Your children would appreciate you for giving them their new found freedom and you too would realize that you are a much freer human being with a voice, with courage and with integrity to do the right thing.
              <br><br>
              Gopalan Nair
              
              <br><br>
              I can say for sure that democracy in my own country is showing signs of regression. This demokrat party are a bunch of fools and traitors to democracy. I would not be surprised if lky and his corrupt regime had anything to do with this situation. lky's Singapore is a cankerous blight to the region. A terminal illness.

A Singaporean it appears, is incapable of doing anything unless he is led!<br><br>Another example of the Singaporean is this. They say that I only dare to write criticism of Singapore from abroad; but I wouldn't dare to do it there. Yes, it is true because I would be imprisoned by Lee Kuan Yew if I did. However as for them from within Singapore, they prefer to do nothing at all except to challenge me to return, something which I am banned from doing anyway by the Singapore government.<br><br>And what is the best example of their mentality is they say all these things hiding under false pretences! Not a single Singaporean is prepared to identify himself in their letters!<br><br>Therefore for your own good and that of your families, if you can get out of the place, you should do it. Make your home in a free country where your children can walk tall as human beings, not having to hide from some bully like Lee Kuan Yew. Your children would appreciate you for giving them their new found freedom and you too would realize that you are a much freer human being with a voice, with courage and with integrity to do the right thing.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br>I can say for sure that democracy in my own country is showing signs of regression. This demokrat party are a bunch of fools and traitors to democracy. I would not be surprised if lky and his corrupt regime had anything to do with this situation. lky's Singapore is a cankerous blight to the region. A terminal illness.</p>

               Like usual laupence trying to get back at me. . . .
               at least he admittted that he's nothing but a dog . . .laupence is not even a Christian yet he trolls eternal hope and has been targeting me specifically I'm only returning the favor to this moron. Note that he keeps pointing out govt conspiracies and olahzhong to try to discredit me he think pointing them out would.....you think JB Jayaretnam and CSJ suffered because they deserved to suffer and be punished? They were punished because they simply refused to give up their soul and simply being an independent mind.
              You see lky has been defaming his critics with all sort of things....from being unlawful to being a marxist to being crazy...he surely uses his imaginations to defame his critics and those who oppose him. PAP has been crying wolf when it is themselves which are the wolves. The very fact that the whole Singapura's system sat idle to this blatant act of shameful injustice is a testimony that people such as CSJ and late JB Jayaretnam suffered under systematic persecution i.e, PAP conspiracies.
              <br><br>
              So .next time people like laupence cry wolf you know better than that.

               Yes you did and you thought it was better than being like me.....oh lapdog ...the difficult thing about trying to relate to such people is that you're forced down to their level of communication that is insult and name calling which is actually just not me but how can you otherwise relate to people whose very response is trying to put you down for no reason.
