The parish priest was aware of this, but he did not want to speak about it for fear of offending the old man. One day, a few weeks before Christmas, the priest paid the man a visit.<br><br>The pair sat by the fire after dinner, having a glass of rum and a chat. At this point, the priest took a pair oftongs and seized one of the burning coals from the fire. He held on to it for some time while the conversation continued. The piece of coal glowed with fire for a short while, then turned grey.<br><br>When it was time for the priest to leave, his host told him to look out for him the following Sunday. The priest's action with the coal had taught him that one's faith diminishes if he stayed away from mass for too long.</div></blockquote>Good story. Illustrates the importance of the Holy Mass.</div>

But instead, He sent his only Son to deliver us.<br><br>Everyone can accept Christ as their Lord and Saviour. It is a easy thing but to sustain the relationship with God. It is really very difficult and many people have fail along the way. What i can say is that Nothing is Impossible with God. You must believe in God that u can change for the better.<br><br>No matter what, He will never forsake you because each of you are special to Him and that the Lord values you. And i hope u can do the same too.  Many a times sinning seems to be a easier way out and as for actions like smoking, lust and etc, these are nothing but temptations. but i wanna use some verses taken from the bible that states:<br><br>No temptation has seized you except that is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. (1 Corinthian 10:13)<br><br>Whatever it is and whoever you are, i hope that you can change for the better in time to come and i pray for you.<br><br>Amen</div>

When all these traits surface, think about it this way, instead of feeling bad about the cursing and swearing etc... and then feel guilty and condemn yourself, (for according to Rom 8:1, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ), why don't you go straight to God/Jesus with your feelings and problems re the issues of lust, swearing etc... and say here God, I feel like this today, I have had these thoughts today... and just yield them to Him.<br>If we confess our sins, He will forgive.<br><br>Put them down at Jesus feet and begin to take up His yoke. When you got saved, your memories stay with you and you cannot just erase them, sometimes certain behaviourial patterns take a while to change. Keep at it. When you feel these things coming on... take it to Jesus. Right now, you are undergoing a purification process, just as Jewellers purify gold in the furnance so that the dross and impurities rise to the surface to be scooped away, this is what is happening with you, you are being made aware of the impurities in you so that God/Jesus can take them away as you yield them to Him.<br><br>Keep the faith, and let Jesus work in you, I keep you in prayer. Take care and God Bless you.</div>
