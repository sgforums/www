            <div class='col-md body'>here's the position of the fundamentalist and evangelical in short:<br><br>2Ti 3:16 <strong>All scripture is given by inspiration of God</strong>, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br><br>17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good<br>works.<br><br>Inspiration of God does not and cannot afford error in the teaching's of Scripture.<br><br>Why because God is perfect and infallible. The Holy Spirit [the third person of the Godhead] guided them in such a way that they will never commit errors in their writings.<br><br>2Pe 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as <strong>they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</strong>"<br><br>prophecy" could be forthtelling or foretelling. When predicting that is foretelling. When forthtelling that is encouraging and edifying writing and teaching.<br><br><strong>SO WHAT ABOUT WHEN THEY SPEAK CONCERNING THE DOCTRINES OF THE FAITH?</strong><br><br>1Co 14:3 But he that prophesieth <strong>speaketh </strong>unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.<br><br>1 Corinthians 14:3 combined with 2 Peter 1:21 [Though 2 Peter was referring to Scriptures] makes it clear that even when a prophet prophecies ORALLY [apostles were also prophets], they are guided by the Spirit.<br><br>Why not? the Lord promised this:<br><br>Joh 14:26 "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name,<strong> He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.</strong><br><br>Joh 15:15 "No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you.<br><br>So in conclusion:<br><br>Apostles never commit mistakes in either their teaching [orally or written]<br><br>thanks nice exchange of ideas...... i really have to go.....i am using only   a pre-paid  internet card. i have to save some for it for ministry work. bye. see you two weeks from now.<br><br>i have to defend my faith Icy. have too.
