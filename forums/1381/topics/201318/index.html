Being an apostle does not mean that you are immuned to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">moral</span></strong> failures and mistakes. They can still fall into sin. But concerning <strong>DOCTRINE</strong>, whether in writing or teaching orally the doctrines of the faith, they are inerrant and infallible. Peter was not teaching doctrine here.<br><br>2) The word "Satan" in Greek means adversary.<br><br>There are those who believe that it is possible for a [true] Christian to be indwelt by <strong>THE</strong> personal Satan, the Devil, basing it on this verse.<br><br>But the Lord Jesus never meant that here. He never meant that Peter was indwelt by Satan here. In the Greek text [we cannot see it in our English translations], there is no definite article THE before the word "Satan" here.<br><br>I have to add something important. There is a Greek rule that says: "The presence of the article identifies, the absence of it qualifies."<br><br>The Lord did not identify the personal Satan [the Devil] as being in Peter. He was qualifying Peter's actions and behavior as ADVERSARIAL to God's will for Christ.<br><br>The Lord did not say that "THE SATAN" has indwelt Peter. He was just simply saying that Peter was an ADVERSARY concerning the will of God about the salvation of sinners. The Christ was to be crucified on the cross to pay humanities sins. If He didn't,there would have been no salvation.<br><br>Here's Young's literal translation of the original:<br><br>Mt 16:23 and he having turned, said to Peter, `Get thee behind me, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">adversary</span>!</strong> thou art a stumbling-block to me, for thou dost not mind the things of God, but the things of men.'<br><br>3) "Stumbling block" in the sense that he was an impident to the Lord's sent purpose here on earth. He was trying to hinder the Lord in His work of salvation. But He never acceded to Peter's ignorance, He obeyed what the Father set for Him to do.<br><br>Peter in his ignorance tried to prevent [stumbling block] the Lord, but the Lord never stumbled and driven off His course, He went on to Calvary.<br><br>The Lord loved us too much, He had to die for you and me [AND PETER] that if we repent and trust in Him we will be saved. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>P.S. see you some time Icy, got to rest my eyes.....i'll see you two weeks from now.

It was a faction in the Jerusalem Church called the Judaizers that was causing all the disturbance: mixing Law and Grace.<br><br>Peter's <strong>moral</strong> mistake in Galatians 2 was indeed crucial. He was not teaching in Galatia, he was manifesting Legalism. Peter's tendency to compromise showed up again.<br><br>But in all of Peter's teachings as seen in his two letters was the unmixed doctrine of pure grace. He was not practicing what he believed and taught in Galatians 2.<br><br>He believed in the doctrine of pure grace [Acts 15 and his letters in his two letters].<br><br>In studying the Bible there are mistakes of God's people that are written there. They are written not for us to follow but to avoid. In the Bible there are promises to claim. There are noble and godly actions written for us to emulate. There are commands to obey. But we are never taught to mimic David's mistakes, Abraham's lapse into temporary unbelief, Paul's temper when he had contention with Barnabas and etc.<br><br></div>

Being an apostle does not mean that you are immuned to moral failures and mistakes. They can still fall into sin. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But concerning DOCTRINE, whether in writing or teaching orally </span></strong>the doctrines of the faith, they are inerrant and infallible.
