            <div class='col-md body'>I think sgdiehard already provided a reasonable answer. Be diligently in reading and understanding the bible.  It will help you understand and know who God is.  Then it may help you in identifying false prophets.<br><br>Just to add, without wanting to throw the topic off course.  It may depends on when you think Christ is reappearing? i.e. before, during or after tribulation?</div>
