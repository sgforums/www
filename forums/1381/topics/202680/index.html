            <div class='col-md body'>I think icemoon make a good reply  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It is no secret tat jesus has been communicating with god throughout the NT.<br><br><strong>Mark1</strong><br><br>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 10As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <strong>11And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." </strong><br><br>Now pray tell me. How can Jesus and god be one ? If he is, then god must be mad to say he is his own son ? If u say Jesus is a "second godhead" of the trinity, then is obviously shown tat trinity made of 3 types of "godhead" but they r not the same. U need to know the meaning of "same". They must have completely no difference at all. If there is a difference, no matter how slight, then they r not the same and one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> One a father and one a son is already a good sign to show they r not the same  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
