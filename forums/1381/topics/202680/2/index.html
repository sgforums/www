How can Jesus and god be one ? If he is, then god must be mad to say he is his own son ? If u say Jesus is a "second godhead" of the trinity, then is obviously shown tat trinity made of 3 types of "godhead" but they r not the same. U need to know the meaning of "same". They must have completely no difference at all.

            <div class='col-md body'>That's why it's a mystery (and people have mulled over it for centuries)... but not unexpected.<br><br>My own take on it is that because God is kinda hard to describe in our own metaphysical language and senses (more difficult as a 2D cartoon character trying to comprehend a cube). Unfortunately you are not going to get people spelling it out to you in some easy formula soon... the simplest I can put it (not helpfully) is that Christians believe there is one God but yet three seperate and distinct aspects... and language and human understanding is a poor way to spell it out.</div>

I feel its irrelevant wether its literal or allegorical now. Because <span style="font-style: italic;">any type bread from God which you've eaten</span> should have transformed you into a generally good and happy person, owing to the life nourishing, heavenly, quality.<br><br>Unless that happens, then I doubt you've partook in such kind of a divine feast in the first place, since that'll be hypocritical right?<br><br>But if one turns out to be genuinely contented, then one will be proving God's miracle through means of oneself, just like Jesus did, together with the purpose of the bread. I guess.<br><br>Thats teh opinion. *Spreads palm* Two cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> No? Kopi money only plz.
