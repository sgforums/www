That's an order Mr Andrew.<br><br>I would say a blind faith as unchecked power given to human who tends to corrupt. Faith in God is never misplaced nor it is blind because when you have faith in God it's a two way relationship, you see God's work sooner or later.<br><br>If you are wondering yourself perhaps because you don't have it Mr Andrew. Simply don't have it and simply don't get it.<br><br>And for Christians(who think themselves as Christians) but never actually got to know God in his/her personal life, reform yourself perhaps you've never been a Christian. Going to churches and got baptized are no indication that you're a Christian by heart. God see your heart, nothing else matter.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I really like the other thread mentioning about my name and therefore I treat it as a welcome for me to come over<br><br>Talking about blind faith. U really need abundant of them to actually believe in the bible. Lets just be frank here... if u r picking a book and it tells u all the story listed in the bible... then u can immediately tell it is bad fiction... Lets just say it with an unbiased heart... a book tat suddenly changes focus from the  middle ? Book full of contradictions ? Books telling of a wary supposed to be good god tat curse men to die and curse men to fight with each other in babel ? Book tat shows many examples of incest (is there a book with more incest scene than tis ?) ? Full of unnecesasary violence (is there a story tat kill more people)? A book tat is sexist and force woman to take lower roles and follow all the man's word (cannot be priest) ? Factually wrong (age of earth, evolution) ? I mean wat else can u make a fiction more unbelievable ?<br><br>If u read them from a shelf, without anyone to psycho u, do u think u really u don't need to take a big leap of faith to believe in such... facinating tales... Isn't it easier to believe tis is just an old folkstory, nothing different from Pang Gu or monkey god or zeus ? If u ask me to choose between pang gu or god creating the world, I find both equally unconvincing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Lets just ask, why believe in god creating the world and not pang gu creating the world ? Of course there r people who believe god will only come out only when they have believed in it but strangly all cults members seemed to find their god after they believed in it too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> There r crazy guys who say their god communicate with them and go on a serial killing rampage as well. Maybe they r right, god want them to kill prostitue and infidels. God himself kill all those sinners and encourage people to do it too isn't it ? He even set it as laws in Dt<br><br>U know wat is the best evidence why the bible can be wrong ? The reason is because it does not have a satisfactory answer to any good question. If u look at the thread, basic questions like who create the world give different opinions among different believer. The problem is, some verse give different meaning from others or something just doesn't make sense. No satisfactory answer tat preserve logic and all verses can be found. If it is a divine book from god himself guided by holy spirirts, why make it so confusing and misleading <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I believe God is out there but He just observe wat we do in our world. and wont help us cuz it is us who created all these problem.<br><br>I guess not many ppl sense the blessing of God when they seek for His help whenever its the emergency period.. everything in our world depends on ourself. We trust God and we also must trust to depend on ourself and not God whenever there is any problem.

Looong time ago.<br><br>Yes the ghosts will still be able to touch you. But the 'trick' is to pray(ask for God's help), a whisper or a cry in your heart would suffice to make the ghost go away. Remember you don't have the power, God has the power. They are very very very afraid if you call out to God. They would flee much faster than they came. Proven in the field...well at least with one spirit who called himsel Olazhong. All that speed was good only for fleeing. Dead and still causing trouble.<br><br>I've heard others use holy water(blessed water) and pray. That would work too. Sprinkle the waters over the area for example doors and windows then pray to ask for God's protection, evil spirit CANNOT break through. However this may causes the evil spirit to get angry and started to run into other rooms and hence frightening other people because it was so anxious not being able to break through your room. So be prepared to take in asylums into your own room if you can't find yourself another inn. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Well don't forget that God see inside you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  :</div>

Well, it doesnt look like it was caused by animals cuz it was just so weird looking with the snake bite marks. Yea perhaps u can say she bluff on me but hey, she doesnt gain anything for this bullshyt if you ask me. and since im working with her, i know shes not the person to talk crap bout this weird thing<br><br>Many things been done to chase away this ghost inhibit in my company's warehouse.. none is effective.. that thing still there. and shes strong lol. Name of God doesnt scare her. Once a Malay medium here to cleanse the warehouse and chase away the ghost, too sad even the medium said he is not strong enough to chase her and he asked us to find stronger medium lol.</div>
