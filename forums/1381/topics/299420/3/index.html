Let's say for the sake of argument that Adam and Eve disobeyed god and their punishment was justified.<br><br>How is the punishment of their descendants justified?<br><br>Let's take another example.<br><br>2 Samuel 12:13-14<br><br>12:13  And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.<br>12:14 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.<br><br>So instead of punishing David for his sin, God instead kills his child.

            <div class='col-md body'>There's a theory that the idea of god punishing descendants is actually due to biblical writers trying to explain natural disasters and conquests by other nations.<br><br>One of the 'innovations' that allowed the Yahweh cult to survive was the idea of that God would punish his own people for their sins and the idea of delayed punishment.<br><br>A religion would typically die out of a people was conquered by another. The defeated people would generally adopt the religion of the conquerors. However, the Yahweh cult made defeat by another nation a punishment from god, and part of god's plan, thereby making defeat not a defeat at all.<br><br>Now that defeat becomes the result of god's wrath, the biblical writers had to explain why 'good' kings for example experienced defeats and natural disasters while some 'bad' kings had long, trouble free reigns. So they explained it by saying, "oh well, THIS king is good but look at the last king, he was terrible. So now god is punishing us. It's not this king's fault, it's that last terrible king."</div>

How do you define faith?<br><br>If you define faith as belief without any reason, I would say okay, faith itself is blind.<br><br>But that's not how we commonly use the word faith, therefore, we add a qualifier in front to make it "blind faith."<br><br>For example, if someone asked me, "do you have faith/believe that the sun will rise tomorrow.", I would reply "yes."<br><br>But I have very good reasons to believe that the sun will rise tomorrow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I came across an article that is sort of related to the free will argument that SpecialOps made.<br><br><a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/01/debunking-other.html" rel="nofollow">http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/01/debunking-other.html</a><br><br><blockquote><br>If God created us and gave us freedom, then as a loving parent his moral concern should be that we that we donÂ’t abuse the freedom he gave us in the ways we do. The giver of a gift is blameworthy if he gives gifts to those whom he knows will terribly abuse those gifts. Any parent who gives a razor blade to a two year old is culpable if that child hurts himself or others with it. Good parents give their children more and more freedom to do what they want so long as they are responsible with their freedom. They should not give them the keys to the car until they can legitimately be responsible to drive, nor buy them any beer until they can legitimately drink responsibly. And if children abuse the freedoms given to them, good parents will discipline them by taking away their opportunities to make these choices. ItÂ’s that simple. God fails miserably as a parent! Admit it. Paul Draper wrote, Â“we would expect God would behave like a good parent, giving humans great responsibility only when we are worthy of it.Â”<br><br>Furthermore, if my parents sat by and did nothing while my brother beat me to death, and if they had the means to stop him and didnÂ’t, then they are morally responsible for letting me die. They could even be considered accomplices. Your God is not a loving parent.<br><br>Besides, why should we as human beings have to learn the consequences of our actions by such draconian kinds of sufferings when we err? When my children misbehaved or didnÂ’t understand the consequences of their actions, I didnÂ’t send a proverbial hurricane their way. In fact, as a parent I sought to protect them as much as I could from the extreme consequences of their actions. A little pain was a good thing, so they could learn from their mistakes. But no caring father would let them suffer the full brunt of their mistakesÂ—no father. That's a miserable parent to allow this, so if the Christian wants to use this analogy then by the same standards God fails miserably as a parent. My parents weren't perfect, but they were much better than this God of yours!</blockquote></div>
