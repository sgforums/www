God placed man in the garden of eden and instructed that that they could eat of any tree except the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br><br>But without knowledge of good and evil, how could man understand disobedience? And for that matter, why is nakedness evil?<br><br>What is interesting is why god cast man out of the garden of eden. Genesis 3:22 tells us "And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"<br><br>Man became partially as god, with the knowledge of good and evil and man had to be cast out LEST he ate from the tree of life and live forever. Had he done so he would have become as god. What if man had eaten of the tree of life first?<br><br>Why couldn't god have taken away the knowledge of good and evil? I think someone mentioned before that once god gives a gift, god does not take it away. I find that to be a strange argument. God gives us the gift of life and he takes it away all the time. And in fact, God basically redoes creation again with the flood. He kills every living thing on the earth save a few. Why?</div>

So the Tree of Life only becomes a factor after man eats the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.<br><br>And why can't man be immortal? What's wrong with that? After all, god created man in his own image.

Why did the couple hid themselves from God?<br><br>Before they hid from God, they already made loincloths for themselves liao right? So why was it that they were comfortable hiding TOGETHER but uncomfortable with facing God?<br><br>Furthermore, since God created them, what is there to be uncomfortable about?<br><br>And most interestingly, look at the reason given by Adam:<br><br><blockquote>But the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, Â‘Where are you?Â’ 10He said, Â‘I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</blockquote>Which is why I asked you - where was it indicated they knew shame? Jewish exegesis ask the following question - when someone is naked, the first thing he/she will feel is shame. But the reason given by Adam is that he was AFRAID.<br><br>What is there to be afraid of? Let's say he is afraid of God punishing him of his misdeed, but what have this to do with the fact that he was naked? Why didn't Adam say he was afraid 'cos he just ate the fruit? Furthermore, didn't he and Eve just made provisional clothes for themselves?<br><br>More and more questions.

So its a lie.</div></blockquote>The original in Hebrew leads to a slightly different understanding; it isn't really a case of inserting a doubt. It is something else deeper altogether.<br><br>Actually not sure if you guys notice it, but Jewish tradition pointed out an interesting observation:<br><br>In the same paragraph in Genesis 3, Eve said:<br><br><blockquote>2The woman said to the serpent, Â‘We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; 3but God said, Â“You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die.Â” </blockquote>There is something wrong with the prohibition mentioned by Eve which she heard from Adam. Spot the mistake, guys!<br><br>Here is how Scripture records the prohibition to Adam in Genesis 2:<br><br><blockquote>16And the Lord God commanded the man, Â‘You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.Â’</blockquote>So the mistake is obvious - Adam was not told that it is forbidden to touch the tree. Well, as the gardener, he must be allowed to touch the tree, or else how he prune it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Back to Eve, in her mind the whole tree is poisonous to her. The whole tree is inaccessible to her. Anyone who is not crazy will not want to touch it.<br><br>And because the prohibition came from God, the more one should not touch it. If Adam was told via a donkey the prohibition, then maybe Eve could ignore it, since the donkey might be lying. But if God - the one who presumably walked with the couple in the Garden everyday and whom the couple knows is GOD - is the originator, then how can they ever break the transgression?<br><br>It just doesn't make sense! Furthermore the Christian explanation simply dismisses the whole incident as a case of disobedience.<br><br>There ought to be this resistance in her heart that the tree must not be touched. Imagine .. touching it and you are dead. Is it worth your life to disobey God?<br><br>So what did the cunning serpent do to overcome her resistance? Jewish tradition gave the solution - the serpent pushed Eve to the tree (or the fruit, I can't remember). The point is that at that moment, Eve knew that *maybe* this God is not so great after all, maybe eat liao also bo daiji, since I touch the tree but still haven't mati.<br><br>Personally I find Jewish exegesis very enlightening. Imagine this scenario - the serpent pushed Eve to the tree. Bo daiji leh! Then the serpent told Eve, "You will NOT die ..
