I can say bring out everything from other sources and u guys still can't be convinced about it. The only thing u guys can be speechless about is when I bring out the scriptures. U can't say it is wrong isn't it ?? Furthermore I am trying to bring the point tat the scripture is contradictory, illogical and factually wrong. Worse still, the wordings deviates from time to time. If i can't talk about them, how can I bring out those points ?<br><br><blockquote>Also he is the only individual I know who continues to log into a forum that he totally disagrees just to get his kicks....<br><br>It is a case of not being able to defecated after having a meal.... </blockquote>Keep on with your insults...

U can put in any person name in if u want. Maybe he is god in disguise, u cannot prove tat either. Why can't u be open to it ? Why do god have to be linked with everything ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Say "No!" To the Evangelist<br>Miracles<br>Extracts from Ven. Dhammika's latest work entitled 'Who's That Knocking on the Door? A Buddhist's Guide to Evangelical Christianity', Published on the Buddhist News Network, Jan 16, 2004<br><br>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia -- Do miracles really happen as the evangelist's claim? No, they do not. Then why are Christians always claiming that Jesus is helping them? In some cases they are lying or exaggerating in the hope that you will be impressed enough to inquire more into Christianity and hopefully eventually convert.<br><br>But in some cases they really believe that Jesus miraculously intervened in their lives. So deluded are they that they interpret the most ordinary events, the most common occurrences, as a miracle. I used to know a man who was always very aggressively trying to convert me. One day I asked him why he became a Christian. He drew himself up, pleased to have the opportunity be a witness for Jesus and then he told me this story.<br><br>His mother had been a Buddhist and his father had been a Christian and as a boy he was a little of both. During the Second World War he joined the army and was taken from Sri Lanka to North Africa.<br><br>He and his platoon were due to be taken abroad a ship but because to a series of strange incidents he was delayed and when he finally arrived his platoon were all on the ship and it was sailing out of the harbor. As he stood watching the ship reach the open sea and a German submarine suddenly torpedoed it. The ship sank and everyone on board died. After saying this he stood there with a big smile on his face as if this explained why he had became a Christian. 'What is the point of your story'? I inquired 'Can't you see'? he said. 'If I had been on that ship I would have died. Jesus delayed me in order to save my life. At that very moment I was born again and I gave myself to Jesus'.<br><br>I was silent for a moment as I tried to comprehend the bazaar logic of the evangelicals. Then I said. 'Do you mean to tell me that Jesus let hundreds of people die just so that you would believe in him? Why didn't he delay the whole platoon so they would all believe in him'? He stood there with his mouth open. It was clear that he had never thought of this possibility before. This man never talked to me about Jesus again.<br><br>Read also:<br>The Gospel of Mark<br>The End of the World<br>Faith Healing<br><br>http://www.buddhistnews.tv/current/sayno-180104.php<br><br></div>

Dhammika's latest work entitled 'Who's That Knocking on the Door? A Buddhist's Guide to Evangelical Christianity', Published on the Buddhist News Network, Jan 16, 2004<br><br>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia -- Do miracles really happen as the evangelist's claim? No, they do not. Then why are Christians always claiming that Jesus is helping them? In some cases they are lying or exaggerating in the hope that you will be impressed enough to inquire more into Christianity and hopefully eventually convert.<br><br>But in some cases they really believe that Jesus miraculously intervened in their lives. So deluded are they that they interpret the most ordinary events, the most common occurrences, as a miracle. I used to know a man who was always very aggressively trying to convert me. One day I asked him why he became a Christian. He drew himself up, pleased to have the opportunity be a witness for Jesus and then he told me this story.<br><br>His mother had been a Buddhist and his father had been a Christian and as a boy he was a little of both. During the Second World War he joined the army and was taken from Sri Lanka to North Africa.<br><br>He and his platoon were due to be taken abroad a ship but because to a series of strange incidents he was delayed and when he finally arrived his platoon were all on the ship and it was sailing out of the harbor. As he stood watching the ship reach the open sea and a German submarine suddenly torpedoed it. The ship sank and everyone on board died. After saying this he stood there with a big smile on his face as if this explained why he had became a Christian. 'What is the point of your story'? I inquired 'Can't you see'? he said. 'If I had been on that ship I would have died. Jesus delayed me in order to save my life. At that very moment I was born again and I gave myself to Jesus'.<br><br>I was silent for a moment as I tried to comprehend the bazaar logic of the evangelicals. Then I said. 'Do you mean to tell me that Jesus let hundreds of people die just so that you would believe in him? Why didn't he delay the whole platoon so they would all believe in him'? He stood there with his mouth open. It was clear that he had never thought of this possibility before. This man never talked to me about Jesus again.<br><br>Read also:<br>The Gospel of Mark<br>The End of the World<br>Faith Healing<br><br>http://www.buddhistnews.tv/current/sayno-180104.php<br><br></div></blockquote>Thx for your post.<br><br>One day, A walk up to B and say, God dont exist and state 1 million points why God do not exist so that he could try to convert B to buddhism. In the end, A said that you should pray to Buddha. He had achieve enlightenment, for he is a good man. Everyone should be like him, or try to be like him.<br><br>B was silent for a moment as I tried to comprehend the bazaar logic of A. Then B voiced out, Did u say pray? So buddha can hear prayers, thus having eternal life, and he is the only one so far out of billion people on earth who is a good person? Is Mother Theresa good enough, so does she achieve enlightenment? Should we pray to her also?<br><br>A also try to convince B that the bible have alot of flaw. B then paused and thought, hmm, in the new testanement, we have 12 disciples withnessing Jesus. Did anyone withness Buddha getting enlightnment under the tree? Did his head shine like a sun?<br><br>Finally B answered, i respect buddha for his moral teachings. He is a good teacher indeed. But by knees, shall never kneel down to a teacher no matter how good he is. I could only kneel down to my creator; my parents but not a teacher.  And B also do not understand the logic behind the food sacrificed on the altar, if one should follow Buddha teaching, i believe he would rather give the food to the poor rather than placing it on the altar.<br><br>I am sad to say that i need to write this. Because, if u do not like this reply, do not post something that are similar with it. Religion bashing is not something fun. Learn to respect. If i could see logic in your religion, i wont be what i am today, i will be buddhist. So, i think this apply to u too. Therefore, if we could not see any logic in each other belief, then, learn to AGREE to DISAGREE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
