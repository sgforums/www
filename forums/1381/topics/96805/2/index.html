But of course he did not understand the culture and history of Singapore and why such policies or law is around and as much as he did not understand it, it is law and nothing can change that at that time. He just had to accept it.

The choice available, is just a second chance for you to live...</blockquote>Tis appears to be a random process. Just because u pick a different one, it doesn't means u deserved to be punish. However for christianity, u really do. Watever u say about original sin, it still boils down to the fact tat one is faultless for picking a wrong religion, yet he still get punish for it<br><br><blockquote>What you BELIEVE as not true may be true afterall huh?

It also proves tat people want to believe in an unfair god so they get better priviledges.<br><br><blockquote>CHristians may always want to tell you the truth they believe in, but most of them do not go around asking other religions to prove themselves.

His death is just to appeased him<br><br><blockquote>I hope you understand what I am trying to say in the context of the christian belief.

But however the policy of free schooling is made by humans to appease human. The effects r little as well. Your belief is making a policy of great significance unfair. Your religion is suppose to be made by a perfect god but turn out not to be so perfect after all.<br><br><blockquote>can. He can.

People can choose a different religion because no religion can prove themselves right. Why do they get punish for believing in others ? The one to blame is probably the so called right religion for not proving itself to the people. </div></blockquote>Yeah, this is common people like to do, accept the credit and push away the blame. My father is the hero, I get the honor as well. My father is a thief, but I don't share the shame. My father is rich, it is fair for me to be rich automatically from the asset he left for me. My father is broke and in debt, but I am not reponsible to bear his debt.<br><br>God know how to judge what is fair.</div>

Tis is not common people, but respectable organisation like bank and law. I see the system above where men share the fruit of success fromt their ancestors but do not share their burdens as fair. I thought now only a loanshark will they start to become unfair and force the family member to pay for their parents debt. U don't see the above as fair ?<br><br></div>
