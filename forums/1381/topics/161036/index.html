            <div class='col-md body'>Armed Men Hijack Car of African Evangelist<br><br>Note: This press release is authorized by African evangelist Loren Davis.<br><br>Oct 28, 2005<br><br>On September 26th, in Nairobi, Kenya, minutes after American-born evangelist Loren Davis finished meeting with 300 Kenyan pastors to warn them about the dangers and pitfalls of Rick Warren's Purpose Driven programs, Davis' car was hijacked by two unidentified armed men. "I left after dark," said Davis. "My crusade manager asked me and my wife to ride with him in his car, so we left our men to bring our vehicle. Later that night, we got a call from our men. They had been hijacked."<br><br>Davis explained that just after his men drove outside the church compound, two gunmen jumped them, forcing them into the back seat. The armed men said if they didn't cooperate they would kill them. "For over thirty minutes the hijackers drove around Nairobi terrorizing them," Davis said.<br><br>"Finally, miraculously, they let our men go, along with our vehicle, stealing only two mobile phones and some small money. Our men said that they wondered if the hijackers were after me, because we had a lot of expensive electronic equipment in the vehicle, which they left alone. My vehicle, which was well marked with our ministry logo, is the one I usually ride in. It was picked out of all the cars at the conference." The incident left Davis and others shaken.<br><br>Davis, who has been an evangelist in Africa for seventeen years with his wife Celeste, is warning Christian leaders and pastors in Africa about Rick Warren and the Purpose Driven program. Davis has planted 132 churches throughout Africa over the last two decades and says he is deeply troubled about the widespread influence Rick Warren has already had in many African churches. According to Davis, Rick Warren's teachings are often unscriptural and contain serious New Age implications.<br><br>Davis says his warning has been met with some hostility and risk. "I was told by reliable sources that in Rwanda I could be arrested for criticizing Rick Warren because of Warren's connection with the president." Rick Warren has already visited with Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, and would like to see Rwanda become the first " Purpose Driven nation."<br><br>Several Kenyan pastors asked Davis if he would speak on November 2nd in Nairobi, just six days prior to Rick Warren arriving. Warren is scheduled to speak at Nairobi Pentecostal Church from November 8th to 11th.<br><br>The November 2nd meeting with Davis is expected to draw over a thousand pastors and leaders. Davis states that he will give the same documented presentation that has already convinced many African pastors and leaders to abstain from Rick Warren's fast growing world-wide agenda.<br><br>Rick Warren'�s global P.E.A.C.E. Plan is targeting the continent of Africa. He believes the world is on the brink of a great spiritual awakening and that every religion can be used to bring this "new reformation" into place. In May, at the Pew and Religion Forum, Rick Warren stated: "Who's the man of peace in any village - or it might be a woman of peace - who has the most respect, they're open and they're influential? They don't have to be a Christian. In fact, they could be a Muslim, but they're open and they're influential and you work with them to attack the five giants. And that's going to bring the second Reformation."<br><br>While Rick Warren's global P.E.A.C.E. Plan is based on good works, Davis is concerned about where this movement is ultimately heading. He is particularly concerned that this new "reformation" is under girded by ecumenical/New Age considerations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Interview with Rick Warren (by Paul Bradshaw)<br><br>In an interview by Paul Bradshaw with Rick Warren, author of The Purpose Driven Life, Rick Warren said:  People ask me, What is the purpose of life? And I respond, In a nutshell, life is preparation for eternity. We were made to last forever, and God wants us to be with Him in Heaven. One day my heart is going to stop, and that will be the end of my body - but not the end of me. I may live 60 to 100 years on earth, but I am going to spend trillion of years in eternity.<br><br>This is the warm-up act, the dress rehearsal. God wants us to practice on earth what we will do forever in eternity. We were made by God and for God, and until you figure that out, life isn't going to make sense.<br><br>Life is a series of problems: Either you are in one now, you're just coming out of one or you're getting ready to go into another one. The reason for this is that God is more interested in your character than your comfort. God is more interested in making your life holy than He is in making your life happy. We can be reasonably happy here on earth, but that's not the goal of life. The goal is to grow in character, in Christ-likeness.<br><br>This past year has been the greatest year of my life but also the toughest, with my wife, Kay, getting cancer. I used to think that life was hills and valleys - you go through a dark time, then you got to the mountaintop, back and forth. I don't believe that anymore. Rather than life being hills and valleys, I believe that it's kind of like two rails on a railroad track, and at all times you have something good and something bad in your life. No matter how good things are in your life, there is always something bad that needs to be worked on.  And no matter how bad things are in your life, there is always something good you can thank God for. You can focus on your purposes, or you can focus on your problems. If you focus on your problems, you're going into self-centeredness, "which is my problem, my issues, my pain."<br><br>But one of the easiest ways to get rid of pain is to get your focus off yourself and onto God and others.<br><br>We discovered quickly that in spite of the prayers of hundreds of thousands of people, God was not going to heal Kay or make it easy for her. It has been very difficult for her, and yet God has strengthened her character, given her a ministry of helping other people, given her a testimony, drawn her closer to Him and to people...You have to learn<br>to deal with both the good and the bad of life.<br><br>Actually, sometimes learning to deal with the good is harder.  For instance, this past year, all of a sudden, when the book sold 15 million copies, it made me instantly very wealthy. It also brought a lot of notoriety that I had never had to deal with before.<br><br>I don't think God gives you money or notoriety for you to own ego or for you to live a life of ease. So I began to ask God what He wanted me to do with this money, notoriety and influence. He gave me two different passages that helped me decide what to do, Corinthians 9 and Psalm 72.<br><br>First, in spite of all the money coming in, we would not change our lifestyle one bit. We made no major purchases. Second, about midway through last year, I stopped taking a salary from the church. Third, we set up foundations to fund an initiative we call The Peace Plan - to plant churches, equip leaders, assist the poor, care for the sick, and educate the next generation. Fourth, I added up all that the church had paid me in the 24 years since I started the church, and I gave it all back. It was liberating to be able to serve God for free.<br><br>We need to ask ourselves: Am I going to live for possessions? Popularity? Am I going to be driven by pressures? Guilt? Bitterness? Materialism? Or am I going to be driven by God's purposes (for my life)?<br><br>When I get up in the morning, I sit on the side of my bed and say, God, if I don't get anything else done today, I want to know You more and love You better ...God didn't put me on earth just to fulfil a to-do list.<br><br>He's more interested in what I am than what I do. That's why we're called human beings, not human doings.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">what was his reply?</div></blockquote>Dear (Name Removed),<br><br><strong>Thanks for your concern!<br><br>Rick Warren is very unscriptural.  Just a few observations from his book:<br><br>On pg. 250, He says that the Bible does not define spiritual gifts.  I Cor. 12 defines the gifts of the Spirit.<br><br>On pg. 195-6 He says, "God's pland for your life is all that happens to you, including mistakes, your sins, your hurts, your illeness, debt, disasters, DIVORCE, and death of your loved ones."<br><br>That is the doctrine of predestination.  No personal responsibility.  The Bible teaches that everything that happens to us is conditional on us believing on him, Jn. 3:16, and keeping his commandments.  Deut. 28.  Please visit www.lighthousetrails.com for alot of information on Rick Warren.<br><br>Blessings!<br><br>Loren DAvis</strong><br><br>I replied:<br><br><strong>I'm sorry, I don't really understand about this doctrine of predestination. I'm kinda new at christianity. Could you elaborate?</strong><br><br>The pastor replied:<br><br><strong>The doctrine of Predestination comes from Calvanism.  It simply means that God foreordains everything that happens in your life, good or bad.  It totally takes away a persons will or freedom of choice.  It actually is rooted in Greek mythology, that the gods control the events of your life, similar to astrology.<br><br>Loren Davis</strong><br><br>I just sent this reply:<br><br><strong>But God's supposed to know everything already right? Omniscient?</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just sent another email:<br><br><strong>I'm sorry for disturbing your busy schedule pastor.<br><br>I just had an idea about the phrase<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"God's plan for your life is all that happens to you, including mistakes, your sins, your hurts, your illeness, debt, disasters, DIVORCE, and death of your loved ones."</span><br><br>Could he have just meant that God has already known what would you choose in your life, and the consequences of the choices, whether good or bad? Since time is relative to God, he's in the past, present and future? So he would know the choices you would make?<br><br>Free will simply means that God does not interfere in any way in the choices we make right?
