The fact that a piece of music (or data) is placed in the internet does not necessarily mean that the person placing it has the right to do so. Anyone following on and download this data is guilty of the same crime.<br><br>Is drinking or smoking sinful? For that matter is eating char kway teow sinful? The point is: anything taken in excesses to a point of destroying God's temple is sinful.  The critical issue is how dependant are we on our liquor or cigs. I do not personally smoke, but I drink quite a bit. However, I am neither an alcoholic nor am I addicted to it. I can drink continuously for weeks but I can abstain for months without any withdrawal symptoms.</div>

Meaning someone is deemed by law that he has ownership to the said music or literary works. Translated in real terms, for example, no one may produce a Lord of the Rings movie without having to pay the estate of JRR Tolkien (or whoever owns the copyright of this title - might be New Line Movies) an arm and leg for the right of production.<br><br>Let's  look at another example, when you go to a studio photographer to have your photo taken (ie graduation, wedding etc), your right is only to the prints, you do not get the negative unless specifically stated in the contract. Is this fair? To me, it is not, but that is the rule of copyright.<br><br>Another example, you may not copy the entire content off a webpage without express permission from the owner of that site, but you may quote the site address.<br><br>One interesting point of argument that has emerged is the concept of "fairness". Just because a product owner is deemed to have overcharged their product should not be the reason to why we should break the law. Like I said before, two wrongs do not make it right.<br><br>To those who are of the opinion that overcharged CDs gave you the right to download illegally and had quoted articles that supports this stand, please also on the same note, read up about copyright laws. Please attempt to understand copyright laws first before you continue to download.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> To Christians reading this, please recognise that downloading without an expressed permission IS STEALING.<br></div>
