The message of salvation by faith alone, that salvation is "free" through God's grace is really what Lucifer wants.

The Church says Jesus is both. (any groups that use the exclusive or approach are branded heretics)<br><br>So should Christians follow the Old or New Testament? The Church says both are equally binding and glaring contradictions are swept under the carpet or de-emphasized. Ebionites hugged the OT and Marcionites hugged the NT .. the rest is history.</div>
