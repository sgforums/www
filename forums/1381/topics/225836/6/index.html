Yeshua is the only way to our reconciliation with Yahweh.<br>2. Only those who follow the commandments of Yahweh like Yeshua did will inherit eternal life. This after salvation by faith through grace. The grace being the opportunity to repent and be saved.<br>3. Works do not save but are the evidence of our salvation.<br>4. If you reject the salvation of Yeshua, then so also will Yahweh reject you.<br>5. Yahweh is a jealous God, He is a God of righteousness and order.<br>6. Yahweh has said through Yeshua, NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH YESHUA.<br>7. In the Holy Scriptures or what you call the OT, salvation was never for the world, it was only for the nation of Israel, and the only way to get saved then was to be part of Israel. This still has not changed today.</div>

Furthermore offerings or sacrifice can only atone for the trivial kind of sins. From the horse's mouth, in Numbers 15 (NRSV):<br><br><blockquote>27 An individual who sins unintentionally shall present a female goat a year old for a sin-offering. 28And the priest shall make atonement before the Lord for the one who commits an error, when it is unintentional, to make atonement for the person, who then shall be forgiven. 29For both the native among the Israelites and the alien residing among themÂ—you shall have the same law for anyone who acts in error. 30But whoever acts high-handedly, whether a native or an alien, affronts the Lord, and shall be cut off from among the people. 31Because of having despised the word of the Lord and broken his commandment, such a person shall be utterly cut off and bear the guilt.</blockquote>The keyword is "unintentional". Notice it has been stressed not once but twice.<br><br>As we go further from the Torah, ie. in the Prophets and Writings, we find that offering/sacrifice is de-emphasized. This was even before Jesus Christ came.<br><br>Your example of Enoch shows you have no freaking idea what's going on in the Torah. Please la .. Enoch was BEFORE Moses. The 10 commandments and the 613 mitzvahs were not even given yet. Wah biang ..<br><br>Only Jews can be saved? Where did you read that? On the contrary, it is mainstream Jewish belief that the righteous of all nations have a share in the world to come. This is recorded in the Talmud and if you argue that they try to twist God's words, then the Talmud will be the best place to twist them.</div>

If you didn't understand anything then it is not meant for you to understand - no matter how many times i explain, you will still choose not to believe and say you don't understand.</div>

Meekness is a controlled strength.  Jesus was meek during his ministry and showed his true power only when really necessary.</div>
