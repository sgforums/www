You are worth the blood of Jesus Christ.  God judges the heart.  Thus every deed done with a sincere heart is perfect in God's eyes no matter how insignificant it may seem to others.  In this way we can be as perfect and holy as God which is necessary for salvation.<br><br>Of inner character, deeds and faith.  Inner character is most important followed by deeds which reflect that inner character.  Faith while commendable, is not necessary for salvation - those who reject Jesus in this life because of the actions of unworthy/hypocritical/bigoted christians may still be saved based on their inner character and deeds.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thus salvation is open to all and not exclusive to christians - because Jesus died for everyone.</strong></span></div>
