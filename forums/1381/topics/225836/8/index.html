Thus, if we have faith, deeds must also follow. Both go hand-in-hand. It is futile to have one without the other.........<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus, those who declare that men are saved by faith/grace alone may like to re-examine this precept.........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div></blockquote>When Jesus died on the cross, he took all of our sins with him. No one can come to the Father except through Jesus Christ. By saying that it partially takes good deeds to get into Heaven, you are stating that Jesus' sacrifice for us was not good enough. Jesus' last words when he died were "tetelestai", meaning paid in <strong>full</strong>. It is true that by having faith, people will try to live more like Jesus Christ, but it is through faith that we are saved, and not by works. Ex/ If a dying cancer patient (or anyone else, for that matter)accepts and trusts in Jesus Christ before he/she dies, even if he/she never did anything significantly "good", he/she will still go to Heaven.</div>

It does not matter if the person is a Jew or not.  i.e Enoch was not a Jew.  [b]However the Jews twisted God's words and claimed that only Jews could be saved.</strong>  Thus insinuating that one must become a Jew to be assured of salvation - the is far from the truth.  In addition the Jews jealously hoarded this knowledge on how to be saved in direct opposition of God's wishes that they be an example for all nations to follow.<br><br><strong>Christians today believe that one must become a christian to be saved. </strong> They are repeating the failures and bigotry of the Jewish nation which is what Lucifer wants.[/b]</blockquote><strong>Romans 10:9</strong><br>If you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.<br><br>But are not Christians followers of Christ? Are not Christians those who believe that Jesus is Lord, and that God raised him from the dead?</div>
