Do you feel guilty whenever you think wicked thoughts or do evil deeds?   Why do people feel good when they do good deeds with a sincere heart?  This idea that salvation is by faith and not character and deeds goes against what the Holy Spirit is trying to tell us in our hearts.<br><br>We are not forgiven by God's mercy as God cannot be a partial God.  We are forgiven only when we deserved to be forgived.  That is if we show repentance by cultivating an upright character and doing good deeds.  Those who do not bear good fruit will not be forgiven as they do not deserve it - the fire awaits them.<br><br>Jesus died so that people of the past who did not practise the tradition of burnt offerings to absolve sins may be saved based on their good character and deeds.<br><br>Jesus died so that people of the present and future of all race, religion, and cultures may be saved based on similar criteria.<br><br>In short, Jesus died out of great love for you and me.  Why should we belittle the great love of God by preaching discrimination against non-believers of our religion?<br><br>Similarly why should we belittle our good intentions and deeds?  Heaven is not a place where one must get 100/100 marks to enter.  Rather 2 marks may be sufficent if God deems your character to be worthy.  Every little deed done with a sincere heart counts in the eyes of God.<br><br></div>
