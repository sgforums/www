Christ indwelling through the Holy Spirit makes us capable of being filled with the fruits of righteousness to the glory of God.<br><br>Php 1:11 being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>by</strong></span> Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.<br><br>It is only<strong> BY</strong> Jesus Christ that true righteousness is possible. All other righteousness will not do with God. God does not accept filthy rags righteousness.<br><br>How can we have Christ in us?<br><br>By trusting alone in Christ alone.<br><br>When we have trusted in Christ, we are sealed by the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit indwells us.<br><br>When we have the Holy Spirit in us, what are some of the fruits that will be manifested through us as we walk in the Spirit?<br><br>Ga 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is <strong>love</strong>, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br><br>We are only capable of giving true love when we have the Holy Spirit in us and we walking in HIm. AGain we recieved the Holy Spirit through faith alone in Christ alone.<br><br>Example:  Was Paul a Pharisee? Yes<br><br>Php 3:5 circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;<br><br>How did Paul surpass the righteousness of the Pharisee? by faith alone in Christ alone<br><br>Php 3:9  and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;<br><br>2) the Bible does not command us to have faith?<br><br>Mr 11:22 So Jesus answered and said to them, "<strong>Have faith </strong>in God.<br><br>Joh 14:1  "Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.<br><br>Paul told the Philippian jailer: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.........."<br><br>Of course Paul was exhorting him to believe in Christ truly, to have faith in Christ truly. When that happens, our hearts are purified through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>Ac 15:9 "and made no distinction between us and them, <strong>purifying their hearts by faith.</strong><br><br>When can a heart be purified and be capable of loving? When it has been cleansed by faith in Christ. Paul knew that trusting in Christ will transformed the sinner from the inside out, giving him a new heart capable of true love, therefore Paul [or God through Paul] commanded the jailer to believe [trust] in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>3) faith is the result of loving God?<br><br>Love is the result of a renewed and purified heart by faith alone in Christ alone<br><br>We love Him because we have appropriated the truth by faith that He first loved us, that He gave Himself for us.<br><br>4) <span style="font-style: italic;">The whole idea that some christians subscribe to - salvation by faith not works/deeds - is a lie or at best a half truth.</span><br><br>Please notice the word "by" in verse 8 and the word "for" in verse 10 below. We are saved  BY grace through faith......not of works but FOR good works.<br><br>Paul said that:<br><br>Eph 2:8 For <strong>by</strong> grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,<br><br>Eph 2:9 not of works, lest anyone should boast.<br><br>Eph 2:10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus <strong>for</strong> good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.<br><br></div>

All mainstream Christians believed salvation is by faith thru God's grace.

The work which God started in you. and not something which  you force yourself to doing.<br><br>its going to be a real burden if you everyday force yourself to do things which you think God wants you to do, so that you can be saved.<br><br>"If I skip cell group, God is going to hate me, and i'm not saved."<br><br>"If I never read the bible, I'm not performing any deeds in faith, so I'm not saved."<br><br>"If I drink, I'm going to look like a bad christian, so I'm not saved."<br><br>"If I listen to new age music, watch harry potter and the matrix, I'm not being a good christian, so I'm not saved."<br><br>and this goes on and on, and until you lose focus on what's important and you're burdened by guilt and worry and shame.. In the end, you lose sight of Jesus.<br><br>And you're going to be so focused on doing deeds to save yourself and burn yourself out, instead of relying on the grace of God, who loved you unconditionally, and accepted you for who you are, and not what you do. And that you're secure that even at the most rotten, God still loves you.<br><br>The whole reason why Jesus died, was to take away this burden of saving ourselves. So stop trying to, and remember why you received Jesus.<br><br>The message is very simple. We're sinners, we can't save ourselves, Jesus died to pay the price of sin, so we don't have to pay it anymore. Full stop.<br><br>Deeds will come naturally when you fill yourself with God's love.<br><br>Like my Jie told me. "Whatever makes you feel loved by God and motivate you to be a better person. Do it."<br><br>Personally, I never liked going to cellgroup. I never liked travelling the distance.. I don't like spending 2 hours at tampines, and spending 1 hour travelling back home. I'd rather do something else, something fun. Like watch a movie or hang out with friends.<br><br>Does that mean I'm not saved, because I'm not doing any deeds that most christians would want me to do?<br></div>

All other righteousness will not do with God. God does not accept filthy rags righteousness.<br><br>How can we have Christ in us?<br><br>By trusting alone in Christ alone.<br><br>When we have trusted in Christ, we are sealed by the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit indwells us.<br><br>When we have the Holy Spirit in us, what are some of the fruits that will be manifested through us as we walk in the Spirit?<br><br>Ga 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is <strong>love</strong>, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br><br>We are only capable of giving true love when we have the Holy Spirit in us and we walking in HIm. AGain we recieved the Holy Spirit through faith alone in Christ alone.<br><br>Example:  Was Paul a Pharisee? Yes<br><br>Php 3:5 circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;<br><br>How did Paul surpass the righteousness of the Pharisee? by faith alone in Christ alone<br><br>Php 3:9  and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;<br><br>2) the Bible does not command us to have faith?<br><br>Mr 11:22 So Jesus answered and said to them, "<strong>Have faith </strong>in God.<br><br>Joh 14:1  "Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.<br><br>Paul told the Philippian jailer: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.........."<br><br>Of course Paul was exhorting him to believe in Christ truly, to have faith in Christ truly. When that happens, our hearts are purified through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>Ac 15:9 "and made no distinction between us and them, <strong>purifying their hearts by faith.</strong><br><br>When can a heart be purified and be capable of loving? When it has been cleansed by faith in Christ. Paul knew that trusting in Christ will transformed the sinner from the inside out, giving him a new heart capable of true love, therefore Paul [or God through Paul] commanded the jailer to believe [trust] in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>3) faith is the result of loving God?<br><br>Love is the result of a renewed and purified heart by faith alone in Christ alone<br><br>We love Him because we have appropriated the truth by faith that He first loved us, that He gave Himself for us.<br><br>4) <span style="font-style: italic;">The whole idea that some christians subscribe to - salvation by faith not works/deeds - is a lie or at best a half truth.</span><br><br>Please notice the word "by" in verse 8 and the word "for" in verse 10 below. We are saved  BY grace through faith......not of works but FOR good works.<br><br>Paul said that:<br><br>Eph 2:8 For <strong>by</strong> grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,<br><br>Eph 2:9 not of works, lest anyone should boast.<br><br>Eph 2:10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus <strong>for</strong> good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>to sum it up:<br>faith first, then comes love and righteosness</div>
