            <div class='col-md body'>It is true that we need to fear God. It is mentioned repeatedly that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. If you believe in a good God, then you should be afraid of being separated from Him eternally.<br><br>Historically, mankind have had difficulties agreeing. A simple act maybe be perfectly fine in one culture, but it may be a taboo in another. So it is impossible for Man to define and agree what is right or wrong. On what does Man measure good and bad? Is anybody, government or instituion able to do so?<br><br>Supposedly someone is able to do so. Assuming that there must be consequences to doing right and wrong (if not, there will be chaos). Then we ultimately be subjected to fear of breaking these rules set out. Fear is not a bad thing. It is what or whom you place your fear on. Can you place your trust in a government run by humans totally?<br><br>There is a cost of being a Christian, there is no free lunch in the world.</div>

It uses your fear of hell to make you believe in God, to make you love him, to make you do what he wants.<br><br>Christianity seems very real. But it restricts. No gambling, no pre-marital sex, no violence, no this, no that. Hell it even restricts your recreational activities, saying that one should not spend too much time on them.<br><br>You guys like a God that uses intimidation, restriction on you?<br><br>The hymns make christianity seem so real. The feel good factor of following Christ's steps make it real. Your belief in God and doing his work makes it real. Your communication with God through prayer makes it real. But its not.<br><br>I dont feel it. I dont feel God's love. He allows so much suffering on earth. God is love. Isnt that contradictory?<br><br>If God really loves us, wouldnt he let us do what we want instead of defining it as sin?<br></div></blockquote>Even if you change your lifestyle from sinning to living a religious life.if it is just that then when yoou die you will still go to hell.<br><br>There is a difference between attrition and contrition my friend.<br><br>Atrition is 'turning away from sin' so that you will escape hell. That is not true repentance.<br><br>Contrition is turning away from sin because it is Sin Against an Almighty God who is loving, gracious and worthy of all my all whether heaven or hell exist.<br><br>You got it wrong my friend. God is not a little kid. He cannot be mocked.<br><br>What's your motive of not sinning? To escape hell ?<br><br>If that is all it: you will still go to hell. You heart has not been changed by grace.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If one should not believe in the Christian God then very well and then, let us cast Him down as a piece of evil dogma that only seeks to hinder all joys.<br><br>But that leaves the bigger question of where all these joys and pleasures come from, let there be no joy and fear and let us be free to seek this happiness... it seems that the initial attraction of athiesm suddenly turns sour when one realizes the cold brutality of the creed.<br><br>Having done away with any form of rules, it seems the only rule we have is that of power. The strongest and fittest shall rule in the end, and the strongest and fittest do not care a whilt for the suffering. But then there is no God, no nothing to resist them, nothing to say they ought to do otherwise. They are the gods and nothing is there to stop them.<br><br>So what exactly do we want? We want to be free to make our choices without anybody cutting our fun. But being free to make choices without restrictions means being free to do things that might hurt and sadden others. And if there are no rules against these evils what hope do we have?<br><br>It seems to me to have happiness you have to follow a certain set of absolute rules and apply to all men irregardless of how high or how low they are. And this set of rules cannot be given by man, but by something higher and beyond him. Trace this far back enough we would have arrived at God yet again.<br><br>Toss away God from the picture, and you will not have to fear the threat of hell, because there will be hell on earth. The fear would have become the reality.<br><br>So why is there the fear? We ought to be thinking why we are blessed enough to be in the state to fear hell, rather then be in the (as we so deserved) very place itself. The fear is an act of mercy and not cruelty, the moment one thinks of it.<br><br>I do not for a moment think the fear is the main motivation for those who realize that those rules are out there for our own good so that we might have as much happiness, even more then we could ever have now.<br><br>It seems to me that God does not want us to just enjoy and see the pleasures we have around us, He wants to give us the real and proper things of eden, but reaching there involves sacrifice (because we have the choice) of the unreal things we make the choice to hold onto now.<br><br>So in the end the choice is still yours.<br><br>What say you?<br><br>Speaking of another kind of fear (not the threatening kind but the kind where we find God scary and awesome), I don't see anything wrong about it... we <span style="font-style: italic;">ought</span> to be scared of God.<br><br>God loves us, that's why he cannot just let us do whatever we want, because so often what we think we want turns out to be the very thing we hate. It seems that all His bothersome efforts to mess with us are an effort to give us the thing we really wanted all the while. If only we could trust Him.</div>

There is a good reason for the scandal of grace, but one needs to be humble enough to accept it. A person who has reason to view himself as higher (in certain conditions) then other men will never understand grace as it was for him.<br><br>It might have something to do with the fact that we are no better then that psyco.
