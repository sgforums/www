Isnt that contradictory?<br><br>If God really loves us, wouldnt he let us do what we want instead of defining it as sin?<br></div></blockquote>actually, you can do anything you want to do, God does not restrict you, even the bible says so, everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial. This verse sums it up very clearly, you can do anything you want, but know that God when He created the world, set in motion certain rules and principles and put certain laws in place and you have to realise that if you choose a certain path, it will carry certain consequences. So ultimately, the choice is still yours.<br><br>Since you say you do not fear anything, then what is the point of posting this?<br><br>God does not use fear for us to come to Him, He uses love. But when you choose God of your own free will, then you also choose His ways and you have to have a clear understanding of what this means.<br><br>If you truly know God, and understand Him, you will come to realise that His ways are actually the best and they allow us to live a life of absolute freedom.<br><br>Like what ironside has said, if you come to the Lord because you fear hell, they you do it for the wrong reason. Your heart is not repentant and the important thing in your relationship with God is keeping a repentant heart.<br><br>With regards to the senior person in your church who said that you could not listen to secular music, well, it may work for him, but what does the Holy Spirit say about it to you? Where does God want you to take your stand? God will and can speak very specifically in our lives if you are in tune with Him and can hear His soft small voice.<br><br>Last thing, our God is not so unjust as to let humans burn in hell for eternity. If you read through the bible, those people who do not believe in God and do not choose His ways, will be totally annihilated forever. No burning in hell forever, except for hasatan and his cohorts.</div>
