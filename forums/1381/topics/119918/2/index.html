But don't you think picking on Christians is going to upset them, just because ornerboy and maybe a couple of others get on your nerves?

Not Eternal Flame.<br><br><blockquote>seriously, i dont see any reference to any other religion in other forums, but only in EH it persist....wanna bet?</blockquote>  And who started it?  Many a times a clean Christian topic will end with some anti-Christians unfavourable judgement.  Wanna bet?   While I see non Christians stirring up this forum, I am glad that Christians don't go to HOFS etc to create trouble, which is why you "dont see any reference to any other religion in other forums, but only in EH it persist".<br><br><blockquote>wanna stop us? give us no reason to do so... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </blockquote>My reason has been put in very simple English.

The topic on our ancient Ancestors who have not heard of Christ.  The discussion was made out of love for our grandparents, and those before them.  It wasn't started for the purpose of condemning our ancestors' religion.  I'm afraid some of you might have misunderstood her question in the thread.</div>

The topic on our ancient Ancestors who have not heard of Christ.  The discussion was made out of love for our grandparents, and those before them.  It wasn't started for the purpose of condemning our ancestors' religion.  I'm afraid some of you might have misunderstood her question in the thread.</div></blockquote>I am afraid, and i explained many times, that whatever our ancestors practised still exist today.<br><br>Since we are talking in sgforums, and sg having a multi racial multi religious society, it will be the Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese folklore.<br><br>Trying to go along the line our ancestors go wrong, is akin to chaffing present faiths now. And i am afraid its a minefield to step in by opening such topic.<br><br>Secondly, a lot of people always think because EH is a wholly Christian forum, that they have a) the freedom of choice to talk whatever they want and b) others have a choice not to click on that topic.<br><br>i can say nothing but freedom of speech and freedom of choice are nothing but poor cover for neglecting responsibilty.<br><br>This is, no matter what people say, a public forum. Its akin to a pastor deriding other faiths within church grounds, but within earshot of passer bys, and he claimed passer bys have choice not to hear. No attempt is made to hold such talks at enclosed room or out of earshot of passer bys.<br><br>If anyone think non believers can stand by and do nothing, while their faiths have been abused, think again.<br><br>It also become another issue of people thinking they gain superiority over others simple because they follow a certain faith. Where is the humility?<br><br>By proposing non believers have the choice not to click onto a topic, sumtimes i can do nothing but to shake head at such arrogance.</div>

But comparing few denominations and looking at my Catholic cousins, there is a shift in the Christian world.<br><br>There are abuses within the RC world from the middle age, where the popes do commit crimes such as declaring war for political gains, rape and looting.<br><br>After which such abuses are relieved by Martin Luther and his 95 theses.<br><br>Then the whole thing shift against RC. RC becoms like weak lamb, while the Christian Protestantism Evangelism gooblegook took over.<br><br>I am appalled by the evangelism stance sometimes, where there is no effort to make peace, where people chide other faiths for the glory of god.<br><br>RC takes a peaceful stance, and now is sometimes subjected to chiding and teasing by prostestants. I thought they have such things in early years of USA, by KKK, and in 17th century Europe, where they tot everything was a Jesuit plot.<br><br>But, it happens here, which is appalling.<br><br>I wont be a Christian, but I admire the RC peaceful stance the most.<br><br></div>

Need I say more?<br><br>Besides, if i were to questioned why i picked a bone abt something that happened in mid 2004, it means two things<br><br>There is such a thing exist. There are proud Christians who make such contemptuous remarks.<br><br>Second, fact is fact. There are such things happened. I dont see a problem with the timeframe. If I committed a crime ten years ago, am i to stay out the storm and hope to get forgiveness ten years later?<br><br>So i cant mention something because it does happen and that it happen 'so long' ago? Anyway, the time frame is opened to abuses by people who simply what to set it aside as picking bones. Good try. But not on me.<br><br>And i mention right from first page, there are black sheeps. Its u guys responsibility to advise them. Just because there are so few, doesnt give anyone the right to simply put them down as the insignificant few. Also another excuse to turn blind to these issues.<br><br>Lastly the forum objective..hmm, sounds nice, but never in practice. If u guys dont know, and i wont reveal who, there are people who propose to forum founder long long time ago to try to mod the tone of some of the extremist. Never been done. Alredi lost hope long time ago liao lor, need to put in forum objective in front of me for fiak? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
