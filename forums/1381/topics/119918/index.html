            <div class='col-md body'>So far I don't see anything wrong with the Christians in this forum.  In fact, I do see another faith not being religiously tolerent and gets very sensitive when his/her faith was mentioned.  I literally got this response : "What has it (the topic) got to do with ****** (the person's belief)?"  I was merely using it as an example and nothing negative.<br><br>While anti-Christians unreservedly criticized Christian's faith, just take a look at how many Christians actually take part in the arguments.  What is the ratio?  I can safely conclude that most of them are quite forgiving.  Just take a look at this forum.  We don't see the moderators deleting I-THINK-I-am-smarter-than-Christians messages even though the messages make no sense at all and the moderators are given the rights to delete or edit the message.<br><br>Regardless of how smart some people think they are, they fail to understand a simple thing that I reckon even my Pri sch nephew could comprehend fully : This is a Christian forum.  It is called Eternal Hope.  Every sub forum created has its purpose.  Eg. House of Fengshui is for Buddhist, Taoist, people to talk about fortune telling &amp; fengshui.<br><br>Likewise, Eternal Hope is meant for those in the Christians faith to share with and inspire one another.  You don't see any of us going HOFS to say "Hey, Christians don't believe in such things".<br><br>This is not a forum for people to be smart.  Too bad, for the one who IS STILL TRYING to look smarter than the 2000 year old church.  No wonder he is used to insults (he said one ah, not I said).  Well, we all can see why he receives so many insults (inside and outside forum) on a daily basis until he is used to insults.  Well, other than the big hearted ones in Eternal Hope forum, who in the right frame of mind, don't want to insult him.</div>

I just wish to address issues.  You bring up so many points, but you can't support them with anything.  You only claim that it's too late blah blah blah.  But I've been reading all these while.  I don't see anything.  Maybe you can see something that i don't.  I don't claim to be smarter than anyone anyway.  So I am giving you a chance to show to me what you claim that I can't see.  I just want to be fair to you and those that you accuse.<br><br>I don't mean to argue.  And I don't intend to win in any arguments.  In every discussion there is an objective.  My purpose is to support Singaporemacros in this topic.  cuz if he doesn't start this thread, I will as I see every reason to do so.<br><br>If you can't support your argument with anything substantial, then calling me a foolish woman might be a clever way of getting out of it.  Not personal attack.  Just mere observation of ppl losing in debates and quarrels.</div>
