              <p>this forum failed because</p>
              <p>1. the refusal to accept that this is a Christian-themed forum....  the incessant declaration that it is public forum fails to hide the fact that there is a theme, and if you don't like the theme, get lost. Of course anyone can post if they want to ask a question, but many TS are just looking for a fight.</p>
              <p>2. the inability for non-Christian and atheists to stay away.... nobody is pointing a gun at you to ask you to read things that you don't agree about.... KPKB for what? It will be equally wrong for Christians to do the same thing to the Buddhist forum.</p>
              <p>3. the refusal to accept that the previous mods had the rights to remove and lock threads that are deemed inappropriate.... if mods go no rights, mod for what?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I fail to understand the mentality of people who, for no rhymes or reason, continue to support the popularity of a forum that they do not agree on.... each time a post comes in, it boost the rating of Eternal Hope.</p>
              <p>These people are either too damn free, or as delusional as the Christians that they are trying to discredit by boosting the rating of EH.... either way... thank you... because of you, EH cannot die.</p>

              <p>i beg to differ. </p>
              <p>from my interaction with Rooney9 in other threads, he failed to answer my question and he did admit that "<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; color: #333333;">I have yet to see a coherent and logical replies posed by non believers." [You can find this post in the thread he started on Namecalling and mudslinging]</span></p>
              <p>While he has been honest about this point (to his credit) i cannot say the same for other non believers. We all need to think a bit more about our positions, not just for non theists. I say this to remind myself too as a theist. </p>

              <p><br>I have not read all the recent posts be it in this topic or another, but just want to share a few things.</p>
              <p>Bad posts have been made by both Christians and non-Christians.</p>
              <p>It is unfair to say that there are members of only one 'side' for lack of a better word who are guilty of anything that one person is saying about another.</p>
              <p>There are people here who are fully into the conflict only, and this so called trolling thing is not only by non-christians or Christians here only here. There are even those who know they are trolling and continue to do so, even to the point of accusing others of doing so.</p>
              <p>There are those who are fully aware that this forum will not be closed no matter how demeaning or inflamatory some of the posts and topics are, and they continue to add to it because they know this.</p>
              <p>Even the non-Christians have seen this forum has become a Christian bashing thread, whether that is right or wrong, deserved or undeserved, many know that this is what it has become.</p>
              <p>There are so many of the tolerant Christians and non-Christians, many of those who have not posted and are very much neutral in this whole conflict or at the very least understanding and religiously tolerant. There are many more such people in the world outside of sgforums.</p>
              <p>There are many Christians who do not conform to the stereotype many of the anti-Christians (to differentiate from non-Christians in general), yet they ignore this totally time and time again. On the other hand, there are Christians who should revisit their faiths and beliefs and what is it they should stand for or should believe in. Christiains who need to learn to be as tolerant of the rights of others as there are those who are tolerant of theirs.</p>
              <p>There is good and bad among all groups of people, to assume all are the same is wrong. Not all muslims are members of al-Qaeda, not all Buddhists refrain from eating beef or are vegetarian. Likewise not all non-Christians are anti-Christians, and not every member of any religious group is part of a cult or extremist group.</p>

              <p>life and our universe has no beginning at all. why must there be
              a beginning. if there is a beginning, surely there must be an end.
              it is simple to attribute life and the universe to a creator
              because this explains everything very easily. god create DNA, sperm
              etc etc which is the building blocks of life. god created the earth
              in 6 days and many others. no need to rack your brains out and just
              say god created this.</p>
              <p>anyway I know how your faiths works lar. I certainly do not
              agree there is a creator in our midst. although science cant
              explain everything, but it helps to dispel the myths of so many
              things. unfortunately our ancient ancestors did not get to share
              the knowledge that we have. at least we now know that tsunamis is
              not the act of god, same as volcanic eruptions. if u study
              geography, you will know. we know earth was round and not
              square.</p>
              <p>anyway I do not think you can fathom a world without a creator.
              einstein said, everything is relative. it does not exists
              independently, but depending on causality. as for the big bang, it
              is a theory, but it is a better alternative to the concept of
              a creator.</p>

              <p>For theist, science can't explain all, so they elaborate the theory of a
              god. Unfortunately, this theory is as much obscure and doesn't explain
              all either For atheist, science could maybe ultimately explain all, but we're not
              there atm, they accept it. We didn't pretend we can explain all. Do you know that einstein is actually is a thesist ? At least i read that from somewhere.</p>
              <p>And as for proof, proof to me god exist, why not change it to proof it to me god doesnt exist.</p>

              <p>anyway all I can say is this. compared to the past where science and technology, we are definitely better equipped to understand our world than our forebears in the ancient past. just imagine living in that era, where science, medicine and tech were so rudimentary. theist flourished in that kind of environment than now because illiteracy were so rampant.</p>
              <p>not only god, alot of things also set me thinking like the chinese customs and beliefs system. I can sum it up that, the chinese going to temple offering food and fruits to their god to ask for 4D, good health, career advancements etc are exactly the same as believers praying to god for strength, health, blessings etc. some pray is due to fear and some are just plain greedy. some pray because they want to connect to spirituality.</p>

              <p>Actually, that last post was not intended for public eyes. Not that I'm ashamed of it or anything just that it was supposed to be a reply to somebody's private message to me.</p>
              <p>Still, it really is very ironic how a certain invididual goes around accusing others of lying and of trolling when he himself as guilty if not definitely guiltier.</p>
              <p>And about that topic accusing me of being a clone, well, at least two people who had said I was a clone in that topic have agreed though privately with me that I and that david guy are different people. One even said I should not have been caught up in it at all.</p>
              <p>Still, be it accusing me or any other person of trolling, the irony and especially the hypocrysy is blatant and obviously there.</p>
