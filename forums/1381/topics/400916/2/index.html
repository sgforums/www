              <p><br>yes you are spot on. we all have unpleasant encounters with christians. my christian female boss. I was having a conversation with her on work, when suddenly she talked about praying to an idol made of wood and I was like, what was that for? When I talked about heaven and believed that whether we are chinese, indians or malay or caucasians, we will go to the same place after death. my christian classmate then barged in and said not so. only those who accepted Jesus will go to heaven and I was like.....I was talking to a friend on causality, cause and effect, when a christian friend interuppted and uttered, I dun believe that. I didnt respond to him, I just kept quiet. so you expected me to believe in god instead lol. so when he talked about god, should I say its all bullshit? so far, I have not said anything bad to christians in real life, but if they continue this type of behaviours, I will not rule out being rude in return.</p>

              <p>you can justify Rony Tan blasting of other faiths they are satanic and false religions?</p>
              <p>so why arent Rony Tan concentrate on his own gospel and mind his own business? he even have the cheek to find a psuedo buddhist and ask him to discredit the teachings. you mean to say christians have the right to critisize other faiths? and he is not alone in doing that, mind you. there are countless christians who do that.</p>

              <p>Fact is be more tolerant and learn to ignore. Works both ways, you to him, him to you. ignoring doesnt mean that you just admited you are a loser, but you know the fact that he holds strongly to his faith. He is childish enough to take a dig at other religions. Tossing accusations back and forth with no true allegation and bear nothing
              but animosity towards it proc them to do the same to you. You attack
              them, they attack you. So where does it end? When the other side is
