              <p>the forum is meant for a healthy discussion on christianity.</p>
              <p>Rooney and laurence have brought up their viewpoint which are
                              valid.</p>
              <p>Christians should examine alternative viewpoint before
                              commenting.</p>
              <p>Scripture quoting holds no weight. Only logical and rational
                              argument are of value.</p>
              <p>It is improper for pastor to manipulate the church for his own
                              well- being. that is for sure. the duty of the pastor is to care
                              for the flock. but they have deviated from their calling and has
                              fleeced the flock instead of caring for it.</p>
              <p>This, the christians, cannot deny. The truth is the truth. CHC
                              should not have invested in suntec . CHC should have used the money
                              to help the poor.</p>
              <p>This is why laurence and roony are so indignant at the matter.
                              They have a right to show contempt because the Church has
                              mismanaged its affairs.</p>
              <p>Christians feel that non-christians have no right to judge the
                              church. but  has the church done right? have the pastor done
                              right? have the church serve its true purpose as a house of prayer
                              or has it become a clubhouse where the opposite sex flirt with each
                              other?</p>
              <p>Christians, do not be angry with rooney and laurence. Instead of
                              bashing laurence and rooney, why dun the christians self-reflect on
                              your own faults and misgivings.Admit your error and fault, repent
                              and strive to be a better person. When you have achieve in doing
                              that, laurence and rooney 's contempt will be resolved.</p>

              <p>Hi there, there is nothing wrong with presenting an alternative viewpoint. To be fair, not everyone who has come to EH with an "alternative viewpoint" has good intentions. Sometimes it's not even about their viewpoint but all about the conflict in itself. We also have a few Christians (or that's what claim to be so we take at face value), who are more into the conflict as well.</p>
              <p>It is sad, whether you are a Christian or not that you make posts and replies in good faith but the other party is only seeking to cause trouble and incite conflict.</p>
              <p>This sub-forum has long ceased being a place of genuine discussion and sharing of views. To blame any one group would be wrong. Some people even knowingly add to it to make it worse.</p>
              <p>There have been those of us who have admitted like you said that mistakes have been made by those who call themselves Christians and we even agree if wrong-doing has been done. We have also conceded since they have done wrong, and such people should be told and dealt with accordingly.</p>
              <p>However, such comments are often largely ignored, and this is not true of all non-Christians, but only certain anti-Christians, they insist on focusing on negative stereotypes even when presented with clear examples of those who don't conform or practice the negative stereotypes. Which brings in the irony of being accused of not listening to alternative views.</p>
              <p>For example, there have been Christians who have said they don't agree with how CHC gets money and how they use it, not just now but even in the past years ago. But this is ignored and sometimes blatantly even.</p>
              <p>Once again, I stress again I agree with you that we should listen to alternative views. But not everyone with an "alternative view" is the same. At the same time, Christians at large should learn how to respond and handle these different types of people with "alternative view". I also believe your advice about listening to alternative views that any person can heed, not just one specific group of people.</p>

              <p>The irony of your comments.</p>
              <p>Still, while not true of every non-Christian posting in EH, there certainly have been those who come here with very malicious intent. Of this I'm sure you are very aware, you yourself have ever commented against a non-Christian or two who have gone too far.</p>
              <p>Saying non-Christians at large are blamed is not true, neither do all of us always mention Satan when we talk about causes as to why this forum is in such a bad state. In fact, most of us don't.</p>
              <p>And to some people, they are all about the arguement and conflict. It is not even what their stand is whether as a Christian or non-Christian. Certain individuals are all about the conflict and arguing because of arguing.</p>
