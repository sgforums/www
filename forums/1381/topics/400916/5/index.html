              <p>Yes, you too know it's weird to be accused by him of
              trolling.</p>
              <p>It's like a serial rapist accusing others of being peeping toms,
              or a mass murdering accusing others of assault.</p>
              <p>You yourself are neither a Christian nor someone who posts in
              EH, yet you can see he is blatantly trolling yet accusing others of
              trolling. Even some of his fellow p-members and other regular
              posters know he is trolling even if they do not say anything about
              it. Even those whom some think are his friends are aware he
              trolls.</p>
              <p>I have sent a message to Jason about his accusation towards me
              being another poster under a different name, but he still continued
              to do it. Either Jason or whoever else chose not to act on it, or
              they told him yet he continues to do so. I'm not sure which is
              it.</p>
              <p>Either way, have a good day yourself. May be weeks or months
              again before I message you.</p>

              <p>Since you mention about copernicus, why not think about Galileo as well.</p>
              <p>Also, I have ever mentioned this more than once. Science and belief in God doesn't have to go two ways. Afterall, nothing happens in contrary to nature but only man's understanding of nature.</p>
              <p>I myself view science as man's understanding of what God has created. Afterall, men of science such as Isaac N ewtown were Christians as well. In fact there are in existence scientists who are Christians, and even Scientists who are not Christians but support creationist theory.</p>
              <p>To say Christians in general are against science would be a sweeping statement. Scientists within themselves have differing views not just on creation but many things in general.</p>

              <p>Actually, that last post was not intended for public eyes. Not
              that I'm ashamed of it or anything just that it was supposed to be
              a reply to somebody's private message to me.</p>
              <p>Still, it really is very ironic how a certain invididual goes
              around accusing others of lying and of trolling when he himself as
              guilty if not definitely guiltier.</p>
              <p>And about that topic accusing me of being a clone, well, at
              least two people who had said I was a clone in that topic have
              agreed though privately with me that I and that david guy are
              different people. One even said I should not have been caught up in
              it at all.</p>
              <p>Still, be it accusing me or any other person of trolling, the

              <p>I would just like to point out again to many people, that there are many examples of the people who dont conform to your stereotype, be it Christian or non-Christian or even members of any faith.</p>
              <p>Very often especially in this forum, there have been people who have encountered people who clearly do not conform to the stereotypes they have raised. Yet they ignore this fact and also even when replies are given in good faith, these same people do not act in the same good faith either.</p>
              <p>Not every muslim is a member of Al Qaeda, and not every Buddhist is a vegetarian or doesn't eat beef.</p>
              <p>There are many people here and even more in the rest of Singapore and the wider world who would respect the right of others to not believe or to believe in any other religion, whether that person believes in it himself or herself.</p>
              <p>I am glad for the friends I have of many different faiths and those without any faith who respect each other's right to believe or not to believe, and their own individual practices of their respective faiths.</p>
              <p>Think about it also what you are against or for, or are you just all about the conflict regardless of what the stand of the other person is or what they are saying.</p>

It does not help when they told you, the idol you are praying is made of wood.  I suppose everyone of us here have had some contacts with these people.

              <p>To continue on science. We infer science is great and true because we are surrounded by it, we
              infer that our brains exist by dissecting other skulls, as well as all
              our other body parts.<br> <br> That is because all possible knowledge depends on the validity of reasoning. But if scientific words like <em>must be, therefore,</em> and <em>since</em>;
              then this certainty is merely a feeling based upon the authority of
              other minds. Of course, if that is true then the theory explaining
              everything (no longer called string theory, but m-theory) would be in
              contradiction because the theory itself would have been reached through
              thinking. If you believe that it is possible then, in a way there is no
              such thing as free will, only the ultimatum of a world simply chasing
              after its own freedom when in fact there is none.</p>
              <p>The idea of authority is merely a submission of sorts, and in terms of
              both religion and science we do give authority. The difference is
              giving authority to some grand vague object that may or may not be
              there, against the authority of other humans.</p>
