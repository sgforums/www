              <p>To continue on science. We infer science is great and true
              because we are surrounded by it, we infer that our brains exist by
              dissecting other skulls, as well as all our other body parts.<br> <br> That is because all possible knowledge depends on the validity of
              reasoning. But if scientific words like <em>must be,
              therefore,</em> and <em>since</em>; then this certainty is merely a
              feeling based upon the authority of other minds. Of course, if that
              is true then the theory explaining everything (no longer called
              string theory, but m-theory) would be in contradiction because the
              theory itself would have been reached through thinking. If you
              believe that it is possible then, in a way there is no such thing
              as free will, only the ultimatum of a world simply chasing after
              its own freedom when in fact there is none.</p>
              <p>The idea of authority is merely a submission of sorts, and in
              terms of both religion and science we do give authority. The
              difference is giving authority to some grand vague object that may
              or may not be there, against the authority of other humans.</p>

              <p>the inference is invalid. even if dissected human skulls have brains, it doesnt necessarily mean that all humans have brains. maybe the brain was something that grew after the person died? no grounds for generalization. </p>
              <p>knowledge is acquired through the reasoning process. when we infer something, we're presupposing logic. </p>
              <p>science and religion both subscribe to dogma then? </p>

              <p>Looks more like a christian bashing forum to me.</p>
              <p>Even the replies by non-believers admit its a christian bashing forum. The oblique view is quite obviously clear.</p>
              <p>Seriously Laurence82 ,Rooney9 and some other nicknames, you guys can create an anti-christ forum or anti-religion forum out there and rally your people there and lamblast all you want. But maybe you guys worry no one will entertain you guys there thats why you come here ? I think I will bet my left nut on it.</p>
              <p>Saying Christianity is unbelievable and wrong is one thing, saying ALL christians are like Rony Tan is another.</p>
              <p>It wouldve been cool to keep the discussion in a non-general view for some constructive comments and opinion not only helping fellow christians like how it is intended in the beginning and non-believers alike. But no, its ironic that those that blame others for being intolerant are the ones that are being the intolerent ones. The hypocrisy ?</p>
              <p>The previous mods have been weak. And its understandable due to their nature. And its always people like these who gets taken down. They meant well, generally of good heart, unfortunately that comes also with the price of sensitivity and the likes that derive from their nature. I admit that EH is not easy to be moderated by such people, but its not easy to find someone who can answer whole questions accordingly to the bible and still maintaining an iron fist while unmoved by the masses.</p>
              <p>For the people that know them in real life through SgForums, I wonder what are your views on having friends like these. =) Do they manifest themselves online in real life ? Or are they totally different online and offline ? Which is more worrying ?</p>
              <p>I have staunch aetheist friends but we ALWAYS come down to an understanding. In fact, we find the topics and discussion entertaining even during drinking. But never has it escalated to generalisation, to generalize is to be an idiot. To particularize is the alone 
              distinction of merit. General knowledge are those knowledge that idiots 
              possess.</p>

              <p>"Dear friends,<br> <br> It is with great sadness that I am writing this.
                   I have proposed to
                                          Chin Eng and ben1xy on closing this forum. We 
                  have agreed that we
                                          will no longer keep this forum active.<br> <br> I am no longer able to actively read posts in 
                  this forum and be an
                                          effective moderator because of family and work 
                  priorities. As I
                                          consider about lessening my activities here, it 
                  will not be fair to
                                          let the other moderators bear too much of the 
                  load. Hence, we will
                                          close this forum.<br> <br> The secondary reason in closing this forum is 
                  because of the recent
                                          activities in EH has made it unpleasant to me to
                   visit this forum.
                                          I love God and would love to share my joy with 
                  whoever is
                                          interested to know more. But I feel it is no 
                  longer sensible to
                                          share when our views are repeated put down just 
                  because someone is
                                          not agreeable to our faith.<br> <br> Instead of appearing to be a thorn in the flesh,
                   it is best that we
                                          remove our presence here.<br> <br> Eternal Hope was started as a gathering place 
                  for fellow Christians
                                          in sgForums. I have made many good friends 
                  through this forum and
                                          my stay here was mostly enjoyable.<br> <br> To the "old gang", Choco B, the Bear, 
                  skinnybeanie, Inzaghi, M,
                                          s|nned, tare, NT2 etc., my beginnings in here 
                  was made wonderful by
                                          all of you.<br> <br> To Chin Eng, ben1xy, Icemoon, laurence82, 
                  vince69, laoda99, thank
                                          you. Thank you for the knowedge I have learnt

                                          for the friendship I have with you. (though I 
                  did not have the
                                          opportunity to meet some of you)<br> <br> From this day, Eternal Hope will no longer

              view for some constructive comments and opinion not only helping
              fellow christians like how it is intended in the beginning and
              non-believers alike. But no, its ironic that those that blame
              others for being intolerant are the ones that are being the
              intolerent ones. The hypocrisy ?</p>
              <p>The previous mods have been weak. And its understandable due to
              their nature. And its always people like these who gets taken down.
              They meant well, generally of good heart, unfortunately that comes
              also with the price of sensitivity and the likes that derive from
              their nature. I admit that EH is not easy to be moderated by such
              people, but its not easy to find someone who can answer whole
              questions accordingly to the bible and still maintaining an iron
              fist while unmoved by the masses.</p>
              <p>For the people that know them in real life through SgForums, I
              wonder what are your views on having friends like these. =) Do they
              manifest themselves online in real life ? Or are they totally
              different online and offline ? Which is more worrying ?</p>
              <p>I have staunch aetheist friends but we ALWAYS come down to an
              understanding. In fact, we find the topics and discussion
              entertaining even during drinking. But never has it escalated to
              generalisation, to generalize is to be an idiot. To particularize
              is the alone distinction of merit. General knowledge are those
              knowledge that idiots possess.</p>

              <p>I wish to emphasize that there is a difference between non-Christians and anti-Christians.</p>
              <p>To say the some of the anti-Christians who have been here as the same as non-Christians at large would be an insult to non-Christians.</p>
              <p>Nobody is using non-Christians as scapegoats, the fact remains that there have been people who have posted here purely for the sake of conflict and conflict only. Some who even encourage for threads and topics to become name-calling and mud-slinging, no matter who it is that does the name-calling. This thing about people posting purely for conflict does not apply to non-Christians only. Christians themselves have either made posts or responded in anger as well.</p>
              <p>It is clear this forum has become a Christian bashing thread, something even non-Christians have commented in this sub-forum itself. Even non-Christians outside of EH understand and know it is happening. Be it right or wrong, deserved or unjustified, this is what it has become.</p>
              <p>It should also be noted that very often, there are people here who ask questions not with the idea of wanting to understand the other person's point of view, but merely looking for a chance to break them down. It is very sad how sometimes people give replies or give views in good spirit and good faith but the other party does not respond as such. Again I stress this is not to Christians or non-Christians only, the forumer known as An Eternal Now has come in to make posts to good faith but was not replied as such.</p>
              <p>It is not  non-Christians at large or even any particular members of any religion who are at fault so to speak. But rather it is the posts and actions of certain individuals here who are more about the conflict than about generally discussing or sharing views, whether or not each person agrees with that view.</p>

              <p>I would like to say again that not all non-Christians have been like the anti-Christians here. To say non-Christians are like these people is an insult to all non-Christians everywhere.</p>
              <p>Not every muslim is a member of Al Qaede, and not every Buddhist is a vegetarian or abstains from beef.</p>
              <p>In fact, EH has even now good-spirited non-Christians who are willing to engage in proper discussion.</p>
              <p>There are others in EH be it Christians or otherwise who respect the right of others to believe in other religions or not to believe altogether. Even more so in the rest of sgforums and even more in the wider world.</p>
              <p>It is something I know some are very aware, but maybe they forget or they choose to forget.</p>

              <p>To make another comment about science, don't assume that just because people have religion they reject science totally.</p>
              <p>Afterall, science in principle is good. That is something not just Christians would say.</p>
              <p>However, even within science itself on matter various aspects and issues within science itself, scientists themselves have differing viewpoints with one another, let alone with people outside of science.</p>
              <p>However, the thing about science is that it is not absolute. Theories and assumptions change, which I feel is nothing bad in itself. It means people at large continue to learn and to explore.</p>
              <p>Maybe the point here is that science in itself is not absolute.</p>

              <p>this forum failed because</p>
              <p>1. the refusal to accept that this is a Christian-themed
                  forum....  the incessant declaration that it is public forum
                  fails to hide the fact that there is a theme, and if you don't like
                  the theme, get lost. Of course anyone can post if they want to ask
                  a question, but many TS are just looking for a fight.</p>
              <p>2. the inability for non-Christian and atheists to stay away....
                  nobody is pointing a gun at you to ask you to read things that you
                  don't agree about.... KPKB for what? It will be equally wrong for
                  Christians to do the same thing to the Buddhist forum.</p>
              <p>3. the refusal to accept that the previous mods had the rights
                  to remove and lock threads that are deemed inappropriate.... if
                  mods go no rights, mod for what?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I fail to understand the mentality of people who, for no rhymes
                  or reason, continue to support the popularity of a forum that they
                  do not agree on.... each time a post comes in, it boost the rating
                  of Eternal Hope.</p>
              <p>These people are either too damn free, or as delusional as the
                  Christians that they are trying to discredit by boosting the rating
                  of EH.... either way... thank you... because of you, EH cannot
                  die.</p>

              <p>1) I pretty much agree with you on this first point. Which is why I say many here come in asking questions or making replies not with the intention of sharing or genuine discussion, but rather their aim is all about the conflict.</p>
              <p>2) Personally I think there is nothing wrong with non-Christians coming here, it is what happends after they come here that is the problem. One one hand, the anti-Christians willl be here to cause trouble, on the other hand, sometimes Christians need to be more careful in their approach and welcome towards non-Christians at large. Christians should be mindful of how they react, even towards the unruly ones. (can't say I do that well, but hopefully I will try to do better)</p>
              <p>No doubt sometimes when one acts in good faith the other does not respond in kind, still let us all at all times remember to respect each others right to believe or not to believe.</p>
              <p>3) The part about mod in this forum, well it's ironic how some of the people who criticized you are even more of what they have said about you. Also, some of these people are very aware that there is no mod and that this forum will not be closed, hence they continue and knowingly come to incite conflict.</p>
