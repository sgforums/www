              <p><br> yes you are spot on. we all have unpleasant encounters with
              christians. my christian female boss. I was having a conversation
              with her on work, when suddenly she talked about praying to an idol
              made of wood and I was like, what was that for? When I talked about
              heaven and believed that whether we are chinese, indians or malay
              or caucasians, we will go to the same place after death. my
              christian classmate then barged in and said not so. only those who
              accepted Jesus will go to heaven and I was like.....I was talking
              to a friend on causality, cause and effect, when a christian friend
              interuppted and uttered, I dun believe that. I didnt respond to
              him, I just kept quiet. so you expected me to believe in god
              instead lol. so when he talked about god, should I say its all
              bullshit? so far, I have not said anything bad to christians in
              real life, but if they continue this type of behaviours, I will not
              rule out being rude in return.</p>

              <p>the forum is meant for a healthy discussion on christianity.</p>
              <p>Rooney and laurence have brought up their viewpoint which are
              valid.</p>
              <p>Christians should examine alternative viewpoint before
              commenting.</p>
              <p>Scripture quoting holds no weight. Only logical and rational
              argument are of value.</p>
              <p>It is improper for pastor to manipulate the church for his own
              well- being. that is for sure. the duty of the pastor is to care
              for the flock. but they have deviated from their calling and has
              fleeced the flock instead of caring for it.</p>
              <p>This, the christians, cannot deny. The truth is the truth. CHC
              should not have invested in suntec . CHC should have used the money
              to help the poor.</p>
              <p>This is why laurence and roony are so indignant at the matter.
              They have a right to show contempt because the Church has
              mismanaged its affairs.</p>
              <p>Christians feel that non-christians have no right to judge the
              church. but  has the church done right? have the pastor done
              right? have the church serve its true purpose as a house of prayer
              or has it become a clubhouse where the opposite sex flirt with each
              other?</p>
              <p>Christians, do not be angry with rooney and laurence. Instead of
              bashing laurence and rooney, why dun the christians self-reflect on
              your own faults and misgivings.Admit your error and fault, repent
              and strive to be a better person. When you have achieve in doing
              that, laurence and rooney 's contempt will be resolved.</p>

              <p>oh yeah, this from the person who thinks he knows everything.. great. So you say you are not at fault at all? You do not have any misgivings? You don't have preconcieved notions? You are totally unbaised? Look at how the rest of the secular world has so totally and royally screwed up and you want to come and point fingers at the church? I mean, I will be the first one to say the church has mismanaged the word of Yahweh, but please...roony's pov is only valid from the way he thinks... other people may not think the same way, so hence it is a subjective way of looking at things as well... no one here can have a totally objective discussion because ALL of us are coloured by our life's experiences.</p>
              <p>If believers accepted the alternative pov, they would not be believers right? so maybe you should consider that they have already considered the other pov and found it wanting? Just as non-christians feel that the church has no right to judge them, so also they have no right to judge the church, if you accept the basic premise that if you want to speak your minds freely, then the other side also has the same right. Same thing can be said of non-christians, right? reflect on your ownselves and stop coming here to take a dump... you have issues look within yourself as to why you do and sort your own self out...</p>

              <p>life and our universe has no beginning at all. why must there be a beginning. if there is a beginning, surely there must be an end. it is simple to attribute life and the universe to a creator because this explains everything very easily. god create DNA, sperm etc etc which is the building blocks of life. god created the earth in 6 days and many others. no need to rack your brains out and just say god created this.</p>
              <p>anyway I know how your faiths works lar. I certainly do not agree there is a creator in our midst. although science cant explain everything, but it helps to dispel the myths of so many things. unfortunately our ancient ancestors did not get to share the knowledge that we have. at least we now know that tsunamis is not the act of god, same as volcanic eruptions. if u study geography, you will know. we know earth was round and not square.</p>
              <p>anyway I do not think you can fathom a world without a creator. einstein said, everything is relative. it does not exists independently, but depending on causality. as for the big bang, it is a theory, but it is a better alternative to the concept of a creator.</p>

              <p>simple lar. because till date, there is no proof of photos, videos, audios that god existed. until you there provide the proof, there are no god. but then if you have proof, you and your brethrens will present them to the whole world by now isnt it. then textbooks, journals and newspapers, magazines will all report that there is god after all. if not, the debate of whether god exists wouldnt lasts until now.</p>
