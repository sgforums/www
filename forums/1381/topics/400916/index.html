              <p>agreed. i've already begun to practise it. </p>
              <p>although i should say that it is fair for atheists to interact, IF they're genuinely interested in discussion and able to reason. but well, there are certainly black sheeps who cannot even afford the most basic courtesy / respect, displaying the same plain lack of tolerance themselves. </p>

              <p>I am amazed to the extent I cant believe what I am reading. they can turn and twist the words to the extent they are portrayed as victims and we are the transgressors.</p>
              <p>well that just goes to show what belief systems they have. anyway I have already maintained my stand. alot of people do not have a good impression of the faith because of their aggressiveness. It does not help when they told you, the idol you are praying is made of wood.  I suppose everyone of us here have had some contacts with these people. I must say I dun think very well on them and the faith after the encounter. I certainly dun see any other religions here or elsewhere that are like them.</p>

              <p>yes I concurred. I have been here for a long time and each time, the replies really smacked of rubbish reasoning and lack of coherence. just like I asked where is the justification of a baby being borned deformed, some alec here has the cheek to say, without abnormality, how do u know what is normal. well there are other many absurd explanations only they can think of. the questions asked is not that difficult really, but their way of deflecting or non answering actually answers the questions really. that says alot about it already if you think about it.</p>

              <p>A  point to note.</p>
              <p>You can bring up your discussion here and spew the utmost blasphemy with no repercussion.</p>
              <p>Christianity has withstood, time and again attacks, like the the Da Vinci Code, and movies like the Second Temptation and numerous caricatures of Jesus. Christianity needs no protection. It stand the test of time.</p>
              <p>Other religions are protected by laws (and their believers threaten you with death) because they are frail and cannot withstand attacks, not to mention continued attacks. Try drawing a caricature of another religion's prophet, and see the government swoop down on you.</p>

              <p>r u sure you are not a christian or are you an associate or relatives of Rony lol. anyway this is not the issue. consider how a few youths are charged and a couple distributing pamphlets outside got jailed time, Rony Tan's trangressions were certainly not as light as them. so where is the consistency in meting out the punishments?</p>
              <p>anyway if you believe he is truly repentent, you are very naive. he apologised because he was forced to, as the espisode was getting the headlines from the papers and alot of people, whether faith or non faith, were condemning him for his seditious talks. if this is not seditious, I dunno what is. sure he was hauled up by ISD but he was given a warning, not even a fine or jail time.</p>
              <p>when u say you are incapable of being objective, are you implying you are objective? why not try asking those youths and the couple who got jailed for their actions, whether Rony was let off lightly? But then you are entitled to your opinions, just like he is also entitlted to his opinions. what right have you got to say he is subjective? if he is subjective, then surely you are also subjective due to the simple reason of your subjectiveness in calling him subjective.</p>

              <p>Ha ha ha I also know about something about Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and even that Pak Ayah and his giant Tea Pot. What would you make out of that?</p>
              <p>The ISD can make me confess that I am part of the conspiracy that assasinated JFK. They are not violent officials, but they have their ways. You figure out how it is.</p>
              <p>I edited that part about not being able to be objective is because on second thought I feel I should  refrain from being personal.</p>
              <p>Basically subjective means your personal opinion, your feelings. By saying the he got of pretty lightly, it is your opinion. The direction of the remark points at you.</p>
              <p>Being objective would be saying what should be for the general population. The direction of the remark points to a goal or standard.</p>
              <p>Those boys who were ordered to see the works of the Muslims first hand, were punished more heavily than Rony Tan? Who does the grading?</p>
              <p>Anyone who says heavy, light or scott free, is being subjective.</p>
              <p>To be objective is to say that education, or more heavy policing should be in place, or such things,  to prevent future occurances.</p>
