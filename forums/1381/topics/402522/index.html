              <p>MONROE, Ohio – A six-story <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385#"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">statue </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">of </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">Jesus</span></span></a> Christ was struck by lightning and burned to the ground, leaving only a
               blackened steel skeleton and pieces of foam that were scooped up by 
              curious onlookers Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The "King of Kings" statue, one of <a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385#"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">southwest </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">Ohio's</span></span></a> most familiar landmarks, had
               stood since 2004 at the evangelical Solid Rock Church along Interstate 
              75 in Monroe, just north of Cincinnati.</p>
              <p>The lightning strike set the statue ablaze around 
              11:15 p.m. Monday, Monroe police dispatchers said.</p>
              <p>The sculpture, about 62 feet tall and 40 feet wide at
               the base, showed Jesus from the torso up and was nicknamed <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385#"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">Touchdown </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">Jesus</span></span></a> because of the way the arms 
              were raised, similar to a referee signaling a touchdown. It was made of 
              plastic foam and fiberglass over a steel frame, which is all that 
              remained Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The nickname is the same used for a famous mural of 
              the resurrected Jesus that overlooks the Notre Dame football stadium.</p>
              <p>The fire spread from the statue to an adjacent 
              amphitheater but was confined to the attic area, and no one was injured,
               police Chief Mark Neu said.</p>
              <p>Estimated damage from the fire was set at $700,000 — 
              $300,000 for the statue and $400,000 for the amphitheater, Fire Capt. 
              Richard Mascarella said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The Ohio State Highway Patrol was at the scene 
              Tuesday to prevent traffic jams and potential accidents from motorists 
              stopping along the highway to take photographs.</p>
              <p>The patrol began issuing citations about 4 p.m. 
              Tuesday <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385#"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">to </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">motorists</span></span></a> for stopping on the side of the highway, dispatcher Adam Brown said. 
              The number of gawkers coupled with construction had slowed I-75 traffic 
              in the area to a crawl, the state Highway Patrol said.</p>
              <p>Some people were scooping up pieces of the statue's 
              foam from the <a id="KonaLink5" class="kLink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385#"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">nearby </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">pond</span></span></a> to take home with them, said 
              church co-pastor Darlene Bishop.</p>
              <p>"This meant a lot to a lot of people," she said.</p>
              <p>Keith Lewis, of nearby Middletown, arrived at the 
              church around 7 a.m. Tuesday to photograph the remains for his wife. 
              Lewis said he had viewed the statue as both an oddity and an 
              inspiration.</p>
              <p>Cassie Browning, a <a id="KonaLink6" class="kLink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385#"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">church </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">member</span></span></a> from Dayton, said she was 
              driving home when she saw smoke and noticed the statue was missing.</p>
              <p>Travelers on I-75 often were startled to come upon 
              the huge statue by the roadside, but many said America needs more 
              symbols like it. So many people stopped at the church campus that <a id="KonaLink7" class="kLink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385#"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">church </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">officials</span></span></a> had to build a walkway to
               accommodate them.</p>
              <p>Bishop said the statue will be rebuilt.</p>
              <p>"It will be back, but this time we are going to try 
              for something fireproof," she said.</p>

              her husband, former horse trader Lawrence Bishop.</p>
              <p>Lawrence Bishop said in 2004 he was trying to help 
              people, not impress them, with the statue. He said his wife proposed the

              <p>Just like the monkey tree phenomenon in Jurong West New Town. The tree has a monkey outline.  Another tree nearby this monkey tree even has an outline of Guan Yin.</p>
              <p>They drew large numbers of cretins who think that they are the manisfestations of the monkey god or Guan Yin. They believe that  praying to those trees will bring them good luck.......hehehehe</p>

              <p>The "King of Kings" statue, one of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385"><span style="color: #366388;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">southwest</span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">Ohio's</span></span></a> most familiar landmarks, had stood since 2004 at the evangelical Solid Rock Church along Interstate 75 in Monroe, just north of Cincinnati.</p>
              <p>The lightning strike set the statue ablaze around 11:15 p.m. Monday, Monroe police dispatchers said.</p>
              <p>The sculpture, about 62 feet tall and 40 feet wide at the base, showed Jesus from the torso up and was nicknamed <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385"><span style="color: #366388;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">Touchdown</span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">Jesus</span></span></a> because of the way the arms were raised, similar to a referee signaling a touchdown. It was made of plastic foam and fiberglass over a steel frame, which is all that remained Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The nickname is the same used for a famous mural of the resurrected Jesus that overlooks the Notre Dame football stadium.</p>
              <p>The fire spread from the statue to an adjacent amphitheater but was confined to the attic area, and no one was injured, police Chief Mark Neu said.</p>
              <p>Estimated damage from the fire was set at $700,000 — $300,000 for the statue and $400,000 for the amphitheater, Fire Capt. Richard Mascarella said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The Ohio State Highway Patrol was at the scene Tuesday to prevent traffic jams and potential accidents from motorists stopping along the highway to take photographs.</p>
              <p>The patrol began issuing citations about 4 p.m. Tuesday <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385"><span style="color: #366388;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">to</span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">motorists</span></span></a> for stopping on the side of the highway, dispatcher Adam Brown said. The number of gawkers coupled with construction had slowed I-75 traffic in the area to a crawl, the state Highway Patrol said.</p>
              <p>Some people were scooping up pieces of the statue's foam from the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385"><span style="color: #366388;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">nearby</span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">pond</span></span></a> to take home with them, said church co-pastor Darlene Bishop.</p>
              <p>"This meant a lot to a lot of people," she said.</p>
              <p>Keith Lewis, of nearby Middletown, arrived at the church around 7 a.m. Tuesday to photograph the remains for his wife. Lewis said he had viewed the statue as both an oddity and an inspiration.</p>
              <p>Cassie Browning, a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385"><span style="color: #366388;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">church</span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">member</span></span></a> from Dayton, said she was driving home when she saw smoke and noticed the statue was missing.</p>
              <p>Travelers on I-75 often were startled to come upon the huge statue by the roadside, but many said America needs more symbols like it. So many people stopped at the church campus that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385"><span style="color: #366388;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">church</span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">officials</span></span></a> had to build a walkway to accommodate them.</p>
              <p>Bishop said the statue will be rebuilt.</p>
              <p>"It will be back, but this time we are going to try for something fireproof," she said.</p>
              <p>The 4,000-member, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lightning_strikes_jesus_statue?bcmt=11208385"><span style="color: #366388;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">nondenominational</span> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; color: #366388 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">church</span></span></a> was founded by Bishop and her husband, former horse trader Lawrence Bishop.</p>
