So if you stay in the east, you belong to a cell group in the east. This makes it easier to meet for cell group meeting and worship, which usually takes place in a member's house.<br><br>A cell group is the smallest unit in a big church (unless they have buddy system? lol). During cell group meetings, they conduct bible study sessions and worship. Worship as in singing songs accompanied by the guitar. On top of that, they could be having birthday celebration for the members or personal admin, like submitting forms or promoting church events.<br><br>Note that a church member can hold multiple roles in a big church. You belong to a cell group and you are encouraged to join a ministry. You could be an usher, a performer, an in-charge for small kids etc. for the latter.<br><br>A cell group is practical for big churches also, in the sense there is coordination to chop [good] seats during the service.</div>
