First, Christ is a unique mediator between man and God because he is the only person who is both God and man. He is the only bridge between the two, the only God-man. But that role as mediator is not compromised in the least by the fact that others intercede for us. Furthermore, Christ is a unique mediator between God and man because he is the Mediator of the New Covenant (Heb. 9:15, 12:24), just as Moses was the mediator (Greek <span style="font-style: italic;">mesites</span>) of the Old Covenant (Gal. 3:19Â–20).<br><br>The intercession of fellow ChristiansÂ—which is what the saints in heaven areÂ—also clearly does not interfere with ChristÂ’s unique mediatorship because in the four verses immediately preceding 1 Timothy 2:5, Paul says that Christians should interceed: "First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. This is good, and pleasing to God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:1Â–4). Clearly, then, intercessory prayers offered by Christians on behalf of others something "good and pleasing to God," not something infringing on ChristÂ’s role as mediator.<br></div>

Of course you should pray to Jesus! But that does not mean it is not also a good thing to ask others to pray for one as well. You also ask why should we ask any Christian, in heaven or on earth, to pray for us when we can ask Jesus directly? If we can go straight to Jesus proves that we should ask no Christian in heaven to pray for us then it also proves that we should ask no Christian on earth to pray for us.<br><br>Praying for each other is simply part of what Christians do. As we see, in 1 Timothy 2:1Â–4, Paul strongly encouraged Christians to intercede for many different things, and that passage is by no means unique in his writings. Elsewhere Paul directly asks others to pray for him (Rom. 15:30Â–32, Eph. 6:18Â–20, Col. 4:3, 1 Thess. 5:25, 2 Thess. 3:1), and he assured them that he was praying for them as well (2 Thess. 1:11). Most fundamentally, Jesus himself required us to pray for others, and not only for those who asked us to do so (Matt. 5:44).<br><br>Since the practice of asking others to pray for us is so highly recommended in Scripture, it cannot be regarded as superfluous on the grounds that one can go directly to Jesus. The New Testament would not recommend it if there were not benefits coming from it. One such benefit is that the faith and devotion of the saints can support our own weaknesses and supply what is lacking in our own faith and devotion. Jesus regularly supplied for one person based on another personÂ’s faith (e.g., Matt. 8:13, 15:28, 17:15Â–18, Mark 9:17Â–29, Luke 8:49Â–55). And it goes without saying that those in heaven, being free of the body and the distractions of this life, have even greater confidence and devotion to God than anyone on earth.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting exchange between the Protestants (Neon, Fandango, Ventin, Extraordinary) and the Catholics (SingaporeMacross, Natasha, Chelle2009). I sense there are many assumptions behind the arguments and counter-arguments presented. I have a few honest questions here.<br><br>1. Where are the Saints and Prophets today? If they can hear our prayers, obviously they're in ... heaven right? Can the transfiguration show that at least for dead prophets, some of their spirits are in heaven? If they're in heaven, are they judged like everyone else during Judgment Day? I can think of three possible Protestant positions regarding the intercession from the Saints. Which is the correct one?<br><br>1. Saints cannot even hear you.<br>2. Saints can hear you, but they're unnecessary.<br>3. Saints can hear you, but such practice is explicitly forbidden/condemned in Scripture.<br><br>I wonder how come no-one asks the angels or even the seraphims and cherubims for help? While Saints may nor may not be in heaven able to hear us, surely angels like Michael and Gabriel have access to God?<br><br>2. While we see so many disagreement in theological issues, surely there're issues agreed unanimously by Catholics and Protestants? I'll think the doctrine of Trinity is one, since nobody rejects the Creeds from the early church regarding the doctrine of Trinity? I quote the Westminister Confession of Faith on the Holy Trinity:<br><br>"In the unity of the Godhead there be three Persons of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternall begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son."<br><br>Don't scare me leh, if this one also cannot agree, then jialat liao .. haha<br><br>3. Christ is the mediator between God and man. I hope no-one disagrees with this. So my question is, is it a technical error, or even blasphemy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> , to pray to Christ DIRECTLY instead to the Heavenly Father? For example, you start the prayer WITH "Dear Jesus Christ ..." and end WITHOUT the "in Jesus name we pray". And how abou the Holy Ghost? You start prayer with "Dear Holy Spirit" and end without "in Jesus name we pray".<br><br>So confusing. If we can pray to Christ directly, then (pardon me) what's the point of even having the one and only mediator Jesus Christ? No gateway! No proxy server!
