            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KittynMeow:</div><div class="quote_body">read in my confirmation class that the breakaway from the Catholic church began in the 1500s... when there was a Reformation in Europe. Before the Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church had beome corrupt in many areas of doctrine and practice. Wrong teachings include:<br>1) salvation through good works<br>2) purgatory and indulgences<br>3) praying to the Virgin Mary and the saints<br>4) transubstantiation - the belief that the bread and wine are Jesus' real body and blood<br>5) authority of the church placed above the authority of the Bible.<br><br>The Reformation was also stimulated by the desire to be free from the political control and dominance of the Pope, to use English rather than Latin in public worship, and to preach the gospel of salvation by faith.<br><br>Martin Luther (1483 - 1546) and John Calvin (1509 - 1546) were key figures in the Reformation of the church in Europe.  Other influential key people include John Wycliffe, King Henry VIII and Thomas Cranmer.<br><br>Hope that info is erm... informative. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Hmm... wrong teachings? Why would you want to jump to such conclusion? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Catholics believe that faith and good works are both important as a christian.. not just one over the other.. You can't believe that Jesus is lord and be mean and all and vice versa...<br>HOWEVER, Ephesians 2:8-9 "For it is by god's grace that you have been saved through faith. It is not the result of your own efforts, but god's gift so that no one can boast about it" Which means to say that at the end, it's God's grace that we are save.. not by our faith or by our works.<br>However, i think both sides get too caught up with the word "Alone"... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Authority of the church... THe bible is the truth, and we all agree that.. it's the good news.. BUT one line can be interpretated with different meanings. and we turn to the church.. IRONically, not many people know that it's in the bible too... 1 Tim 3:12-16 ".... the church of the living god, the pillar and support of the truth... " thats why we don't place one over the other.. we just turn to the church because we believe that when God sent down his holy spirit during pentecost, the holy spirit will guide the church along the way.<br>And for any human civilisation with so many mistakes, the catholic church manage to stand for so long... there's something about it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I've explained purgatory and Mary in another thread and dun wish to explain so please do refer there...BTW, many like to trap catholics with the term praying... What's the definition of prayer? it's a conversation right? We don't pray to mary and the saints.. but we talk to them and ask them to pray for us. And this the catholics are vey sure of... most at least... so please be fair to us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Body and blood of christ... what's so hard to believe that the bread and wine really turned to body and flesh? In many cases, people have reported that the 'bread' they took have turned into flesh... And many are kept in certain chapels in rome and all... For display even. Scientifically, and interestingly, all bloodtype are type AB+ and comes from the muscle from the heart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Coincidence? With god? i doubt it. Whatever it is, the eucharist, as what catholics call the body and blood, does come from the bible. Similarly, the last supper, Christ said "this is my body, take it and eat it and do it in the memory of me..." same for his blood. I don't think the bread did change it's looks and become flesh.. But why did Christ say that? He said this IS my body.. not this is something like my body... Jesus is known not to play with words... it must be so important that christ did it again when he resurrected.<br>We have to understand that it's the change in looks but form... And would anyone dare to eat real flesh in blood? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i don't think i am... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Hope it clears the air more...<br></div>

Are you perhaps refering to the Eastern Catholics, Catholics of a different rite?<br><br>Regarding the eucharist,<br>And Jesus said to them: "I am the bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread that I give is my flesh for the life of the world. The Jews then argued among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" And Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you shall have no life within you. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him". (Jn 6:51-57)</div>

And Catholics love Jesus, so we respect his Mother too...<br><br>Qn: Why do you pray to Mary?<br>My Ans: I am not praying to Her, I am just asking her to pray for me to Jesus coz she is Jesus's Mother, and she is close to Jesus. And if I ask you to pray for me if I have trouble, does that mean I'm worshipping you??<br><br>Qn : why do you carry pictures and idol worship?<br>Ans: Does carrying a picture means idol worshipping?? If you carry a picture of me in yr wallet, does that mean you are worshipping me??<br><br>And how the Methodist comes about I think is because King Henry wants to remarry and is rejected by the Church.... thus he form is own denomination.

It's the prayer that's more important. If you kneel in front of a statue, it does not mean that you are praying to the statue. You are simply using the statue to help you concentrate in your prayers.</div>
