            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Repented John 2:</div><div class="quote_body">Well is he a false prophet? I consider him bothering on heresy &amp; apostasy. He is on very dangerous ground. I like his entertaining &amp; encouraging sermons but there are loopholes in his theology &amp; the exegesis of the verses. I agree we are saved by grace thru faith but other elements of what he preached are bothering on heresy or error in doctrine.<br><br>So what if he is right on the grace part? He is wrong on other parts. He thinks his experience applies to everyone but not so. Experience could be wrong anyway. I find he skips certain verses &amp; cannot explain others well. He tries to link all to grace which i find ok but overdoes it sometimes. Sometimes he gives his own ridiculous twist to the scripture.<br><br>So if a prophet is right on one part but wrong on others, he is a false prophet &amp; can slowly lead to error &amp; apostasy. It can slowly creep in &amp; destroy the faith of many or twist their understanding of the bible. I have left NCC already for good. Yes, undeserved grace is good. But with God's grace, come the responsibility of living a life that is right before God &amp; men. Anyway, does God say salvation is forever even if one sins greatly? There are many verses saying not so.<br><br>One eg of heresy brought up by NT2 was the Holy Communion heresy. I have a friend who told me use plain water also can. If Prince is wrong on one part, he is not a true prophet of God.<br><br>Also he subscribes to the WOF heresy, where one can pray for anything one wants &amp; get them, so long as he confesses right &amp; believes he gets it. He also subscribes to the healing &amp; prosperity gospel, a health &amp; wealth preacher. You mean Christians must be healthy &amp; rich &amp; if they are not, they arent good Christians or even Christians at all? You mean God could give you all the health &amp; wealth you can imagine &amp; pray for &amp; believe for?<br><br>I know i will get bombarded for this but i will like to hear your comments.</div></blockquote>And what makes you so sure that you are right? Me thinks as well, like the holy communion thing and the smoking thing, all blown out of proportion by people who have no discernment. The Holy communion thing was shared by a member of the congregation about how his family member was healed by taking the holy communion, the fact that he improvised is one that should not even be harped on. God can work miracles inspite of our human failings.<br><br>Also, can you claim that you can explain all the verses in the bible well? Are you so sure that you have all the right answers to the biblical verses? Ps prince speaks at the level of understanding which God has given him, you mean you are better?<br><br>So what is wrong with Christians being materially well off? We are the blessed of the Lord! Does it mean that just because you are a Christian, you have to be poor? Many people just hear the first part, and then they switch off, but then do they hear the second part of Ps princes sermon, he also talks about the conditions that God sets for us to be blessed. And also, he talks about God's will being done and not our own. I think ps prince has a clear revelation of what it means to be prosperous. This does not just include wealth, but in our relationships, in our health, our mental psyche etc. If were were not meant to be blessed, why then would God tell us so?<br><br>Health and wealth are our rights as children of God. Even the bible says so. So how is Ps Prince preaching heresy?<br></div>

(well, his church is thousands strong, for starters!) but i think we also need to remember that not every 1 in EVERY church is saved.<br><br>thankfully the NCC isn't under scrutiny for reasons of  which were once highlighted a few years ago in TNP , but still, i guess- NCC is by no means a conservative church.<br><br>So that's my 2 pence worth.<br><br>-WCO <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div></blockquote>Hi WCO,<br>just wonder if you are still attending NCC, if not, have you find a good church to settle in? I would hope that you are able to find one that you are comfortable in that you may continue to grow with the Lord (I am assuming you have accepted the Lord).<br>Don't worry, there are plenty of other good churches in Singapore, hope you can find one that suits your needs.<br>God bless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
