There's already a known interpretation but Ps Prince seems to twist them all somehow to suit his grace message. For eg, i once heard Ps Prince preach abt the parable of the vine. Yes, when we abide in Christ we are blessed but what happens when we don't? When he came to the part abt the pruning of the branches he skipped it without much explaining. I saw his face change a bit as if he tried to hide something. Well can he say God will prune us &amp; make us suffer so we can grow? He can't right with all the prosperity &amp; health &amp; wealth message he is preaching? That's only one personal</strong> eg.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Do you understand the word 'abide"? So what about pruning? Theologians and pastors/elders differ on what are the actual meaning to this parable. But does it mean Ps Prince is wrong? not necessary so. Does God make us suffer? even tat pastors differ</span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Prosperity/health/wealth - if u have a kid, dun u wan him to be in good health? or u prefer him to be sick all the time? dun u wan him to do well in his studies, career and prosper in not juz money but also in his family, in giving, in enjoying life? If u as an earthly father would want the best, then are u saying our Heavenly Father wants us to be sick, be poor, be in poverty and suffer? Funny rite?</span><br><br><strong>Yes, God can work miracles despite our human failings but to desecrate the Holy Communion &amp; still get healing is heresy. Where does the healing come from then? Could be the devil?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">How has NCC's manner of taking the Holy Communion be a desecration to u?<br>Bcoz they believe tat taking the Holy Communion is in remembrance of Jesus, and for Him to suffer all that whipping and beatings on His body SO THAT BY HIS STRIPES WE ARE HEALED and by His death and shedding of His precious blood on the Cross we have forgiveness of sins? So this is desecration to u?<br><br><strong>There is nothing wrong with Christians being well off but is it the main point of being a Christian ie. to be well off? I have bought books from NCC bookshop that subscribes to the WOF heresy, false prosperity message etc. One book says Money Cometh! I thot Christ cometh not money cometh! It was a book teaching abt tithing &amp; offerings. Many books by heretical pastors like Kenneth Copeland etc are found in the bkshop of NCC. Do you Rhema is getting heretical as well in the US?</strong><br><br>Others denominations have said that Billy Graham is heretic becoz he once seek audience with the pope. U believe? Nothing wrong with Kenneth Copeland. U are taking things out of context again. So being a Christian means u cannot be rich, or drive cars? only if u are poor and suffering, then u are holy?<br><br>Letz put it this way, Ps Prince is not wrong when he said God wants us to be rich. The bible is full of examples of God's servants who were blessed by Him. Ps Prince preached this many times - Dun use people to get money, but use money to bless people. If i am not a Christian, and i am in desperate and genuine financial need.....i go to a Christian for help - who would be more helpful to me? The Christian who says "I'll pray for u" and not give a single cent becoz he can't afford it or the Christian who says "here take this money and I'll pray for u too"?</span><br><br>Ok stop here.

I have come across them. They don't need education to grow rich. Why leh? I ask you lah! There is no equal sum game. 80% of the wealth goes to 20% of the people. It's a fact. It's the 80/20 pareto rule. How did all these wealth get to the minority if not by conning? How did all the money get sucked to these people? You mean God rain the money on them &amp; neglected the poor people below? Then i must say God is a really unfair God who favours the rich. But is He like this?</div>

Thanks for your comments. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Stop here? If u wish to make sweeping statements, then u ought to be prepared to listen. Get ur facts rite first <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No malice intended. cheers.</span><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I am no theologian so i can't give theological arguments. Abide means to remain in Christ w/c i suppose is to seek His help in all that we do &amp; we can do nothing without Him. Pruning as we know is like cutting away the lousy parts so that the good parts can grow? So doesnt this involve a bit of suffering &amp; pain? Perhaps u can enlighten me on what the other theologians said.<br><br>I never said God wants us to be sick, poor, etc but did God promise ripe cherries will fall into our laps when we become Christians? Yes, as a father i want my children to be happy &amp; blessed but does it always involve money or will my children always be healthy? What happens if they fall sick due to viruses etc? We live in a sinful world so we also fall sick, become poor etc. &amp; what if God doesnt want to give the wealth or health we ask for? Or what if some believer dies of poor health, or suffers poor health or is poor? U mean God is unkind to that believer? So many people's faith are wrecked bcos Prince &amp; others preach health &amp; wealth but when they are poor &amp; sick they feel rejected by God.<br><br>The Holy Communion was desecrated when it wasnt done properly, like not using the proper materials etc. The message behind it wasnt wrong as by His stripes we are healed, but even theologians differ on what this means. Does it mean even sickness can be healed or just our sins healed?<br><br>People has already been criticisizing Billy Graham, Kenneth Copeland etc for a long time. Search the web &amp; Christians are saying Billy Graham actually works for the devil in wanting an ecumenical church under the catholics etc. Copeland again is a prosperity preacher &amp; some things he did wasnt really truthful. Again i never said Christians cannot be rich, healthy etc. I said if Christians are rich &amp; healthy, then God approves of them but not those who are poor &amp; sick?<br><br>Not just Christians have been charitable btw just to tell u. I have met charitable people from other religions or no religion. So are you saying the Christian who has no money but sincerely prays for the person is of lower grade or status than a Christian who is very rich &amp; gives money &amp; prays at the same time? See what i mean. That was my pt all along!</div>

But real apostles usually have big churches bcos many people listen to them &amp; converts. Even Jesus had a huge following. But when Jesus was under trail how many were with Him? Why did the whole city changed all of a sudden from everyone shouting Hallelujah to Him into crucify Him? Where are all the people? So i am confused like u said.</div>

I think he is, at least entitled to that.<br><br>For starters, the appropriate word is NOT slander but libel, adjective is LIBELOUS.<br><br>Popular religious leaders are always under constant scrutiny of their lifestyles and theology. Joe Prince should not expect anything less than that.<br><br>There is also a large schism pertaining to whether health/wealth gospel is Biblical or not.
