            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">And what makes you so sure that you are right? Me thinks as well, like the holy communion thing and the smoking thing, all blown out of proportion by people who have no discernment. The Holy communion thing was shared by a member of the congregation about how his family member was healed by taking the holy communion, the fact that he improvised is one that should not even be harped on. God can work miracles inspite of our human failings.<br><br>Also, can you claim that you can explain all the verses in the bible well? Are you so sure that you have all the right answers to the biblical verses? Ps prince speaks at the level of understanding which God has given him, you mean you are better?<br><br>So what is wrong with Christians being materially well off? We are the blessed of the Lord! Does it mean that just because you are a Christian, you have to be poor? Many people just hear the first part, and then they switch off, but then do they hear the second part of Ps princes sermon, he also talks about the conditions that God sets for us to be blessed. And also, he talks about God's will being done and not our own. I think ps prince has a clear revelation of what it means to be prosperous. This does not just include wealth, but in our relationships, in our health, our mental psyche etc. If were were not meant to be blessed, why then would God tell us so?<br><br>Health and wealth are our rights as children of God. Even the bible says so. So how is Ps Prince preaching heresy?<br></div></blockquote>I just feel that the style of Ps Prince is like a sales motivational speaker someone like Anthony Robbins. I agree speaking positive is necessary but it sounds so much like worldy motivational training courses from renowned speakers like Jim Rohn, Robbins, etc. I think people doing business will do very well in NCC. That's why Ps Prince said this year will be the year of acceleration for his people. But i don't totally agree with the business psyche. Businessmen usually con people, then to absolve their guilt they donate to church or charity. Or else how they become so rich?<br><br>I don't know all the verses but certain verses are very famous already. There's already a known interpretation but Ps Prince seems to twist them all somehow to suit his grace message. For eg, i once heard Ps Prince preach abt the parable of the vine. Yes, when we abide in Christ we are blessed but what happens when we don't? When he came to the part abt the pruning of the branches he skipped it without much explaining. I saw his face change a bit as if he tried to hide something. Well can he say God will prune us &amp; make us suffer so we can grow? He can't right with all the prosperity &amp; health &amp; wealth message he is preaching? That's only one personal eg.<br><br>Yes, God can work miracles despite our human failings but to desecrate the Holy Communion &amp; still get healing is heresy. Where does the healing come from then? Could be the devil?<br><br>There is nothing wrong with Christians being well off but is it the main point of being a Christian ie. to be well off? I have bought books from NCC bookshop that subscribes to the WOF heresy, false prosperity message etc. One book says Money Cometh! I thot Christ cometh not money cometh! It was a book teaching abt tithing &amp; offerings. Many books by heretical pastors like Kenneth Copeland etc are found in the bkshop of NCC. Do you Rhema is getting heretical as well in the US?<br><br>Ok stop here. Thanks for your comments. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
