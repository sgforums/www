            <div class='col-md body'>Well is he a false prophet? I consider him bothering on heresy &amp; apostasy. He is on very dangerous ground. I like his entertaining &amp; encouraging sermons but there are loopholes in his theology &amp; the exegesis of the verses. I agree we are saved by grace thru faith but other elements of what he preached are bothering on heresy or error in doctrine.<br><br>So what if he is right on the grace part? He is wrong on other parts. He thinks his experience applies to everyone but not so. Experience could be wrong anyway. I find he skips certain verses &amp; cannot explain others well. He tries to link all to grace which i find ok but overdoes it sometimes. Sometimes he gives his own ridiculous twist to the scripture.<br><br>So if a prophet is right on one part but wrong on others, he is a false prophet &amp; can slowly lead to error &amp; apostasy. It can slowly creep in &amp; destroy the faith of many or twist their understanding of the bible. I have left NCC already for good. Yes, undeserved grace is good. But with God's grace, come the responsibility of living a life that is right before God &amp; men. Anyway, does God say salvation is forever even if one sins greatly? There are many verses saying not so.<br><br>One eg of heresy brought up by NT2 was the Holy Communion heresy. I have a friend who told me use plain water also can. If Prince is wrong on one part, he is not a true prophet of God.<br><br>Also he subscribes to the WOF heresy, where one can pray for anything one wants &amp; get them, so long as he confesses right &amp; believes he gets it. He also subscribes to the healing &amp; prosperity gospel, a health &amp; wealth preacher. You mean Christians must be healthy &amp; rich &amp; if they are not, they arent good Christians or even Christians at all? You mean God could give you all the health &amp; wealth you can imagine &amp; pray for &amp; believe for?<br><br>I know i will get bombarded for this but i will like to hear your comments.</div>

We all take as much as God allows us revelation for and we grow step by step, at different point in our walk with God we can accept a certain level of teaching. Then as we mature in Christ, we can accept deeper teachings as well. Its just like when Jesus came and started preaching or John the baptist. They both caused much overturning of what accepted teaching norms were. The test here for pastor prince is to see if NCC can continue to grow and remain strong. We will know the tree by its fruit. This only time can tell.<br><br>Ultimately, it boils down to this, you and God and no one else. Yes no doubt teachers are doubly accountable, but that goes for all pastors etc. Not just the ones that are high profile. It's just that being high profile, you get hit more... hence this topic.<br><br>One last thought, i think different people have different needs and different personalities, therefore the different ways in which we have church service and the different pastors and different preaching styles. What one person can accept another may not and vice versa, so we have to allow for this also. Just because ps prince preaches in a style or uses certain analogies in a certain way that some cannot accept, does not necessarily make him wrong. As the saying goes, never judge a book by its cover. Personally, I do not think that there is "something wrong" with his preaching. He is humble enought to admit mistakes and sensitive enough to be used by the Holy Spirit. That should say a lot about him.</div>
