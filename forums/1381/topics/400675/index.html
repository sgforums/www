              <p>I'm an ex-city harvester too, But only come to cell group these days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Offering is very common, even in outings, A few weeks back also 'offering', even though no CG, Just a BBQ outing, people give (offering) like asif they are rich though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, where did your sources came from? And I wonder what will be their response if I ask them point-blank straight at their face how would they feel if PK gets thrown into jail though.</p>

              <p>Maybe I not fit to tell what happening since I am one, but I will give you what I have seen.</p>
              <p>Indeed, once you don't come CG and service, and "backslide" for whatever reason, they will forget you, even if you are part of the cell. Occurs to someone I know that was in my cell group. Some totally just FORGET him. Although megachurchs and their CG always like to evangelise (I don't really approve their method of evangelise, at least at least 90% I think), meeting lots of new friends is something we can't avoid. But then, to forget your ex-members? Although I belive is a small amount of people, as they only saw that person only in CG and service.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, they like to preach about sowing and reaping (aka properity gospel to some). Keep sowing and you will keep reaping, using a farmer keep planting seeds and will keep sow the plants to explain. Sow $$$ by keep asking for tithe and offerings. That part don't affect me much, since my parents (being buddist) forbid me from tithing. Anyway, regarding tithing, the thing I hate to see my friends force to borrow $$$ so that they can eat during fellowship after service. Espically those not well off. Always like to say their blessing is from God in other form. But this just illustrate this (putting $$$ in the vending machine called "God" and wait and pray for the goods to drop out).</p>
              <p>And serving the ministries (aka helping or working for them for free, whichever way), you indeed have to look presentable. I mean, at worship place that is have the "high class feeling", one will tend to wear nice nice, but really, God look at heart, not how pretty we are. Will wear sandles short pants and some random T-shirt (as long is presentable) if my CGL allow. Although serving ministeries is always optional, they will kinda guilt-trap you into doing it if you have lots of time. Kinda like you are suspose to be happy if you keep losing sleep just to serve. I currently not serving cause I simply don't have the time to do so.</p>

              <p>Maybe I not fit to tell what happening since I am one, but I will give you what I have seen.</p>
              <p>Indeed, once you don't come CG and service, and "backslide" for whatever reason, they will forget you, even if you are part of the cell. Occurs to someone I know that was in my cell group. Some totally just FORGET him. Although megachurchs and their CG always like to evangelise (I don't really approve their method of evangelise, at least at least 90% I think), meeting lots of new friends is something we can't avoid. But then, to forget your ex-members? Although I belive is a small amount of people, as they only saw that person only in CG and service.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, they like to preach about sowing and reaping (aka properity gospel to some). Keep sowing and you will keep reaping, using a farmer keep planting seeds and will keep sow the plants to explain. Sow $$$ by keep asking for tithe and offerings. That part don't affect me much, since my parents (being buddist) forbid me from tithing. Anyway, regarding tithing, the thing I hate to see my friends force to borrow $$$ so that they can eat during fellowship after service. Espically those not well off. Always like to say their blessing is from God in other form. But this just illustrate this (putting $$$ in the vending machine called "God" and wait and pray for the goods to drop out).</p>
              <p>And serving the ministries (aka helping or working for them for free, whichever way), you indeed have to look presentable. I mean, at worship place that is have the "high class feeling", one will tend to wear nice nice, but really, God look at heart, not how pretty we are. Will wear sandles short pants and some random T-shirt (as long is presentable) if my CGL allow. Although serving ministeries is always optional, they will kinda guilt-trap you into doing it if you have lots of time. Kinda like you are suspose to be happy if you keep losing sleep just to serve. I currently not serving cause I simply don't have the time to do so.</p>

I've been trying to fight it and I really do not want to get brainwashed like how i was 2 years back. Does anyone have any idea on what to do? I really need help desperately. And it really does not make sense to me why I have the urge to go back. Oh, and one more thing. If I were to hear any videos related to chc speaking in tongues my head will start to hurt.

              <p>Just think of the money that you have to come out with when you go to chc and how much money you can save by not going there. Your head hurts when you hear them speak in tongue, you have one more reason for not going there. Anything religious should give you a calming effect, if it is otherwise, something must be wrong.</p>
