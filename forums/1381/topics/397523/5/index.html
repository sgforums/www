              <p>believe it or not.... it's not about making enemies....</p>
              <p>i have already made peace with brey via a pm a couple of months back. i have also told him that we can discuss hobbies, our toys, our life etc, but i WILL NOT DISCUSS theology with him.</p>
              <p>there is no basis for any discussion.... it's always what he sees in the OT, what disagrees about the NT and what the church has done wrong with the misinterpretation.....</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, his view is that the church has gone wrong.... he obviously will disagree with story of the fishing net and Peter (Acts 10).... because he will tell you that the Christian view is wrong... so as I'd said, what's the point....?</p>
              <p>in my opinion, this is a clear cut "lifting of the ban".... otherwise why use would God use "food" as an example.... to confuse the heck out of us now?</p>
              <p>i know that there will always be the explanation of Acts 11 for people who are still pro-levitical laws....</p>
              <p>look at the practicality of the vision.... God cannot show vision of Gentiles ah? must use unclean animals to illustrate a point ah?</p>
              <p>obviously those who are pro-levitical laws will continue to look for support, everybody does that.</p>
              <p>think about it.... you work your life trying to do good because of the salvation of Christ, and you reach heaven and get hung on a technicality of what you ate??? c'mon....</p>

              <p>For those of you who are truly seeking.. these two articles provide a very good guide as to what is clean and unclean food according to Yahweh.</p>

              <p>Despondent, CE and I did set aside our differences a while ago. I am not his enemy. Neither is he mine.</p>
              <p>I was confirmed a Methodist from Wesley, led in the hearing impaired services, served in YAG, I have also been a full on charismatic pentacostal, listened to all you could possibly listen to, Joyce Meyer, Marylin Hickey, Jessie Duplantis, Kenneth Copeland Joseph Prince, read through Clavin, Martin Luther, etc... why would I turn my back on 20 years of following the church?? Why would I say the church has gone astray? Read the bible for what it is, G_d's word and G_d's instruction for how we are to live our lives.</p>
              <p>Salvation is not ours yet, the blood of Yeshua only gives us redemtion, whether we are saved or not really depends on how obedient we are to Him. We will only know that on the last day. It is up to Yeshua to judge us for that is given Him by our Father in Heaven, that is why the bible admonishes us to WORK OUT OUR SAVATION WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING...</p>

              <p>Salvation is by grace for all, but it does not excuse us from keeping the mitzvot of Yahweh. This we ought to do as being obedient children to Him.</p>
              <p>But then our salvation is not yet, because we have not finished the race. All those who fall by the wayside, do you think they will be saved??</p>
              <p>Salvation in the context of the bible, has always been some thing happening to deliver the savee into a better place, as we are not yet delivered, we still are not "saved" we are redeemed by the blood of Yeshua, for the opportunity of salvation, but because the event of Yeshua's return has not occured yet to deliver us form our circumstances, we are not "saved".</p>
              <p>Look to the temple sacrifice to understand the various things that have to take place before we can come into the holy of holies. The blood is not just for salvation, but also for purification, for redemption, for reconciliation, for justification and for restoration.These processes are necessary for us to be able to come before Him. This has always been the way, from time past till now. We need to sanctify ourselves, we need to purify ourselves, we need to reconcile ourselves... all back to Him. Then there can be restoration, then there can be the justification to stand before Him.</p>
              <p>Salvation is our hope, so long as we walk with Him in His ways. Be aware that we can loose our hope of salvation. It is very clearly stated in the bible with Yeshua's illustration of the goat and the sheep. Be mindful always.</p>

              <p>Well put.</p>
              <p>I used to believe OSAS, but no longer.. once one has a greater understand of the word, you begin to see things is a very different light. These two teachings of grace and good works are not mutually exclusive, neither are they that confounding. I believe once one understands the word from the original intent of Yahweh, they will be able to see how these two ideas flow.</p>
