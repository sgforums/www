              <p>May I know why Christians are not allowed and so afraid to eat
              those food that have been prayed to the dead, to Buddha or Taoist
              Gods? During Qing Ming, my relatives who are Christians refused to
              eat or bring home any food that were prayed to the ancestors.</p>
              <p>I drank holy water from the church before, I ate
              food that pray to Buddha, to ancestors and to Taoist Gods.
              Nothing happen to me. My old grandparents eat food that being
              prayed live till today, they are already in their 80s. Isn't God's
              power is greater than other forces ? If yes, what is there to be

              <p>i'm lazy to read and sometimes after reading, i also don't understand what it is trying to say. according to your earlier post, you said by eating offering food will make others stumble (if i interpret correctly) and god will not be pleased. why is it so ? i remember christians told me they were taught not to waste food. i ask again because i still think that i don't get the reason why god is not pleased. is ok if you don't feel like answering again.</p>

              <p>wad i want to say is the main reason why u still dun get the reason why God is not pleased is due to the fact that there r alot of things abt christianity which u either dunno or do not understand. personally, i feel that b4 u can get the reason why God is not pleased, u need to 1st understand the christian perspective. i have said this b4 and i am repeating this again tat u have and always been judging christianity from the basis of gd works and buddhism, taking the assumption tat buddhism and christianity are the same. tink of tis, if buddhism and christianity are diff, then is it reasonable to compare one from the basis of the other?</p>
              <p>in fact, from reading ur posts, i can see tat u have probably read up more abt buddhism than christianity. moreover, most of ur qns are resulted from misconceptions abt christianity which arose from u judging christianity from the basis of buddhism. for me, i dun face much problems when understanding buddhism simply cos when i read up and explored buddhism, i engaged it from wad it taught, which is karma and reincarnation. likewise, i encourage u to engage christianity based on wad it teaches and not based on wad u tink and wad u agree. i dun agree wif the effects of karma and reincarnation but i still engaged buddhism from those perspective and it did give me a betta understanding of buddhism. well, this method worked, at least for me...</p>

              <p><br>of course we give proper respect when they are alive. we respect them to the extent that even when they are dead we still offer food to them. one of the way to show respect to buddha and deities is to offer food and flowers, to show further respect, we eat the food after them, rather than throw the food away. this is chinese way of showing respect.</p>

              <p>Well, you are teasing the dieties and the dead. What kind of

              <p>Better to give the dead the proper respect while they are still

              <p> This is the belief of other people, so for that very reason alone you should respect it.</p>
              <p>The reasons to you should not matter in itself, even if you do not believe it yourself. What matters is respect the belief of others, and you respect the right of others not to believe.</p>
