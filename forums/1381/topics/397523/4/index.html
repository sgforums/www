              <p>Instead, those who feel uncomfortable with the situation can
                  just refuse to partake in eating the offerings given to you. Do not
                  give a superiority complex or give the impression that 'My God is
                  better than your God'. Instead, just politely refuse and use this
                  opportunity to explain to them your relationship with God, <strong>a God
                  who wishes to have a personal relationship with all mankind
                  irrespective of his religion.</strong></p>
              <p>In a sense, the partaking of food for idols is not forbidden, <strong>as
                  long as we spread the love of Jesus in the process</strong>. Of course, I'm
                  not saying that you can now set up an Altar and start eating
                  offering food to Idols and eating it as well:P That's just wrong

              <p>Completely agree. It is the intention of the eating that is more
              important, especially if respect and unity results from the
              action. Similarily, it is also possible to eat so-called
              'permitted' food and think of all the wrong things right? We can't

              <p>Talmudic definition of what work is and Yahweh's definition of what work is are two totally different things. Yeshua came to abolish Talmudic law and return people back to G_d's TORAH. Is healing permitted on Shabbat? Definitely, even the rabbis today will tell you so. What did Yeshua do on Shabbat that was prohibited? Nothing.</p>
              <p>The two "commandments" by Yeshua as you put them are just a summation of the 10 Mitzvot that are written in the Tenakh.</p>

              <p>These don't apply to Christians anymore due to Christ's
                  sacrifice for all of us (Acts 10:10-15) : </p>
              <p>But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they
                  were making preparations, he fell into a trance; and he saw
                  the sky opened up, and an object like a great sheet coming down,
                  lowered by four corners to the ground, and there were in it
                  all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the
                  earth and birds of the air. </p>
              <p>A voice came to him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat!" But
                  Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything
                  unholy and unclean." Again a voice came to him a second time, "What
                  God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy."</p>
              <p>I'm not not sure about Judaism though, food
                  restrictions may still apply for them.</p>

              <p>Yet Acts 10:10 - 15 wasn't about food nor that due to Jesus sacrifice, all food restrictions were lifted or override.</p>
              <p>Acts 10:28-29</p>
              <p>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a 
                  man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; 
                  <strong>but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</strong>Therefore
                   came I <em>unto you</em> without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I
                   ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</p>
              <p>Are there other sentences that talks about the pork being declared clean for Abrahamic religions' followers? Like maybe Jesus said something or override it?</p>
