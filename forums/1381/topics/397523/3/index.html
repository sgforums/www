              <p>to Fairyfairy,</p>
              <p>wad i want to say is the main reason why u still dun get the
              reason why God is not pleased is due to the fact that there r alot
              of things abt christianity which u either dunno or do not
              understand. personally, i feel that b4 u can get the reason why God
              is not pleased, u need to 1st understand the christian perspective.
              i have said this b4 and i am repeating this again tat u have and
              always been judging christianity from the basis of gd works and
              buddhism, taking the assumption tat buddhism and christianity are
              the same. tink of tis, if buddhism and christianity are diff, then
              is it reasonable to compare one from the basis of the other?</p>
              <p>in fact, from reading ur posts, i can see tat u have probably
              read up more abt buddhism than christianity. moreover, most of ur
              qns are resulted from misconceptions abt christianity which arose
              from u judging christianity from the basis of buddhism. for me, i
              dun face much problems when understanding buddhism simply cos when
              i read up and explored buddhism, i engaged it from wad it taught,
              which is karma and reincarnation. likewise, i encourage u to engage
              christianity based on wad it teaches and not based on wad u tink
              and wad u agree. i dun agree wif the effects of karma and
              reincarnation but i still engaged buddhism from those perspective
              and it did give me a betta understanding of buddhism. well, this
              method worked, at least for me...</p>

              <p>hi, personally, I think U gave a better than good answer. Howerver, given some have already closed their ears/eyes and seemingly just want to disengage, i think your pt is well made and taken from my perspective. Kudos.</p>

              <p>however in the old testament, which has many similarities to the Quran, Pork was forbidden. only in the new testament with the crucification of Jesus Christ that we are allowed to eat pork. i'll find the verses and post it again.  </p>

              <p>About eating pork, read Acts 10: 12-15. If we want to take this

              <p>That is the whole problem with reading and taking verse out of context, if you bother to read on further in the book of Acts after verses 12-15. Read Kefa's (Peter's) own words. For why would Kefa still ponder within himself if the vision had been very clear. Understand the context. Kefa was a Jew and followed all the commandments written in the Tenakh (OT) In Acts 10:28 Kefa says that Yahweh has shown him that he should not call any man common or unclean.This was the meaning of the vision that he had.</p>

              <p>Is the Tenakh (OT) still part of the bible or not? Read B'Midbar (Numbers) 15:15 and Shmot (Exodus) 12:49. There shall be one law (read TORAH) for both the Jew and the gentile (stranger) alike.  christians follow the G_d of Avraham, Yitzak and Yakov, so why should they not follow His TORAH??</p>

              <p>actually as long as you obey the 10 commandments and the 2 big

              <p>eg: Sabbath: you must not work. Then the jews start to define

              during Sabbath.</p>
              <p>Christians say cannot eat this, cannot eat that. At the end of
              the bottom line, it is " do not do things that will tempt your

              <p>Talmudic definition of what work is and Yahweh's definition of what work is are two totally different things. Yeshua came to abolish Talmudic law and return people back to G_d's TORAH. Is healing permitted on Shabbat? Definitely, even the rabbis today will tell you so. What did Yeshua do on Shabbat that was prohibited? Nothing.</p>
              <p>The two "commandments" by Yeshua as you put them are just a summation of the 10 Mitzvot that are written in the Tenakh.</p>

              <p>ergo... see my previous post on B'midbar 15:15. You choose to follow Yahweh, but don't want to follow His TORAH? christians are beholden to all the TORAH that Yahweh has laid down for them, it was never abolished, never replaced. Even Yeshua kept TORAH both in the spirit and according to the letter of the TORAH.</p>
              <p>There is a reason why the Jewish people do not see Maschiach yet. Read Romans 11:25-36.</p>
              <p>Actually if you want to be technically correct christianity is a faith that was "created" by constantine to pervert the true faith of Yahweh. Following different dates, having different festivals. Doing things that Yahweh never commanded them to do.</p>
              <p>How do you know that Jews do not accept Maschiach? There are many who do already even from much earlier times.</p>

              <p>If eating things offered to idols opens up opportunity to share the
              love of Jesus by all means utilize the opportunity. If it is does not
              open an opportunity by no means partake in it <strong>1 Corinthians 10:20</strong></p>
              <p>As Christians, we know that there is only one true God. So, the foods offered to the idols are nothing but food that we eat everyday, and would not harm us in any way at all.</p>
              <p><br>Basically, if eating things offered to idols opens up the opportunity to share the love of God, why not? The scripture even states that you must, by all means, utilise the opportunity to share the love of Jesus.</p>
              <p>In fact, what almost always happens would be Christians feeling awkward and taking the opportunity to discard the food or gulp it down quickly. Along with the fact that we aren't good actors, our facial expressions often give us away, especially the feelings of awkwardness or being plain uncomfortable about the situation at hand. The misconception that we should share the love of Jesus by not offending the non-believers while showing signs of being uncomfortable is quite common, and we would never show the love of Jesus this way.</p>
              <p>Instead, those who feel uncomfortable with the situation can just refuse to partake in eating the offerings given to you. Do not give a superiority complex or give the impression that 'My God is better than your God'. Instead, just politely refuse and use this opportunity to explain to them your relationship with God, a God who wishes to have a personal relationship with all mankind irrespective of his religion.</p>
              <p>In a sense, the partaking of food for idols is not forbidden, as long as we spread the love of Jesus in the process. Of course, I'm not saying that you can now set up an Altar and start eating offering food to Idols and eating it as well:P That's just wrong lol!</p>

              <p>Completely agree. It is the intention of the eating that is more important, especially if respect and unity results from the action. Similarily, it is also possible to eat so-called 'permitted' food and think of all the wrong things right?
