IMHO they r as crappy as miracle healings etc. Just think for a moment, do u really think tat it can heal a person sickness by the will of a pastor or father ? If it can be done, why do some church organisation still donate money for the deaf or blind homes ? Isn't the best donation to these people the ability to be normal ? Why give them money when the pastor, by his will can heal them ? U speak of people gainaing the ability to learn foreign language without learning it is to me, absurb and belittlling the effort of people learning these languanges. If it is so effective, then it will be written in scientific journals or paper and be undergo studies on such a miracle. But clearly, nobody give a damn to these hoax.<br><br><blockquote>Don't be so mean, will ya?

If some jokers say "goo goo gaa gaa" meaning god is great, then surely all the people have to say the say things when it meant the same meaning as well. Why r they so fundamentally different from each other ? It is not verifiable and therefore we should doubt them instead of believing in them. If someone says he can fly without showing u any verifiable evidence, will u blindly believe him ?<br><br></div>

If it is a miracle, it will clearly betrayed the essence of science and therefore it can be carried out to prove science wrong. It can be used to show tat the world is not in a nature order.

Can u deny the above statement ?</blockquote>The statement is vague, hence I won't affirm or deny it. Whatever the case, such miracles are done according to the will of God. The same for answered prayers.<br><br>Maybe the pastor prayed silently to God before the healing? So it is still according to the will of God.<br><br><blockquote>So in the end the pastor do have tis ability to heal people, or convince some entity to heal people, but he can't heal the real people from deaf or mute home.

If it is a miracle, it will clearly betrayed the essence of science and therefore it can be carried out to prove science wrong. It can be used to show tat the world is not in a nature order.</blockquote>Not possible. Science cannot "touch" the realm of the supernatural. If you cannot perform experiment or carry out an observational study, then very hard right? But since healings relate directly to the medical science, perhaps you can ask the doctor who examined the healed person? Like if the person can suddenly walk, or the cancer overnight gone, such events can be verified medically. We cannot study the miracle, but we can study the result of the miracle. But take note, this doesn't really prove the miracle. The whole thing boils down to causality.<br><br>I leave you to find those doctors, ask them then present your case to us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Science is not wrong with miracles.

As such, you have failed to convince me they are not consistent. Look, I'm not saying they are consistent and I dunno who are spourting rubbish, but my feeling is that many tongues we hear in church today are fake. But this doesn't invalidate the gift of tongue.</div>
