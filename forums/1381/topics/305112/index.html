            <div class='col-md body'>This  one should keep us all thinking.<br>I  chose #2, now you pick one.   Scripture tells us that it is the FOOL who says in his heart that there is no God.<br><br>This  is a true story of something that happened just a few years ago at  USC.<br><br>There  was a professor of philosophy there who was a deeply committed  atheist.<br><br>His  primary goal for one required class was to spend the entire  semester to<br>prove that God couldn't  exist.<br><br>His  students were always afraid to argue with him because of his  impeccable logic.<br><br>Sure,  some had argued in class at times, but no one had ever really gone  against him because of his reputation.<br><br>At  the end of every semester on the last day, he would say to his  class of 300 students, 'If there is anyone here who still believes  in Jesus, stand up!'<br><br>In  twenty years, no one had ever stood up. They knew what he was  going to do next. He would say, 'Because anyone who believes in  God is a fool'.<br><br>If  God existed, he could stop this piece of chalk from hitting the  ground and breaking Such a simple task to prove that He is God,  and yet He can't do it.'<br><br>And  every year, he would drop the chalk onto the tile floor of the  classroom and it would shatter into a hundred pieces.<br><br>All  of the students would do nothing but stop and  stare.<br><br>Most  of the students thought that God couldn't exist. Certainly, a  number of Christians had slipped through, but! For 20 years, they  had been too afraid to stand up.<br><br>Well,  a few years ago there was a freshman who happened to  enroll.<br><br>He  was a Christian, and had heard the stories about his  professor.<br><br>He  was required to take the class for his major, and he was afraid.  But for three months that semester, he prayed every morning that  he would have the courage to stand up no matter what the professor  said, or what the class thought.<br><br>Nothing  they said could ever shatter his faith...he  hoped.<br><br>Finally,  the day came. ! The professor said, 'If there is anyone here who  still believes in God, stand up!' The professor and the class of  300 people looked at him, shocked, as he stood up at the back of  the classroom.<br><br>The  professor shouted, 'You FOOL!!!<br><br>If  God existed, he would keep this piece of chalk from breaking when  it hit the ground!'<br><br>He  proceeded to drop the chalk, but as he did, it slipped out of his  fingers, off his shirt cuff, onto the pleat of his pants, down his  leg, and off his shoe. As it hit the ground, it simply rolled away  unbroken. The professor's jaw dropped as he stared at the chalk.  He looked up at the young man, and then ran out of the lecture  hall.<br><br>The  young man who had stood, proceeded to walk to the front of the  room and shared his faith in Jesus for the next half hour. 300  students stayed and listened as he told of God's love for them and  of His power through Jesus.<br><br>You  have 2 choices:<br><br>1. Never look at it again.<br><br>2.  Pass this along to your Christian and non-Christian friends,  giving them encouragement we all need every  day<br><br>When  you choose option 2, you have chosen to STAND  UP<br><br><strong>    In  light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh, this  is a little different:<br><br>This  is not intended to be a joke, it's not funny, it's intended to get  you thinking.............<br><br>Isn't  it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder  why the world's going to hell.<br><br>Isn't  it funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what  the Bible says.<br><br>Isn't  it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not  have to believe, think, say, or do anything the Bible says. Or is  it scary?<br><br>Isn't  it funny how someone can say 'I believe in God' but still follow  Satan  (who, by the way, also 'believes' in God  ).<br><br>Isn't  it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they  spread like wildfire,<br><br>But  when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think<br>twice about sharing.<br><br>Isn't  it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely  through cyberspace, but the public discussion of Jesus is  suppressed in the school and workplace.<br><br>Isn't  it funny how someone can be so fired up for Christ on Sunday, but  be an invisible Christian the rest of the  week.<br><br>Are  you laughing? !<br><br>Isn't  it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not  send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what  they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to  them.<br><br>Isn't  it funny how I can be more worried about what  other people  think of me than what God thinks of me.  </strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The story kind of reminded me of my own experience when a particular lecturer name Michael at NTU asked in front of the class :Why do you like to go to church?"<br><br>He didn't specifically ask the question to me but somehow I believed that was intended for me.<br><br>Then he asked the second question "Why are you so coc*y?"<br><br>I believe he was a co*ky man himself I was just trying to give  co*ky people a mirror to look at.
