You will prolly learn it by and by.<br><br>But there are few things you should know, that other religious forums have really great moderators, who are mature enough and experienced in modding forums. I know some personally. I see them take great care to steer discussion to topic proper, stop potential flaming and most importantly, to treat any topic regarding other faiths with great care.<br><br>Sadly, these sort of behaviour are sadly missing here. The founder of this forum has time to time neglect my advice on the above concerns, and even shown lack of forum etiquette, clearly showed up when he deleted Devil1976's topic without notice.<br><br>Besides that, among all forums, i find that some topics are really unbecoming, mostly those that touch on non believers, as well as some strong issues, like homsexuality, as well as topics or discussions that has a tinge of anti-Catholicism. Ever stop for a moment to think, is fandango the ever first guy to attack the Catholics, or why you seen jwworld and other have to set up their own catholic forum, or that honeybunz has to defend the catholic faith from time to time?<br><br>Look at one of such kind of topics that show lack of maturity and sense, where you see a whole host of sensible christians replying, but the topic starter of such topic is the mod. Sheesh.<br><br>You want peace? I dont foresee this for a long time in this forum.<br><br></div>

Similarly, I m sure some of you have parents who nag at u saying it's for your own good, w/c is true in a sense, but do u realise that it's harassment also? &amp; when they start to force u or ground u or restrict your movement, dont u feel angry also &amp; feel your rights have been taken away? I pray God will change the hearts of all parents, leaders, educators, pastors, lawgivers, CEOs etc to repent &amp; come to God &amp; show compassion on the less fortunate in S'pore. God bless you all!</div>
