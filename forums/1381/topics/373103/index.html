              <p>1 Samuel 17:2-5</p>
              <p><sup id="en-NKJV-7621" class="versenum">2</sup> And Saul and the men
                      of Israel were gathered together, and they encamped in the Valley of
                      Elah, and drew up in battle array against the Philistines. <sup id="en-NKJV-7622" class="versenum">3</sup> The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.<sup id="en-NKJV-7623" class="versenum"><br>4</sup> And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, from Gath, whose height <em>was</em> six cubits and a span.<sup id="en-NKJV-7624" class="versenum"><br>5</sup> <em>He had</em> a bronze helmet on his head, and he <em>was</em> armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat <em>was</em> five thousand shekels of bronze.</p>
              <p>In the dictionary, "Goliath means a gigantic, overwhelming power.</p>
              <p>look at goliath, he is such a big tall strong and probarly the tallest basketballer that has ever live, but yet was brought down by a boy, that have a broken family and has nothing but 5 smooth stones when he brought down Goliath!</p>
              <p>this 5 smooth stone is not smooth stone by default, they are stones that are being purified by the water over time and time again. and finally becoming stones that became the weapon of david which slay down goliath!</p>
              <p>Are we going to pick up this 5 stones that is goig to change our lifes?</p>
              <p>1. Pick up the stone of the Past.</p>

              <p>time are ticking forward, not back if you notice it.</p>
              <p>2. Pick up the stong of Prayer.</p>
              <p>no, absoulutly NO christian is a born prayer warrior.</p>
              <p>i don't even know how to pray when i first became a christian. ask me lead in a prayer i will shake! cause i won't know what to say, but when you pray and pray all together you will know what you are prayer, and letting the spirit to guide you, you will be once prayer warrior!</p>
              <p>3. Pick up the stones of Priority.</p>
              <p>as christian this whould be our prioty of anything!</p>
              <p>1. God<br>2. Family<br>3. Ministry<br>4. Carrer</p>
              <p>Mattew 6:33</p>
              <p><sup id="en-NKJV-23311" class="versenum">33</sup> But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Pick up the stones of Passion</p>
              <p>1 Samuel 17:48-49</p>
              <p><sup id="en-NKJV-7667" class="versenum">48</sup> So it was, when the
                      Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David
                      hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. <sup id="en-NKJV-7668" class="versenum">49</sup> Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung <em>it</em> and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.</p>
              <p>David charge Goliath at full speed and throw a stone at him.</p>
              <p>back then David might be known as Bolt!</p>
              <p>how many christian we know, are trying to drag their feet to church, to work, or even going back home?</p>
              <p>but its really being passionate like david, at the face of danger he charge towards it.</p>
              <p>arn't we suppose to be like that? when problem come we are suppose to go full speed and try to destroy this problem we have. not dragging it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for guys, 2 year ns, is like a Goliath to you!</p>
              <p>some want to back out from it, some want to avoid seeing it. but Guys you still have to serve the NS, why not go for it, finish that 2 years obstacle you have in your life?</p>
              <p>working adult, maybe your boss have a problem, should we be passionate to help your boss out?instead of avoiding him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Pick up the stone of Presistence</p>
              <p>we have to be presistence in the things we are doing.</p>
              <p>lets say a husband did something unfaithful to the wife.</p>
              <p>is he going to say sorry once and wife would forgive him? surly not.</p>
              <p>but this would have to see if the husband is presistence enough to let the wife forgive him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just like prayers, we pray but things still don't goes our way, are we just gona ask help for once or are we going to pray again</p>
              <p>if prayer were send by mails, we should be bursting the inbox of God email and he have no choice but to fufill what we pray for if not we are not going to stop!.</p>
              <p> </p>

              Well for prayer many people think prayer should be beautiful verbally...that's why so many people do not feel confident leading a pray.
                                <br><br>
              A prayer first and foremost should be an intimate experience.<br><br>
              Meaning that they should be done mostly in private: away from other people and in silent. Prayers are heart talk to God, that's why they are sacred and ideally should be kept in private. Let no one see you when you pray or try to pray in privacy. Let no one knows the consolation that you get when praying. Let no one know what you're praying about unless it is necessary like in a group praying. Or even one should continue praying even when he doesn't get any consolation in praying. Faith doesn't expect mere sensations.
                                <br><br>
              Of course there's that thing called group praying where a man may lead a pray of a group of people with a loud voice but the essence or the fundamental of praying imo is that it is an intimate personal relation with God and should ideally be kept private. A whisper of the heart is all that it takes. Prayer should come from the bottom of the heart not from mere mouth.
                                <br><br>
               Anyway it's just my personal opinion on praying. I can't lead a pray well too. Too shy for most of the time. But I know it's wrong to be concern with that aspect of praying that it should be beautiful verbally as that's trying as if to impress men instead of communing with God.
