In this portion of Acts that are used to justify CGs is really the church in it's infancy, where believers met at each other's homes.<br>As the years go by, churches are formed ie, the various churches that Paul travelled to + the churches named by John in Revelation.<br><br>When we read (and intepret scripture) we need to draw the line as to whether when something is said, is it a doctrinal teaching or a cultural comment. So when scripture noted that the believers wore a certain kind of clothing, do we take it to mean that we also need to dress likewise?<br><br>My take is: if you are comfortable in that CG, by all means go ahead, but if you are not, there is no reason why you should continue doing that.<br><br>PM me if you wish to discuss this further.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's the idea of the modern church that cell groups are created. Yes the bible talks abt the early disciples gathering together but never mention how long they gather or how to gather. the modern church comes out with their own idea of cell group system only becos they want to manage the members better. The question is just like whether it is a must to attend church on sunday. Some chrisitan don't attend church on sunday becos their church got sat service or mid-week service. btw, the whole idea of attending church on sunday is set by the catholic church (some of you might know this). so how do u justifiy whether a christian must attend a cell group just becos some churches are doing it?
