            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeMacross:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm, in Jeremiah 44 it also mentions the phrase Â‘Queen of HeavenÂ’ a number of times. Maybe you are rightÂ….<br><br>Absolutely not!!<br><br>To begin with the "queen of heaven" found in the book of Jeremiah has no bearing or relation with Mary. The text in question has to do with Ishtar, the Assyro-Babylonian goddess of fertility. This pagan worship was initiated under Manasseh and was restored after the death of Josiah. Pagan worship, then as now, is considered an abomination by Jews and Christians alike, including the first Christians, Catholics.  Catholics do not regard the Blessed Mother of the Lord as a god, or goddess, or anything of the sort!<br>This whole Protestant argument is not the Biblical text or true history, it is simply based on the similarity in the title, "Queen of Heaven", and is a very weak position. The fact that a pagan deity was known, as the "queen of heaven" doesn't mean this term can't rightfully be applied, in another sense altogether, to Mary.<br><br>In the second place, the fact that a pagan deity was known as the queen of heaven doesn't mean this term can't rightfully be applied, in another sense altogether, to Mary. The pagan king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, is called the king of kings by Daniel (Daniel 2:37), yet this doesn't preclude Jesus from being called by the same title (Rev. 17:14; 19:16).<br>Thirdly, Mary, whom all generations "shall call blessed." (Luke 1:4<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> has a legitimate claim to the title of QUEEN OF HEAVEN. As Christians we acknowledge Christ as the king of heaven (Matt. 19:23-24). And a King of the Davidic Royal line "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David"(Luke: 1:32) The Sacred Scriptures specifically refer to Mary as the mother of Christ  over 25 times.<br><br>Next, we must note "The mother of the ruling monarch is known as the Queen Mother," (World Book Encyclopedia 2000) So we see that "Queen Mother" refers to the mother (Mary) of a reigning monarch (The Divine King, Jesus Christ).<br><br>The Queen Mother, "Gebi Rah" in Hebrew, was a distinct honor, and a tradition began by the son of David, Solomon. The Sacred Scriptures show in Ancient Israel or Judah the mother of the designated heir enjoyed a special status. Nathan enlisted Bathsheba rather than Solomon in his plan to have Solomon confirmed as king (1 Kings 1:11-40). Queen mother was an official position in Israel and Judah. Great care was taken in preserving the names of the queen mothers (1 Kings 14:21; 15:2, 13; 22:42; 2 Kings 8:26). AsaÂ’s removal of his mother from the office for idolatry (1 Kings 15:13) points to its official character. On her sonÂ’s death, Athaliah murdered her own grandsons, the legitimate heirs, in order to retain the power she had enjoyed as queen mother (2 Kings 11:1-2). The queen mother served as a trusted counsel for her son Proverbs:  31:1). In the Scriptures God heavily, heavily emphasized the queen mother's of the Davidic Royal line. In Scriptures over 25 times that after the introduction of the Jewish king, the queen mother is recognized Each Time. In all of these verses notice the words, "and his mother's name was". Notice what the king does for his mother, he stands to greet her, pays homage to her, and had a throne built for her at his right hand side.<br>So we see that Mary has a right to the title of "Queen of Heaven" but were does scripture say God say he will have a Queen?  In Psalms: 45:9, 12, and 17 we read:<br><br>"Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the QUEEN in gold of Ophir...even the rich among the people SHALL INTREAT THY FAVOUR. I will make THY NAME TO BE REMEMBERED IN ALL GENERATIONS: therefore shall the people PRAISE THEE for ever and ever."<br>Her name remembered in all generations. Ring a bell? The prophecy comes to fulfillment in Luke 1:48: "For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth ALL GENERATATIONS SHALL CALL ME blessed". In the Book of Revelation we read.<br>"A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars." (Rev. 12:1-2)<br>What kinds of women wear crowns? Queens wear crowns, but this woman seems to be crowned with the 'highest jewels' of creation, the stars, with the sun itself as her royal robes.<br><br>"Then the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring, those who keep God's commandments and bear witness to Jesus."(Rev. 12:17)<br>Satan could not get the woman (enmity Gen 3:16) so he went to fight her spiritual children, Christians, people who bear witness to Jesus the Christ.<br>Even Martin Luther preached after his break with Rome on the Feast of the Visitation (July 2, 1532) --<br>"She, the Lady above heaven and earth, must have a heart so humble that she might have no shame in washing the swaddling clothes or preparing a bath for St. John the Baptist, like a servant girl. What humility! It would surely have been more just to have arranged for her a golden coach, pulled by 4,000 horses, and to cry and proclaim as the carriage proceeded: 'Here passes the woman who is raised FAR ABOVE all women, indeed above the WHOLE human race.'"<br>Five years later, preaching on the same feast day, Luther said --<br>"She was not filled with pride by this praise...this immense praise: 'No woman is like unto thee! Thou art more than an EMPRESS or a QUEEN....blessed above all nobility, wisdom, or saintliness!'"<br><br>Some people just like to use similarities and judge it as absolute truth. I know a pastor who said that Buddhism is devil because the chinese word for Buddha look like a snake. What childish theology ?  how superficial<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'<br>9 "I have seen these people," the LORD said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people. 10 Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>When the Israelites made the golden calf..it was not some pagan gods they have in mind when they made it. Infact when u read the words in bold...they ascribe to the calf what the God of Israel did. They say....this is the  'god' who brought them out of Egypt. They worship the calf as though worshipping God and recognising what God has done for them....in the wrong manner and God hates it.  Many of us can also worship the true God in a false manner....<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Youre example falls short in any supposed comparison to Catholic piety. I will say this again, we do not worship our images as though worshipping God. We do not sacrifice anything before our images. We do not attribute to our images any qualities or works of God. Our images are not substitutes for God. Our images do not prompt us to indulge in revelry. In all these ways, Catholics are distinct and separate from the stiff-necked people who created the golden calf.<br></div>

Every church in Christendom condemned contraception until 1930, when, at its decennial Lambeth Conference, Anglicanism gave permission for the use of contraception in a few cases. Soon all Protestant denominations had adopted the secularist position on contraception. Today not one stands with the Catholic Church to maintain the ancient Christian faith on this issue. Yet God slew Onan for spilling his seed. (Refer to Genesis 38:9-10)</div>

They do not call the Bible the Holy bible for nothing...So you think that the Catholic Church denies that the Bible is the inerrant, inspired Word of God? Well, consider the following opinions:<br><br>Â“We have no wish either to see or hear Moses.Â”<br><br>Â“Job . . . is merely the argument of a fable.Â”<br><br>Â“Ecclesiastes ought to have been more complete. There is too much incoherent matter in it . . . Solomon did not, therefore, write this book.Â”<br><br>Â“The book of Esther I toss into the Elbe. I am such an enemy to the book of Esther that I wish it did not exist, for it Judaizes too much and has in it a great deal of heathenish naughtiness.Â”<br><br>Â“The history of Jonah is so monstrous that it is absolutely incredible.Â”<br><br>Â“There are many things objectionable in this book [Revelation]. To my mind it bears upon it no marks of an apostolic or prophetic character.Â”<br><br>Â“St. JamesÂ’ epistle . . . has nothing of the nature of the gospel about it.Â”<br><br>What Pope do you think declared this? What Cardinal dared to so condemn the Holy Word of God? What priest took it upon himself to judge the living and active Word? None at all. The above judgements were made by the founder of Protestantism himself, Martin Luther!<br><br>The Catholic Church, on the other hand, has always defended the inspiration and trustworthiness of Scripture. For example, in the Vatican II document Dei Verbum, we find the following affirmation:<br><br>Those divinely revealed realities which are contained and presented in sacred Scripture have been committed to writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. For [the Church] . . . holds that the books of both the Old and New Testaments in their entirety, with all their parts, are sacred and canonical because written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they have God as their author and have been handed on as such to the Church herself. In composing the sacred books, God chose men and while employed by Him they made use of their powers and abilities, so that with Him acting in them and through them, they, as true authors, consigned to writing everything and only those things which He wanted.<br><br>Therefore since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into the sacred writings for the sake of our salvation. (Dei Verbum, Chapter 11)<br><br>Contrast the holy and reverent attitude of the Catholic Church with that of Luther:<br><br>Luther . . . freely charges the sacred writers with inaccurate statements, unsound reasonings, the use of imperfect materials and even urges the authority of Christ against that of Holy Writ. In a word, as is admitted by a recent Protestant writer: Â“Luther has no fixed theory of inspiration: if all his works suppose the inspiration of the Sacred Writings, all his conduct shows that he makes himself the supreme judge of itÂ” (Rabaud, p. 42). . . . The Inspired Word of God was nothing to Luther when it could not be made to square with Lutheranism. He is prepared to assume the whole responsibility for the changes he made, and believes he has the faculty of judging the Bible without danger of error. He believes he is infallible. Â“My wordÂ” says he, in an exhortation to his followers, Â“is the word of Christ: my mouth is the mouth of Christ.Â” . . . Not only did Luther knowingly make additions to the text and expunge from the canon some of the Inspired Books, but he distorted the meaning of several passages by interpretations that were erroneous and nothing short of blasphemous. He even went so far as to accuse the Divine Author of playful mendacity, of irony, when no other sense of the Inspired Words would suit the Lutheran cause. (OÂ’Hare, Luther, 202-205.)<br><br>When reverent Scripture scholars decried LutherÂ’s improper addition of the word Â“aloneÂ” to his German translation of Romans 3:28, he replied, Â“You tell me what a great fuss the Papists are making because the word Â‘aloneÂ’ is not in the text of Paul. If your Papist makes such an unnecessary row about the word Â‘alone,Â’ say right out to him: Â‘Dr. Martin Luther will have it so,Â’ and say: Â‘Papists and asses are one and the same thing.Â’ I will have it so, and I order it to be so, and my will is reason enough.Â” (John Stoddard, Rebuilding a Lost Faith, (Rockford, IL: TAN Books), 136-7.)<br><br>The point of this is not to suggest that modern Protestantism should be held accountable for its founderÂ’s attitude toward Scripture. Rather, the point is simply that people who live in glass houses shouldnÂ’t throw stones. The Catholic Church has always treated the Bible with the reverence it deserves, and the heirs of LutherÂ’s reformation really arenÂ’t in a good position to allege otherwise.<br><br>The first six quotation of Martin Luther are from Patrick F. OÂ’Hare, The Facts About Luther, (Rockford, IL: TAN Books, 1987), 202-205; the last one is from The Works of Martin Luther, tr. C.M. Jacobs, (Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press, 1932), copyrighted by the United Lutheran Church in America, vol. 6, 443-444.</div>

He lost his life because he violated natural law, as Jewish and Christian commentators have always understood. For this reason, artificial contraception has historically been known as "Onanism," after the man who practiced it, just as homosexuality has historically been known as "Sodomy," after the men of Sodom, who practiced that vice (cf.

As some of fellow catholic and protestant brothers have mentioned, arguing about such things is going to make things better.  Only with love can we overcome such problems.<br><br>Both Catholics and Protestants are guilty of malicious bigotry.  Let us not judge, though it's tempting to do so.  Let God be the judge.<br><br>As a Catholic I am taught that our Church represents the entire repository of the Truth.  Our protestant bretheren also believe in the same Truth, but not to the full extent that we do.  However, there can be only 1 Truth.<br><br>As a Catholic I am also taught to respect other denominations for it is said in the bible that, who is not against me is for with me right?  There's so much good work that's come from our protestant brothers and sisters.  Look at the fervour in their worship and their mission work.  There's much to learn from them.   Having said that, it's obvious that significant divisions exist between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches - something will not changing no matter how much we bicker here.<br><br>Accept my comments or not, it is your choice.  My priest once shared a nugget of wisdom to me, which i would like to share everyone here :<br><br>"For those who believe, there is nothing that you can say to change his belief.  Likewise, for those who don't believe, there is nothing you can say to make him believe.  Such changes need to come from the heart, and it is through God that we are touched is such ways."<br><br></div>

The "rock" in Matt 16:18, can be and should be in my opinion, intepreted as Peter's confession that Jesus is the Christ. Christianity (including Catholism) is not found upon Peter, but upon Christ, as the name suggests.<br></div>
