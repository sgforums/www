            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fandango:</div><div class="quote_body">Right, if you were what you said you were - a Methodist, i assume you have a bible that you used when you were a Methodist, and i will further assume that you have a Roman Catholic Bible. If you want to get to the bottom of this issue - that is if you really care, compare both bible. It takes a little bit of time but you will soon realise...wouww......very different.<br><br>Why is there such differences? thats the answer to the question where the bible came from. The Roman Catholic bible came from the careful scrutinising and altering by the Pope and the Council in the first 100 years. (You may be right here). But I am sure the Protestants uses the bible from the faihful translation from the original scriptures. (This have also changed because those modern versions NIV,NKJV adopted the transalation of the Roman Catholic text. Bad news. )<br><br>Nobody will agree with me? You will be surprised.<br><br>George Bush? That may be the last person you want to mention. George W Bush and Bush Snr are life members of a secret society called The Skull and Bones. And.......get ready for this....it is a society that worship.....tada.....Lucifer.<br><br></div></blockquote>Peace to u in the name of Christ. U mentioned that protestants uses bible from the faithful translation from the original scriptures. The original scriptures were not found and can never be found. The first bible is compiled by RC...and it was in greek. so how could protestant compile something from no where? if u say u are the last to have compile from the orignal scriptures......does that mean protestant have the original scriputres in thier hand????? There is the existence of the Dead Sea Scroll too...hav u heard about it from the protestant side. And again...protestant just mean " to protest / go against " catholic. But..dun forget...there are alot alot of cults in the so call protestant itself..and each of the denomination have different teachings.... Unless ur church is the only church on earth that is correct ..then ur church will be flooded by ppl rite. will ur pastor consider in building a new church? if new churches are built....will ur pastor elect someone to be incharge of all the churches in order to syncronize the teachings??? or will he just ignore the new church and let it be watever it will be?? then when it is big enough to go around the world....ppl will start firing back and say..well church do not need a leader...just pray to Jesus.. and stuff...mind u, catholic also pray to Jesus. I do not worship my priest..i only kneel down to God and God alone.<br><br>Catholic praying to statue? Jesus christ on the cross...Idol worshiping..? Well...i have a picture of my galfren. I miss her so much..i took out her picture...sometimes i talk to the picture..saying " i love u", i kiss the picture..and i keep it proeperly...so does that mean i am praying / worshiping to the picture..believing her spirit lies within the picture....come on.....i kneel to the cross..just simply i RESPECT and LOVE Jesus...even if i kiss it.<br><br>I am just sharring my view....i just pray that we will live in harmony. I had been a catholic for 20 years....from wat i had known...the priest had never once mentioned a word that condemn other christians ( from my own experience ). God bless u all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>finally got some time to spare to post some difference between Catholic Jesus and Biblical Jesus:<br><br>1. Catholic Jesus has been widely potrayed as one with his heart exposed. What normally known as Sacred Heart of Jesus. No where in the Bible did Jesus told ppl to honour his heart. The 12 promises of honoring the heart is not biblical..it keeps on emphasizing exposing the image of the heart to obtain grace and blessings when one honours the picture.<br><br>2. Catholic Jesus appear in several occassions revealing images of himself for ppl to venerate. The Divine Mercy image is one of the occassions in which 'Jesus' told ppl to make a painting of him and honour it to obtain grace and mercy. Biblical Jesus before His ascension pray for His followers and gave the command about preaching the good news and wait for the coming of the Holy Spirit, the Helper. He didnt give instructions to make paintings and hang and honour them.<br><br>3. Catholic Jesus is believed to reside in the tabernacle. That is why catholics when entering a catholic church will genuflect to show respect to the presence. Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament is when catholics believed that the consecrated host become real flesh and blood, soul and divinity of Christ. When placed in a receptacle known as monstrance, catholics are to kneel before that bread and worship it as if Christ is really there. Biblical Jesus celebrate the Last supper and insititute it as a remembrance for all of us. He never ask ppl to place that bread in a photo frame and worship it. Worship God in spirit and in truth.<br><br>Conclusion:  Catholic Jesus reveal many things in which is contrary to the teachings of the Bible and in no way is the same Jesus as we read about in the Bible.

I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.<br><br>-2 Corinthians 11:4-15<br><br></div>

Since you are so fundamentalist, why don't you read the Bible carefully . Did Jesus ask you to read the 'Bible' or follow his teachigs or his apostles. Is the word bible in the word ?<br>Jesus asked us to follow his teachings passed down from the apostles and the Holy Spirit is always revealing Himself in history. What you mentioned Sacred heart etc are devotions revealed by Christ himself. It is not compulsory for Catholics to follow.<br><br>Isn't it interesting that when protestants mentioned about so and so pastors receive some revelations from God, nobody say anything and just believe. But Catholics mentioned something like on a world wide scale, they started to bad mouth.<br><br>Remember my brother, Satan always go for division and not harmony.<br><br>Somebody said that RC bible is different from King James bible. Sorry which one came first. Where did the King James bible comes from ? It is definitely not from original book ( there was none ) . It is all from the Catholic Bible.<br><br>Unlike Islam, Christianity is not a religion of a book but spirit. Christ, in order to pass down his teaching has formed a Church - The RC Church.<br><br>Can anyone of your man build church claim to trace back to the apostles or may be Rome ( St Peter and Paul died there ) ?<br><br>Look at all your contradiction in all your spilted protestant churches. Are you sure you are same in teaching ? why so many sects ?<br><br>Let me tell you why. Because each pastor seek to have his own power base and spilt from the mainstream. Each pastor thinks he know the bible best. Cannot agree , spilt from them. this is what happen between RC and others.<br>Not humble enough to submit to authority.<br><br>Why they always based only on bible and anything not in it, condemn ?Because when you form a group, you need a constitution. You need a base. They have no base, no Vatican, No Pope, so follow the lawyer style, cling to a book and interpret the way they want.<br><br></div>

Many modern versions actually relied on the Catholic translation for some verses, since the Authorized Version, or rather the Textus Receptus, sucks for those verses.<br><br>If fandango is to read this reply, may I know his opinion of the Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus?

The Catholic claim of Peter starting the church in Rome is a weak one. In Acts and probably elsewhere, Peter is described as based in Jerusalem.

So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.</blockquote>Then fandango says tat george bush is a satanist but he keep making christian policy...<br><br><a href="http://christianity.about.com/library/weekly/aa110899.htm" rel="nofollow">http://christianity.about.com/library/weekly/aa110899.htm</a><br><br>there r more instances about bush being more christian than u think if u want.<br><br>in short, all this point to the conclusion<br><br><strong>christainity is satanist...</strong><br><br>I know I am going to be shoot by tis  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus are currently the oldest manuscripts not because they are the FIRST copy. It is just that they outlasted the original  earliest papyrus copies of the Scriptures.</strong><br><br>To talk like a papyrus scholar, these two are the oldest extant manuscripts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>Many view that both codex have been currupted.</strong><br><br>I read somewhere that they disagree in many places. What irony. While Christians would like to argue for the early date of the manuscripts, the reality could be they have been corrupted. So much for the reliability of the 'oldest extant manuscripts'.<br><br><strong>I stand by the KJV because of the translation from Ben Chayyim Hebrew Masoretic Text and the Greek Textus Receptusas the original language used in biblical times. </strong><br><br>The best Masoretic Texts are still 9th or 10th century productions. The Aleppo Codex dated to that era. Since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, it is widely agreed that the LXX Septuagint is closer to the original Hebrew Bible than the Masoretic Texts. (the LXX bears closer resemblance to the scrolls)<br><br>Regarding the Textus Receptus, what makes it more authentic than the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus?<br><br><strong>You may suspect that modern bible version (NIV, NKJV and "can't remember acroynmns") may have been translated from the 2 codex.</strong><br><br>Wait a minute, you mean the NKJV is a translation from scratch?
