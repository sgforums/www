That is why I say <strong>think</strong> of it as a friendly argument, as oppose to a do-or-die session of justifying your existance.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nukewatch:</div><div class="quote_body">I assume that this statement comes from an intepretation of Matt 16:18,<br><br>"And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it."<br><br>This intepretation runs contrary to 1 Cor. 3:11,<br><br>"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ"<br><br>Other verses, Acts 4:11, 1 Cor. 10:4 and Eph. 2:20, expicitly state that the"rock" is Jesus. The "rock" in Matt 16:18, can be and should be in my opinion, intepreted as Peter's confession that Jesus is the Christ. Christianity (including Catholism) is not found upon Peter, but upon Christ, as the name suggests.<br></div></blockquote>One of the main contentions that Protestants have with the Catholic Church is the interpretation of Matthew 16:18 where Jesus says, "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church. Historical Protestantism has had a hard time accepting the Catholic view that Peter is the rock to which Jesus referred.<br><br>They have advanced two alternative interpretations: First, it has been said that Jesus is remarking about Peter's faith and/or confession, saying, in effect, that it is as solid as a rock.<br><br>Since the soteriology of the Protestant movement was based on sola fide (faith alone), it seems fitting that Protestants see in Peter the prototype of that solitary faith.<br><br>Second, it is said that Jesus Himself is the rock, not Peter. Since they claim that the metaphor "rock" in the Bible is invariably used in reference to God, Protestants cannot see how a mere man can be designated as something that is exclusive to divinity.<br><br>To support these views, the more scholarly Protestant may even point to the interpretation of some of the Fathers of the Church. For example, it is true that in the writings Augustine, at least two of the views of the rock can be found. Various other Church Fathers offer one or more of the three interpretations as well. So, we must be careful in accusing the Protestants of a novel interpretation of the rock that was not known until the 16th century.<br><br>Upon closer examination, however, we find that most of the Church Fathers agreed that Peter was the rock of Matthew 16:18. Even the few who failed to see Peter as the rock did not have any problem with Peter's primacy. Augustine, in whom we find at least two views, was unequivocal that the chair of Peter in Rome was the supreme authority for the Church. His famous statement, "Rome has spoken, the case is closed," has rung in the ears of Catholics for a millennium and a half. Further, one needs to understand the contexts in which Augustine was writing, as well as the theological license he gave himself to explain the deeper truths of the Faith. All in all, Augustine was a diehard supporter of the papacy.<br><br>Interesting developments in the exegesis of Matthew 16:18-19 have occurred in the Protestant world since the turn of this century. Many Protestant scholars have come to the conclusion that Peter is indeed the rock to which Jesus referred. Renowned Protestant theologians such as Oscar Cullman and Herman Ridderbos have written voluminous works exegeting Matthew 16:18 in fine detail, showing that classical Protestant exegesis is full of false assumptions and shortcomings. One of the more salient errors pointed out by these sources is the Protestant claim that the original Greek of Matthew 16:18 made a lexical distinction between Peter (Greek: petros) and rock (Greek: petra). Petros was understood to be a small stone or pebble, while petra was understood to be a huge, immovable rock, or rocky cliff. Conclusion: Peter could not be the rock to which Jesus referred, since it is obvious that a small stone is not a huge, immovable rock. In discovering more about Greek etymology, however, Protestant scholars learned that petros and Petra are actually interchangeable terms. Though desiring to complete the pun and convey assonance, the Gospel writer was simply limited by the fact that since Peter is a masculine name, it must be designated by a masculine Greek noun (i.e., petros), whereas petra is a feminine noun.<br><br><a href="http://www.netacc.net/%7Emafg/peter01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.netacc.net/%7Emafg/peter01.htm</a></div>
