Protestants failed to understand the meaning behind because most of the churches were started in late centuries when people are more educated ect.<br>In the early Church most people do not know how to read. There was not even a Bible as we see today. Because of persistant persecutions from the pagans, the Catholic Church under the Pope at that time decided to have the books collected so that they can have at least someting in writing to pass on to future generations. Martin Luthur mentioned that it was due to the RC church that we owned the Bible. It is like when you form a society and you have your beliefs and culture. When your society gets bigger and you are afraid to lose its identity, you want to write things down for future members. Same as a company founder who want to make sure the basic tenats of his company be passed on to future owners.<br>But the Church have an unwritten tradition passed down from the apostles and early Church Fathers. The Church father bears witness to the faith. For example St Ignatius who was martyred in the colessums spoke of ' where there is peter, there is the Catholic Church' You may read these readings yourself.<br>Early Christians did use symbols and pics to remind them of the faith. Go to Rome and see the catacombs or Israel.<br>When you see the picture of your late relative or friend or even girlfriend, it helps you to focus on that person and remind you of him or her. This is not worship.<br>I agree that some catholics put superstitions into the pics etc but this popular piety not official church teaching.<br>As a Catholic if you feel that you don't need these sacramentals, you don't have do. In fact if you go to modern RC churches in the US, you find no images except the crucifix.<br>Lets not argue over these petty things.

In fact your second belief was confirmed by the RC church in the early centuries. St Augustine was the one who challenged the heretical beliefs in those days and won at the council.

You will find that images are not to be made for worship. Nothing condemns them being made for the purpose of directing our minds and hearts to God. How can images be wrong when they facilitate our prayer and worship of the One Lord?<br><blockquote>if God knows humans like pictures so much..then y the bible is all in words?</blockquote>Firstly, in the early years of the Church, before the masses knew how to read as they do today, pictures were used to teach the people about Christ and the stories of the Bible. It is for that reason that many stained-glass windows, paintings, and statues were created. Also, if you look at the very first editions and printings of the King James Bible--as well as similar bibles of that time period--you will find that they are extensively adorned w/ wood carvings and other artwork and illustrations.<br><br>Of course, today, since most Christians can read, the Bible is mostly in words. Words are also the most effective way to get any point across--much more effective then pictures. However, this does not discredit the use of pictures to "illustrate" a story or to aid our prayer life.<br><br><blockquote>the bible also emphasise on a faith that require no sight. then why keep insisting people need to see and touch some relics and pictures in order to believe?</blockquote>Catholics do not insist on these at all. We argue not that the use of pictures and relics is absolutely necessary, but that the use of them is an orthodox practice. This is a big difference. Also, Catholics have plenty of "faith without seeing," the most notable example being our belief in the Real Presence.<br><br><blockquote>Grace from God is it tt limited that we need sacramentals such as medals and scapulars to obtain? Christ's death is not powerful and sufficient enough to make us worthy of God's grace? Mary dun wear medals..yet she is highly favored and God's grace is on her.</blockquote>No one is claiming that medals and scapulars are absolutely necessary. We can and do receive grace w/o them. We merely contend that grace can also be received through the physical aided by the spiritual.<br><br><blockquote>Moses and all the biblical figures do not encounter God in bread and images. They saw God in visions and out of faith.</blockquote>For one thing, visions are images. Secondly, if manna from the sky isn't people encountering God in bread, what do you call it?<br><br><blockquote>Pictorial representations, no matter how legitimate it seems on human terms is not the right manner to remember, observe, worship and honour God-the invisible.</blockquote>We are merely claiming that it is right, not that it is THE right way, or more right then any other way<br><br><blockquote>Why dun we worship a picture of Jesus's brain so that we can have the mind of Christ?<br></blockquote>I repeat once again, we do not worship these images. We do not worship paintings or statues of Jesus. No worship is being afforded these things. Instead, these things direct our worship to God.<br>Hence, in the devotion to the Sacred Heart, there are two elements: a sensible element, the Heart of flesh, and a spiritual element, that which this Heart of flesh recalls spiritual element, that which this Heart of flesh recalls and represents. But these two elements do not form two distinct objects, merely co-ordinated they constitute but one, just as do the body and soul, and the sign and the thing signified. Hence it is also understood that these two elements are as essential to the devotion as body and soul are essential to man. Of the two elements constituting the whole, the principal one is love, which is as much the cause of the devotion and its reason for existence as the soul is the principal element in man. Consequently, devotion to the Sacred Heart may be defined as devotion to the adorable Heart of Jesus Christ in so far as this Heart represents and recalls His love; or, what amounts to the same thing, devotion to the love of Jesus Christ in so far as this love is recalled and symbolically represented to us by His Heart of flesh.<br></div>

How can images be wrong when they facilitate our prayer and worship of the One Lord?</blockquote>Regarding to your explanation..statues and images that direct our worship to the God of the Bible is ok....i show you wat the bible says...<br><br>Exodus 32<br><br>The Golden Calf<br><br>1 When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."<br>2 Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me." 3 So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron. 4 He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. <strong>Then they said, "These are your gods,  O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."</strong><br>5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD ." 6 So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. [3] Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.<br>7 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt. 8 They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'<br>9 "I have seen these people," the LORD said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people. 10 Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>When the Israelites made the golden calf..it was not some pagan gods they have in mind when they made it. Infact when u read the words in bold...they ascribe to the calf what the God of Israel did. They say....this is the  'god' who brought them out of Egypt. They worship the calf as though worshipping God and recognising what God has done for them....in the wrong manner and God hates it.  Many of us can also worship the true God in a false manner....<br><br></div>

Maybe you are rightÂ….<br><br>Absolutely not!!<br><br>To begin with the "queen of heaven" found in the book of Jeremiah has no bearing or relation with Mary. The text in question has to do with Ishtar, the Assyro-Babylonian goddess of fertility. This pagan worship was initiated under Manasseh and was restored after the death of Josiah. Pagan worship, then as now, is considered an abomination by Jews and Christians alike, including the first Christians, Catholics.  Catholics do not regard the Blessed Mother of the Lord as a god, or goddess, or anything of the sort!<br>This whole Protestant argument is not the Biblical text or true history, it is simply based on the similarity in the title, "Queen of Heaven", and is a very weak position. The fact that a pagan deity was known, as the "queen of heaven" doesn't mean this term can't rightfully be applied, in another sense altogether, to Mary.<br><br>In the second place, the fact that a pagan deity was known as the queen of heaven doesn't mean this term can't rightfully be applied, in another sense altogether, to Mary. The pagan king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, is called the king of kings by Daniel (Daniel 2:37), yet this doesn't preclude Jesus from being called by the same title (Rev. 17:14; 19:16).<br>Thirdly, Mary, whom all generations "shall call blessed." (Luke 1:4<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> has a legitimate claim to the title of QUEEN OF HEAVEN. As Christians we acknowledge Christ as the king of heaven (Matt. 19:23-24). And a King of the Davidic Royal line "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David"(Luke: 1:32) The Sacred Scriptures specifically refer to Mary as the mother of Christ  over 25 times.<br><br>Next, we must note "The mother of the ruling monarch is known as the Queen Mother," (World Book Encyclopedia 2000) So we see that "Queen Mother" refers to the mother (Mary) of a reigning monarch (The Divine King, Jesus Christ).<br><br>The Queen Mother, "Gebi Rah" in Hebrew, was a distinct honor, and a tradition began by the son of David, Solomon. The Sacred Scriptures show in Ancient Israel or Judah the mother of the designated heir enjoyed a special status. Nathan enlisted Bathsheba rather than Solomon in his plan to have Solomon confirmed as king (1 Kings 1:11-40). Queen mother was an official position in Israel and Judah. Great care was taken in preserving the names of the queen mothers (1 Kings 14:21; 15:2, 13; 22:42; 2 Kings 8:26). AsaÂ’s removal of his mother from the office for idolatry (1 Kings 15:13) points to its official character. On her sonÂ’s death, Athaliah murdered her own grandsons, the legitimate heirs, in order to retain the power she had enjoyed as queen mother (2 Kings 11:1-2). The queen mother served as a trusted counsel for her son Proverbs:  31:1). In the Scriptures God heavily, heavily emphasized the queen mother's of the Davidic Royal line. In Scriptures over 25 times that after the introduction of the Jewish king, the queen mother is recognized Each Time. In all of these verses notice the words, "and his mother's name was". Notice what the king does for his mother, he stands to greet her, pays homage to her, and had a throne built for her at his right hand side.<br>So we see that Mary has a right to the title of "Queen of Heaven" but were does scripture say God say he will have a Queen?  In Psalms: 45:9, 12, and 17 we read:<br><br>"Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the QUEEN in gold of Ophir...even the rich among the people SHALL INTREAT THY FAVOUR. I will make THY NAME TO BE REMEMBERED IN ALL GENERATIONS: therefore shall the people PRAISE THEE for ever and ever."<br>Her name remembered in all generations. Ring a bell? The prophecy comes to fulfillment in Luke 1:48: "For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth ALL GENERATATIONS SHALL CALL ME blessed". In the Book of Revelation we read.<br>"A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars." (Rev. 12:1-2)<br>What kinds of women wear crowns? Queens wear crowns, but this woman seems to be crowned with the 'highest jewels' of creation, the stars, with the sun itself as her royal robes.<br><br>"Then the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring, those who keep God's commandments and bear witness to Jesus."(Rev. 12:17)<br>Satan could not get the woman (enmity Gen 3:16) so he went to fight her spiritual children, Christians, people who bear witness to Jesus the Christ.<br>Even Martin Luther preached after his break with Rome on the Feast of the Visitation (July 2, 1532) --<br>"She, the Lady above heaven and earth, must have a heart so humble that she might have no shame in washing the swaddling clothes or preparing a bath for St. John the Baptist, like a servant girl. What humility! It would surely have been more just to have arranged for her a golden coach, pulled by 4,000 horses, and to cry and proclaim as the carriage proceeded: 'Here passes the woman who is raised FAR ABOVE all women, indeed above the WHOLE human race.'"<br>Five years later, preaching on the same feast day, Luther said --<br>"She was not filled with pride by this praise...this immense praise: 'No woman is like unto thee! Thou art more than an EMPRESS or a QUEEN....blessed above all nobility, wisdom, or saintliness!'"<br></div>
