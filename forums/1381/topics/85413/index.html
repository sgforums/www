            <div class='col-md body'>I am sad to see so many anti-catholism comments in this forum. May be the government should intervene under the religious harmony act.<br><br>My separated brothers and sisters do not forget that the Christian message is love and non judementall. How do you know you are right ? Do not judge but build on your own spiritual life rather than condemn. Remember the Lord's words that not everybody who shout Lord Lord or perform miracles will be saved but  those who do His Will - Love.<br><br>Whether you like it or not, the Catholic Church is the early Church of Christ. The Church did not invent any new doctrines but contrary many have taken out her teachings passed down from the apostles. They interpret the Bible literally and only read what they want to see rather than the whole picture.<br><br>There are many things that we can learn from our separted brothers and sisters and so i hope you can learn from us too.<br><br>Watch the MOVIE Mother Theresa of Calcultta and you will see how a true Christian should behave.<br><br></div>

Friend, where did you get your sources from??? Tracts handed out by certain churches? I have read one of them, and it happens to be printed by a certain mission in Singapore.... Anti-Catholicism is alive and kicking eh?...</div>

Which is your church ? Nobody even in mainstream protestant de nominations agrees with you ( or may be yours is not )<br>Pls go to Rome, Israel, Palestine etc and look at Christianity there. Or go to Iraq then the 'babylon', only Catholics are there and can be traced back to the apostles. can your church trace back ?<br><br>As i have said, the bible did not exists after a hundreds years or more... It was the Pope and the RC Church who put these letters together. If they are wrong then you are also reading the wrong bible now.<br><br>It is fruitless to argue on all these points. The basic tenat is to follow God commandments - Love your God, Love your enemy. If you do this, i don't care whether you are Catholic or not. The apostolic Church still loves you.<br><br>Ask yourself and your pastor deep in your own conscious, are you arging over this in order to create polarity ie draw people away from RC to join your church - a marketing tool we learn from school. Bad mouthing others to boost your own self esteem.</div>

While I am an extremely entrenched Protestant and some of the RC's doctrines are extremely far-out to me, I am not sure what is achieved by the continual arguments and counter-arguments from both camps.<br>No one is certain (at least not me) whether Constantine or Peter founded the RC, or perhaps Dan Brown's conspiracy thoery is correct (refer to Dan Brown's best seller "Da Vinci Code"), the prolong argument accomplishes nothing here.</div>
