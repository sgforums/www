Let us be careful of these people cause they may run into the same track and the world willl not be at peace.  </div></blockquote>I agreed with you x2.  I want to be catholic too and have decided to take up catholic class next year and I was from other dinomination.</div>

Then upon reading it a couple of times more, and then trying to validate the "facts" the plot is too painfully contrived. Eg the value of "Pi" in a hive of bees... not true, the number of pieces in the Lourve, 666? not true....<br><br>Nonetheless fun to read but not to be taken seriously...<br><br>Than the other books, they get worst...<br></div>

Dunno can match Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad Poor Dad" or not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But many christians in Singapore have not read it. Bah, as if it is on the church's list of recommended readings. You are the first one I know who have read it.<br><br>So sian, the whole book they running everywhere to solve the never-ending puzzles, no time for romance.<br><br>Dunno whether you find it strange or not, but the whole DVC all the characters are male except Princess Wisdom and Marie.<br><br>I guess Langdon has Vittoria liao, no place in his heart for Princess Wisdom. But I'm wondering what happened or what will happen in Florence for that one week ... hehe</div>
