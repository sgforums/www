              <p>Nope. I am saying that there are commands given that are only meant for a specific people for a specific time for a specific purpose. Bible critics distort the Bible when they try to use such commands to prove that it should be done so today. Why do Bible critics like to use the OT but not appeal to the NT? The answer is obvious. They fail to understand the Bible as it was meant to be understood. They see God command something, and they assume that every command is universal and must be applied across space and time.</p>

              <p>Ok localised. I agree it's localised.</p>
              <p>Can you tell me if stoning and "removing sinners by the sword using armies" are acceptable today?</p>

              <p>Here's the thing. You read the Bible and "studied" it deep deep right? What did Jesus say concerning the use of the sword and His kingdom? Need a hint?</p>

              <p>The point being made was about the rationale for exterminating
              everything. What's absurd was that you missed that whole point and
              instead haggled over whether babies are pests!</p>

              <p>Nope. That's not what I am saying. Please read properly what I did say. I am saying that if God said "A" then we should first understand who this was intended for and for what purpose and whether it should be applicable to us today.</p>

              <p>Why you keep coming up with "what if" scenarios? Like that where got end? Shoot down one you come up with another. All this just so that you can finally come up with one where you can finally say "Aha! Got you, now you know why I must reject the Bible, right?"</p>
