              executioner...then is he guilty of deliberate killing aka murder?
              so shld nt he be sent to the gallows as well? so can i say tat by
              allowing the executioner to get away, we are contradicting the
              country's law tat says anyone guilty of murder is to be hanged?</p>
              <p>u muz take note, God is the law-giver, he is the one who put the
              laws in place...the executioner is nt guilty of murder cos he was
              executing the law, he was given authority to kill the
              criminal...since God is the law-giver, isnt he like the
              excutioner/judge who holds the authority?</p>
              <p>regarding lying, same thing...who set the law tat thou shall nt
              lie?</p>

              <p>Perhaps you can think of it this way, evil people do not deserve to be told the truth because they have no moral claim to it. I tend to agree with despondent on this. God knows the beginning from the end. If someone demands you to tell the whereabouts of your sister so that they can rape her, you gonna stick to telling the truth to them and spill the beans on her? What are you going to do? People who are entitled to the truth should be told the truth. But to those who are not deserving of the truth, but hate the truth, they will want to live in a delusion.</p>

              <p>And the situation is to lie when someone asks you where your sister is so they can rape her. Of course it's right to lie...and not tell the truth in that situation.</p>
