              <p>I believe in a hierarchy of values. A higher value overrides a lower one. If withholding the truth to an evil man is what it takes to preserve the life of a loved one, then it is not a sin to deny the evil man the truth. But please answer my question concerning the scenario of evil man raping your sister.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Tthe command to wipe out certain groups of people was given to a specific people for a specific purpose for a specific time. It is unwarranted of you to assume that this localised command should be universal across space and time. If it was then we should expect the NT to also continue to teach it. Eh, I thought you study the Bible deep deep? How come it still does not show?</p>

              <p>Tthe command to wipe out certain groups of people was given to a
              specific people for a specific purpose for a specific time. It is
              unwarranted of you to assume that this localised command should be
              universal across space and time. If it was then we should expect
              the NT to also continue to teach it. Eh, I thought you
              study the Bible deep deep? How come it still does not show?</p>

              <p>I get you. It's acceptable for God to wipe out Amalek babies in the OT but not acceptable in the 11th century or now.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>I believe it is OK to punish sin. We also do it in our courts of law when we punish wrongdoing. The question is in who has the authority to effect or impose that punishment. Back in the OT, God would be the one to command it. Israel cannot do it on her own terms and decision. The same with our laws. Only the judge can set the punishment, we cannot be our own vigilantes.</p>
