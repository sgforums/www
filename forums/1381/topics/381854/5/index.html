              <p>Here is some evidence for the ressurection and existence of Christianity :</p>
              <p>http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/num9.htm</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The Strategy of the
              Argument for the Resurrection: Five Possible Theories</span></strong></p>
              <p>We believe Christ's resurrection can be
              proved with at least as much certainty as any universally
              believed and well-documented event in ancient history. To prove
              this, we do not need to presuppose anything controversial (e.g.
              that miracles happen). But the skeptic must also not presuppose
              anything (e.g. that they do not). We do not need to presuppose
              that the New Testament is infallible, or divinely inspired or
              even true. We do not need to presuppose that there really was an
              empty tomb or post-resurrection appearances, as recorded. We need
              to presuppose only two things, both of which are hard data,
              empirical data, which no one denies:</p>
              <p><strong>I. The existence of the New
              Testament texts as we have them. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>II. The existence (but not
              necessarily the truth) of the Christian religion as we find it
              today.</strong></p>
              <p>The question is this: Which theory about
              what really happened in Jerusalem on that first Easter Sunday can
              account for the data? There are five possible theories:
              Christianity, hallucination, myth, conspiracy and swoon.</p>
              <p><strong>Jesus died ---
              Jesus rose ----------------------------------</strong> <strong>(1) </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Christianity</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Jesus didn't rise
              --- the apostles were deceived -----</strong> <strong>(2) </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Hallucination</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>the
                          apostles were myth-makers -------------------------</strong> <strong>(3) </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Myth</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>the
                          apostles were deceivers ------------------------------</strong> <strong>(4) </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Conspiracy</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Jesus didn't die
              ----------------------------------------------</strong> <strong>(5) </strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Swoon</strong></span></p>
              <p>Theories 2 and 4 constitute a dilemma:
              if Jesus didn't rise, then the apostles, who taught that he did,
              were either deceived (if they thought he did) or deceivers (if
              they knew he didn't). The Modernists could not escape this
              dilemma until they came up with a middle category, myth. It is
              the most popular alternative today.</p>
              <p>Thus either (1) the resurrection really
              happened, (2) the apostles were deceived by a hallucination, (3)
              the apostles created a myth, not meaning it literally, (4) the
              apostles were deceivers who conspired to foist on the world the
              most famous and successful lie in history, or (5) Jesus only
              swooned and was resuscitated, not resurrected. All five theories
              are logically possible, and therefore must be fairly investigated
              -- even (1) ! They are also the <strong>only</strong> possibilities, unless we include really far-out ideas that
              responsible historians have never taken seriously, such as that
              Jesus was really a Martian who came in a flying saucer. Or that
              he never even existed; that the whole story was the world's
              greatest fantasy novel, written by some simple fisherman; that he
              was a literary character whom everyone in history mistook for a
              real person, including all Christians <strong>and</strong> their
              enemies, until some scholar many centuries later got the real
              scoop from sources unnamed.</p>
              <p>If we can refute all other theories
              (2-5), we will have proved the truth of the resurrection (1). The
              form of the argument here is similar to that of most of the
              arguments for the existence of God. Neither God nor the
              resurrection are directly observable, but from data that <strong>are</strong> directly observable we can argue that the only possible adequate
              explanation of this data is the Christian one.</p>
              <p>We shall take the four non-believing
              theories in the following order: from the simplest, least popular
              and most easily refuted to the most confusing, most popular and
              most complexly refuted: first swoon, then conspiracy, then
              hallucination and finally myth.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Refutation of the Swoon
              Theory: Nine Arguments</span></strong></p>
              <p>Nine pieces of evidence refute the swoon
              theory:</p>
              <p><strong>(1)</strong> Jesus could not have survived crucifixion. Roman
              procedures were very careful to eliminate that possibility. Roman
              law even laid the death penalty on any soldier who let a capital
              prisoner escape in any way, including bungling a crucifixion. It
              was never done.</p>
              <p><strong>(2)</strong> The fact that the Roman soldier did not break
              Jesus' legs, as he did to the other two crucified criminals (Jn
              19:31-33), means that the soldier was sure Jesus was dead.
              Breaking the legs hastened the death so that the corpse could be
              taken down before the sabbath (v. 31).</p>
              <p><strong>(3)</strong> John, an eyewitness, certified that he saw blood
              and water come from Jesus' pierced heart (Jn 19:34-35). This
              shows that Jesus' lungs had collapsed and he had died of
              asphyxiation. Any medical expert can vouch for this.</p>
              <p><strong>(4)</strong> The body was totally encased in winding sheets
              and entombed (Jn 19:38-42).</p>
              <p><strong>(5)</strong> The post-resurrection appearances convinced the
              disciples, even "doubting Thomas," that Jesus was
              gloriously alive (Jn 20:19-29). It is psychologically impossible
              for the disciples to have been so transformed and confident if
              Jesus had merely struggled out of a swoon, badly in need of a
              doctor. A half-dead, staggering sick man who has just had a
              narrow escape is not worshiped fearlessly as divine lord and
              conquerer of death.</p>
              <p><strong>(6)</strong> How were the Roman guards at the tomb
              overpowered by a swooning corpse? Or by unarmed disciples? And if
              the disciples did it, they knowingly lied when they wrote the
              Gospels, and we are into the conspiracy theory, which we will
              refute shortly.</p>
              <p><strong>(7)</strong> How could a swooning half-dead man have moved
              the great stone at the door of the tomb? Who moved the stone if
              not an angel? No one has ever answered that question. Neither the
              Jews nor the Romans would move it, for it was in both their
              interests to keep the tomb sealed, the Jews had the stone put
              there in the first place, and the Roman guards would be killed if
              they let the body "escape."</p>
              <p>The story the Jewish authorities spread,
              that the guards fell asleep and the disciples stole the body (Mt
              28:11-15), is unbelievable. Roman guards would not fall asleep on
              a job like that; if they did, they would lose their lives. And
              even if they did fall asleep, the crowd and the effort and the
              noise it would have taken to move an enormous boulder would have
              wakened them. Furthermore, we are again into the conspiracy
              theory, with all its unanswerable difficulties (see next
              section).</p>
              <p><strong>(8)</strong> If Jesus awoke from a swoon, where did he go?
              Think this through: you have a living body to deal with now, not
              a dead one. Why did it disappear? There is absolutely no data,
              not even any false, fantastic, imagined data, about Jesus' life
              after his crucifixion, in any sources, friend or foe, at any
              time, early or late. A man like that, with a past like that,
              would have left traces.</p>
              <p><strong>(9)</strong> Most simply, the swoon theory necessarily turns
              into the conspiracy theory or the hallucination theory, for the
              disciples testified that Jesus did not swoon but really died and
              really rose.</p>
              <p>It may seem that these nine arguments
              have violated our initial principle about not presupposing the
              truth of the Gospel texts, since we have argued from data in the
              texts. But the swoon theory does not challenge the truths in the
              texts which we refer to as data; it uses them and explains them
              (by swoon rather than resurrection). Thus we use them too. We
              argue from our opponents' own premises.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Refutation of the
              Conspiracy Theory: Seven Arguments</span></strong></p>
              <p>Why couldn't the disciples have made up
              the whole story?</p>
              <p><strong>(1)</strong> Blaise Pascal gives a simple, psychologically
              sound proof for why this is unthinkable:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"The apostles were either
                  deceived or deceivers. Either supposition is difficult, for
                  it is not possible to imagine that a man has risen from the
                  dead. While Jesus was with them, he could sustain them; but
                  afterwards, if he did not appear to them, who did make them
                  act? The hypothesis that the Apostles were knaves is quite
                  absurd. Follow it out to the end, and imagine these twelve
                  men meeting after Jesus' death and conspiring to say that he
                  has risen from the dead. This means attacking all the powers
                  that be. The human heart is singularly susceptible to
                  fickleness, to change, to promises, to bribery. One of them
                  had only to deny his story under these inducements, or still
                  more because of possible imprisonment, tortures and death,
                  and they would all have been lost. Follow that out."
                  (Pascal, <em><strong>Pensees</strong></em> 322, 310)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The "cruncher" in this
              argument is the historical fact that no one, weak or strong,
              saint or sinner, Christian or heretic, ever confessed, freely or
              under pressure, bribe or even torture, that the whole story of
              the resurrection was a fake a lie, a deliberate deception. Even
              when people broke under torture, denied Christ and worshiped
              Caesar, they never let <strong>that</strong> cat out of the bag,
              never revealed that the resurrection was their conspiracy. For
              that cat was never <strong>in</strong> that bag. No Christians
              believed the resurrection was a conspiracy; if they had, they
              wouldn't have become Christians.</p>
              <p><strong>(2)</strong> If they made up the story, they were the most
              creative, clever, intelligent fantasists in history, far
              surpassing Shakespeare, or Dante or Tolkien. Fisherman's
              "fish stories" are never that elaborate, that
              convincing, that life-changing, and that enduring.</p>
              <p><strong>(3)</strong> The disciples' character argues strongly against
              such a conspiracy on the part of all of them, with no dissenters.
              They were simple, honest, common peasants, not cunning, conniving
              liars. They weren't even lawyers! Their sincerity is proved by
              their words <strong>and</strong> deeds. They preached a
              resurrected Christ and they lived a resurrected Christ. They
              willingly died for their "conspiracy." Nothing proves
              sincerity like martyrdom. They change in their lives from fear to
              faith, despair to confidence, confusion to certitude, runaway
              cowardice to steadfast boldness under threat and persecution, not
              only proves their sincerity but testifies to some powerful cause
              of it. Can a lie cause such a transformation? Are truth and
              goodness such enemies that the greatest good in history --
              sanctity -- has come from the greatest lie?</p>
              <p>Use your imagination and sense of
              perspective here. Imagine twelve poor, fearful, stupid (read the
              Gospels!) peasants changing the hard-nosed Roman world with a
              lie. And not an easily digested, attractive lie either. St.
              Thomas Aquinas says:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"In the midst of the tyranny of
                  the persecutors, an innumerable throng of people, both simple
                  and learned, flocked to the Christian faith. In this faith
                  there are truths proclaimed that surpass every human
                  intellect; the pleasures of the flesh are curbed; it is
                  taught that the things of the world should be spurned. Now,
                  for the minds of mortal men to assent to these things is the
                  greatest of miracles....This wonderful conversion of the
                  world to the Christian faith is the clearest witness....For
                  it would be truly more wonderful than all signs if the world
                  had been led by simply and humble men to believe such lofty
                  truths, to accomplish such difficult actions, and to have
                  such high hopes." (<em><strong>Summa Contra Gentiles</strong></em>,
                  I, 6)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>(4)</strong> There could be no possible motive for such a
              lie. Lies are always told for some selfish advantage. What
              advantage did the "conspirators" derive from their
              "lie" ? They were hated, scorned, persecuted,
              excommunicated, imprisoned, tortured, exiled, crucified, boiled
              alive, roasted, beheaded, disemboweled and fed to lions -- hardly
              a catalog of perks!</p>
              <p><strong>(5)</strong> If the resurrection was a lie, the Jews would
              have produced the corpse and nipped this feared superstition in
              the bud. All they had to do was go to the tomb and get it. The
              Roman soldiers and their leaders were on their side, not the
              Christians'. And if the Jews couldn't get the body because the
              disciples stole it, how did they do that? The arguments against
              the swoon theory hold here too: unarmed peasants could not have
              overpowered Roman soldiers or rolled away a great stone while
              they slept on duty.</p>
              <p><strong>(6)</strong> The disciples could not have gotten away with
              proclaiming the resurrection in Jerusalem -- same time, same
              place, full of eyewitnesses -- if it had been a lie. William Lane
              Craig says,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"The Gospels were written in
                  such a temporal and geographical proximity to the events they
                  record that it would have been almost impossible to fabricate
                  events....The fact that the disciples were able to proclaim
                  the resurrection in Jerusalem in the face of their enemies a
                  few weeks after the crucifixion shows that what they
                  proclaimed was true, for they could never have proclaimed the
                  resurrection (and been believed) under such circumstances had
                  it not occurred." (<em><strong>Knowing the Truth About
                  the Resurrection</strong></em>, chapter 6)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>(7)</strong> If there had been a conspiracy, it would
              certainly have been unearthed by the disciples' adversaries, who
              had both the interest and the power to expose any fraud. Common
              experience shows that such intrigues are inevitably exposed
              (Craig, ibid).</p>
              <p>In conclusion, if the resurrection was a
              concocted, conspired lie, it violates all known historical and
              psychological laws of lying. It is, then, as unscientific, as
              unrepeatable, unique and untestable as the resurrection itself.
              But unlike the resurrection, it is also contradicted by things we
              do know (the above points).</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Refutation of the
              Hallucination Theory: Thirteen Arguments</span></strong></p>
              <p>If you thought you saw a dead man
              walking and talking, wouldn't you think it more likely that you
              were hallucinating than that you were seeing correctly? Why then
              not think the same thing about Christ's resurrection?</p>
              <p><strong>(1)</strong> There were too many witnesses. Hallucinations
              are private, individual, subjective. Christ appeared to Mary
              Magdalene, to the disciples minus Thomas, to the disciples
              including Thomas, to the two disciples at Emmaus, to the
              fisherman on the shore, to James (his "brother" or
              cousin), and even to five hundred people at once (1 Cor 15:3-8).
              Even three different witnesses are enough for a kind of
              psychological trigonometry; over five hundred is about as public
              as you can wish. And Paul says in this passage (v. 6) that most
              of the five hundred are still alive, inviting any reader to check
              the truth of the story by questioning the eyewitnesses -- he
              could never have done this and gotten away with it, given the
              power, resources and numbers of his enemies, if it were not true.</p>
              <p><strong>(2)</strong> The witnesses were qualified. They were simple,
              honest, moral people who had firsthand knowledge of the facts.</p>
              <p><strong>(3)</strong> The five hundred saw Christ together, at the
              same time and place. This is even more remarkable than five
              hundred private "hallucinations" at different times and
              places of the same Jesus. Five hundred separate Elvis sightings
              may be dismissed, but if five hundred simple fishermen in Maine
              saw, touched and talked with him at once, in the same town, that
              would be a different matter. (The only other dead person we know
              of who is reported to have appeared to hundreds of qualified and
              skeptical eyewitnesses at once is Mary the mother of Jesus [at
              Fatima, to 70,000]. And that was not a claim of physical
              resurrection but of a vision.)</p>
              <p><strong>(4)</strong> Hallucinations usually last a few seconds or
              minutes; rarely hours. This one hung around for forty days (Acts
              1:3).</p>
              <p><strong>(5)</strong> Hallucinations usually happen only once, except
              to the insane. This one returned many times, to ordinary people
              (Jn 20:19-21:14; Acts 1:3).</p>
              <p><strong>(6)</strong> Hallucinations come from within, from what we
              already know, at least unconsciously. This one said and did
              surprising and unexpected things (Acts 1:4,9) -- like a real
              person and unlike a dream.</p>
              <p><strong>(7)</strong> Not only did the disciples not expect this, they
              didn't even believe it at first -- neither Peter, nor the women,
              nor Thomas, nor the eleven. They thought he was a ghost; he had
              to eat something to prove he was not (Lk 24:36-43).</p>
              <p><strong>(8)</strong> Hallucinations do not eat. The resurrected
              Christ did, on at least two occasions (Lk 24:42-43; Jn 21:1-14).</p>
              <p><strong>(9)</strong> The disciples touched him (Mt 28:9; Lk 24:39; Jn
              20:27).</p>
              <p><strong>(10)</strong> They also spoke with him, and he spoke back.
              Figments of your imagination do not hold profound, extended
              conversations with you, unless you have the kind of mental
              disorder that isolates you. But this "hallucination"
              conversed with at least eleven people at once, for forty days
              (Acts 1:3).</p>
              <p><strong>(11)</strong> The apostles could not have believed in the
              "hallucination" if Jesus' corpse had still been in the
              tomb. This is very simple and telling point; for if it was a
              hallucination, where was the corpse? They would have checked for
              it; if it was there, they could not have believed.</p>
              <p><strong>(12)</strong> If the apostles had hallucinated and then spread
              their hallucinogenic story, the Jews would have stopped it by
              producing the body -- unless the disciples had stolen it, in
              which case we are back with the conspiracy theory and all its
              difficulties.</p>
              <p><strong>(13)</strong> A hallucination would explain only the
              post-resurrection appearances; it would not explain the empty
              tomb, the rolled-away stone, or the inability to produce the
              corpse. No theory can explain all these data except a real
              resurrection. C.S. Lewis says,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"Any theory of hallucination
                  breaks down on the fact (and if it is invention [rather than
                  fact], it is the oddest invention that ever entered the mind
                  of man) that on three separate occasions this hallucination
                  was not immediately recognized as Jesus (Lk 24:13-31; Jn
                  20:15; 21:4). Even granting that God sent a holy
                  hallucination to teach truths already widely believed without
                  it, and far more easily taught by other methods, and certain
                  to be completely obscured by this, might we not at least hope
                  that he would get the face of the hallucination <strong>right</strong>?
                  Is he who made all faces such a bungler that he cannot even
                  work up a recognizable likeness of the Man who was
                  himself?" (<em><strong>Miracles</strong></em>, chapter
                  16)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Some of these arguments are as old as
              the Church Fathers. Most go back to the eighteenth century,
              especially William Paley. How do unbelievers try to answer them?
              Today, few even try to meet these arguments, although
              occasionally someone tries to refurbish one of the three theories
              of swoon, conspiracy or hallucination (e.g. Schonfield's
              conspiratorial <em><strong>The Passover Plot</strong></em>). But
              the counter-attack today most often takes one of the two
              following forms.</p>
              <p><strong>I.</strong> Some dismiss the resurrection simply because it
              is miraculous, thus throwing the whole issue back to whether
              miracles are possible. They argue, as Hume did, that any other
              explanation is always more probable than a miracle. For a
              refutation of these arguments, see our chapter on miracles
              (chapter 5).</p>
              <p><strong>II.</strong> The other form of counter-attack, by far the
              most popular, is to try to escape the traditional dilemma of
              "deceivers" (conspirators) or "deceived"
              (hallucinators) by interpreting the Gospels as myth -- neither
              literally true nor literally false, but spiritually or
              symbolically true. This is the standard line of liberal theology
              departments in colleges, universities and seminaries throughout
              the Western world today.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Refutation of the Myth
              Theory: Six Arguments</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>(1)</strong> The style of the Gospels is radically and
              clearly different from the style of all the myths. Any literary
              scholar who knows and appreciates myths can verify this. There
              are no overblown, spectacular, childishly exaggerated events.
              Nothing is arbitrary. Everything fits in. Everything is
              meaningful. The hand of a master is at work here.</p>
              <p>Psychological depth is at a maximum. In
              myth it is at a minimum. In myth, such spectacular external
              events happen that it would be distracting to add much internal
              depth of character. That is why it is ordinary people like Alice
              who are the protagonists of extra-ordinary adventures like
              Wonderland. That character depth and development of everyone in
              the Gospels -- especially, of course, Jesus himself -- is
              remarkable. It is also done with an incredible economy of words.
              Myths are verbose; the Gospels are laconic (concise).</p>
              <p>There are also telltale marks of
              eyewitness description, like the little detail of Jesus writing
              in the sand when asked whether to stone the adulteress or not (Jn
              8:6). No one knows why this is put in; nothing comes of it. The
              only explanation is that the writer saw it. If this detail and
              others like it throughout all four Gospels were invented, then a
              first-century tax collector (Matthew), a "young man"
              (Mark), a doctor (Luke), and a fisherman (John) all independently
              invented the new genre of realistic fantasy nineteen centuries
              before it was reinvented in the twentieth.</p>
              <p>The stylistic point is argued so well by
              C.S. Lewis in "Modern Theology and Biblical Criticism"
              (in <em><strong>Christian Reflections</strong></em> and also in <em><strong>Fern-Seed
              and Elephants</strong></em>) that we strongly refer the reader to
              it as the best comprehensive anti-demythologizing essay we have
              seen.</p>
              <p>Let us be even more specific. Let us
              compare the Gospels with two particular mythic writings from
              around that time to see for ourselves the stylistic differences.
              The first is the so-called Gospel of Peter, a forgery from around
              A.D. 125 which John Dominic Crossan (of the "Jesus
              Seminar"), a current media darling among the doubters,
              insists is earlier than the four Gospels. As William Lane Craig
              puts it:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"In this account, the tomb is
                  not only surrounded by Roman guards but also by all the
                  Jewish Pharisees and elders as well as a great multitude from
                  all the surrounding countryside who have come to watch the
                  resurrection. Suddenly in the night there rings out a loud
                  voice in heaven, and two men descend from heaven to the tomb.
                  The stone over the door rolls back by itself, and they go
                  into the tomb. The three men come out of the tomb, two of
                  them holding up the third man. The heads of the two men reach
                  up into the clouds, but the head of the third man reaches
                  beyond the clouds. Then a cross comes out of the tomb, and a
                  voice from heaven asks, 'Have you preached to them that
                  sleep?' And the cross answers, 'Yes.'" (<em><strong>Apologetics</strong></em>,
                  p. 189)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Here is a second comparison, from
              Richard Purtill:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"It may be worthwhile to take a
                  quick look, for purposes of comparison at the closest thing
                  we have around the time of the Gospels to an attempt at a
                  realistic fantasy. This is the story of Apollonius of Tyana,
                  written about A.D. 250 by Flavius Philostratus....There is
                  some evidence that a neo-Pythagorean sage named Apollonius
                  may really have lived, and thus Philostratus' work is a real
                  example of what some have thought the Gospels to be: a
                  fictionalized account of the life of a real sage and teacher,
                  introducing miraculous elements to build up the prestige of
                  the central figure. It thus gives us a good look at what a
                  real example of a fictionalized biography would look like,
                  written at a time and place not too far removed from those in
                  which the Gospels were written.</p>
              <p>"The first thing we notice is
                  the fairy-tale atmosphere. There is a rather nice little
                  vampire story, which inspired a minor poem by Keats entitled
                  Lamia. There are animal stories about, for instance, snakes
                  in India big enough to drag off and eat an elephant. The sage
                  wanders from country to country and wherever he goes he is
                  likely to be entertained by the king or emperor, who holds
                  long conversations with him and sends him on his way with
                  camels and precious stones.</p>
              <p>"Here is a typical passage
                  about healing miracles: 'A woman who had had seven
                  miscarriages was cured through the prayers of her husband, as
                  follows. The Wise Man told the husband, when his wife was in
                  labor, to bring a live rabbit under his cloak to the place
                  where she was, walk around her and immediately release the
                  rabbit; for she would lose her womb as well as her baby if
                  the rabbit was not immediately driven away.' [Bk 3, sec 39]</p>
              <p>"The point is that this is what
                  you get when the imagination goes to work. Once the
                  boundaries of fact are crossed we wander into fairyland. And
                  very nice too, for amusement or recreation. But the Gospels
                  are set firmly in the real Palestine of the first century,
                  and the little details are not picturesque inventions but the
                  real details that only an eyewitness or a skilled realistic
                  novelist can give." (<em><strong>Thinking About Religion</strong></em>,
                  p. 75-76)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>(2)</strong> A second problem is that there was not enough
              time for myth to develop. The original demythologizers pinned
              their case onto a late second-century date for the writing of the
              Gospels; several generations have to pass before the added
              mythological elements can be mistakenly believed to be facts.
              Eyewitnesses would be around before that to discredit the new,
              mythic versions. We know of other cases where myths and legends
              of miracles developed around a religious founder -- for example,
              Buddha, Lao-tzu and Muhammad. In each case, many generations
              passed before the myth surfaced.</p>
              <p>The dates for the writing of the Gospels
              have been pushed back by every empirical manuscript discovery;
              only abstract hypothesizing pushes the date forward. Almost no
              knowledgeable scholar today holds what Bultmann said it was
              necessary to hold in order to believe the myth theory, namely,
              that there is no first-century textual evidence that Christianity
              began with a divine and resurrected Christ, not a human and dead
              one.</p>
              <p>Some scholars still dispute the
              first-century date for the Gospels, especially John's. But no one
              disputes that Paul's letters were written within the lifetime of
              eyewitnesses to Christ. So let us argue from Paul's letters.
              Either these letters contain myth or they do not. If so, there is
              lacking the several generations necessary to build up a commonly
              believed myth. There is not even <strong>one</strong> generation.
              If these letters are <strong>not</strong> myth, then the Gospels
              are not either, for Paul affirms all the main claims of the
              Gospels. Julius Muller put the anti-myth argument this way:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"One cannot imagine how such a
                  series of legends could arise in an historical age, obtain
                  universal respect, and supplant the historical recollection
                  of the true character [Jesus]....if eyewitnesses were still
                  at hand who could be questioned respecting the truth of the
                  recorded marvels. Hence, legendary fiction, as it likes not
                  the clear present time but prefers the mysterious gloom of
                  gray antiquity, is wont to seek a remoteness of age, along
                  with that of space, and to remove its boldest and most rare
                  and wonderful creations into a very remote and unknown
                  land." (<em><strong>The Theory of Myths in Its
                  Application to the Gospel History Examined and Confuted</strong></em> [London, 1844], p. 26)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Muller challenged his nineteenth-century
              contemporaries to produce a single example anywhere in history of
              a great myth or legend arising around a historical figure and
              being generally believed within thirty years after that figure's
              death. No one has ever answered him.</p>
              <p><strong>(3)</strong> The myth theory has two layers. The first layer
              is the historical Jesus, who was not divine, did not claim
              divinity, performed no miracles, and did not rise from the dead.
              The second, later, mythologized layer is the Gospels as we have
              them, with a Jesus who claimed to be divine, performed miracles
              and rose from the dead. The problem with this theory is simply
              that there is not the slightest bit of any real evidence whatever
              for the existence of any such first layer. The two-layer cake
              theory has the first layer made entirely of air -- and hot air at
              that.</p>
              <p>St. Augustine refutes the two-layer
              theory with his usual condensed power and simplicity:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"The speech of one Elpidius,
                  who had spoken and disputed face to face against the
                  Manichees, had already begun to affect me at Carthage, when
                  he produced arguments from Scripture which were not easy to
                  answer. And the answer they [the Manichees, who claimed to be
                  the true Christians] gave seemed to me feeble -- indeed they
                  preferred not to give it in public but only among ourselves
                  in private -- the answer being that the Scriptures of the New
                  Testament had been corrupted by some persons unknown...yet
                  the Manicheans made no effort to produce uncorrupted
                  copies." (<em><strong>Confessions</strong></em>, V, 11,
                  Sheed translation)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Note the sarcasm in the last sentence.
              It still applies today. William Lane Craig summarizes the
              evidence -- the <strong>lack</strong> of evidence:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"The Gospels are a miraculous
                  story, and we have no other story handed down to us than that
                  contained in the Gospels....The letters of Barnabas and
                  Clement refer to Jesus' miracles and resurrection. Polycarp
                  mentions the resurrection of Christ, and Irenaeus relates
                  that he had heard Polycarp tell of Jesus' miracles. Ignatius
                  speaks of the resurrection. Puadratus reports that persons
                  were still living who had been healed by Jesus. Justin Martyr
                  mentions the miracles of Christ. No relic of a non-miraculous
                  story exists. That the original story should be lost and
                  replaced by another goes beyond any known example of
                  corruption of even oral tradition, not to speak of the
                  experience of written transmissions. These facts show that
                  the story in the Gospels was in substance the same story that
                  Christians had at the beginning. This means...that the
                  resurrection of Jesus was always a part of the story." (<em><strong>Apologetics</strong></em>,
                  chapter 6)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>(4)</strong> A little detail, seldom noticed, is significant
              in distinguishing the Gospels from myth: the first witnesses of
              the resurrection were women. In first-century Judaism, women had
              low social status and no legal right to serve as witnesses. If
              the empty tomb were an invented legend, its inventors surely
              would not have had it discovered by women, whose testimony was
              considered worthless. If, on the other hand, the writers were
              simply reporting what they saw, they would have to tell the
              truth, however socially and legally inconvenient.</p>
              <p><strong>(5)</strong> The New Testament could not be myth
              misinterpreted and confused with fact because it specifically
              distinguishes the two and repudiates the mythic interpretation (2
              Peter 1:16). Since it explicitly says it is not myth, if it <strong>is</strong> myth it is a deliberate lie rather than myth. The dilemma still
              stands. It is either truth or lie, whether deliberate
              (conspiracy) or non-deliberate (hallucination). There is no
              escape from the horns of this dilemma. Once a child asks whether
              Santa Claus is real, your yes becomes a lie, not myth, if he is
              not literally real. Once the New Testament distinguishes myth
              from fact, it becomes a lie if the resurrection is not fact.</p>
              <p><strong>(6)</strong> William Lane Craig has summarized the
              traditional textual arguments with such clarity, condensation and
              power that we quote him here at length. The following arguments
              (rearranged and outlined from <em><strong>Knowing the Truth About
              the Resurrection</strong></em>) prove two things: first, that the
              Gospels were written by the disciples, not later myth-makers, and
              second, that the Gospels we have today are essentially the same
              as the originals.</p>
              <p><strong>(A)</strong> Proof that the Gospels were written by
              eyewitnesses:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>(1)</strong> Internal evidence, from the Gospels
                  themselves:</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p><strong>(a)</strong> The style of writing in the Gospels is
                      simple and alive, what we would expect from their
                      traditionally accepted authors.</p>
              <p><strong>(b)</strong> Moreover, since Luke was written before
                      Acts, and since Acts was written prior to the death of
                      Paul, Luke must have an early date, which speaks for its
                      authenticity.</p>
              <p><strong>(c)</strong> The Gospels also show an intimate
                      knowledge of Jerusalem prior to its destruction in A.D.
                      70. The Gospels are full of proper names, dates, cultural
                      details, historical events, and customs and opinions of
                      that time.</p>
              <p><strong>(d)</strong> Jesus' prophecies of that event (the
                      destruction of Jerusalem) must have been written prior to
                      Jerusalem's fall, for otherwise the church would have
                      separated out the apocalyptic element in the prophecies,
                      which makes them appear to concern the end of the world.
                      Since the end of the world did not come about when
                      Jerusalem was destroyed, the so-called prophecies of its
                      destruction that were really written after the city was
                      destroyed would not have made that event appear so
                      closely connected with the end of the world. Hence, the
                      Gospels must have been written prior to A.D. 70.</p>
              <p><strong>(e)</strong> The stories of Jesus' human weaknesses
                      and of the disciples' faults also bespeak the Gospels'
                      accuracy.</p>
              <p><strong>(f)</strong> Furthermore, it would have been
                      impossible for forgers to put together so consistent a
                      narrative as that which we find in the Gospels. The
                      Gospels do not try to suppress apparent discrepancies,
                      which indicates their originality (written by
                      eyewitnesses). There is no attempt at harmonization
                      between the Gospels, such as we might expect from
                      forgers.</p>
              <p><strong>(g)</strong> The Gospels do not contain anachronisms;
                      the authors appear to have been first-century Jews who
                      were witnesses of the events.</p>
              </blockquote> </blockquote>
              <p>We may conclude that there is no more
              reason to doubt that the Gospels come from the traditional
              authors than there is to doubt that the works of Philo or
              Josephus are authentic, <strong>except</strong> that the Gospels
              contain supernatural events.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>(2)</strong> External evidence:</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p><strong>(a)</strong> The disciples must have left <strong>some</strong> writings, engaged as they were in giving lessons to and
                      counseling believers who were geographically distant; and
                      what could these writings be if not the Gospels and
                      epistles themselves? Eventually the apostles would have
                      needed to publish accurate narratives of Jesus' history,
                      so that any spurious attempts would be discredited and
                      the genuine Gospels preserved.</p>
              <p><strong>(b)</strong> There were many eyewitnesses who were
                      still alive when the books were written who could testify
                      whether they came from their purported authors or not.</p>
              <p><strong>(c)</strong> The extra-biblical testimony unanimously
                      attributes the Gospels to their traditional authors: the
                      Epistle of Barnabas, the Epistle of Clement, the Shepherd
                      of Hermes, Theophilus, Hippolytus, Origen, Puadratus,
                      Irenaeus, Melito, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Dionysius,
                      Tertullian, Cyprian, Tatian, Caius, Athanasius, Cyril, up
                      to Eusebius in A.D. 315, even Christianity's opponents
                      conceded this: Celsus, Porphyry, Emperor Julian.</p>
              <p><strong>(d)</strong> With a single exception, no apocryphal
                      gospel is ever quoted by any known author during the
                      first three hundred years after Christ. In fact there is
                      no evidence that any inauthentic gospel whatever existed
                      in the first century, in which all four Gospels and Acts
                      were written.</p>
              </blockquote> </blockquote>
              <p><strong>(B)</strong> Proof that the Gospels we have today are the
              same Gospels originally written:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>(1)</strong> Because of the need for instruction and
                  personal devotion, these writings must have been copied many
                  times, which increases the chances of preserving the original
                  text.</p>
              <p><strong>(2)</strong> In fact, no other ancient work is available
                  in so many copies and languages, and yet all these various
                  versions agree in content.</p>
              <p><strong>(3)</strong> The text has also remained unmarred by
                  heretical additions. The abundance of manuscripts over a wide
                  geographical distribution demonstrates that the text has been
                  transmitted with only trifling discrepancies. The differences
                  that do exist are quite minor and are the result of
                  unintentional mistakes.</p>
              <p><strong>(4)</strong> The quotations of the New Testament books in
                  the early Church Fathers all coincide.</p>
              <p><strong>(5)</strong> The Gospels could not have been corrupted
                  without a great outcry on the part of all orthodox
                  Christians.</p>
              <p><strong>(6)</strong> No one could have corrupted <strong>all</strong> the manuscripts.</p>
              <p><strong>(7)</strong> There is no precise time when the
                  falsification could have occurred, since, as we have seen,
                  the New Testament books are cited by the Church Fathers in
                  regular and close succession. The text could not have been
                  falsified before all external testimony, since then the
                  apostles were still alive and could repudiate such tampering.</p>
              <p><strong>(8)</strong> The text of the New Testament is every bit
                  as good as the text of the classical works of antiquity. To
                  repudiate the textual parity of the Gospels would be to
                  reverse all the rules of criticism and to reject all the
                  works of antiquity, since the text of those works is less
                  certain than that of the Gospels.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Richard Purtill summarizes the textual
              case:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"Many events which are regarded
                  as firmly established historically have (1) far less
                  documentary evidence than many biblical events; (2) and the
                  documents on which historians rely for much secular history
                  are written much longer after the event than many records of
                  biblical events; (3) furthermore, we have many more copies of
                  biblical narratives than of secular histories; and (4) the
                  surviving copies are much earlier than those on which our
                  evidence for secular history is based. If the biblical
                  narratives did not contain accounts of miraculous events,
                  biblical history would probably be regarded as much more
                  firmly established than most of the history of, say,
                  classical Greece and Rome." (<em><strong>Thinking About
                  Religion</strong></em>, p. 84-85)</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Conclusions: More
              Objections Answered</span> </strong></p>
              <p>No alternative to a real resurrection
              has yet explained: the existence of the Gospels, the origin of
              the Christian faith, the failure of Christ's enemies to produce
              his corpse, the empty tomb, the rolled-away stone, or the
              accounts of the post-resurrection appearances. Swoon, conspiracy,
              hallucination and myth have been shown to be the only
              alternatives to a real resurrection, and each has been refuted.</p>
              <p>What reasons could be given at this
              point for anyone who still would refuse to believe? At this
              point, general rather than specific objections are usually given.
              For instance:</p>
              <p><strong>Objection 1 :</strong> History is not an exact science. It does not
              yield absolute certainty like mathematics.</p>
              <p><strong>Reply :</strong> This is true, but why would you note that fact
              now and not when you speak of Caesar or Luther or George
              Washington? History is not exact, but it is sufficient. No one
              doubts that Caesar crossed the Rubicon; why do many doubt that
              Jesus rose from the dead? The evidence for the latter is much
              better than for the former.</p>
              <p><strong>Objection 2 :</strong> You can't trust documents. Paper proves nothing.
              Anything can be forged.</p>
              <p><strong>Reply :</strong> This is simply ignorance. Not trusting documents
              is like not trusting telescopes. Paper evidence suffices for most
              of what we believe; why should it suddenly become suspect here?</p>
              <p><strong>Objection 3 :</strong> Because the resurrection is miraculous. It's the
              content of the idea rather than the documentary evidence for it
              that makes it incredible.</p>
              <p><strong>Reply :</strong> Now we finally have a straightforward objection
              -- not to the documentary evidence but to miracles. This is a
              philosophical question, not a scientific, historical or textual
              question. (See chapter five in this book for an answer).</p>
              <p><strong>Objection 4 :</strong> It's not only miracles in general but this
              miracle in particular that is objectionable. The resurrection of
              a corpse is crass, crude, vulgar, literalistic and materialistic.
              Religion should be more spiritual, inward, ethical.</p>
              <p><strong>Reply :</strong> If religion is what we invent, we can make it
              whatever we like. If it is what God invented, then we have to
              take it as we find it, just as we have to take the universe as we
              find it, rather than as we'd like it to be. <strong>Death</strong> is crass, crude, vulgar, literal and material. The resurrection
              meets death where it is and conquers it, rather than merely
              spouting some harmless, vaporous abstractions about spirituality.
              The resurrection is as vulgar as the God who did it. He also made
              mud and bugs and toenails.</p>
              <p><strong>Objection 5 :</strong> But a literalistic interpretation of the
              resurrection ignores the profound dimensions of meaning found in
              the symbolic, spiritual and mythic realms that have been deeply
              explored by other religions. Why are Christians so narrow and
              exclusive? Why can't they see the profound symbolism in the idea
              of resurrection?</p>
              <p><strong>Reply :</strong> They can. It's not either-or. Christianity does
              not invalidate the myths, it validates them, by incarnating them.
              It is "myth become fact," to use the title of a germane
              essay by C.S. Lewis (in <em>God in the Dock</em>). Why prefer a
              one-layer cake to a two-layer cake? Why refuse either the
              literal-historical or the mythic-symbolic aspects of the
              resurrection? The Fundamentalist refuses the mythic-symbolic
              aspects because he has seen what the Modernist has done with it:
              used it to exclude the literal-historical aspects. Why have the
              Modernists done that? What terrible fate awaits them if they
              follow the multifarious and weighty evidence and argument that
              naturally emerges from the data, as we have summarized it here in
              this chapter?</p>
              <p>The answer is not obscure: traditional
              Christianity awaits them, complete with adoration of Christ as
              God, obedience to Christ as Lord, dependence on Christ as Savior,
              humble confession of sin and a serious effort to live Christ's
              life of self-sacrifice, detachment from the world, righteousness,
              holiness and purity of thought, word and deed. The historical
              evidence is massive enough to convince the open-minded inquirer.
              By analogy with any other historical event, the resurrection has
              eminently credible evidence behind it. To disbelieve it, you must
              deliberately make an exception to the rules you use everywhere
              else in history. Now why would someone want to do that?</p>
              <p>Ask yourself that question if you dare,
              and take an honest look into your heart before you answer.</p>

              <p>Agree with HappyInfo2. Laurence82 is just an idiot who utters nonsense, and then says it is us christians who utter nonsense about the bible saying it upholds scientific principles or whatever. He has not read the bible before and he gives this false and stupid assumption. He is without logic. He thinks it is so fun to lie about the bible as christians but we rather spend our time masturbating if we want to cover up knowing christianity is false(though it is not). So this totally shows how ironic he and the other atheists are. They refuse to read the bible and than say it is false. What kind of shit is that? You ask me did I read sutras but HELLO? Why should I participate in a religion <strong>MADE BY MAN?</strong> If Buddhism says it is a religion from some gods, maybe I might read it too. But, under common sense and logic, I <strong>WILL NOT</strong></p>
              <p>Since the atheists and people from other religions say we are narrow-minded, I am going to make a narrow-minded remark here too. Oh, it's fun to stoop to your low levels sometimes.</p>
              <p>''Buddha was just a guy tired of smelly naked guys and started making up his own stories''</p>
              <p>here is another one.</p>
              <p>''Good ole fat buddha was demon posessed.''</p>
              <p>How do you like that? =)</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">1- Reincarnation can't be true because it is numerically impossible.<br><br>    If there is one soul per person, and if the population of the world is increasing (which it is), where are all these new souls coming from? In other words, the population has more than doubled from around two billion at the turn of the century to over 6 billion today. If each of these 5 billion souls have lived at least ONE past life, where did the over 4 billion souls come from which did not exist before 1900 AD ? It seems there are several possible solutions to this problem:<br><br>        (A) These new souls are coming from animals or inanimate matter.<br><br>        (B) These new souls are coming from other planets (Shirley Maclaine has offered this as a solution I have heard), ETs and stuff.<br><br>        (C) New souls come out of "thin air" or are somehow created by God or perhaps have always existed so they are actually "old" souls.<br><br>        (D) or there are people with several souls -- perhaps 3 or more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Since the standard definition of reincarnation involves one soul per person, that rules out option (D). Now if you accept the classic Hindu concept of reincarnation -- the idea that you could come back as a cockroach if you lived a really bad life -- then option (A) is a possible solution. If you are nuts, then option (B) is possible.<br><br>    Again, if the standard definition of reincarnation holds true, new souls are not created out of thin air, but already exist and are just taking on new lives and new bodies. So option (C) is out.<br><br>    The Catholic concept is that souls are indeed created immediately by God (see the Catechism paragraph 366). One soul and one body (Mt 10:28).<br><br>    2- Reincarnation is not true because it contradicts the Resurrection.<br><br>    To quote some Bible, "it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgement" (Heb 9:27) is probably a text you've heard.</span></p>
              <p>Reincarnation in Hinduism and Buddhism itself is a contradiction. Since all people and animals have souls, why is it that only humans can become enlightened, but not the animals? Animals actually suffer more than humans, given the way they become food on a table. So ants also have a soul? Why don't I see that they become enlightended? They seem more engrossed in serving the nest.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">It makes no sense because the reason we live further lives is to supposedly improve upon and do restitution for what wrong we did in our prior lives. But who remembers their prior lives? I have no conscious memory of any prior lives. So how in the world am I supposed to improve upon what I did if I can't remember what I did?<br><br>    Now I realize some people claim to remember their prior lives through various techniques, particularly hypnosis. But it has been documented that hypnosis is notoriously unreliable. We have people claiming everything under hypnosis -- from UFO abductions, to Satanic ritual abuse, to prior lives. Is all of this stuff true?<br><br>    A good recent book on hypnotherapy written from a skeptical psychologist point of view is Robert Baker, They Call It Hypnosis (Prometheus Books, 1990). I believe that is the correct title.<br><br>    4- Reincarnation is not true because it perpetuates the problem of evil.<br><br>    Contrary to what you said about karma and reincarnation being just, the concepts are unjust because evil is perpetuated and there is no forgiveness. To quote what you wrote --<br><br>    PC&gt; To me, the ideas of karma and reincarnation seemed more just. If God is just, then the punishment should fit the crime.<br><br>    Therefore, if I am a murderer in this life, does not the law of karma require that I must come back as the victim of a murder?<br><br>    If I am a wife beater in this life, don't I have to come back as a woman who is beaten by her husband (or something equivalent to have "justice" done to me) ? Each crime committed in this life requires the perpetrator to return in a future life to have the same thing done to him or her!<br><br>    Do you see how evil is perpetuated? There is no forgiveness here. That's why the Hindus refer to this as "the wheel of reincarnation" since there is no getting off. It is a hopeless cycle. And where is God in all of this?<br><br>    A question that must be asked -- where did evil originate according to the laws of karma and reincarnation?<br><br>   </span></p>

                                          humans can also become immortals. Thus, from 
                  what i assume, is the
                                          reason why many want to receive enlightment/ 
                  whatever. But there
                                          are so many people who actually read so many

              <p>Buddha actually went to heavens and taught 
                  the celestial beings, and celestial beings actually came down and 
                  received teachings from Buddha. So it is not true that the Buddha is not
                   actually a teacher of god and men. Secondly, Buddhism does not teach 
                  Immortality, that is Taoism. Uncountable Buddhists attained 
                  enlightenment and liberation from all sufferings, from samsara, the 
                  world of suffering, the cycle of rebirth, even up till today, and so

              <p>There
                   are three bodies of Buddha: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya. 
                  Nirmanakaya manifestations are temporary, i.e. the physical manifestation of Buddha with the 32 major marks and 80 minor marks, but the Dharmakaya and 
                  Sambhogakaya is eternal and continues endlessly (not as a permanent 
                  static identity, but an endless continuum of wisdom). However it is not 
                  an immortal identity because as explained in the previous post, there is
                   no such thing as a permanent eternal identity, <strong>even right now as we 
                  are living</strong>. There is no eternal soul. Nevertheless, the continuum of
                   wisdom of the enlightened beings roll on, never at any moment being a 
                  graspable essence.</p>

                  point in Buddhism: the total end of suffering through enlightenment. The
                   quality of life can be improved through science and medicine, but that 
                  is not his main concern. Buddhist masters even today have also performed

              <p>You're right, as I 
                  explained in this post: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/330273#post_8393743">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/330273#post_8393743</a></p>
              <p>Just
                   a short summary:</p>
              <p>    The stories of a Buddha going to teach a 
                  brahma take place on the plane of Maha Brahma, the third of the 
                  fine-material planes (No. 14). Many people worship Maha Brahma as the 
                  supreme and eternal creator God, but for the Buddha he is merely a 
                  powerful deity still caught within the cycle of repeated existence. In 
                  point of fact, "Maha Brahma" is a role or office filled by different 
                  individuals at different periods.<br><br>    The Buddha has directly 
                  seen the origins of Maha Brahma and understands what it requires to be 
                  reborn in his world. In the Brahmajala Sutta (DN 1) the Buddha describes
                   how a supposed Creator God came to believe himself omnipotent and how 
                  others came to rely on his sovereignty.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Thus, that
                   religion is none other than 
                  the works of men
                                          who had very ambitious plans on being immortal.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Again,
                   false understanding of the goal of Buddhism, as explained on top. 
                  Immortality is not on our agenda. Enlightenment, end of suffering, is.</p>

              <p>The source is a guide for Sri Lankan Buddhists to answer Christian evangelists because Christian evangelism is very strong in that area. It does not discount the virtues of Christianity but serves as a guide to answer these people. In Buddhism we see virtue in all religions. Unlike Christianity, we do not see 'non-believers' as definitely hell-bound.</p>
