              <p>What Larryteo posted has many core misunderstandings. First, the 
                                              karma and reincarnation taught in Hinduism is very different from 
                                              Buddhism. Buddhism teaches dependent origination, and is the only 
                                              religion in the world to teach dependent origination, and without 
                                              recoursing to a permanent self entity or a soul. There is only 
                                              Consciousness as a stream of dependently originated phenomena, a 
                                              process, and not a self entity, not an Atman. Karma in Buddhism is also 
                                              not deterministic or fatalistic like other systems.</p>
              <p>Next, the argument that spirit possession disproves Rebirth is 
                                              very false. In fact Rebirth is probably the only plausible way to 
                                              explain how the Dead can communicate with human, how the dead relatives 
                                              can appear to people's minds in visions and dreams, how dead can possess
                                               a person in a medium and so on. Of course the Christians explain this 
                                              as 'just minions of the devil' or whatever their reason may be.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, we teach that a person is reborn according to karma 
                                              not only as a human but can reborn in any of the following realms:</p>
              <p><strong>3 lower realms: Hell, ghost, animal</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3 higher realms: Human, asura, heaven/devas</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It should be noted that the ultimate goal of Buddhism is not rebirth in heaven as such a rebirth though extremely long lived, in Buddhism's understanding is still impermanent for this is the nature of all phenomena. One is still within the cycle of rebirth. In Buddhism we teaches that it is possible to transcend all sufferings and the uncontrolled cycle of rebirth in samsara, through practicing Buddhism and attaining enlightenment and liberation from all sufferings. And the means of this is not just 'do good, avoid evil' as what the TS have thought. In Buddhism we also emphasize 'attaining wisdom, enlightenment, liberation from sufferings, purification of mind [through wisdom]'. This is what sets Buddhism apart from other religions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So anyway regarding the 6 realms, what do those spirit possession cases belong? Not because they
                                               are devils pretending as dead people, rather, those beings of course 
                                              belong to the ghost realm who were reborn in that realm by karma, and 
                                              could have been a human in their immediate past life. Buddhists unlike 
                                              other religions like folk Taoism, however, do not encourage mediumship, 
                                              because we do not want to create unnecessary karmic affinities with a 
                                              lower realm.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> Buddhism is not based on theories. Buddhism is based on experiential realisation, everything the Buddha taught is by his own realisation, enlightenment, not told by someone else. Everything from the ultimate nature of reality to things like karma, rebirth, he realised it himself. He remembered 91 aeons of his past lives. My Buddhist forum also have many forummers and moderators who remembered not just one but numerous past lives one after another. It is not very rare for trained meditators. People until today also have attained insight into the nature of reality and attained liberation. I have seen people today, both on the internet and off the internet who are enlightened. It is possible.</p>
              <p>The point is, anyone too, can become as enlightened as the Buddha (meaning 'The Awakened One') himself, he can realise the nature of reality, realise every other truth to be realised, be liberated from all sufferings, and save other sentient beings from suffering, through the practices the Buddha taught.. Something like a scientific method, that performed accordingly will lead to specific reproducible and predictable results. You can do the 'experiment' and 'see for yourself' and the Buddha teaches that one should.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Buddha said thus:</p>

              <p>The original link which An Eternal Now has actually given is actually more unreliable. First of all, it sticks to the theories of the Roman Catholic Church's teachings instead of the Bible itself.</p>
              <p>In the teachings of the Church in Europe a few centuries ago, it was influenced by the pagan gods which has once dominated the region. Thus, much of the teachings from the pagan gods religon actually went into the teachings of the church.</p>
              <p>Here are a few examples of the teachings from the Catholic Church(which was under influence from the Pagans) :</p>
              <p>-The Earth was in the cetre of the universe</p>
              <p>-The moon and Sun revolved around the Earth</p>
              <p>-Someone was holding up the Earth</p>
              <p>But in the original Bible scripture, here are the teachings of science :</p>
              <ul type="square">
              <li>Roundness of the earth (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/isa40.html#22">Isaiah 40:22</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>Almost infinite extent of the sidereal universe (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/isa55.html#9">Isaiah 55:9</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>Law of conservation of mass and energy (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/2pet3.html#7">II Peter 3:7</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>Hydrologic cycle (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/eccl1.html#7">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>Vast number of stars (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/jer33.html#22">Jeremiah 33:22</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>Law of increasing entropy (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/psa102.html#25">Psalm 102:25-27</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>Paramount importance of blood in life processes (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/lev17.html#11">Leviticus 17:11</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>Atmospheric circulation (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/eccl1.html#6">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>Gravitational field (<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/job26.html#7">Job 26:7</a>)<br> </li>
              <li>and many others. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>See the difference? The teachings of the Roman Catholic church actually differ alot from the original bible scripture due to the influence from another religion which was once backed up by the powerful nation of Rome and Greece.</p>
              <p>Another thing about the bible is it's prophecy. Many of the prophesized events have actually come true. I do not wish to type them out one by one here, because there are thousands of them ad my hands will be sore. If you are interested about the prophecies, go and google them to see what's inside. You will amazed. Another thing on common sense is that the number of archeologists who choose to believe in the Bible rather than the claims made by atheists. Why? Because archeology does verify the word of the bible, and does not contradict it. Go google it yourself.</p>
              <p>Regarding Noah's Ark, here is a source :</p>
              <p>http://www.thebibleistheotherside.org/currentarticlep39.htm</p>
              <p>About buddhism, I have nothing to say but this :</p>
              <p>http://www.breadonthewaters.com/0237_False_Religion_of_Buddhism.html</p>
              <p>Buddhism is actually, just nothing more than an off-shoot of hinduism whom people actually mistake that Buddha is a god.</p>
              <p>No offence to those from the other religions, just backing up my claims and giving an answer to those people who misintepret the bible and claim what they GUESS is true.</p>
              <p>About atheism, it came about from the teachings of the old churches too. As science started to emerge and people started to want to seek the truth, many actually left christianity because of the teachings of the old churches. In the U.S.A, they once had a rule that no one can become a governer unless he was a christian/believer. This, of course, led to a grudge between the atheists and religion. The grudge still exists today.</p>

              <p>Herzog_Zwei, I view as that as a total insult.</p>
              <p>For your information, the theory of evolution is NOT A PROVEN THEORY.</p>
              <p>The reason as to why evolution is passed off as a scientific fact in textbooks everywhere is because it was the only way to fairly show the origins of life in a society where not everyone believes that humans came in one piece.</p>
              <p>Actually, evolution does not really deny the existence of God. I am just stressing that evolution did not happen because of it's weird claims. Do you even know how the theory of evolution works? If so, why do you still believe in it when you don't have a full understanding? Do you know that evolution believes that life came from a single, non-living cell, gradually over millions of years, becoming a full organism? First of all, evolution has never been observed. But wait - It is. But it only gave scientists and atheists false hope. Take a smallfly for example, it can produce multiple generations in just a  week,  and scientists have observed this small flies for hundreds of years. And for hundreds of years, the flies should have produced MILLIONS of generations, more than enough to match the generations of the so called cell-created man. Yet, there were no changes made in these flies. They did not crossbreed and emerge from a fly to a bird. Neither has a dog gave birth to a partial cat.</p>
              <p>You say since I cannot accept evolution as part of life, I might as well live apart from humanity. That is very ironic. Don't you know evolutionists claim that humans came from stupid monkeys? Why not you go live in the zoo or in the woods? You should be the one living apart from humanity because you view humans as no different from animals.</p>
              <p>As I said before, stop harassing the religious people in these forums made for the religious to discuss. I have no right to chase you away but what you have posted is generally offensive to the religious. If you are looking for answers, I am sure many christians will welcome you and help you in your search for truth, but with what you are doing, you keep blindly claiming that God does not exist, God does not exist, God does not exist. You keep repeating your words around this forum as though no one has heard before. What are you trying to do? Prove your existence? If you have proof that God does not exist, just show it here and keep your mouth shut after that. Not to mention that the so-called ''PROOF'' that God does not exist has many more contradictions in its own sense rather than in the bible.</p>
              <p>You claim that if I cannot accept evolution, then I might as well live apart from humanity. So billions of others also need to live apart from humanity? What kind of stupid claim is that? You claim that by common sense there is no God. I think that is more of your own ''common sense''. So were you given birth to or were you popped onto the surface of the Earth like that? Did the bricks you were playing with when young suddenly build itself into a monument? In your own small world of imaginations, I guess.</p>
              <p>You blindly claim that the bible is false, without regard to what is written inside. You give no second thoughts. You are just stubborn, and not only that, but ANNOYING.  You do not think or read what i have posted about the bible but you just shoot the same phrases here and there as though it will help. I other words, you are doing nothing but spamming this forum. Just to prove your own existence. So I assume that all 7135 posts you made here are actually the same phrases. I will ASSUME. Since that is what you like to do anyway.</p>

              <p>This cannot be further than the truth. Buddha was someone who rejected all the Hindus scriptures as authority, such as the Vedas, Upanishads and so on. The very core essence and doctrine of such teachings, that of the Atman Brahman, is replaced in Buddhism by the teaching of Emptiness and No-Self.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is one of the few traditions in India that are considered 'Unorthodox' by Hindu standards, because it does not suscribe to traditional Hindu beliefs.</p>
              <p>As such since the very core essence of the religion is different, it cannot be considered an offshoot.</p>
              <p>Also as I explained, nobody treats Buddha as a god. Buddha is beyond samsara, and gods are in Buddhism still part of Samsara. Buddha is known as the "teacher of gods and men", see <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html</a></p>

              <p>In Buddhism, unlike materialists, do not claim that life and consciousness derives from matter.</p>
              <p>As my wise forum moderator Thusness said in the past to someone else who said "<br> Consciousness exists with the human brain, that 
              is clear...",</p>
              <p><strong>Perhaps if we were to live in the 17th centuries
                       applying the
                                              Newtonian viewpoint, what you said might still 
                      be acceptable in the
                                              scientific community. Unfortunately, we donÂ’t. 
                      In light of quantum
                                              mechanics and neuroscience, I think that is a 
                      bold statement and
                                              you may want to substantiate it with some valid 
                      scientific
                                              findings.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Loppon Namdrol states:</p>
              <p><em>There are no merely five principles that govern empirical reality in Buddhist 
                      theory, but rather six: solids, liquids, gases, heat, dimensionality, and 
                      consciousness.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, Consciousness too play an important role in shaping our experiential universe. Karma, etc, in Buddhism are important also. They are not mere byproducts of things. But there is no 'creation' or 'creator' in Buddhism which are involved, only a seamless interdependence and relativity.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>• I exist.<br>• If I exist, then something must have always existed because something doesn’t<br>come from nothing.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In Buddhism we do not hold on to the view 'I exist'. Because a fixed entity called 'I' cannot be found. What we call "I" is simply a convention, just like the word "weather" is just a convention, but does not refer to a truly existing eternal identity. What we find instead is a flux of sensations, feelings, thoughts, nothing graspable, nothing that is truly 'I' or 'mine'. This does not deny that we are conscious beings, but it denies that consciousness is identical with something unchanging, static, etc -- it is something totally dynamic, unfixed, empty of any independent or inherent existence (consciousness dependently originates) yet vivid and alive. This is something we can realise for ourselves when we practice meditation, mindfulness, by clear light of awareness of our moment to moment experience. The realising of the true nature of reality called enlightenment.</p>

              <p>A somber day, isn't it? Dark, cloudy, cool, moist and
                      windy. Amazing, this whole affair of "the weather!"
                      We call it "weather," but what is it really? Wind. Rain.
                      Clouds slowly parting. Not the words spoken about it, but just
                      this darkening, blowing, pounding, wetting, and then lightening
                      up, blue sky appearing amidst darkness, and sunshine sparkling
                      on wet grasses and leaves. In a little while there'll be frost,
                      snow and ice-covers. And then warming again, melting, oozing water
                      everywhere. On an early 
                      spring day the dirt road sparkles with streams of wet silver.
                      So — what is "weather"  other than this incessant change
                      of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings, and
                      undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and
                      elation. Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever changing stream
                      of happenings abiding nowhere. No entity "weather" to
                      be found except in thinking and talking 
                      about it.</p>
              <p>Now — is there such an entity as "me,"
                      "I," "myself?" 
                      Or is it just like the "weather" — an ongoing, ever
                      changing stream of ideas, images, memories, projections, likes
                      and dislikes, creations and destructions, which thought keeps
                      calling "I," "me," "Toni," and thereby
                      solidifying what is evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what
                      do I think and believe I am? Are we interested in exploring this
                      amazing affair of "myself" from moment to moment? Is
                      this, maybe, the essence of retreat work? Exploring ourselves
                      minutely beyond the peace and quiet that we are seeking and maybe
                      finding. Coming upon clarity about this deep sense of separation
                      which we call "me," and "other people," without
                      any need to condemn or overcome.</p>
              <p>Most human beings take it totally for granted that
                      I am "me," and that "me" is this body, this
                      mind, this knowledge and sense about myself which so obviously
                      feels separate from other people. The language in which we talk
                      to ourselves and to each other inevitably implies separate "me's,"
                      and "you's" all the time. All of us talk "I" and "you"
                      talk, we think it, write it, read it, and dream it with rarely
                      any pause. There is incessant reinforcement of the sense 
                      of "I," "me," separate from others. Isolated.
                      Insulated. Not understood. How is one to come upon the truth if
                      separation is taken so much for granted, feels so common sense?</p>

              <p>He is <em>known</em> as the teachers of gods and men. But he he is <em>not</em> a teacher of gods and only men. From what I know(correct me if I'm wrong), Toaism and Buddhism teaches that humans can also become immortals. Thus, from what i assume, is the reason why many want to receive enlightment/ whatever. But there are so many people who actually read so many texts and try to understand so much on what Buddha taught and also do so much, but none has become immortal.(This refers to toaism).</p>
              <p>Buddha did receive enlightment, but did he posess powers to control demons? Many people actually used his name to drive away demons or evil spirits. Photos always portray buddha in the clouds. But was Buddha immortal? NO. He was actually just a normal human being who received <em>enlightment</em>, unlike the proclaimed Jesus Christ who actually performed miracles and helped the disabled. Buddhism also does not claim that the world had a creator. Thus, that religion is none other than the works of men who had very ambitious plans on being immortal. The reason why I am saying this is to justify Christianity, since it is sincerely the true religion. Yes, I am saying this. But I am not going to assault other religions if not it will only stir a fight. A true bible study takes around a few years, and to get full understanding of the bible on your own takes longer. Which is why many atheists who claim that God does not exist and also claims that the bible has many contradictions are actually none other than a lack of understanding. And because they <em>are</em> atheists, thus, their claims of the bible are actually more unreliable than those made by believers because they have no interest in the bible. Thus, few have even read or tried to understand the bible at all.</p>
              <p>http://www.exposingsatanism.org/buddhism.htm</p>
              <p>Sorry but I am not a narrow minded person. i am just merely justifying my point of view and my religion, like what AEN is doing now. So you are also saying AEN is narrow minded too? I believe that everyone should respect each other's religion, and not throw a missile here or there on this forum meant for christianity. First of all, though I was at first not with Martial's words, but after giving some thought I have actually sided with him. He actually has the right to say Christianity is a true religion in this '' Eternal Hope'' forum because this forum was at first place, made for christians and believers to discuss. The basis of this forum is God's existence. Though the rule does not apply that it is forbidden for non-christians to come here and discuss, I see it as more of an etiquette and manners which everyone should have. In my opinion, no one should come barging in on a christian topic with the so-called ''proof'' that the bible is highly unreliable and then the flaming and the scolding.</p>
              <p>After all, this <em>is</em> made for christians and I guess it will be alright if anyone says that other religions are false, since that is what the bible says so. But to be rude would mean ME or another fellow christian posting his messages on another forum made for another religion that this or that is false and blah blah blah. Thus, the one who started the war here are those from other religions/ non-believers posting their messages here that our God does not exist, blah blah blah. Those should be posted into their own forum made for their own religion rather than here. Sorry for changing this topic to etiquettes.</p>
              <p>After all, how can I believe in a religion that claims life is an illusion?</p>
              <p>No offence.</p>

              <p>I would also like to further emphasize:</p>
              <p>Buddha claims that he <em>knows</em> there are devas in heaven, or deities. But there is absolutely no proof
              that Buddha was a prophet or medium in any sense. How did he know there
              were devas? The answer is simple. He mixed them up together with
              teachings from Hinduism.</p>
              <p>Buddha also seems to know how the
              universe had existed. But he was merely an indian prince who did not
              receive much education on <em>how</em> the universe came to be. He had <strong>no </strong>connections
              with the supernatural, and neither has he any relations with any
              spirits of a divine origin. Thus, I can already proclaim that Buddha
              was just making weird assumptions towards how the universe was created.</p>
              <p>To those unbelievers of Christ :</p>
              <p>Yes, the bible <em>is</em> written by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">man</span>.
              But it was written as an instruction from God. There are 66 books in
              the bible, 40 people wrote them, and the people were from 3 different
              continents who did not know each other. Yet, when King Constantine of
              Rome put the bible together into one book, it was quite disturbing to
              realise the books actually made a full , matching story. And I would
              also like to stress again that there are <em>no</em> contradictions in
              the bible. The so called ''contradictions'' are actually
              misunderstandings by the readers. And to study the bible actually takes
              years, not days or months. To study the bible, you also need lots of
              sources, given the way as to how much of the the bible was written in a
              special code to protect it's message from the enemies of Israel. Go
              search for some of the solved ''bible contradictions'' and you will
              know what I meant. Regarding bible prophecy, it has been predicted
              hundreds of years in advance that Jesus will come to Earth to die for
              the sin of man. And there is enough proof to backup that the prophecy <strong>was not</strong> added in after Jesus came. Neither is there any proof that Jesus'
              stories were edited, given the description of the many witnesses of
              what actually happened. The bible also predicted the fall of ancient
              Babylon, Greece, and Rome. That alone gives the bible its very own
              reputation of authenticity and divine inspiration.</p>

              <p>Agree with HappyInfo2. Laurence82 is just an idiot who utters nonsense, and then says it is us christians who utter nonsense about the bible saying it upholds scientific principles or whatever. He has not read the bible before and he gives this false and stupid assumption. He is without logic. He thinks it is so fun to lie about the bible as christians but we rather spend our time masturbating if we want to cover up knowing christianity is false(though it is not). So this totally shows how ironic he and the other atheists are. They refuse to read the bible and than say it is false. What kind of shit is that? You ask me did I read sutras but HELLO? Why should I participate in a religion <strong>MADE BY MAN? </strong>If Buddhism says it is a religion from some gods, maybe I might read it too. But, under common sense and logic, I <strong>WILL NOT</strong></p>
              <p>Since the atheists and people from other religions say we are narrow-minded, I am going to make a narrow-minded remark here too. Oh, it's fun to stoop to your low levels sometimes.</p>

                    can't be true because it is numerically impossible.<br> <br>     If there is one soul per person, and if the population
                    of the world is increasing (which it is), where are all these new souls
                    coming from? In other words, the population has more than doubled from
                    around two billion at the turn of the century to over 6 billion today. If
                    each of these 5 billion souls have lived at least ONE past life, where did
                    the over 4 billion souls come from which did not exist before 1900 AD ? It
                    seems there are several possible solutions to this problem:<br> <br>         (A) These new souls are coming

                    existed so they are actually "old" souls.<br> <br>         (D) or there are people with
                    several souls -- perhaps 3 or more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: x-small;"> Since the standard definition of reincarnation involves
                    one soul per person, that rules out option (D). Now if you accept the
                    classic Hindu concept of reincarnation -- the idea that you could come
                    back as a cockroach if you lived a really bad life -- then option (A) is a
                    possible solution. If you are nuts, then option (B) is possible.<br> <br>     Again, if the standard definition of reincarnation
                    holds true, new souls are not created out of thin air, but already exist
                    and are just taking on new lives and new bodies. So option (C) is out.<br> <br>     The Catholic concept is that souls are indeed created
                    immediately by God (see the Catechism paragraph 366). One soul and one
                    body (Mt 10:28).<br> <br>     2- Reincarnation is not true because it contradicts the
                    Resurrection.<br> <br>     To quote some Bible, "it is appointed for men to
                    die once, and after that comes judgement" (Heb 9:27) is probably a
                    text you've heard.</span></p>
              <p>Reincarnation in Hinduism and Buddhism itself is a contradiction. Since all people and animals have souls, why is it that only humans can become enlightened, but not the animals? Animals actually suffer more than humans, given the way they become food on a table. So ants also have a soul? Why don't I see that they become enlightended? They seem more engrossed in serving the nest.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-size: x-small;"> It makes no sense because the reason we live further
                    lives is to supposedly improve upon and do restitution for what wrong we
                    did in our prior lives. But who remembers their prior lives? I have no
                    conscious memory of any prior lives. So how in the world am I supposed to
                    improve upon what I did if I can't remember what I did?<br> <br>     Now I realize some people claim to remember their prior
                    lives through various techniques, particularly hypnosis. But it has been
                    documented that hypnosis is notoriously unreliable. We have people
                    claiming everything under hypnosis -- from UFO abductions, to Satanic
                    ritual abuse, to prior lives. Is all of this stuff true?<br> <br>     A good recent book on hypnotherapy written from a
                    skeptical psychologist point of view is Robert Baker, They Call It
                    Hypnosis (Prometheus Books, 1990). I believe that is the correct title.<br> <br>     4- Reincarnation is not true because it perpetuates the
                    problem of evil.<br> <br>     Contrary to what you said about karma and reincarnation
                    being just, the concepts are unjust because evil is perpetuated and there
                    is no forgiveness. To quote what you wrote --<br> <br>     PC&gt; To me, the ideas of karma and reincarnation
                    seemed more just. If God is just, then the punishment should fit the
                    crime.<br> <br>     Therefore, if I am a murderer in this life, does not
                    the law of karma require that I must come back as the victim of a murder?<br> <br>     If I am a wife beater in this life, don't I have to
                    come back as a woman who is beaten by her husband (or something equivalent
                    to have "justice" done to me) ? Each crime committed in this
                    life requires the perpetrator to return in a future life to have the same
                    thing done to him or her!<br> <br>     Do you see how evil is perpetuated? There is no
                    forgiveness here. That's why the Hindus refer to this as "the wheel
                    of reincarnation" since there is no getting off. It is a hopeless
                    cycle. And where is God in all of this?<br> <br>     A question that must be asked -- where did evil
                    originate according to the laws of karma and reincarnation?<br> <br>     </span></p>

              masturbating if we want to cover up knowing christianity is
              false(though it is not). So this totally shows how ironic he and
              the other atheists are. They refuse to read the bible and than say
              it is false. What kind of shit is that? You ask me did I read
