              <p>I think you are confusing Buddha with John the Baptist here. Buddha is regarded as the Supreme Enlightened One and taught about the liberation of self, while John the Baptist is the one saying that someone higher than him was coming, one whom he was not fit even to tie the sandals of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the Bible, Jesus never outright claimed to be God. Jesus often claimed or implied that he was the Son of God, it was human philosophers who came up with the Trinity (also not ever mentioned in the Bible). Jesus may being healing the people through the body, but it can also be said that Buddha heals the mind, which is what is important in Buddhism. And note that Jesus was the one that died at the age of 33, dying of his wounds anyway. Jesus did too denied himself and starved his own body, at the time of meditation where he was supposedly tempted by the devil himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am also quite sure that Jesus believed in himself too, yet he ended up being betrayed by Judas, banished by the people whom he tried to heal and save, suffered under the hands of his enemy and died of his wounds. Whatever you mean by not helping, you were extremely vague at this point. You should also know that the historical records of that time said that the disciples supposedly stole the body away and tried to spread to the public that Jesus has resurrected. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I understand that you are comparing with Buddhism because that was what I mentioned earlier, but there probably are other religions out there with similar stories such as in the New Testament. And from my criticism of Pascal's Wager to Badzmaro in a previous post, when you do choose a religion, you should choose a religion with the strictest of God(s), since the one that loves you anyway would forgive you even if you did choose a wrong religion, wouldn't he/she?</p>

              <p>According to Wikipedia, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledot_Yeshu">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledot_Yeshu</a>), under the section of '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">historicity</span>', it says that: '<span style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px; font-size: 13px; color: #ff0000;">Scholarly consensus, according to van Voorst, dismisses it as a reliable source for the historical Jesus' . </span></p>
              <p>Since the Toledoth Yeshu is not a reliable historical record, it provides no support at all to the hypothesis that '<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">the disciples supposedly stole the body away and tried to spread to the public that Jesus has resurrected'</span></p>
              <p>The hypothesis that Jesus rose from the dead, given all the historical facts, is still the best hypothesis.</p>

              <p>if you google a little further, you will also find that Dr. van Voorst is also a Christian pastor said to possibly have a apologetic agenda, which is to try provide a rational basis for the Christian faith, defend the faith against objections, and expose the perceived flaws of other world views. Hence, his conclusions to the subject may be bias due to his religious standing. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do understand that the Toledoth Yeshu may not be a perfectly reliable source, but one has to understand that the bible is a collection of recordings by people following the Abrahamic faith, then chosen by the Church to be presented to the world. There are other books of that time which weren't chosen to be placed in the bible, due to their conflicting views with the chosen books. </p>
              <p>Then how does the Church know that the books they chosen are true? Because the books say so. But how are the books true? Because the Church said so. Notice something here? As said earlier, this is like you drinking Pepsi because of a Pepsi ad saying Pepsi is better than Coke. </p>

              <p>ThunderFbolt was correct, you are confused. Buddha had never said someone higher than him is coming because in Buddhism, nobody is higher or lower than Buddha. What he said was another Buddha will be coming to preach. Though Buddhism does not promote miracles but that does not mean miracles do not happen to its followers. There are many miracles happening to the people around me but I am not going to elaborate because Buddha does not wish his followers to promote miracles, He wanted us just simply practise what he taught.

              <p>I said I was not going to interfere here anymore but -.- HELLO? NO ONE IS GOING TO WIN IF ALL OF YOU KEEP GIVING UNRELIABLE CLAIMS AND SOURCES LIKE THAT- AS I SAID, DEBATE ABOUT ARCHEOLOGY AND THE BIBLE PROPHECIES!</p>
              <p>ThunderFbolt your claims about those stuff is <strong>UNRELIABLE </strong>. If the disciples stole Jesus' body, then where did they put it? Also, there were more than 50 witnesses who saw Jesus the 4th day after he was persecuted and killed on the cross. It <strong>CANNOT</strong> be a hallucination, since many people saw it The witnesses were also <strong>purely peasants, even the disciples themselves</strong> and not<strong> LAWYERS</strong>. Also, Jesus appeared for <strong>40days</strong>, hallucinations don't happen to multiple people, and neither do any actually last for more than a day. But people witnessed Jesus and his living body for <strong>40days</strong>. Another thing is that the <strong>disciples THEMSELVES WERE KILLED AND PERSECUTED WHILE SPREADING THE NEW FAITH. And how were they killed? WORSE OFF THAN JESUS. From being beheaded to being boiled alive!</strong> With some logic, no one would go to that extent to lose their life to spread a <strong>LIE! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LOGICS? DID YOU EVEN READ THE BIBLE OR WAS YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF IT MADE UP OF PURELY HEARSAY?</strong></p>
              <p>About the books of the bible. Actually, the bible is made of 66books by 44men. These 44 men did not know each other, and they were from 3 different continents. How were the books put together into one? Actually, there was more than 66books written about witnessing God. However, only books with the criteria of being <strong>witnesses of christ and certain key people were selected for the book.</strong> The books <strong>WERE NOT CHOSEN AT RANDOM.</strong></p>

According to Princeton University's Program in Judaic Studies website, with reference to the <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">Toledoth Yeshu<span style="color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px; font-size: 13px;">  (http://www.princeton.edu/~judaic/toledotyeshu.html) :</span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In academic circles, the book has been dismissed as a reliable source for 
              historical events and was at best considered as “a polemical satire against 
              Christianity based on inversions of New Testament narratives” (David Biale), or, 
              at worst, as “an instructive evidence of a regrettable popular psychosis” 
              (Bernát Heller).</span></p>
              <p>As for your question as to how the Church knew which books to include in the Bible, it's simple. Let's restrict  the discussion to the New Testament [NT] for now. It comprises of the gospels, written by Matthew, Mark, Luke &amp; John. Matthew, Mark &amp; John make up Jesus' inner circle &amp; were all his apostles. Luke was also prominent in the early church. The rest of the New Testament was mainly written by Paul. There's the letter/s of James &amp; Peter also, who were apostles &amp; thus leaders in the early church. These people all wrote letters and historical records for the early church, which became the Bible. The early church all lived within the time of the NT writers thus it's easy for them to know who the 12 apostles were and which were their writings/letters. </p>
              <p>Or picture this: Suppose the leadership of a mega church in Singapore were to send out a circular to all its member cells, departments, etc. People in the church would easily recognise it as from their leaders. But suppose you, ThunderFbolt<span style="line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px;"><span style="color: #000000;">, were to try to masquerade as one of their leaders and spread a heretical doctrine, don't u think it would be easy for their members to tell that u're really not one of their leaders?</span></span></p>
              <p>To use your soft drink analogy, a Coke fan can easily tell a Coke [the Bible- the real thing, pun intended, haha] from something close like the Pepsi, &amp; even more so from something so much different like F&amp;N orange [<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">Toledoth Yeshu]</span></p>

              <p>No offence please.I am not trying to be funny but trying to understand more about christianity and your thoughts. Since Jesus is God or Son of God, why he did not appear to humans as God but reborn (should I call reborn or do you christians say that he was reborn?) as human. Do christians believe in rebirth? If I see from a buddhist angle point of view, he is God but reborn as human. Your thoughts please.</p>

              <p>reborn means to be born again, or to be born a second time. Jesus was born of Mary, Christians do not say He is reborn because, God was only born in the flesh as Jesus once on earth.</p>
              <p>If by rebirth u mean reincarnation, then no, Christians do not believe in reincarnation.</p>
              <p>As to why God appeared to humans as a human (Jesus) &amp; not as God, there are many aspects to this answer, but one of the major reasons is that God's plan was for Jesus to come to earth to die/pay for our sins.</p>

But I know what some people mean when they say that Christianity is not a religion [though I don't think they should use the word religion that way]. They mean that Christianity is not like most religions, where good works earn your way to heaven. Also Christianity is unique in that it has a personal loving God who wants to have a personal relationship with humans, unlike many other religions where u have often times (angry) god/s who one must appease.

              NO ONE IS GOING TO WIN IF ALL OF YOU KEEP GIVING UNRELIABLE CLAIMS
              AND SOURCES LIKE THAT- AS I SAID, DEBATE ABOUT ARCHEOLOGY AND THE

              <p>ThunderFbolt your claims about those stuff is
              <strong>UNRELIABLE</strong> . If the disciples stole Jesus' body,
              then where did they put it? Also, there were more than 50 witnesses
              who saw Jesus the 4th day after he was persecuted and killed on the
              cross. It <strong>CANNOT</strong> be a hallucination, since many
              people saw it The witnesses were also <strong>purely peasants, even
              the disciples themselves</strong> and not <strong>LAWYERS</strong>.
              Also, Jesus appeared for <strong>40days</strong>, hallucinations
              don't happen to multiple people, and neither do any actually last
              for more than a day. But people witnessed Jesus and his living body
              for <strong>40days</strong>. Another thing is that the
              <strong>disciples THEMSELVES WERE KILLED AND PERSECUTED WHILE
              SPREADING THE NEW FAITH. And how were they killed? WORSE OFF THAN
              JESUS. From being beheaded to being boiled alive!</strong> With
              some logic, no one would go to that extent to lose their life to
              spread a <strong>LIE! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LOGICS? DID YOU EVEN
              READ THE BIBLE OR WAS YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF IT MADE UP OF PURELY
              HEARSAY?</strong></p>
              <p>About the books of the bible. Actually, the bible is made of
              66books by 44men. These 44 men did not know each other, and they
              were from 3 different continents. How were the books put together
              into one? Actually, there was more than 66books written about
              witnessing God. However, only books with the criteria of being
              <strong>witnesses of christ and certain key people were selected
              for the book.</strong> The books <strong>WERE NOT CHOSEN AT

              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #808080;">The 3 faiths Judaism, Christianity and Islam were born from
              an account of a man Abraham, who claimed that a god appeared before him. This
              is the start of a monotheism faith. Since then, a lot of religious scriptures
              were written. Many accounts of event were shared among the 3 faiths and
              sub-sects. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #808080;">Within Christianity, it was split into many separate
              churches and denominations. Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337 CE) was
              the first Roman Emperor to convert to Christianity. He needed a single canon to
              be agreed by all the Christian leaders in order to help him unify his empire. The
              assembled copy of the christian bible was gathered in the council of Nicaea and
              was agreed it was the word of god. Of course they were many scriptures deemed not
              suitable for assembly into the bible and they were not considered.</span></p>

              <p>Of course I would prefer my children to respect me from their
              hearts (or conscience, or brains, whatever). However, I don't go
              condemning the children who don't respect me to the pits of Hell
              for all eternity. That isn't being a good father.</p>

              <p>You are not a good father too if you allow children to disrespect you.</p>
              <p>A father loves all his children but must discipline them when they are bad.</p>
