              explain oh my. creationist theories are not really theories, but a
              set of dogma. science is continually adjusting its theories based
              on evidence and discovery. what about being dogmatic? as usual, god

              <p>well, the best you can explain is god created everything and satan is the devil who created havoc for everything evil, and you have to accept god to go to heaven, if not go to hell? if this is not dogma, I dunno what is. No wonder a lot of christians have become so disillusioned with the faith. look at the number of christians converting to other religions or become free thinker. I dun blame them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>since I dun believe in god, so does your faith hell even apply to me in the first place? by the way, when I say god, does not include christianity alone. I refer to religions that have god or god concept. There are many religions that centred on a god or many god, whatever.</p>

              <p>Yes, God alone created everything and science has helped to explained many of God's creations so that we can understand God's creation better. But science cannot and will not be able to replace God and produce creation.</p>

              <p>since I dun believe in god, so does your faith hell even apply

              include christianity alone. I refer to religions that have god or

              <p>Bad news....even though you don't believe in God, there is still God. And I beleived in ONE God and there is only ONE God that is our creator. We will meet Him again regardless if we beleived in Him or not.</p>
              <p>You don't think hell applies does not means it does not exist. Worst news, it does not means that it does not apply to you simply because you don't think so.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong.....you have the freedom to choose to believe, not to believe, to see God existance or ignore it. But you should not misrepresent yourself with falsehood and hear say....</p>
              <p>God is not a concept but big bang theory is....God is reality.</p>

              are two main schools of thought in</span><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Buddhism,
              the Theravada and the Mahanyana,</span><strong><span style="color: red;"><br>         </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span>Theravada
              Buddhists believe they must personally eradicate their mental defilements and
              develop all the great virtues i</span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span>n
              order to gain their final salvation by following the method and example
              prescribed by the Buddha. They </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span>  </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span>respect
              Bodhisattvas but do not regard them as saviors. <br>         </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">In
              the Mahayana school of thought, the Bodhisattvas play an important role by
              showing others the path to attain Nibbana. A Bodhisattva is a  </span><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #ff0000; font-size: small;"> </span></em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">person who is able to be
              released from Samsara and reaching Nibbana but delays doing so through
              compassion for suffering beings.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">  <br>        The practice of Buddhism has been modified
              by local customs, producing distinct varieties of worship.</span> They include the Indian, Tibetan, Ceylonese (Sri
              Lankan), Burmese, Thai, Cambodian, Chinese and  Japanese varieties. <br>        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">It is
              claimed that   <span>the
              <span>Siddartha
              Gautama's way of life and doctrine were substantially different from the Hindu
              (Vedic and Brahmanic) believing people in India.  <br>         Yet he embraced the Hindu beliefs of <strong>Karma </strong>and <strong>rebirth</strong> explaining it <span>as a natural law of cause and effect.
              Hence </span></span></span></span>Buddhism is often considered as an off-shoot
              of Hinduism because it shares with Hinduism its core beliefs of Karma and
              reincarnation. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span>It
              also shares many common terms, some of which are:  Dharma, Samsara, Mantra,
              Samadhi and Aum. </span><span><span><br>        </span></span></span>What distinguishes it
              from Hinduism is that it does not invoke the existence of gods. <br>         Although claiming to be non theistic,
              yet the practice of Buddhism involves worship of the statue or image of
              Siddartha Gautama. Buddhists claim is that these images are not idols but are <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span>symbolic
              representations of his great qualities</span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span><span><br>         </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">One
              of his original concepts is that of dependent origination. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">It
              claims that that life or the world is built on a set of relations, in which the
              arising and cessation of factors depend on some other factors which condition
              them so that all phenomena in this universe are relative, conditioned states and
              do not arise independently of supportive conditions. Hence Buddhism does not
              support the concept of a creator or first cause. <span>Since
              everything is conditioned, relative, and interdependent, there is nothing in
              this world which could be regarded as a permanent entity, variously regarded as
              an ego or an eternal soul.<br>         This provided the basis for another
              original concept </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span><span>called
              the Anatta doctrine, interpreted as </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span>the </span>absence of a distinct soul, self and ego for each person. <br>         Yet he was of the opinion that the
              sum total of the Karma in the form of a consciousness for each person is
              distinct and continues after bodily death by reincarnating in another body.<br>         </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span>He
              introduced the <span>idea of the Four Noble Truths, </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Suffering,
              the Arising of Suffering, the ceasing of Suffering, and the approach to the
              ceasing of Suffering.<br>         Another original concept
              introduced  is The Eightfold path of a righteous life consisting of 
              Right Speech,</span> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Sila Right Action
              Morality, Right Livelihood,</span> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Right
              Effort, Samadhi Right Mindfulness Mental culture, Right Concentration, Right
              Understanding, Panna Right Thoughts Wisdom.<br>    </span>     The adherence to this path
              would bring a Buddhist devotee closer to the salvation called Nibbana.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><br>         In
              Buddhism,  <span>there
              is no such thing as sin as explained by other religions</span><span>.
              Sin is merely unskillful or unwholesome action resulting in further suffering in
              the present life or future lives.<br>         </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span><span> His rejection of the caste system appealed especially to the untouchables.<br> </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">2. Who is Buddha.<br> </span></strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">   </span>    
              A Buddhist apologist, <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">K.Sri Dhammananda
              describes Buddha as follows:</span><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><br> </span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial Narrow; color: #008080; font-size: small;">       
              Gautama Buddha, the founder of what came to be known as Buddhism, lived in
              Northern India in the 6<sup>th</sup> century B.C. His personal name was
              Siddhartha, and family name Gotama. The name 'Buddha' was given to Him after He
              attained Enlightenment and realized the Truth. It means the 'Awakened' or the
              'Enlightened One'. He generally called Himself the Tathagata, while His
              followers called Him Bhagava, the Blessed One. Others spoke of Him as Gotama or
              Sakyamuni.<br>         He was born a prince who seemed to
              have everything. He had a luxurious upbringing and His family was of pure
              descent on both sides. He was the heir to the throne, extremely handsome,
              inspiring trust, stately and gifted with great beauty of complexion and fine
              presence. At sixteen He married His cousin named Yasodhara who bore Him a son
              whom they called Rahula. His wife was majestic, cheerful day and night, and full
              of dignity and grace.<br>         Despite all this, He felt trapped
              amidst the luxury like a bird in a golden cage. During a visit to the city one
              day, He saw what is known as the 'Four Sights', that is , an old man, a sick
              man, a dead man, and a holy recluse. When He saw the sights, one after another,
              the realization came to Him that, 'it is subject to age and death'. He asked,
              'Where is the realm of life in which there is neither age nor death?' The sight
              of the recluse, who was calm for having given up the craving for material life,
              gave him the clue that the first step in His search for Truth was Renunciation.<br>         Determined to find the way out of
              these universal sufferings, He decided to leave home to find the cure not for
              Himself only, but for all mankind. One night in His twenty-ninth year, He bade
              His sleeping wife and son a silent farewell, saddled His great white horse, and
              rode off toward the forest.<br>         His renunciation is unprecedented in
              history. He left at the height of youth, from pleasures to difficulties, from
              certainty of material security to uncertainty, from a position of wealth and
              power to that of a wandering ascetic who took shelter in the cave and forest,
              with His ragged robe as the only protection against the blazing sun, rain and
              winter winds. He renounced His position, wealth, promise of prestige and power,
              and a life filled with love and hope in exchange for the search for Truth which
              no one had found.<br>         For six long years, He labored to
              find the Truth. He studied under the foremost masters of the day, and learned
              all these religious teachers could teach Him. When He could not find what He was
              looking for, He joined a band of ascetics and tortured His body so as to break
              its power and crush its interference, since it was believed that Truth could be
              found this way. A man of enormous energy and will power, He outdid other
              ascetics in every austerity they proposed. While fasting, He ate so little that
              when He took hold of the skin of His stomach, He actually touched His spine. He
              pushed Himself to the extent that no man had done and yet lived. He, too, would
              have certainly died had He not realized the futility of self-mortification, and
              decided to practise moderation instead.<br>         On the full moon night of the month
              of Vesakha, He sat under the Bodhi tree at Gaya, wrapped in deep meditation. It
              was then that His mind burst the bubble of the universe and realized the true
              nature of all life and all things. At the age of 35 years, He was transformed
              from an earnest truth seeker into the Buddha, the Enlightened One.<br>         For nearly half a century, the Buddha
              walked on the dusty paths of India Teaching the Dhamma so that those who heard
              and practised could be ennobled and free. He founded an order of monks and nuns,
              challenged the caste system, raised the status of women, taught religious
              freedom and free inquiry, opened the gates of deliverance to all, in every
              condition of life, high or low, saint or sinner, and ennobled the lives of
              criminals like Angulimala and courtesans like Ambapali.<br>         He was towering in wisdom and
              intellect. Every problem was analyzed in component parts and then reassembled in
              logical order with the meaning made clear. None could defeat Him in dialogue. An
              unequaled teacher, He still is the foremost analyst of the mind and phenomena
              even up to the present day. For the first time in history, He gave men the power
              to think for themselves, raised the worth of mankind, and showed that man can
              reach to the highest knowledge and supreme Enlightenment by his own efforts.<br>         Despite His peerless wisdom and royal
              lineage, He was never removed from the simple villager. Surface distinctions of
              class and caste meant little to Him. No one was too little or low for Him to
              help. Often when an outcast, or poor and dejected came to Him, his self-respect
              was restored and he turned from the ignoble life to that of a noble being.<br>         The Buddha was full of
              compassion(karuna)and wisdom(panna), knowing how and what to teach each
              individual for his own benefit according to his level and capabilities. He was
              known to have walked long distances to help one single person.<br>         He was affectionate and devoted to
              His disciples, always inquiring after their well-being and progress. When
              staying at the monastery, He paid daily visits to the sick wards. His compassion
              for the sick can be seen from His advice, 'He who attends the sick, attends on
              me.' The Buddha kept order and discipline on the basis of mutual respect. King
              Pasenadi could not understand how the Buddha maintained such order and
              discipline in the community of monks, when he as a king with the power to
              punish, could not maintain it as well in his court.<br>         The Buddha did not claim to have
              'created' worldly conditions, universal phenomena, or the Universal Law which we
              call the 'Dhamma'. Although described as lokavidu or 'knower of the worlds', He
              was not regarded as the sole custodian of the Universal Laws. He freely
              acknowledge that the Dhamma, together with the working of the cosmos, is
              timeless, it has no creator and is independent in the absolute sense. Every
              conditioned thing that exists in the cosmos is subject to the operation of
              Dhamma. What the Buddha did (like all the other Buddhas before Him) was to
              rediscover this infallible Truth and make it known to mankind. In discovering
              the Truth, He also found the means whereby one could ultimately free oneself
              from being subjected to the endless cycle of conditioning, with its attendant
              evils of unsatisfactoriness.<br>         After forty-five years of ministry,
              the Buddha passed away at the age of eighty at kusinara, leaving behind
              thousands of followers, monks and nuns, and a vast treasure store of Dhamma
              Teaching. The impact of His great love and dedication is still felt today. </span></p>

              <strong> spirit
              possession</strong> is able to explain all the phenomena attributed to the theory
              of <strong> reincarnation</strong> as well as explain the phenomenon of invoking the
              spirits of the departed. 
               <br>         Because of this, I consider the theory of reincarnation as
              redundant, unnecessary and even <strong>false</strong>.<br>         As the theory of reincarnation is open to question, it then
              follows that the theory of <strong> karma i</strong>s also open to question. 
               <br>         As the theories of reincarnation and karma form the
              foundations of<span>  </span>Hinduism, Buddhism
              and New Age, then these systems of belief are also open to question.<br>         Then what is the purpose of the theory of
              reincarnation? 
               <br>         I believe the purpose is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">deception</span></strong>.
