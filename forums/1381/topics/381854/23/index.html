              <p> </p>
              <p>So you mean holding a joss stick and pay respect to one's mum or

              <p>Actions of material value seems so important to you. U ask a
              Buddhist to come out on the ghost festival when his master told him
              that going out is bad luck.. u see u can ask him out or not. Even his
              mum tell him go out he wont. U may think its ridiculous and bullshit.
              But hey, u respect his decision and his religion.</p>
              <p>Being an
              atheist doesnt mean u can around being all big n mighty, thats exactly
              how it is with you guys. Act so big n tough, talk with such blustery
              without fear. Thats exactly the attitude that is bring about the decay
              in society. Because of that lack of fear, you think you can do and say
              anything. Atheists and non-believers with a good heart and conscience
              will NEVER talk and make statements the way u do.</p>
              <p>The bible has tought us
              to honour our fathers and mothers. And even though God is the Holy
              Father figure, if you dont learn to honour and respect that father
              figure, how do u even expect to love , respect and honour ur own
              parents. What is wrong with honouring ur parents the way u honour ur Holy Father ? The parents should be even more proud.</p>
              <p>And as for entering the temple. There may be fear of attack by other
              spirits, it may because they feel uncomfortable, or they simply just
              refuse to enter. Depending on whether the Christian is of liberal view
              or conservative. But for sure, any Christian who enters the temple will
              pray to have strong faith and blessing. Because entering into a temple
              of idol worship is for Chrstians extremely hard to accept, because that
              is extremely against any Christian belief for idol worship.</p>

              <p>Proof of God has existed ever since...  but time and time again, man chose to forget. So do u still blame the Almighty for not giving.. proof of His existence ?

              <p>did you mistook nature and natural phenomenon as works of god? look to me like you really dunno science or simply chose to ignore it. to think that you used these as proof that god exists, really border on the absurdity. science has explained that these natural phenonmenon have nothing to do with god, in fact there are nothing to suggest that these are acts of god. if like that are acts of god, then tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions are also deemed as acts of god lor, as is the rainfall and snow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why should I read and be receptive to something that was concocted and invented by some men 2009 years ago. the stories are nice to read, but they were just the author's imagination then. on your claim that you know the origin of religion, I have serious doubts. If you know the origin of religion, you would have wholeheartedly agreed with my explanations on how religion came about and the flawed and paradoxes concept of god.</p>

              <p>Ah... I see,</p>
              <p>when I begin in this discourse, I am curious why everytime, when it comes to <span style="color: #000000;">filial piety, its almost always boils down to not holding joss sticks = not filial, not honoring parents. Its as if, holding joss sticks is the one and only form of honoring parents during funeral for christians (all else does not matters). </span></p>
              <p>Is this the only way?</p>
              <p>my thoughts are</p>
              <p>1) holding joss sticks is not the only way, the focus should be on the act of repecting parents/elders not the act of holding/not holding joss sticks.</p>
              <p>2) its better to show these repects and honor when parents are alive, and not wait till they pass on.</p>
              <p>3) finally, different people have different ways to honor and show respect to their parents, there in no "one size fit all" solution/methodology to follow, so let each person choose his/her ways, and lets not impose our ways on others.</p>
              <p>do put some thoughts into these...</p>

              <p>What will you guys do, if your parents are non christian and you are a faithful christian? Give and take? Or must have christian way?

              <p>Because when my grandma passed away, my uncle they all saw/ felt her in the house on the seventh day.. both of them while sleeping.... she was "washing dishes" and in the morning when they were awake... there was a hand print on the rice container..  the spirits do this to make sure there is enough rice in the tub...</p>
              <p>Then what are spirits actually if souls are supposed to go heaven or hell??</p>
              <p>And why is it there are ghost in this world?? Does anyone have a clue</p>
              <p>And if a person is condemned to hell in the christian context.. does that mean their soul stay there forever or what??? and do what.. the meaning is??? why does God create new souls to see if they believe in him a not and then send them to hell if they dun believe in him.. wouldnt doing this be redundant??</p>
              <p>Pls enlighten me anyone sorry to sound like an unknowledgable person..</p>

              christian myself straight away brings out the point that i would be bias

              approach towards the bible, meaning that he took everything in it by its
              literal sense, which is obviously the wrong way to read the bible. In fact, i
              would be touching on this problem in the next few paragrahs</span></p>

              own image (Gen 1:26) so from this we can assume God looks something like a
              human being.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>God creating man in his own image does not mean that God looks
              like man. the 'Image' written here is the characteristics or personality of
              God. to sum it up is his "Perfectness".Men used to be perfect, like
              God, without Sin. But when men sinned by eating from the Tree of knowledge of
              the Good and Evil, they had become sinners and evil-doers, and were banished
              away from God until Jesus Christ came down to save us. That is why men are no
              longer perfect. </span></p>

              11:2), fingers (Ps 8:3) and a face (Deut 13:17). He does not like people seeing
              his face but he doesn t mind if they see his back.</span></span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'></span></p>

              the Israelites were praising and worshiping God after they
              escaped from the Pharaoh of Egypt. In the last few verses, Moses was
              talking about how Pharaoh thought he could use his hand and sword to
              wipe out the Israelites. But instead Moses draws comparison to God, when
              God stretch out his 'hand' then the water came down on the Egyptians. The
              'hand' used here is just a comparison between Pharaoh and God, nothing to do
              with God's physical being.  </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'> </span></p>

              base it not only on what it says, but also what is it's context. in this case,
              the verses before it. </span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'>The setting of this verse still involves Moses, after he had
              received the two tablets which bear the Ten commandments from God on top of
              Mount Sinai. In fact, in this verse, i can draw another reason which would make
              it simple to understand why 'his mighty hand and his stretched out arm' cannot
              be read literally. In the earlier part of the verse, Moses said that 'I speak
              not with your children which have not known'. If i was to read this using the
              writer of the article's method. i would be thinking that this would mean that i
              cannot talk with anyone who is not a christian? Of course not! This actually
              means that Moses would not follow the ways of the world, such as worship false Gods
              and idols, and so on. So the 'mighty hand and outstretched arm' is basically
              something for the reader to understand God's power more easily. What i would
              think when i read 'mighty hand and stretch out arm' would be such as; God is so
              powerful and almighty, and he reaches to everyone of us and helps us '
              outstretched arm'. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'>This shows that we cannot read the Bible in the way we would read
              a children's story book, but instead by the way we read our literature books
              and poems. </span></p>

              that. but as timothy keller has said in his book, you still have to believe in
              something. Most Atheists believe in Evolution and the Big Bang, which basically
              points to<span>  </span>"the scientific
              explanation for ourselves". The basic theory of Evolution, by Charles
              Darwin, is basically that everything forms, happens, changes by CHANCE over a
              long period of time. I’ll be touching on 2 main aspects, Evidence against
              Darwinism, Why it is so widely accepted in modern times.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'> </span></p>

              times</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'>Darwinism is considerably a huge part of a person’s everyday life,
              whether we are studying or working. We can see the evidence of it in what we
              watch, hear and see in the world around us. But imagine what was life like
              before 1859,<span>  </span>before the whole idea of
              evolution and darwinism was brought about by the man himself. The world was
              still the same, people were still people, scientist were still scientists,
              animals were still animals. Why would any commoner believe in it? When there
              were in a sense, ‘better’ and ‘proven’ ways of why the earth was created and
              how man came to be. In the next 150 years, more and more scientist began to
              believe in darwinism. Scientists, of course are of higher intellect and are the
              ‘equivalent of church leaders’ in the atheist society. Because Scientists are
              at such a high position in society, and because they are pretty neutral against
              all religions, they have the most exposure to the media, have the most books
              and are constantly writing in newspapers, they are less criticized and their
              works and understandings are more widely accepted among free thinkers. Most
              free thinkers think that there is no such thing as god but instead everything
              relies on chance and nature, which points to darwinism and the theory of
              evolution. But if most free thinkers think that darwinism is not a religion,
              then they are wrong. The definition of religion in <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">www.wikipedia.org</a> is “</span><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A</span></span><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></span><span><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>religion</span></strong></span><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></span><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>is a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of
              the universe</span>”. </span><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'>Now, think to yourself, is darwinism a
              set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe? Of
              course it is! Now, what sets darwinism or rather degrades darwinism apart from
              the rest of the religions, is that it was inspired by a 100% human man! Charles
              Darwin himself! So if Charles darwin created darwinism, does that make him God?
              Or rather does that make him a person who has seen everything happening from
              the start and till the end? Did he witness the first cell growing into
              something 1 billion times bigger than it? Of course he did not. What Charles
              Darwin did was basically draw conclusions from things he saw around him, which
              is the reason why there is so much evidence for his theory. But again, Charles
              Darwin is still a human after all, and a human’s understanding of the world
              around him is only limited to a certain amount. For me, it’s harder to believe
              in a fellow person who has that certain amount of knowledge and power instead
              of a celestial being who has infinite amount of knowledge and power. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span style='font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";  color: black;'>Coming back to my topic, the main reason why darwinism is so
              widely accepted in the world, is because it is endorsed by most scientists. Many
              people who have less intellect capability than scientists would probably think “since
              they are smarter than me, then they are probably right and i should believe in
              whatever they believe in”. But the main reason why darwinism is so widely
              accepted by scientists around, is because Charles darwin was practically one of
              them. Average scientists would look up to the better scientists and say “these
              people are smarter and more experienced than me, therefore they are correct”. </span></p>

              Darwinism</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; '>Most believe in Darwinism
              simply because it is much easier to comprehend and understand it. But, in
              reality, these people are lazy and just want to lay back and say “this is where
              i come from, but since it is such, it does not affect me presently and i should
              go on living life just as i did”. Darwinism is basically believes that </span><span><span style='font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>“Life on earth evolved gradually
              beginning with one primitive species—perhaps a self-replicating molecule—that
              lived more than 3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing
              off many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not all) of
              evolutionary change is natural selection.”<sup> </sup></span></span><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; '>Now what this means is that it took 3.5 billion
              years (in other words: a very very very long <span style="color: red;">time</span>)
              for a single species to branch out into millions and millions of species, and
              currently the leader of it all are humans. So the whole basis of darwinism and
              the evolution theory is that things CHANGE over a long long PERIOD OF <span style="color: red;">TIME</span> through a course of ‘natural selection’. This is
              basically the assumption that <span style="color: red;">time</span> allows for
              change through natural selection. If you take out <span style="color: red;">time</span> out of this equation, there would not be change and no natural selection. How
              Charles Darwin brought up this approximate time of 3.5 billion years was by
              looking at fossil remains deeper and deeper into ground and examining them for
              age and therefore finding at what <span style="color: red;">time</span> would
              these fossils have been still alive and kicking. How he based this <span style="color: red;">time </span>was by the basic explanation that for things to
              be fossilised, it would take <span style="color: red;">time </span>and tremendous
              pressure to prevent decomposition. So if <span style="color: red;">time </span>was
              again taken out of this equation, Darwin’s theory of evolution would be
              completely wrong. Simply because, if things did not take alot of time to
              fossilise, then Darwin’s approximate time of 3.5 billion years would be wrong
              and the whole length of time would be shortened alot, and that would mean there
              could not have been enough time for evolution to occur. That basic explanation
              that the only way to fossilise something was by<span>  </span>time and tremendous pressure was accepted during Darwin’s time, but is
              something that now is considered wrong. For example, a cat or dog can be
              fossilised in 2 or 3 years as long as there is a huge amount of pressure and
              the right conditions, with the exception of time. This link shows how it’s
              possible:</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><a href="http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm">http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm</a>.
              Therefore, Darwinism is false. This proves that as new discoveries are made,
              and new theories are brought up, old theories and beliefs have to be removed
              from the ‘scientific library’, and evolution and Darwinism are one of them. <span> </span>For more information, please read: <a href="http://www.discovery.org/a/10661">http://www.discovery.org/a/10661</a></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>The setting of this verse is one which Moses and the Israelites were praising and worshiping God after they escaped from the Pharaoh of Egypt. In the last few verses, Moses was talking about how Pharaoh thought he could use his hand and sword to wipe out the Israelites. But instead Moses draws comparison to God, when God stretch out his 'hand' then the water came down on the Egyptians. The 'hand' used here is just a comparison between Pharaoh and God, nothing to do with God's physical being.  </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>This shows that when we are reading a particular verse, we must base it not only on what it says, but also what is it's context. in this case, the verses before it. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>Duet 11:2 </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>1</span></sup></strong><span>Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>2</span></sup></strong><span>And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>3</span></sup></strong><span>And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>4</span></sup></strong><span>And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>The setting of this verse still involves Moses, after he had received the two tablets which bear the Ten commandments from God on top of Mount Sinai. In fact, in this verse, i can draw another reason which would make it simple to understand why 'his mighty hand and his stretched out arm' cannot be read literally. In the earlier part of the verse, Moses said that 'I speak not with your children which have not known'. If i was to read this using the writer of the article's method. i would be thinking that this would mean that i cannot talk with anyone who is not a christian? Of course not! This actually means that Moses would not follow the ways of the world, such as worship false Gods and idols, and so on. So the 'mighty hand and outstretched arm' is basically something for the reader to understand God's power more easily. What i would think when i read 'mighty hand and stretch out arm' would be such as; God is so powerful and almighty, and he reaches to everyone of us and helps us ' outstretched arm'. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>This shows that we cannot read the Bible in the way we would read a children's story book, but instead by the way we read our literature books and poems. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>Psalms 8:3</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><strong><sup><span>1</span></sup></strong><span>O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>2</span></sup></strong><span>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>3</span></sup></strong><span>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>4</span></sup></strong><span>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>5</span></sup></strong><span>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>This is pretty similar to the earlier verse from Duet 11:2 (please refer)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>Duet 13:17</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>16</span></sup></strong><span>And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>17</span></sup></strong><span>And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>18</span></sup></strong><span>When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>This verse does not show that God has a face in the first place. it just says that God can become merciful and compassionate though he has been angered terribly (of course by us doing something wrong). This verse says nothing about his face but his mercy and Compassion for us. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>On the whole, I personally feel that with such lack of true understanding of the Bible and what it teaches, one should not believe it, let alone criticize it, you just bring yourself to self-ridicule. These simple literature skills are thought in schools to 14 year olds. much younger than the writer himself. He should honestly be ashamed. I personally would not go and criticize any religion unless i have completely read and understand whatever it teaches. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>Now i would like to touch on atheists or free thinkers.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>You guys often say i don't believe in this, i don't believe in that. but as timothy keller has said in his book, you still have to believe in something. Most Atheists believe in Evolution and the Big Bang, which basically points to<span> </span> "the scientific explanation for ourselves". The basic theory of Evolution, by Charles Darwin, is basically that everything forms, happens, changes by CHANCE over a long period of time. I’ll be touching on 2 main aspects, Evidence against Darwinism, Why it is so widely accepted in modern times.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>Why it is so widely accepted in modern times</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>Darwinism is considerably a huge part of a person’s everyday life, whether we are studying or working. We can see the evidence of it in what we watch, hear and see in the world around us. But imagine what was life like before 1859,<span> </span> before the whole idea of evolution and darwinism was brought about by the man himself. The world was still the same, people were still people, scientist were still scientists, animals were still animals. Why would any commoner believe in it? When there were in a sense, ‘better’ and ‘proven’ ways of why the earth was created and how man came to be. In the next 150 years, more and more scientist began to believe in darwinism. Scientists, of course are of higher intellect and are the ‘equivalent of church leaders’ in the atheist society. Because Scientists are at such a high position in society, and because they are pretty neutral against all religions, they have the most exposure to the media, have the most books and are constantly writing in newspapers, they are less criticized and their works and understandings are more widely accepted among free thinkers. Most free thinkers think that there is no such thing as god but instead everything relies on chance and nature, which points to darwinism and the theory of evolution. But if most free thinkers think that darwinism is not a religion, then they are wrong. The definition of religion in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">www.wikipedia.org</a> is “</span><span><span>A</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><strong><span>religion</span></strong></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>is a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe</span>”.</span> <span>Now, think to yourself, is darwinism a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe? Of course it is! Now, what sets darwinism or rather degrades darwinism apart from the rest of the religions, is that it was inspired by a 100% human man! Charles Darwin himself! So if Charles darwin created darwinism, does that make him God? Or rather does that make him a person who has seen everything happening from the start and till the end? Did he witness the first cell growing into something 1 billion times bigger than it? Of course he did not. What Charles Darwin did was basically draw conclusions from things he saw around him, which is the reason why there is so much evidence for his theory. But again, Charles Darwin is still a human after all, and a human’s understanding of the world around him is only limited to a certain amount. For me, it’s harder to believe in a fellow person who has that certain amount of knowledge and power instead of a celestial being who has infinite amount of knowledge and power.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt;"><span>Coming back to my topic, the main reason why darwinism is so widely accepted in the world, is because it is endorsed by most scientists. Many people who have less intellect capability than scientists would probably think “since they are smarter than me, then they are probably right and i should believe in whatever they believe in”. But the main reason why darwinism is so widely accepted by scientists around, is because Charles darwin was practically one of them. Average scientists would look up to the better scientists and say “these people are smarter and more experienced than me, therefore they are correct”.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Evidence against Darwinism</span></p>
              <p><span>Most believe in Darwinism simply because it is much easier to comprehend and understand it. But, in reality, these people are lazy and just want to lay back and say “this is where i come from, but since it is such, it does not affect me presently and i should go on living life just as i did”. Darwinism is basically believes that</span> <span><span>“Life on earth evolved gradually beginning with one primitive species—perhaps a self-replicating molecule—that lived more than 3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing off many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not all) of evolutionary change is natural selection.” </span></span><span>Now what this means is that it took 3.5 billion years (in other words: a very very very long <span style="color: #ff0000;">time</span>) for a single species to branch out into millions and millions of species, and currently the leader of it all are humans. So the whole basis of darwinism and the evolution theory is that things CHANGE over a long long PERIOD OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">TIME</span> through a course of ‘natural selection’. This is basically the assumption that <span style="color: #ff0000;">time</span> allows for change through natural selection. If you take out <span style="color: #ff0000;">time</span> out of this equation, there would not be change and no natural selection. How Charles Darwin brought up this approximate time of 3.5 billion years was by looking at fossil remains deeper and deeper into ground and examining them for age and therefore finding at what <span style="color: #ff0000;">time</span> would these fossils have been still alive and kicking. How he based this <span style="color: #ff0000;">time</span> was by the basic explanation that for things to be fossilised, it would take <span style="color: #ff0000;">time</span> and tremendous pressure to prevent decomposition. So if <span style="color: #ff0000;">time</span> was again taken out of this equation, Darwin’s theory of evolution would be completely wrong. Simply because, if things did not take alot of time to fossilise, then Darwin’s approximate time of 3.5 billion years would be wrong and the whole length of time would be shortened alot, and that would mean there could not have been enough time for evolution to occur. That basic explanation that the only way to fossilise something was by<span> </span> time and tremendous pressure was accepted during Darwin’s time, but is something that now is considered wrong. For example, a cat or dog can be fossilised in 2 or 3 years as long as there is a huge amount of pressure and the right conditions, with the exception of time. This link shows how it’s possible:</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm">http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm</a>. Therefore, Darwinism is false. This proves that as new discoveries are made, and new theories are brought up, old theories and beliefs have to be removed from the ‘scientific library’, and evolution and Darwinism are one of them. <span> </span>For more information, please read: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.discovery.org/a/10661">http://www.discovery.org/a/10661</a></span></p>

              <p>Well, i am fully aware of science and religion. All my statements till now is reference to science and religion.  From quantumn physics to praying. From Evolution to Intelligent design. From the geological formations of this miracles to the scientific explainations of its possibilities.I am a strong advocate of Science and Religion. Because it stands side by side.</p>
              <p>How do u know that it is invented and concocted. It is not ur normal fantasy book with dragons and elves.</p>
              <p>The origin of religion, that u most likely watched on TV...  does not FULLY explain Christianity itself. Its just a general conceptualisation of what religion is to different people. Dont mix Hindu's god to the gods of ancient Egypt and the Christian God.</p>
              <p>Your paradoxes in this few posts leading up to this one is regarding Good n Evil. And your paradox is about God being all GOOD and not evil. But dont forget, God is capable of both Good n Evil. Your so called paradoxes..  are not even paradoxes.</p>
              <p>About God able to create something he cant lift.. again.. to remind u of how to bring God to your level, is God can always create something to LIFT what he cant lift.  Like Man. We can create something we cant lift, but we create machines to lift what we cant lift.</p>

              <p>Atheism itself is a form of religion, especially when they become die hard defending it against all others.</p>
              <p>All i know is  a Christian dont reject the BIble, as it is there for a reason, to learn to understand and learn its message.</p>

              God looks like man. the 'Image' written here is the characteristics
              or personality of God. to sum it up is his "Perfectness".Men used
              to be perfect, like God, without Sin. But when men sinned by eating
              from the Tree of knowledge of the Good and Evil, they had become
              sinners and evil-doers, and were banished away from God until Jesus
              Christ came down to save us. That is why men are no longer
              perfect. </span></p>

              8:3) and a face (Deut 13:17). He does not like people seeing his

              the Israelites were praising and worshiping God
              after they escaped from the Pharaoh of Egypt. In the last
              few verses, Moses was talking about how Pharaoh thought
              he could use his hand and sword to wipe out the Israelites.
              But instead Moses draws comparison to God, when God stretch out his
              'hand' then the water came down on the Egyptians. The 'hand'
              used here is just a comparison between Pharaoh and God, nothing to
              do with God's physical being.  </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>This shows that when we are reading a particular
              verse, we must base it not only on what it says, but also what is
              it's context. in this case, the verses before it. </span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>2</span></sup></strong><span>And know ye this day: for
              I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have
              not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his
              mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>3</span></sup></strong><span>And his miracles, and his

              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span> </span><strong><sup><span>4</span></sup></strong><span>And what he did unto the

              after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this
              day;</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>The setting of this verse still involves Moses,
              after he had received the two tablets which bear the Ten
              commandments from God on top of Mount Sinai. In fact, in this
              verse, i can draw another reason which would make it simple to
              understand why 'his mighty hand and his stretched out arm' cannot
              be read literally. In the earlier part of the verse, Moses said
              that 'I speak not with your children which have not known'. If i
              was to read this using the writer of the article's method. i would
              be thinking that this would mean that i cannot talk with anyone who
              is not a christian? Of course not! This actually means that Moses
              would not follow the ways of the world, such as worship false Gods
              and idols, and so on. So the 'mighty hand and outstretched arm' is
              basically something for the reader to understand God's power more
              easily. What i would think when i read 'mighty hand and stretch out
              arm' would be such as; God is so powerful and almighty, and he
              reaches to everyone of us and helps us ' outstretched
              arm'. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>This shows that we cannot read the Bible in the way
              we would read a children's story book, but instead by the way we
              read our literature books and poems. </span></p>

              doing something wrong). This verse says nothing about his face but

              not believe it, let alone criticize it, you just bring yourself to
              self-ridicule. These simple literature skills are thought in
              schools to 14 year olds. much younger than the writer himself. He
              should honestly be ashamed. I personally would not go and criticize
              any religion unless i have completely read and understand whatever
              it teaches. </span></p>

              believe in that. but as timothy keller has said in his book, you
              still have to believe in something. Most Atheists believe in
              Evolution and the Big Bang, which basically points to<span> </span> "the scientific explanation for ourselves". The
              basic theory of Evolution, by Charles Darwin, is basically that
              everything forms, happens, changes by CHANCE over a long period of
              time. I’ll be touching on 2 main aspects, Evidence against
              Darwinism, Why it is so widely accepted in modern times.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>Why it is so widely accepted in modern
              times</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>Darwinism is considerably a huge part of a person’s
              everyday life, whether we are studying or working. We can see the
              evidence of it in what we watch, hear and see in the world around
              us. But imagine what was life like before 1859,<span> </span> before the whole idea of evolution and darwinism
              was brought about by the man himself. The world was still the same,
              people were still people, scientist were still scientists, animals
              were still animals. Why would any commoner believe in it? When
              there were in a sense, ‘better’ and ‘proven’ ways of why the earth
              was created and how man came to be. In the next 150 years, more and
              more scientist began to believe in darwinism. Scientists, of course
              are of higher intellect and are the ‘equivalent of church leaders’
              in the atheist society. Because Scientists are at such a high
              position in society, and because they are pretty neutral against
              all religions, they have the most exposure to the media, have the
              most books and are constantly writing in newspapers, they are less
              criticized and their works and understandings are more widely
              accepted among free thinkers. Most free thinkers think that there
              is no such thing as god but instead everything relies on chance and
              nature, which points to darwinism and the theory of evolution. But
              if most free thinkers think that darwinism is not a religion, then
              they are wrong. The definition of religion in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">www.wikipedia.org</a> is
              “</span><span><span>A</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><strong><span>religion</span></strong></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>is a set of beliefs
              concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the
              universe</span>”.</span> <span>Now, think to yourself, is
              darwinism a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and
              purpose of the universe? Of course it is! Now, what sets darwinism
              or rather degrades darwinism apart from the rest of the religions,
              is that it was inspired by a 100% human man! Charles Darwin
              himself! So if Charles darwin created darwinism, does that make him
              God? Or rather does that make him a person who has seen everything
              happening from the start and till the end? Did he witness the first
              cell growing into something 1 billion times bigger than it? Of
              course he did not. What Charles Darwin did was basically draw
              conclusions from things he saw around him, which is the reason why
              there is so much evidence for his theory. But again, Charles Darwin
              is still a human after all, and a human’s understanding of the
              world around him is only limited to a certain amount. For me, it’s
              harder to believe in a fellow person who has that certain amount of
              knowledge and power instead of a celestial being who has infinite
              amount of knowledge and power.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0cm;"><span>Coming back to my topic, the main reason why
              darwinism is so widely accepted in the world, is because it is
              endorsed by most scientists. Many people who have less intellect
              capability than scientists would probably think “since they are
              smarter than me, then they are probably right and i should believe
              in whatever they believe in”. But the main reason why darwinism is
              so widely accepted by scientists around, is because Charles darwin
              was practically one of them. Average scientists would look up to
              the better scientists and say “these people are smarter and more
              experienced than me, therefore they are correct”.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Evidence against Darwinism</span></p>
              <p><span>Most believe in Darwinism simply because
              it is much easier to comprehend and understand it. But, in reality,
              these people are lazy and just want to lay back and say “this is
              where i come from, but since it is such, it does not affect me
              presently and i should go on living life just as i did”. Darwinism
              is basically believes that</span> <span><span>“Life on
              earth evolved gradually beginning with one primitive
              species—perhaps a self-replicating molecule—that lived more than
              3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing off
              many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not
              all) of evolutionary change is natural selection.” </span></span><span>Now what this means is that it took
              3.5 billion years (in other words: a very very very long
              <span style="color: red;">time</span>) for a single species to
              branch out into millions and millions of species, and currently the
              leader of it all are humans. So the whole basis of darwinism and
              the evolution theory is that things CHANGE over a long long PERIOD
              OF <span style="color: red;">TIME</span> through a course of
              ‘natural selection’. This is basically the assumption that
              <span style="color: red;">time</span> allows for change through
              natural selection. If you take out <span style="color: red;">time</span> out of this equation, there would not be
              change and no natural selection. How Charles Darwin brought up this
              approximate time of 3.5 billion years was by looking at fossil
              remains deeper and deeper into ground and examining them for age
              and therefore finding at what <span style="color: red;">time</span> would these fossils have been still alive and kicking. How he based
              this <span style="color: red;">time</span> was by the basic
              explanation that for things to be fossilised, it would take
              <span style="color: red;">time</span> and tremendous pressure to
              prevent decomposition. So if <span style="color: red;">time</span> was again taken out of this equation, Darwin’s theory of evolution
              would be completely wrong. Simply because, if things did not take
              alot of time to fossilise, then Darwin’s approximate time of 3.5
              billion years would be wrong and the whole length of time would be
              shortened alot, and that would mean there could not have been
              enough time for evolution to occur. That basic explanation that the
              only way to fossilise something was by<span> </span> time and tremendous pressure was accepted during Darwin’s time, but
              is something that now is considered wrong. For example, a cat or
              dog can be fossilised in 2 or 3 years as long as there is a huge
              amount of pressure and the right conditions, with the exception of
              time. This link shows how it’s possible:</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm">http://www.creationinthecrossfire.com/Articles/Fossilization.htm</a>.
              Therefore, Darwinism is false. This proves that as new discoveries
              are made, and new theories are brought up, old theories and beliefs
              have to be removed from the ‘scientific library’, and evolution and
              Darwinism are one of them. <span> </span>For more

              <p>You have raised a point in fossilization in matter of million years versus artificial fossilization using pressure and such.</p>

              <p>b) fossil done by artificial  means.</p>
              <p>What will the cabon dating reveal for sample (a) and (b)?</p>
