              <p>in their view, its god who is the creator of humans, never mind it was your mother who gave birth to you. thats their simplistic view and using god to explain everything and anything. frankly speaking, this type of thinking really retard the progress of society and superstitious, using the concept of a supreme divine being. our world and universe is much more than just god and satan.</p>
