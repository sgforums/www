              <p>Yes, you can have control of your own destiny....and all Christians do when they choose to accept the Lord as their saviour......and you choose to reject it. It's all free will and personal choice.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, being complex over simple issues does not make one "complicated or smarter".......but may make one stupid. If it's simple, keep it simple.....don't complicate it unnecessarily. Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p>simple reason, beause he is being an extremist, so to let him know of the reaction of his words, i would have to say sth.. unless you suggest something like.. " Hey i am angry at what you said" whats more, its just a form of expressing anger. Unless he is so smart to really go burn himself. i know everyone will die, not like i'm immortal and yes you too will be barberque.</p>

              <p>this fellow really have no idea that science attempted to explain the BIG BANG theory and he has the cheek to say unable to explain oh my. creationist theories are not really theories, but a set of dogma. science is continually adjusting its theories based on evidence and discovery. what about being dogmatic? as usual, god followers will trump their teachings over science.</p>
              <p>Since you have no idea what I mean by I am not going to hell, I let others non believers here explain to you. its quite simple really, you have no idea I am mocking at the hell thingy.</p>

              <p>yes they are fundamentalist in that sense. other religions are satanic and their religion is the one and only true religion. non believers go to hell. salvation is thru their god only, for he is the only god and all god are false. I have heard that so many a time already. sounded dogmatic, arrogance and irrational to outsiders.</p>
