              <p>Well, thats a fact, hence, i believe we should be looking at real compassion, not amount of compassion as in your earlier posts, or worship of beings as means of repentance or as a form of compassion to add</p>
              <p>I am sure the Buddhists will be happy if someone find out better path to happiness and greater compassion, without all the falsehood as which i point out in the last few posts</p>

              <p>Dawnfirstlight, my suggestion would be to look for a religion that you think that is both compassionate &amp; true and not use the amount of compassion in the religion as the sole criterion for choosing a religion, if that's what you're doing. I can invent a religion that is more compassionate than Buddhism, say, one in which there is no hell &amp; in which Hitler goes unpunished or one that  says that if someone murders your mother, he should be forgiven &amp; not be capitally punished or thrown into jail, but u may not subscribe to this invented religion right?</p>

              <p>Hi all, let's take this discussion as sharing views but not trying to convince or making anybody to believe one has said. I have experienced Buddha and proved some of the scriptures are true. Thus, I take it as everything it is being said in the scriptures are true because I cannot be experiencing everything to prove that it is true right, like going to hell to see whether there is really a Buddha there. What ThunderFbolt said was exactly what is being preached in Buddhism. You need not pray to Him to gain Nirvana if you can practise his teachings well. By paying respect to Him, it reminds one of his teachings.</p>

              <p>none of us here are saying that religion is not <strong>good</strong>. (you can go back a few pages to read. aside from flaming each other, we are generally quite nice when talking about religion.) after all, there are many religious non-profit charity groups. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, this discussion is sharing the views of whether Christianity is <strong>real</strong> or not, and why people feel the need to believe in religion. haven't yet gotten to other religions, mostly Christianity with a bit of Islam and Judaism on the side, but as you know there are a whole lot more to talk about. </p>

              <p>Somewhere in the middle of the pages, I read about this Chris pple go heave where non chris go hell. I feel very distrub by this sentences.</p>
              <p>I just wonder why chris pple can have this thought? And I am sure GOD love all the kind and golden heart pple regardless of whether u are chris or non chris. It is thru the process, pple not GOD might wrote that a very narrow minded sentence.</p>

              <p>As far I understand, this is the historic/theological mainsteam/biblical view that's been held by the church for 2 millennia- the notion that one need's a personal faith in Jesus to enter heaven. Are u writing from Singapore? If u are, I will be very surprised at the number of your  Christian friends who have a different opinion. </p>

              <p>In fact, I do not wish to share if you did not ask because my experience (not just mine, thousands of practising buddhists have seen  this phenomenal before) was too amazing to be believed even to a new practising buddhist like me, talk less about people like you who is a christian. In May this year, I went to participate in a chanting event at a temple (my first time there). My friend told me that each time at the end of this event (this event is held once in 2 years), there would be changes to the sky. I did not believe her but still hoping to see something. 5 minutes after the event, I did not see any changes to the sky although there were still many buddhists staring at the sky. I went for teabreak. About 15 minutes later, I walked out and saw others pointing and praying, I looked up and saw the clouds changed so suddenly, the speed was comparable to firework, clouds changed from white to orange to orangy red. We believed these were the clouds that buddhas were stepping on. There was also a ray of light, very bright but not glaring to the eyes (ä½›å…‰ï¼‰. I was stunned as I have never seen anything like this before but I understand that this is nothing new to those long time practising buddhists. The changes lasted for about 5 to 10 minutes. I could not sleep that night thinking of what I had seen. I vowed that every word I said here was true or I will be condemned to hell. There are many others but just share with you this amazing one. Not trying to convince or make anybody to believe what I saw but just to share.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The term 'canon of Scripture' refers to the collection of books
              that are considered scripture. At the council of Nicaea, they
              discussed &amp; debated mainly the 5 issues mentioned, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">based on what was already regarded as
              scripture</span>. Thus the canon of scripture, &amp; the doctrines
              that were derived from scripture, are 2 separate things, the latter
              of which were discussed at the council, not the former, according

              <p>yes, I was referring to the doctrine, which derived from the many scriptures. Thus the council involved selecting which scriptures are suitable for acceptance.</p>
              <p>So it involve selecting the better ones and discarding the less suitable ones.</p>
