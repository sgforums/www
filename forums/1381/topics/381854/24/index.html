              <p>Last time I checked, religions usually have supernatural being/beings. Atheism is more of an ideology. But I know what you mean now.</p>

              <p>Hey there unfortunately the answer is yes, because he hasnt confessed his sins. You go to hell because of all the sins you've ever committed, and that is an absolute. The only way out is through God's forgiveness - that's why when someone believes in Jesus it's called "salvation", where you are "saved" from your sins &amp; its consequences.</p>
              <p>Seems really unfair right, that bad people who finally believe (as in, truly. lip service wont get you anywhere) can end up in heaven, and good people who dont end up in hell. This is because it's not about how much good I do - because that is unfair. It's about whether my heart is willing to believe and realise I am a sinner and turn away from that.</p>

              <p>But I'm not saying that happened with Jesus, I'm just saying that could have been. Besides, the Bible itself records the actions/words of Jesus, and the earlier books are prophecies of his life, and the records have been proven to be genuine. If they're all made up, you'd have to admit it's all a very very elaborate conspiracy, because the books were written centuries apart in a variety of countries, and still corroborate.</p>
