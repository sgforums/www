              <p>Ooo... long post... okay, let me try...</p>
              <p>1. regardless of whether days in 1st chapter of Genesis refer to
              actual 24 hours or millions of years, the time line is still
              wrong. <span>The Genesis 1 creation account conflicts
              with the order of events that are known to science. In Genesis, the
              earth is created before light and stars, birds and whales before
              reptiles and insects, and flowering plants before any animals. The
              order of events known from science is just the opposite. (<a style="color: #0000bb; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/1.html#1">1:1-2:3</a>) God
              creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from
              night, on the first day. Yet he didn't make the light producing
              objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day (<a style="color: #0000bb; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/1.html#14">1:14-19</a>). Not to
              mention by the 2nd or 3rd day the time line should already be 24
              hours to a day, since that was when God supposed already created
              the Earth. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. A temporary flood on Earth is possible. A flood lasting 150+
              days covering the highest mountains of the highest peaks is
              bullshit. There isn't enough water on Earth to cover up to the
              height of Bukit Timah Hill. </p>
              <p>Also, isn't it strange that in Chap 1 he kept saying everything
              was good, and in Chap 6-7 he said everything was fucked up?</p>
              <p>Noah sent out a dove to see if the waters have gone down. The
              dove returned with an olive branch. Wouldn't all the olive trees be
              dead being under water for 150+ days?</p>
              <p>And... I remember my grandmum telling me that during every
              eclipse, one has to pick up pots and pans and bang away as loud as
              possible to scare away the dog of Er Lang Shen, who was eating the
              moon. And everytime up till today the moon survives! Does that
              signify the existance of Er Lang Shen's dog?</p>

              <p>he can't make a rock so heavy than he can't lift it it up i suppose. and that is only an assumption that there is a God that created the universe, written in a book which it itself says it's true.</p>
              <p>a long time ago, people also believed that a Sun God rode the chariot of fire across the sky everyday, and hence why the Sun moves across the sky. people also believed that there was a pretty lady goddess with a cute rabbit living on the moon. however, while there are probably people out there still believing such stories, we know them to be false. why? it is because these stories were created to explain the unknown before they were studied.</p>
              <p>notice how the Christian god in this case is seen to be the creator of everything and nothing. is he/she hence the god of nothing but of knowledge as yet unknown?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as to human intel being limited, why do you assume so?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and while i agree with you that scientists are rational, i believe you misunderstand the purpose of science today. it is not to fight the petty arguments between religion and nonreligion, but to attain a better understanding of the natural world. science having facts that back-up either for or against religion is just a boon.</p>

              <p>well, everyone does need to keep an open mind about religions and other people's beliefs. what is important is to try to have a better understanding of each religion and then comes to his/her own conclusion of the matter.i do have a very dear friend of mine who studies religion and philosophy to a great extent, and she believes in Buddhism. discussions do get awesome though. =)</p>
              <p>and you must admit that religious groups do help others all around the world. though it does make you wonder if they would help anyway regardless of their religious affliation.</p>

              <p>people generally believe in scientists because their discoveries can be backed up and their experiments repeated. religion, however, is based faith and believing that a claim to be true without any evidence whatsoever. hence the criticism toward all religions.</p>

              <p>If u guys read the bible carefully enough , Abraham was supposed to have one son, but instead, he had two. Another from the servant girl. God has warned him, and his lack of faith of his old wife not being able to bear any children. N told Abraham that one son will have the riches of the earth.. while the other... something else.. forgot what was the specific wording.</p>
              <p>So, God told him that for his sins, the generation of both his sons will go thier seperate ways, n there u have it. Fast forward present day.</p>
              <p>BOOM</p>
              <p>Oil rich Muslim nations, vs technological powerful west.</p>
              <p>Anyways, those that dont belive dont believe la. No need try n convince those that wont believe. Its like those that want proof of miracles, when miracles are happening everyday, ever small or big, just not as OOH AAH as back in old testament, come one even with such massive ridiculous miracles happening back in the day.. thier faith still falters. Thats human nature man....  because if one refuses to see the miracles or believe, he just wont see it because he just dont believe. If he dont believe he wont see , wont see further convinces him that it doesnt exist even if it exists.</p>
              <p>If i am wrong and there is no God, i die.. i become part of the earth. Big win for the atheists n other religions.. *clap clap* thats just about it. At least i try to live the life of a true Christian and its no wrong or harm in that.U dont see us coming to torch ur buildings n jihad ur ass right?  <strong>But</strong> if i am right...  lol.. i know where i am going ;p</p>

              <p>i understand your reasoning, which is also thought of before and named Pascal's wager.</p>
              <p>however, i would like to point out 2 flaws.</p>
              <p>1. how do you know that Christianity is the true religion? there are so many out there, what if your choice is wrong? if you chose the wrong one, would the right one send you to hell anyway? then your years of supporting the wrong god is wasted.</p>
              <p>2. if this is why you chose the religion that you are in, even if you are right in choice of god and religion, would god take you into heaven just because you support him due to a bet that he exists? would he not be able to see what your intentions are for choosing him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not saying to go against religion though, just to choose a religion for the right reasons.</p>

              <p>if you believe and engage in a true and active personal relationship and encounter with God, you have gotten what Christianity is all about. Christianity isnt about religion, its about choosing to walk with God into eternity. it isnt about a set of rules. these rules are just there to follow the way God expects us to follow. its like we get to get married, we don't have to get married. going to church, is communion with a body of people that can strengthen and edify your Spirit and to minister to your needs, God saw the importance in that, as well as a channel to be a vessel to minister to the rest of the world. Believe me, everyone has needs as long as we are human.</p>
              <p>go on youtube, search about different video testimonies of encounters of God. there's so many archaic facts that has been dugged out, so many signs and wonders happening day after day. people being raised from the dead almost everyday in the world. the Bible mentioned so many prophesies in the old testament relating to the coming of the Messiah, Jesus and all came true when he was born.</p>
              <p>but why people do not believe?</p>
              <p>Because they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">choose not</span> to. God placed us here for us to choose, sadly Man became to selfcentered to grasp that. atheists and antichrists and best cults, all have been stated in the Bible which was written long before our time. predictions that people become more wicked and more disasters that God allows in is coming to past. what you tell me the Bible says isn't true? if you believe that Bible is made up by people, believe you me everything in this world is written by people. but the Bible is a Book which has so much Truth in it, if you go on and research about it. there are flaws in Man but God is perfect. A book this perfect is definitely God-inspired.</p>
              <p>i chose not to throw verses in the Bible to relate to a non-Christian and people who believe the Bible is just a book made up by people to think about what I've said. come and find a loving and accepting graceful encounter which just sets you free in peace. when you get it, you'll truly know what true freedom is (: i've found it and i'm open to share it (:</p>

              <p>1. how do you know that Christianity is the true religion? there are so many out there, what if your choice is wrong? if you chose the wrong one, would the right one send you to hell anyway? then your years of supporting the wrong god is wasted.</p>

              <p>however, since we are all snooping around the forums looking for something interesting to discuss about, we might as well talk about something, right? and this subforum happens to be called Eternal Hope.... or else this subforum will be quite boring leh. =P</p>

              <p>So did Buddha on his way to enlightenment, Mohammed as he preached through the nations, priests of Brahma as they went through their priestly-stuff. It's not new. It's like drinking Pepsi because of an ad saying Pepsi is better than Coke.</p>
