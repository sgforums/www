              <p>Hi Laurence, this guy's motive is obvious. He wants to stop the discussion. Just ignore him and don't fall into his trap. Treat his posting  as invisible, let him talk to thin air. Anyway, I have nothing more to say about this topic. What I need to say is already said. Merry X'mas and Happy New Year to you guys!</p>

              <p>Christianity to me is like a product, if you need it you may subscribe to it, if you are dissatisfied you are free to leave.</p>
              <p>Then again if many people are dissatisfed with the product they may bring negative word of mouth, this happens not only in religion but also by science. Criticisms are bound to pop out and in this case religion tries to answer it.</p>
              <p>I'm a materialist and I do not believe that spiritual ideas are economically sustainable, when does god ever provide me bread when I truely need it, eventually I had to get it myself, and when does religion alone ever sustainable without economic support (its people)?</p>
              <p>Religion, throughout history has been used as a source of control, preys on fear and greed. There are some lessons to be learn though, it is also a source of collectivism, people taking care of each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I quote this for now:</p>
              <p>"There is no society" Margaret Thatcher</p>
              <p>Religion is only a tool, the people inside it are more salient, this is how I see. You can help yourself or request others to help you, but religion in this case is not dependable.</p>

              <p>There are 6 billion adherents to science and technology, so what gives?</p>
              <p>Besides, about 1.2 billion of these are Roman Catholics, who the Protestants love to deny as being Christians anyway, so what gives?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>the concept of a creator is flawed and full of paradoxes to begin with. one such paradox is this. can god create something he cant lift? if he cant, then he is not omnipotent. if he can, then he is also not omnipotent. second in point is, if there is a god and he is so almighty, then why is the world in such a mess? can he do remedial action like reverting the world to a pure abode, where everyone and everything are equal, there are no suffering and happiness ever after? if he can, and he doesnt do it, then what made him not to do it since he is so almighty. the list goes on and on.</p></div>

              <p>that is the views of the bible, you and your brethrens. I am not here to discuss on the intracacies of god and his choices, besides I dun believe in them, but thats not the point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the point of contention is the paradoxes of this story and the concept of god. there are so many loopholes and flaws in this storyline. go figure that out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by the way, is that god or bible's explanation or your own explanation? pray pls tell.</p>

              <p>Sorry to burst your bubbles but you are using little facts to lure people to your own conclusion</p>
              <p>66 books out of many were chosen by councils of men, the rest discarded and followers of other thoughts were branded heretics and persecuted.

              <p>You said 3 different continents, but you conveniently neglect to say none of these come beyond the boundaries of the Roman empire, which conquered North Africa and West Asia...there, you got it, 3 continents...again, so whats so great about 3 continents? I would be more impressed if someone who has never heard of jesus in Han China or Gupta India write about him independently.</p>
              <p>None of these know each other but christianity has already spread by then, they first heard of jesus before they begin writing the book, and it doesnt help again, that their books were afterwards shortlisted like some Pulitzer Award or Booker Prize</p>
