              <p>After all, how can I believe in a religion that claims life is
                                          an illusion?</p>

              <p>In Buddhism, life is not an illusion but like an illusion, vivid yet ungraspable. There is a big difference between 'life is an illusion' and 'life is LIKE an illusion'. Because if it is truly an illusion or a dream, life will end and some other reality will appear when we wake up or attain enlightenment, but in Buddhism, the world rightly seen is enlightenment.</p>
              <p>We do not deny life, we reject a mistaken view of life, as something static, fixed, separate, graspable. Life is something dynamic, ungraspable, ever changing, without center or circumference. There is no reference point you can point to called 'me'. Life IS everything. When there is no grasping on a false separate 'me', no dividing into a 'me in here' vs 'universe out there', there is no suffering. There is no longer a holding onto a dead image of what 'me' or what 'life' is, no boundaries, no bondage, no suffering.</p>
              <p>Everything is vivid, but ungraspable like a mirage on the horizon. If we investigate, we cannot find a permanent entity called 'me' that truly exists inherently, there is just an everchanging stream of sensate reality that is ungraspable, and nevertheless vivid and clear.</p>

              <p>In Buddhist worldview, gods and deities are still under samsara and are not higher than Buddha. A Buddha has transcended even the highest realms of the devas and they take him as a teacher. A Buddha has the powers to go to any realms (which as explained, he did), and in fact is a deva from the Tushita heaven in his immediate past life, but chose to come to Earth to attain Buddhahood to guide innumerable sentient beings to enlightenment and liberation out of compassion.</p>

              <p>point taken on board, but a valid one nevertheless. thats the problem with creationist, got so many never ending questions on the creator, yet no satisfactory answers obtained.

              <p>No offence but sorry to inform you that this is not true in the case of Christianity. If you do not accept Christ by faith then thats where you are going. Nothing a man can do to go to heaven for all man have sinned and therefore fall short of the glory of God.</p>
              <p>You cannot enter by works but only by grace (i.e. getting what you do not deserve - the free gift of Christ)</p>
