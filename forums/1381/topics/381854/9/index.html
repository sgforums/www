              <p>Well Rooney, you cannot see God. He is so holy that for us in our imperfection to look at him is death. Even Moses was not permitted to see God's face but God revealed his back to him. After that no one could look at Moses' face for some time after.</p>

              <p>From what I know, the reason as to why Christ died on the cross was to free all mankind from the sacrifice of animals, which does not seem to be working as humans, after sacrificing animals each time, will continue to sin again. Thus, God chose to die on the cross instead in order to cover-up for all the sins of man, Which is why if you read on all christian websites, all of them say that no one needs to fear about breaking the ten commandments, as one only needs to believe in Jesus christ- that alone to go to heaven. But I don't think breaking the ten commandments willingly and knowingly is a good idea...</p>

              <p>If you believe in Christ that means you know how much he loves you and you would love him. If you love him, you will try your best (though you fail at times to obey him) therefore you would try to keep the commandments and not break them.</p>
              <p>By the way, Christ only gave two commands which summed them all up.</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I am not an expert at the Bible but from memory here are some hints that the Bible is real.</p>
              <p>1. The timescale on the account of creation can be scientifically explained by Einstein's special theory of relativity which states that there is no absolute time and elapsed time is dependent on the velocity of one reference frame relative to another. As one speeds up, a ground observer will observe a much significant increased period of time in comparison to the one that is moving near light speed.</p>
              <p>Another possibility is that in the beginning, the universe being infintesimally small and dense has a near infinite gravitational field strength. This will warp space time again providing a possible explanation of the timescales in Genesis.</p>
              <p>Google "Special Theory of Relativity" - it makes for a good and interesting read regardless. If you are more involved you can check out "General Theory of Relativity" as well.</p>
              <p>2. The historical periods mentioned in the Bible have all been verified archaelogically. It has also further been proven that a catastrophic flood as mentioned in the Bible did happen - Check out "Was there really a great flood" in How Stuff Works. Also google "Great Flood and Noah's Ark" to read more articles. In addition check out all the other wars and empires mentioned in the Bible and you find that they are all backed by archaelogical evidence.</p>
              <p>3. If you want to go further and read the Bible (Try the NIV study Bible which provides loads of foot notes explaining each verse in the Bible and references any archaelogical findings) in greater detail you will realise that all the prophecies regarding Israel (Jews) have not failed to occur in History. It is clearly mentioned that they will be severely punished becaused of their disobedience to the Lord and this has played out even to modern History (i.e. the Holocaust). Even today anti-Semitism is still very strong in many parts of the world.</p>
              <p>4. Somewhere in Isaiah, mention is given to the "Circle of the World" indicating knowledge that the world was indeed round. This was written approx 600 BC way before Christopher Columbus sailed the world and many still believe in a flat planet.</p>
              <p>5. Everything written in the Old Testament with regards to the prophecies regarding the Christ played out perfectly and coherently in the life of Jesus. The existence and life of Jesus is well documented even by secular historians. Again Google it up for more details.</p>
              <p>6. The resurrection cannot be refuted even by modern day secular scholars. While there is much controversy regarding the face imaged on Jesus's burial cloth (the Shroud of Turin) there is nothing to refute his resurrection. There are no valid claims as to the remains of Christ ever being found. Again Google "Resurrection of Christ Evidence" to read all the theories pointing to its validity.</p>
              <p>7. The apostles who wrote about the Christ all faced persecution and death for their teachings yet they persisted confident in the knowledge of their after life. If they had not seen the risen Christ what then would give them such confidence. Remember they face real world persecution and held firm even in the face of  their executions. Also, Paul being a staunch anti-Christian became one of the apostles overnight. What would drive hime to do so. Remember he was responsible for persecuting a lot of Christians of that time.</p>
              <p>8. There is a DVD called "Exodus Decoded" which explains and proofs all the events mentioned in Exodus (The Ten Plagues and the parting of the Sea) scientifically. This documentary was the result of research of secular scientists.</p>
              <p>9. According to Chaos theory, all things will degrade from an ordered fashion to a chaotic fashion naturally. If there was no creator, we would not see the order we see in the uUniverse today. And statistically, the chance of everything turning out in a random fashion to what it is today without intervention is practically nought. For those who believe in randomness, it is equivalent to leaving a pile of bricks on a site and expecting to see a house come up all by itself without any intervention. Not to say that this is impossible if you look at it from a statistical thernmodynamic point of view but ask yourself "How likely"? Would you bet on it.</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I am not an expert at the Bible but from memory here are some
              hints that the Bible is real.</p>
              <p>1. The timescale on the account of creation can be
              scientifically explained by Einstein's special theory of relativity
              which states that there is no absolute time and elapsed time is
              dependent on the velocity of one reference frame relative to
              another. As one speeds up, a ground observer will observe a much
              significant increased period of time in comparison to the one that
              is moving near light speed.</p>
              <p>Another possibility is that in the beginning, the universe being
              infintesimally small and dense has a near infinite gravitational
              field strength. This will warp space time again providing a
              possible explanation of the timescales in Genesis.</p>
              <p>Google "Special Theory of Relativity" - it makes for a good and
              interesting read regardless. If you are more involved you can check
              out "General Theory of Relativity" as well.</p>
              <p>2. The historical periods mentioned in the Bible have all been
              verified archaelogically. It has also further been proven that a
              catastrophic flood as mentioned in the Bible did happen - Check out
              "Was there really a great flood" in How Stuff Works. Also google
              "Great Flood and Noah's Ark" to read more articles. In addition
              check out all the other wars and empires mentioned in the Bible and
              you find that they are all backed by archaelogical evidence.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>1. regardless of whether days in 1st chapter of Genesis refer to actual 24 hours or millions of years, the time line is still wrong. <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Univers, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;  ">The Genesis 1 creation account conflicts with the order of events that are known to science. In Genesis, the earth is created before light and stars, birds and whales before reptiles and insects, and flowering plants before any animals. The order of events known from science is just the opposite. (<a style="color: #0000bb; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/1.html#1">1:1-2:3</a>) God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day.

Not to mention by the 2nd or 3rd day the time line should already be 24 hours to a day, since that was when God supposed already created the Earth. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. A temporary flood on Earth is possible. A flood lasting 150+ days covering the highest mountains of the highest peaks is bullshit. There isn't enough water on Earth to cover up to the height of Bukit Timah Hill. </p>
              <p>Also, isn't it strange that in Chap 1 he kept saying everything was good, and in Chap 6-7 he said everything was fucked up?</p>
              <p>Noah sent out a dove to see if the waters have gone down. The dove returned with an olive branch. Wouldn't all the olive trees be dead being under water for 150+ days?</p>
              <p>And... I remember my grandmum telling me that during every eclipse, one has to pick up pots and pans and bang away as loud as possible to scare away the dog of Er Lang Shen, who was eating the moon.

              <p>3. If you want to go further and read the Bible (Try the NIV
              study Bible which provides loads of foot notes explaining each
              verse in the Bible and references any archaelogical
              findings) in greater detail you will realise that all the
              prophecies regarding Israel (Jews) have not failed to occur in
              History. It is clearly mentioned that they will be severely
              punished becaused of their disobedience to the Lord and this has
              played out even to modern History (i.e. the Holocaust). Even today
              anti-Semitism is still very strong in many parts of the world.</p>
              <p>4. Somewhere in Isaiah, mention is given to the "Circle of the
              World" indicating knowledge that the world was indeed round. This
              was written approx 600 BC way before Christopher Columbus sailed
              the world and many still believe in a flat planet.</p>
              <p>5. Everything written in the Old Testament with regards to the
              prophecies regarding the Christ played out perfectly and coherently
              in the life of Jesus. The existence and life of Jesus is well
              documented even by secular historians. Again Google it up for more
              details.</p>
              <p>6. The resurrection cannot be refuted even by modern day secular
              scholars. While there is much controversy regarding the face imaged
              on Jesus's burial cloth (the Shroud of Turin) there is nothing to
              refute his resurrection. There are no valid claims as to the
              remains of Christ ever being found. Again Google "Resurrection of
              Christ Evidence" to read all the theories pointing to its
              validity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>3. No idea of this one, since I haven't quite finished reading the bible yet. Don't suppose you could point me a link? =P</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. the Bible has said in separate occasions that the Earth is flat and/or round. Still doesn't explain the existence of God. Anyway, the shape of the earth may already have been known in Isaiah's time. Ancient astronomers could determine that the earth was round by observing its circular shadow move across the moon during lunar eclipses. There is some suggestion that the Egyptians knew of the earth's spherical size and shape around 2550 B.C. (more than a thousand years before Moses). The Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who was born in 532 B.C., defended the spherical theory on the basis of observations he had made of the shape of the sun and moon. If this information was known by educated Greeks and Egyptians during biblical times, its use by Isaiah is nothing special.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Not quite. There must be a reason why Judaism still exists. And the size of Christianity and Islam today is not an indication that Jesus must be the Messiah due to the number of people following the ideas, as the large number today is more of conquests the respective missionaries did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. The resurrection of Jesus is unknown, as if someone were to have stolen his body, it is also unlikely for them to mark his final resting place, hence giving your conclusion of the unfound remains of JC. And Christianity also isn't the only religion that has some dude resurrecting. For example: </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">Horus c. 3000 BCE<br>Osiris c. 3000 BCE<br>Attis of Phrygia c.1400 BCE<br>Krishna c. 1400 BCE (possibly as early as 5771 BCE)<br>Mithra of Persia c. 600 BCE<br>Dionysus c. 186 BCE</span></p>

              <p>8. I think I saw a similar one of Discovery channel, where winds blew the waters in the Red Sea away to reveal dry land, and the ten plagues being explained by this:</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.3em; padding: 0px;">In 1999 an environmental catastrophe happened in the town of New Burn, North Carolina. The residents woke up to find the waters of their river - the Neuse - had turned red. More than a billion fish died. People working near the river found that they were covered in sores.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.3em; padding: 0px;">The cause of this was found to be pollution. The pollution had come from a pig farm further up the river. Millions of gallons of pig-waste had found its way into the river, causing a genetic mutation in a marine micro-organism called pfisteria; turning it from harmless into lethal. The river had been poisoned.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.3em; padding: 0px;">John Marr, an epidemiologist specialising in environmental disasters, believes pollution in ancient Egypt could have caused the first six plagues. Pfisteria, or something like it, caused the fish to die, thus turning the river red; the pollution would have driven the frogs onto the land, on land the frogs would die, causing an explosion of flies and lice. The flies could then have transmitted viral diseases to livestock, killing them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.3em; padding: 0px;">And on May 17th 1980, in the North West of America, Mount St Helens volcano erupted, killing everything within 20 miles. Ash columns were ejected into the atmosphere, circling the globe within two weeks and causing complete darkness over a radius of 100 miles.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.3em; padding: 0px;">Could a natural phenomenon on this scale have triggered the plagues?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.3em; padding: 0px;">John Marr, epidemiologist, thinks that fall-out of volcanic ash could have produced a toxic bloom of algae in the River Nile; thus setting off a chain of events similar to those produced by pfisteria.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.3em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p>The thing is, doesn't this just show that no divine intervention is required for these events to occur? And if these events do signify the presence of a god, who was God trying to kill off this time in the above 2 cases?</p>

              <p>1. If you read 1:1 -2 carefully it does not say that God created the Earth before anything else. It says "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . Now the earth was formless and empty. The heavens in this case would refer to the Universe.

              <p>This is also mentioned by Fortmax777 at point 9. I can't explain it very well, but Richard Dawkins did in his book "The God Delusion". Can't actually remember what it says, but creating a celestial body is different from getting a ton of airplane parts and expected a Boeing 747. The difference is the least-action principle, as planetoid spherical bodies are that of lowest energy, while the creation of a Rolex is that of higher energy. </p>
              <p>I'll use the big bang in this example, seeing how the big bang is accepted in both creationists and... naturalists? Non-creationists? Err... never mind. </p>
              <p>The big bang occurred. Mass is produced. Due to gravity produced by the mass, regardless of how insignificant the gravity produced by each piece is, still pulls them together. This continues until a planet is formed. Some don't make it, producing star dust and asteroid belts. Some are forced together too hard, producing stars. Some come together but miss, creating orbits. </p>
              <p>As to what caused the big bang, not too sure. It may be an intelligent being, it may be a natural phenomenon. Going to take General Relativity in a few years, so I'll come back and post my article then on my assumptions. However, an intelligent being creating a universe is also not an indication of a Christian God, as it may as likely be Altas or Pang Gu. </p>

              <p>1. If you read 1:1 -2 carefully it does not say that God created
              the Earth before anything else. It says "In the beginning God
              created the heavens and the earth . Now the earth was formless and
              empty. The heavens in this case would refer to the Universe. I
              think the full explanantion is too long to type here. try the
              following link for a view on the matter.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">7. The apostles who wrote about the Christ all faced persecution and death for their teachings yet they persisted confident in the knowledge of their after life. If they had not seen the risen Christ what then would give them such confidence. Remember they face real world persecution and held firm even in the face of  their executions. Also, Paul being a staunch anti-Christian became one of the apostles overnight. What would drive hime to do so. Remember he was responsible for persecuting a lot of Christians of that time.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Persistence in spreading the faith is no indication of the truthfulness of the risen Christ. Mohammed has never seen the risen Christ, yet Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism have also existed after such a long time, which, as you may agree, is no indication that their teachings are true either. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I do however, have no idea what Paul/Saul was thinking at that time. But then again, at the time of Mohammed, the city we know as Mecca wanted to kill Mohammed. Yet...? And this is a city as compared to one person, does that mean the teachings of Islam are right?</p>
