              <h1><a href="http://uqconnect.net/slsoc/bsq/budchr0.htm#cont">http://uqconnect.net/slsoc/bsq/budchr0.htm#cont</a><br></h1>
              <h1>Chapter 2:<br>Christian Arguments<br>for God's Existence</h1>
              <p><br> Christians claim that there is an all-knowing, all-loving God who
              created and who controls the universe. Several arguments are used 
              to prove this idea. We will examine each of these arguments and 
              give the Buddhist objections to them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>The Authority of the Bible</h3>
              <p>When asked to prove God's existence, the Christian will often open the 
              Bible and say "The
              Bible says God exists, so he must." The problem is that if we ask a 
              Hindu, a Muslim, a
              Sikh or a Jew the same question they too will point to their respective 
              holy books as proof
              of the existence of their Gods. Why should we believe the Bible but not 
              the holy books of
              all the other religions? Using the Bible to prove God's existence is 
              only valid if we already
              accept that it alone contains God's words. However, we have no evidence 
              that this is so. In
              fact, as we will demonstrate later, there is strong evidence that the 
              Bible is a highly
              unreliable document.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>The Existence of the Universe</h3>
              <p>In their attempts to prove God's existence, Christians will sometimes 
              say "The universe
              didn't just happen, someone must have made it and therefore there must 
              be a creator God."
              There is a major flaw in this argument. When it starts to rain ~e do not
               ask "Who is
              making it rain?" because we know that rain is caused not by someone but 
              by something -
              natural phenomena like heat, evaporation, precipitation, etc. When we 
              see smooth stones in
              a river, we do not ask "Who polished those stones?" because we know that
               the smooth
              surface of the stones was caused not by someone but by something - 
              natural causes like
              the abrasive action of water and sand.</p>
              <p>All of these things have a cause (or causes) but this need not be a 
              being. It is the same
              with the universe - it was not brought into being by a God but by 
              natural phenomena like
              nuclear fission, gravity, inertia, etc. However, even if we believe that
               a divine being is
              needed to explain how the universe came into existence, what proof is 
              there that it was the
              Christian God? Perhaps it was created by the Hindu God, the God of Islam
               or one of the
              gods worshipped by tribal religions. After all most religions, not only 
              Christianity, claim
              that their God or gods created the universe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>The Argument from Design</h3>
              <p>In response to the above refutation, the Christian will maintain that 
              the universe does not
              merely exist but its existence shows perfect design. There is, a 
              Christian might say, an
              order and balance which point to its having been designed by a higher 
              intelligence, and
              that this higher intelligence is God. But as before, there are some 
              problems with this
              argument.</p>
              <p>Firstly, how does the Christian know that it was his God who is behind 
              creation? Perhaps
              it was the gods of non-Christian religions who designed and created the 
              universe.</p>
              <p>Secondly, how does the Christian know that only one God designed 
              everything? In fact, as
              the universe is so intricate and complex we could expect it to need the 
              intelligence of
              several, perhaps dozens, of gods to design it. So if anything the 
              argument from design
              proves that there are many gods, not one as Christians claim.</p>
              <p>Next, we would have to ask, is the universe perfectly designed? We must 
              ask this because
              if a perfect God designed and created the universe, then that universe 
              should be perfect.
              Let us first look at inanimate phenomena to see whether they show 
              perfect design. Rain
              gives us pure water to drink but sometimes it rains too much and people 
              lose their lives,
              their homes and their means of livelihood in floods. At other times it 
              doesn't rain at all
              and millions die in drought and famine. Is this perfect design? The 
              mountains give us joy
              as we see them reaching up into the sky. But landslides ~nd volcanic 
              eruptions have for
              centuries caused havoc and death. Is this perfect design? The gentle 
              breezes cool us but
              storms and tornadoes repeatedly cause death and destruction. Is this 
              perfect design? These
              and other natural calamities prove that inanimate phenomena do not 
              exhibit perfect design
              and therefore that they were not created by a perfect God.</p>
              <p>Now let us look at animate phenomena to see whether they reveal perfect 
              design. At a
              superficial glance, nature seems to be beautiful and harmonious; all 
              creatures are provided
              for and each has its task to perform. However, as any biologist will 
              confirm, nature is
              utterly ruthless. To live, each creature has to feed on other creatures 
              and struggle to avoid
              being eaten by other creatures. In nature, there is no time for pity, 
              love or mercy. If a
              loving God designed everything, why did such a cruel design result? The 
              animal kingdom
              is not only imperfect in the ethical sense, it is also imperfect in that
               it often goes wrong.
              Every year ~lions of babies are born with physical or mental 
              disabilities, or are stillborn or
              die soon after birth. Why would a perfect creator God design such 
              terrible things?</p>
              <p>So if there is design in the universe, much of it is faulty and cruel. 
              This would seem to
              indicate that the universe was not created by a perfect all-loving God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>The First Cause Argument</h3>
              <p>Christians will sometimes say that everything has a cause, that there 
              must be a first cause,
              and that God is the first cause. This old argument contains its own 
              refutation, for if
              everything has a first cause then the first cause must also have a 
              cause.</p>
              <p>There is another problem with the first cause argument. Logically there 
              is no good reason
              to assume that everything had a single first cause. Perhaps six, ten or 
              three hundred causes
              occurring simultaneously caused everything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Miracles</h3>
              <p>Christians claim that miracles are sometimes performed in God's name and
               that the fact
              that this happens proves that God exists. This is an appealing argument 
              until it is looked at
              a little more closely.</p>
              <p>While Christians are quick to claim that because of their prayers the 
              blind could see, the
              deaf could hear and crooked limbs were straightened, they are very slow 
              in producing
              evidence to back up their claims. In fact, some Christians are so 
              anxious to prove that
              miracles have occurred at their prayer meetings that the truth often 
              gets lost in a flood of
              wild claims, extravagant boasts, and sometimes even conscious lies.</p>
              <p>It is true that things which are unusual and difficult to explain do 
              sometimes happen
              during religious events - but not just for Christians. Hindus, Muslims, 
              Taoists, etc. all
              claim that their God or gods sometimes perform miracles. Christianity 
              certainly does not
              have a monopoly on miracles. So, if miracles performed in God's name 
              prove the
              existence of the Christian God, then miracles performed in the name of 
              numerous other
              gods must likewise prove that they too exist.</p>
              <p>Christians may try to overcome this fact by claiming that, when miracles
               occur in other
              religions, they are done through the power of the Devil. Perhaps the 
              best way to counter
              this claim is to quote the Bible. When Jesus healed the sick, his 
              enemies accused him of
              doing this through the power of the Devil. He answered that healing the 
              sick results in
              good and if the Devil went around doing good he would destroy himself 
              (Mk 3:22-26).
              Therefore the same could be said for the miracles performed by Hindus, 
              Jews or Sikhs. If
              these miracles result in good, how can they be the work of the Devil?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>The Argument for God's Necessity</h3>
              <p>Christians will often claim that only by believing in God will people 
              have the strength to
              deal with life's problems, and therefore that belief in God is 
              necessary. This claim is
              apparently supported by numerous books written by Christians who have 
              endured and
              overcome various crises through the power of God. Some of these books 
              make highly
              inspiring reading, so the claim that one can cope with problems only 
              with God's help
              sounds rather convincing - until we look a little  more deeply.</p>
              <p>If this claim is true, we would expect most of the non-Christian people 
              of the world to
              lead lives of emotional distress, confusion and hopelessness while most 
              Christians through
              their faith in God would be able to unfailingly deal with their problems
               and to never need
              to seek help from counsellors or psychiatrists. It is clear, however, 
              that people from
              non-Christian religions and even those with no religion are just as 
              capable of dealing with
              life's crises as Christians are sometimes even better. It is also 
              sometimes the case that
              people who are devout Christians lose their faith in God after being 
              confronted with
              serious personal problems. Consequently, the claim that belief in God is
               necessary to cope
              with and overcome problems is baseless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>The  "Try and Disprove" Argument</h3>
              <p>When Christians find they cannot prove God's existence with doubtful 
              facts or logic, they
              may switch tactics and say "Perhaps it can't be proved that God exists, 
              but neither can you
              disprove it". This of course is quite true. You cannot prove that God 
              doesn't exist - but
              neither can you prove that the gods of Taoism, Hinduism and a dozen 
              other religions do
              not exist. In other words, despite all the hyperbole, the extravagant 
              claims and the
              confident proclamations, there is no more evidence for the existence of 
              the Christian God
              than there is for the gods worshipped in other religions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>The Testimony</h3>
              <p>After everything else has failed, the Christian may finally try to 
              convince us that God
              exists by appealing to the emotions. Such a person will say, perhaps 
              quite truthfully, "I
              used to be unhappy and discontented but after giving myself to God I am 
              happy and at
              peace with myself." Such testimonies can be deeply moving, but what do 
              they prove?
              There are millions of people whose lives became equally happy and 
              meaningful after they
              embraced Buddhism, Hinduism or Islam. Likewise, there are no doubt many 
              people whose
              lives have not changed for the better after they became Christians - the
               same weaknesses
              and problems sometimes remain. So this argument, like all the others, 
              does not prove the
              existence of the Christian God.</p>

              <p>Are u sure about it? I had heard of miracles from other religions too, I dare to say u did not find out about them from other religions and just assumed it. It would be better for u to find out more about other religions and study them before u make these types of statements.</p>
              <p>Maybe u can find out from doctors that there are many miracles happening through the support of their loved and family too. Are u going to say they are all christians?</p>
              <p>"Everything mentioned in the bible is and has come true."</p>
              <p>Have u read and find out about other religions? Is Bible the only " is and has come true"?</p>
              <p>I do believe Christainity is a real religion, but what u had stated is simply baised and showed that u make statements with no knowledge of other religions.</p>

              <p>hi. Jesus Christ was crucified on Good Friday. He rose from the grave on Easter Sunday. Good Friday is not celebrated, its supposed to be solemn. Easter Sunday is celebrated with parties and bunnies.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>as a christian here, i feel so sorry over what martial said. Well, i believe in my god because the bible really backs it up. Many archeological findings, though not made public, actually confirms the bible's words. These findings, though info can be found on the internet, were not on the news because it would cause quite a stir as it effects the theory of evolution and common scientific aspects. Giants mentioned in the bible have been found mummified in the dessert. the dimensions of those bodies match those given in the bible. Not only that, the bible also supports many facts of the universe (roundness of the earth) and a near infinite universe. I am not lying, as lying would not help but give a bad name. Also, if any of you here realised, jews,muslims, and christians worship the same God. Islam and christ came out after Jesus. But although I respect my own religion, we also need to respect buddhists and hindus. Buddha deserves respect for his words and teachings , which is very inspiring also.Another thing supporting the the bible is its code and phrophecy. Many of the prophecies have actually come true, and the birth place of jesus christ was actually even pin pointed accurately a few hundred years in advance before it happened. The people who wrote the bible were scattered across 3 continents and they do not know each other. neither do they know the books they wrote will be combined into one , and even fit together as one "story".  All in all, just respect each other.</p></div>

              <p>the thing about god religion is that, their teachings centred on god being the creator of the universe and all things. salvation is thru him only. the book or bible has written prophesies, so the religion is sort of a revelation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the cons of this teaching is that you cant change your fate, but to accept your fate. it will reveal to you, but cant teach or tell you how to change it. example if it revealed that on a certain date in future, the meteor will crash onto earth, but didnt tell you how to change the course or tell you what action to take to prevent the meteor from slamming onto earth. end result, you have to accept god's fate for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so what if the prophesies are true. you cant do anything about it or avoid an impending diaster cos its god's fate or idea. you just have to accept and embrace it. when you die, you will go to his heaven and enjoy eternal bliss.</p>

              <p>Religious people always pray that someone who is

               When it is finally cured, they claimed god's power.</p>
              <p>Why don't they pray that a follow church goer, who has his
              arm/leg amputated, to have a new limb growth ?</p>

              <p>Why is the limb amputated? Run over by car, blown off by landmine or caused by frostbite while trying to conquer Mt Everest?</p>
              <p>Don't blame the maker for the cause.</p>
              <p>If man longs for amputated limbs to regrow, there's the salamander, the newt and the starfish to learn from.</p>
              <p>By then, someone might ask why God didn't heal (reassemble) the body parts and bring Liu Hongmei back to life.</p>
              <p>God's plan for salvation is for the man's spirit to return to Him. The body becomes fertilizer when the man dies. It doesn't matter  that I die with a broken body and you die with a pretty face.</p>
              <p>Most tragedies can be prevented if everyone has love for humanity. Human beings have not express enough love for humanity.</p>
              <p>I  find the doctrine of sin makes sense.</p>

              <p>1. So far, no one can explain origins of life because it's God creation. Are you sure that "bible has written prophesies, so the
              religion is sort of a revelation" and what do you mean by that?</p>
              <p>2. God does not teach about fate.....He teaches about Love. How do you change your "fate" and what are you doing to "to change the course" and "what action to take to prevent the
              meteor from slamming onto earth" ??</p>
              <p>3. Which "prophesies" are true and which are untrue? And how do you avoid diaster?</p>
              <p>Mind sharing with us?</p>
