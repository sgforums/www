I think free will as in God wants us to love him on our own accord and not he "program" us to follow him. He wants u to go to heaven and live in eternal harmony like what u said. If u know this, why do u still want to go hell and suffer and eternity?<br><br>2. 2nd para I think not a very good illustration. U can always reject the man who is most likely a looney.</div>

Addressing this problem requires understanding the relation between freedom and causation, and determining whether or not the laws of nature are causally deterministic. The various philosophical positions taken differ on whether all events are determined or notÂ—determinism versus indeterminismÂ—and also on whether freedom can coexist with determinism or notÂ—compatibilism versus incompatibilism. So, for instance, hard determinists argue that the universe is deterministic, and that this makes free will impossible.<br><br>The principle of free will has religious, ethical, and scientific implications. For example, in the religious realm, free will may imply that an omnipotent divinity does not assert its power over individual will and choices. In ethics, it may imply that individuals can be held morally accountable for their actions. In the scientific realm, it may imply that the actions of the body, including the brain and the mind, are not wholly determined by physical causality. <strong>The question of free will has been a central issue since the beginning of philosophical thought</strong>.<br><br>I am sure a person of your presuppose intellect is aware that you can wiki out an answer.... of course, right now you'd say that you want views of Christians... yet you are also aware that they are myriads of answers and opinions of this question. What follows will be an attempt to discredit the less-than-acceptable or less-than-perfect answers. So therein, what's the point!<br></div>

The Devil, the Beast, and the False Prophet.  The rest of the normal people whose only mistake is that they reject God will have the punishment of not being able to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  This is already a very great punishment and will cause them to weep and dispair with regret at their wrong decision.  God does not have to punish them further by "torturing" them in  hell.  The throwing into the lake of fire mentioned in the bible is only to erase their misery as God is merciful and doesn't want them to suffer.  In fact most of them will praise God's justice before jump into the fire by themselves.<br><br>Of course there are a few class of criminals that will be tortured(although not for eternity), but you have to read the bible yourself to find out.<br><br></div>
