              <p>Do you believe that people may have sixth sense or psychic ability?</p>
              <p>And how do you view this as a Christian?</p>
              <p>Well I have my own theory on the so called psychic ability in that they are not to be considered ability at all. I actually do not believe that people have a sixth sense. What appear as the sixth sense or psychic ability is in my personal opinion the work of spirits.</p>
              <p>So in a way saints or holy men may appear to have some form of psychic ability as in other ordinary 'psychic' people. The difference is that holy men are in contact with God and the holy ghost while others are not.</p>

              <p>You think psychic ability is the same as miracle?</p>
              <p>Why? <strong>if you believe there is a sixth sense what would they be manifested in?</strong></p>
              <p>Seeing ghosts [everywhere] could be a sixth sense. Invoking an earthquake in an instant [with a prayer request] is obviously not a sixth sense. That is a miracle. Or could it be a sixth sense to you? A massive telekinetic at work if you will? Constructive shoot please!</p>
              <p>The thing that intrigued me is that I was told more than once that when a certain people had the ability to see ghosts but didn't want to keep seeing them they could ask the pastor to pray for them for God to get rid of their 'ability'. It works in an instant. They would no longer be seeing ghosts. <strong>Do you think sixth sense is spiritual in nature? Or does it have something to do with the brain? or both?</strong></p>
              <p>Please keep the discussion constructive. Don't mutter something useless or incomplete. And don't troll either.</p>

              <p>y ask pastor to pray for you when it concerns you? ghosts are nothing but demons in disguise is it not? the so called "ability" is also nothing but demons attack on the person in that they keep appearing to the victim to make them believe in the "supernatural" lies. in this sense, 6th sense is spiritual in nature.</p>
