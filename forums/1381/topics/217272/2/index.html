            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from wikipedia:<br><br>Arutz Sheva (Channel Seven) is a <strong>right wing </strong>Israeli online media network, which identifies with Religious Zionism. It offers online news in English, Hebrew, French and Russian in three ways: written, internet radio, and internet television. The Israeli government <strong>never granted it a license </strong>to broadcast, prompting charges of government discrimination against the right-wing, religious public.<br><br>The main broadcasters on the station are Yishai Fleisher, his wife Malkah Fleisher, Tamar Yonah, Alex Traiman, and <strong>renowned anti-missionary Rabbi Tovia Singer </strong>known as the "Chief Rabbi of Newstalk Radio".<br><br>Taken from Your Arms to Israel:<br><br>Rabbi Moshe writes...<br><br>May I suggest to you, my precious brother, that if you agree to meet with someone like Mr. Singer, you should take a well-versed Messianic rabbi or apologist along with you. Then you will not fall away from the faith at the hands of those whose feigned words are making merchandise of your very soul (Second Peter 2:1-3), trying their hardest to get you to deny the very Elohim who bought you with His own precious blood. DonÂ’t forget! Everyone like yourself who he can successfully "deprogram", just increases the donations he can bring into his organization. Those are his true motives. Scripture backs this up!<br><br><strong>Mr. Singer has openly admitted to being paid very well to "deprogram" sincere men and women</strong> like yourself, who are not interested in critical theological sideshows, but rather simply need the assurance of His acceptance, love and forgiveness. You have and always will have ElohimÂ’s love, acceptance forgiveness, if you continue to abide in the Vine of all true life and in His Word.<br><br>To Icemoon:<br><br>Mr. Singer idealogy does not represent the views of mainstream Judaism, therefore please change the topic's title as this may be offensive to Jews.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well according to wikipedia, tis is wat they say about satan<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the Tanakh, the holy hebrew bible, ha-satan (=the satan) is an angel whom God uses to test man for various reasons usually dealing with his level of piety. </span><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan</a><br><br>So satan seems to be an angel tat specially went around "testing" and "give suffering" to people so god can satisfy his curiosity. In tat sense god is indeed "satan".<br><br>However on your issue about satan being created by god and never rebel against god seems to be true from the jewish prospective.</div>
