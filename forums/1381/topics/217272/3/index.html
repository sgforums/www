A bible is a collection of books. Scripture is basically any book that is divinely inspired.<br><br>From what I understand, the purpose of suffering is not to satisfy anyone's ego. There is a hint of the purpose in the article - "This is the Almighty's divine sovereign plan for creation: It is through man's personal decision to turn away from evil and choose good that virtue can be attained."<br><br>I think the reason why everyone is so confused (including you) is because we assume that suffering is bad. Actually suffering need not be bad. I can give you one example - practising chin up until your arms become jelly. In fact, if you want to excel in anything, you have to suffer.<br><br>Of course la .. there are many levels of suffering. What I listed is quite trivial, you might say. I agree.

The things tat will make "suffer" good is yourself willingly "suffering" to improve yourself such as exercising to gain tat muscle u want. However the "suffer" tat satan inflict and the whole problem we r talking is suffering tat is inflicted. No one volunteer for tis kind of act of god but they just inflict it out for no-one-know wat reason. Furthermore the magnitude of "suffering" when u volunteeringly commit is many times lower and it has a "reward". Suffering inflicted on u is many times more devastating as well as having perhaps, lifetime punishment at the end instead of reward.</div>
