And since, we Christians  believe in the Book.......we do not entertain the thought that antichrist will come from our ranks.<br><br>the two words are actually different as used originally.<br><br>many of our able expositors [of the Book] in the past  believe that he will come from the city sitting on seven hills in Italy.<br><br>But of course, this is not definitive and conclusive.</div>

No he will not be one who will openly speak and go against Christ our Lord. I'm focusing more on definiton b.<br><br>But he will be someone who is against  our Lord in a sense  that he consciously makes himself the Christ when in fact he knows he is not. Much like a man who pretends to be a father of a particular child......no he does not go against the father of the child violently and virulently but by pretending to be the father of the child he in a way goes against the real father.<br><br>And so about your statement, i think he will not be one who pretends to be a devout Christian. Because "Christian" means a follower of Christ. He does not pretend to be a follower of Christ. No. He claims that he is Christ, the one who should be followed.<br><br></div>
