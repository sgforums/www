The thing is, does worrying about apocalypse serve you in anyway? Arent you better of doing somethingelse more fruitful instead of hiding somewhere and cowering in fear consantly worrying about the end of the world? Are you at peace?<br><br>In the 1980s people say the world was going to end in the millenium. The world didnt end. The same people came up with more excuses and reasons to justify their cause and say that it might happen in the future. Do you think so? Like I said, biblical end times revelations of apocalypse expired a long time ago, the world will never end. The world has evolved, and humans, too, should also evolve together with the world. </div></blockquote>Hello there my friend  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I wonder why you said that biblical end times in revelations  has expired a long time ago? why, has <strong>THE BIBLE</strong> set a date on the fulfillment of those prophecies for you to say so?<br><br>I apologize in behalf of those misled Christians [if indeed there are true Christians who set a date]  who have somehow led you to believe that the world will end when 2000 comes.<br><br>The true teaching of the Bible however, my friend, is that no one will ever know of the day or the hour.  Christ the Lord's coming [the first stage or the Rapure] is taught in the Bible as imminent, could happen any moment.<br><br>You will never read a date set by the Bible from Genesis to REvelation of when that time comes.<br><br>I hope that clarifies the matter.</div>

They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.

Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.<br>Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position.

We pre-trib deny deny this based on exegisis of the Scriptures. Yes, angels will come together with all His previously raptured saints. but this verse here speaks about saved saints. Paul makes it clear if he talks about angels coming together with the Lord:<br><br>"2Th 1:7 and to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>with His mighty angels</strong></span>."<br><br>rapture verse:<br><br>"1 Th 4:17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord."<br><br>Some godly Christians deny the Rapture saying its not in the Bible. Actually when they say this they are not denying the Rapture per se. What they are saying is that there is no PRE-TRIBULATIONAL RAPTURE.<br><br>Rapture means being caught up. To deny the Rapture is to say that Paul is wrong when he said:<br><br>"1 Th 4:17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>caught up</strong></span> together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord."<br><br>the issue is not whether the Bible teaches Rapture doctrine or not, No, for the Bible sets forth clearly this doctrine. The issue is WHEN will 1 Thessalonians 4:17 take place.<br><br>I personally believe our Lord will come to take His Church to Himself BEFORE the Tribulation period. At the second coming, He will judge all the nations.<br><br>who will be included in the Rapture? Those who have repented of their sins and trusted in Christ's saving work alone for salvation.</div>
