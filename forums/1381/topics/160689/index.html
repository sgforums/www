Please pray for my health. I'm experiencing internal bleeding, bleeding spot located at lower end of small intestine due to a growth of white patches which had corroded into my intestine walls and thus the bleeding. I requires regular blood transfusion of 2 - 3 pints (300 - 450ml/pint) for every 10 to 14 days. The doctor is going to operate on me early next year to remove my lower end of my small intestine and rectify the problem. However, I still proclaim the promises of God on His healing.<br><br>I'm also going for a mission trip from 2nd to 7th Dec to Rangsit in Thailand. Please pray for journey mercies and protection against any harms. Pray for the angels to encamp around us and guard us. We are interacting with the villager as well as to paint one of the Sanctuary's of the church. We have some problem in securing economical air-tickets. Please pray that we can secure the air-tickets soon with a budget of $250.<br><br>On a side note, I'm finding people who could provide details on where to secure air tickets of $250 for 40 person. I'm also selling donated items and my own items to raise funds for my friends who are unable to pay for the trip due to financial restrains. If I can sell some stuffs, hope someone can let me know.<br><br>Thanks and God Bless !</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've just came back from my check-up. Went earlier because I'm experiencing aches around my waist and vomited this morning once. Doctor prescribed some pain-killers for me. If I still doesn't feel well and vomits, I'll require admission for observation, which I dreaded due to fear of hospitalisation from the long period of stay. Please pray for me that the pain isn't caused by an infection and that the pain will leave my body in the name of Jesus. Thanks and God Bless !</div>
