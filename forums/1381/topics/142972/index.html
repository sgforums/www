And why..???<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>New Potter Book Breaks Sales Records By HILLEL ITALIE, AP National Writer<br>Sun Jul 17, 9:18 PM ET<br><br>The new Harry Potter book sold an astonishing 6.9 million copies in its first 24 hours, smashing the record held by the previous Potter release. "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" averaged better than 250,000 sales per hour, more than the vast majority of books sell in a lifetime.<br><br>"This is a cause for celebration, not just for Scholastic, but for book lovers everywhere," said Lisa Holton, president of Scholastic Children's Books, Rowling's U.S. publisher.<br><br>Sales for the sixth installment of J.K. Rowling's fantasy series easily outpaced those for Potter V, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," which came out in 2003 and sold 5 million copies in the first 24 hours. Acknowledging that some stores quickly ran out of books two years ago, Scholastic has already increased the print run for "Half-Blood Prince" from 10.8 million copies to 13.5 million.<br><br>The Scholastic numbers are for the United States only. Sales figures from Britain are expected Monday.<br><br>Anticipated from the moment fans finished Potter V, the new book has been available virtually everywhere, from price clubs and supermarkets to the Scholastic Web site. Holton said Sunday that a big factor in the new sales record was a six-fold increase in the number of Potter bookstore parties, from 800 to 5,000, with both superstores and independent retailers dramatically increasing their participation.<br><br>Even allowing for deep discounts on the $29.99 release, "Half-Blood Prince" still easily generated more than $100 million in revenue. It's not only the richest opening in publishing history, but tops the combined estimated take for the weekend's top two movies, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and "The Wedding Crashers."<br><br>"When a book beats out movies, we're in great shape," Holton said.<br><br>Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations, said he did not believe that Potter pulled kids away from "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," which starred Johnny Depp as the reclusive candy king Willy Wonka.<br><br>"With a $55 million opening, it's hard to say anything had a negative affect on the movie's performance," Dergarabedian said Sunday. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was the biggest debut ever for Depp, topping the $46.6 million opening weekend of his 2003 hit "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."<br><br>Meanwhile, Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. estimated 1.3 million U.S. sales for the book in its first 48 hours, around 400,000 higher than for the first 48 hours of Potter V. Rival superstore chain Borders Group Inc. reported a record 850,000 Potter sales worldwide in the first day, 100,000 greater than for the debut of "Order of the Phoenix."<br><br>Although the book only went on sale midnight Saturday, some have already decided to pass their copies on to others. Used editions, for as little as $15.94, were available through eBay, Amazon.com and Alibris.com, which has been offering $5, plus postage, for used copies.<br><br>Unlike most blockbusters, "Harry and the Half-Blood Prince" is also a hit with critics, getting raves from The New York Times, the Seattle Times, The Associated Press and others. Many found it Rowling's deepest, most accomplished work, with a tragic conclusion that left even reviewers in tears.<br><br>A dissenting opinion came from the San Francisco Chronicle, where David Kipen observed of the 600-plus page novel: "A major character dies by the end of the latest Harry Potter book; readers who bore easily may feel a bit done in themselves.<br><br>"It's not that `Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' is dull, exactly. ... No, the main problem is that J.K. Rowling has now written six of these bricks. Even if they were getting better, they're certainly not getting any fresher."<br></div>

And why..???<br></div></blockquote>Of course!!!! Read all they want!!!<br><br>One of the most popular verses used by detractors of the "sorcery" genre is<br>Deut 18:10 - There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. I have seen this verse quoting so many times when pastors and preachers speak against Harry Potter and Pokemon etc. It is so strange that the verb in this verse is "Useth" or "Practice" in some versions.<br><br>How in the world did "Practice" become "Read". Reading about something does not make one a practioner, otherwise, I am now already a super spy or a hired assassin, based on the genre of books I read.<br><br>If a parent who fails to communication with his children and understand what is going on in the child's mind, regardless of the parent's reservation over such genre, the parent would have failed to bring up the child properly. It has always been my goal to educate my boys to be discerning in whatever that goes on outside. They have to think intelligently and analyse appropriately. There will be some children who will never be able to split reality from fantasy, and these are the ones the adults will need to watch out for. The issue herein, is not witchcraft or sorcery, but it is upbringing. If the child fails to have self-control, it does not matter whether it is Harry Potter or ESPN sports, obsession is obsession. Obsession is not witchcraft and has to be dealt with in another manner.</div>

She is into all sorts of ethnic music, from Mesopotamia to Mohicans, from Russian to Japanese enka-style.... regular at Gramophone Records....<br><br>I have seen too many Christians "speaking out against" all kinds of "abominations".... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Speaking with a certain level of ignorance, music is made up of 7 notes and compounded with different octaves and different musical instruments (traditional to electronic) and beat. It depends on how this mix is thrown together and the resulting concoction will fall into the many genres available at any good music store. Styles of music is to me like flavour of the month at Haagen Daz... it depends on who likes it.<br><br>I have heard that some music is "back-masked" and there are many satanic bands around. A fine example is "Hotel California", who would you believe? The band members who explained the lyrics (in their CD jacket) or a preacher who splits the lyrics and look for meanings that may not be there in the first place. Or for that matter, a preacher who plays a poorly produced supposed back-masked tape that sounded vaguely like "s-s-s-s----tan" and goes "THERE, SATAN IS WORSHIPPED".<br><br>Music, without the words, may convey a mood, but I am not sure what lifestyle message it conveys. Sure sometimes it can get hypnotic (if you let it...), just look at King Saul with David playing the harp. No unlike one attending a Aerosmith concert..... or for that matter any new age Charismatic church. How can one claim that the trance-like condition in a Charismatic church is any different from a rock concert. Point remains that music can be intoxicating, what we are thinking of when we are being "intoxicated" is probably being differentiated as whether we are "worshipping" or not.<br><br>"Charmed"???? one of the lamest witch shows I'd ever seen..... totally laughable...<br>I don't listen to Secret Garden (I probably don't Secret Garden even if it is played). Is it music with lots of woodwinds and percussions??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I am into the heavy stuff like Deep Purple and Dire Straits... Favourite group among my sons and I: Blue. Wife's favourite singer: Robbie Williams.<br><br>One question I'd like to ask when peeps "speak out over my abominations" is WHY??? I only need one GOOD reason, and I almost always never get it. Many Christians speak without knowing the reason to speak. Secret Garden is Bad? WHY? and wait for the answer.</div>

Are back-masked lyrics intentionally added - meaning if I listen to a cover version of a back-masked songs, the lyrics will not be there, eg in an unplugged or cover version of "Another One Bites The Dust" by Queen (which apparently sounded like "smoking marijuana is fun" when played in reversed,<br>2. Or as some claims, back-mask is the sound of the sentence when heard in reverse, which means even if one SPEAKS those words the inherent meaning still exist, so we cannot use the phrase "Another One Bites The Dust"?<br>3. Or has any one done any research on hidden meanings in the media and the effect it has on the target audience, meaning if an heartland auntie is going to listen to "Another One Bites The Dust" does it make her desire smoking marijuana? Incidentally, one claim that Coke added images of their product into a movie was a mere urban legend.<br><br>It boils down to "Cause and Effect". Even though if the "Cause" is present, does it have any effect?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">i think what my teacher is afraid is the intention...<br>my christian frens think it is not good to listen to such music as we may not know their intention...tat's why i am wary too...</div></blockquote>On the issue of "intention".... everyone has intentions, big or small. No different to MacDonald's placing an ad in the media to entice people to come buy their food. But "intention" in itself is NOT sorcery per se. The intention of every TV programme is to have high viewership, be it Charmed or JAG or CSI. If this is a crime, then it worked  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> - over the weekends I went out and bought a microscope set for my boys as we are all fans of CSI. If there ever is a crime in this "intention" issue, it is "MARKETING".....<br><br>My boys are into Pokemon cards, but not to play, but to appreciate the artwork as we are also manga fans and I had thought them to appreciate art as a medium for communication.<br><br>Point is, the media caters for all and we can choose to watch what we want. Christians should not start condemning people for watching "Charmed" and look for the devil under every rock. I am not defending such shows, I think they are juvenile and stupid, but it is NOT satanic.<br><br>No teacher should enforce what their students watches in their own free time. I had once written to my boys' school who had a teacher spreading "Internet Rumours" on Harry Potter and Pokemon. It is okay if these information can be substantiated, but mostly they are urban legends and it is important to separate personal opinions and true evidences.<br><br>Those who think that Charmed is satanic should also consider dissuading anyone from watching "Buddha's Palm" or "Journey To The West"? So where is the consistency if we don't?<br><br>Christiandom is filled with strange folks with strange agendas. "Charmed" is no good because it features witchcraft. "Touched By An Angel" is no good because it does not feature Jesus and God. "Harry Potter" is no good because it is a show on magic and shows them celebrating Christmas. I am waiting for the morally-right winged folks condemning "Chronicles of Narnia" like the way the "Lord of Rings" series was condemned too. I cannot understand why people cannot take creative works for what it is - creative works. They are not political or religious statements.<br><br>It is important to guard against the attacks of the devils, however as Christians we must also NOT BE tempted to spread lies, regardless of how well-intentioned these lies are. Unless we can prove that something is indeed harmful, we should not place ourself in a position where we become the self-appointed morally upright conscience of the society. Sometimes because of the unyielding stance of these well-intentioned folks, we are seen to be so paranoia and that our God whom we have extolled to be omnipotent seem so powerless that we are afraid of the things outside that "parental warning" must be stuck to every single piece of entertainment.<br></div>
