Paul explains everything.<br><br>but if ur too impatient, then ill jus give a brief explanation.<br><br>Jesus died to save us, cus Man is incapable of saving himself. Man cannot offer a proper compensation to God for his sins. thus Jesus came to die for our sins and pay for our sins instead of us.<br><br>in the new testatment, the apostles explicitly states that good works or abiding by the law CANNOT n WILL not justify us in God's sight. thus, we depend on the sacrifce of Jesus as atonement for our sins. if we couldnt atone for sins b4 Jesus came, then we stilll can't after Jesus died. its in trusting in the sufficiency of His sacrifice and admitting that we are sinners and that nothing that we can do will save us, that we are saved. this is justification by faith, as Paul explains.<br><br>and even after we accept Jesus and still sin (not intentionally but because of the weakness of the flesh), we know that with true repentance, Jesus will forgive us of our sins. trying to do good works to "offset" our sins after we accept Jesus is denying that Jesus's sacrifice was enough. Jesus die for our sins - past, present and future. that is living by grace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course not... like i said, Christ died for our sins- past present AND future. but that doesn't mean that we can jus go on sinning like there's no tommorow. BUT God knows that the flesh will continue to fail us and so we will continue to sin. it surely is wrong for us to think: "Christ died for my sins already... that means i can sin in future n its OK!"<br><br>that is of course, not ok. that is taking advantage of His sacrifice. y do i say restitution is not necessary but in fact, contradict's God's Word? because no amount of good works that we do to try to "make up" for the sins we commited AFTER we accepted Jesus will satisfy God. lemme quote from a source :<br><br><span style="color: green;"><br>According to the Handbook for TodayÂ’s Catholic, page 47, "If you die in the love of God but possess any Â‘stains of sin,Â’ such stains are cleansed away in a purifying process called purgatory. These stains of sin are primarily the temporal punishment due to venial or mortal sins already forgiven but for which sufficient penance was not done during your lifetime."<br><br>The Catholic Catechism, paragraph 1030, says that purgatory is for "All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation, but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven."<br><br>Among the many doctrines that Catholicism claims to be derived through Sacred Tradition, purgatory is one of the most interesting and puzzling, particularly to a Protestant. In light of the Pauline doctrine of <strong>justification by grace through faith</strong>, how is it possible that an afterlife cleansing through punishment is necessary for a Christian who has trusted in Jesus to cleanse him from all His sins? Wasn't Jesus' punishment for our transgressions sufficient? DidnÂ’t He take our place in that He suffered our death? It would seem that the words of Christ, <strong>"It is finished,"</strong> (John 19:30) do not mean that the cleansing of our souls was completed on the cross.<br><br>Of course, Roman Catholic doctrine states that eternal life is bestowed upon the one who receives baptism (Catechism, par. 1265 - 1266, 1992). It is the stains of the sins committed after baptism and not removed through penance, good works, prayers, the Mass, etc., that are removed in the fires of purgatory (Handbook for Today's Catholic, page 47).<br><br>In light of the doctrine of justification by faith (Rom. 5:1), <strong>where Jesus bore all of our sins,</strong> purgatory would seem to have no theologically justifiable right to exist. But the Bible alone is not appealed to by Catholic theologians in support of Purgatory. By far, the main support for Purgatory is found in the Catholic doctrine of Sacred Tradition. Nevertheless, what does the Bible say about justification, punishment, and our sins?<br><br>What is justification by faith?<br><br><strong>To Â‘justifyÂ’ means Â‘acquitÂ’, Â‘declare righteousÂ’, the opposite of Â‘condemnÂ’. It means to not be guilty of breaking the Law and to be deemed as righteous by the standard of the Law.</strong><br><br>God gave the Law, i.e, the 10 commandments. The Law is a reflection of GodÂ’s character and it is a perfect standard of righteousness which no one can keep. Since no one is able to keep GodÂ’s Law, <strong>no one can be justified by the Law</strong> (Rom. 3:20). <strong>There is, therefore, none righteous </strong>(Rom. 3:10-12). This is the problem of all people. We have all broken GodÂ’s Law and are in need of justification, of being declared righteous in GodÂ’s sight. <strong>This can only be done through the Messiah, our sin bearer.</strong><br><br>Jesus is the one who took our place on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24), became sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21), and turned away the wrath of God from us (Rom. 5:9) by being a propitiation (1 John 2:2) that turned away the wrath of God. He was punished in our place. Therefore, Jesus was our substitution. <strong>The righteous work of Christ is imputed to the believer by grace</strong> (Titus 3:7)<strong> and through faith</strong> (Rom. 5:1). This justification is a legal action on the part of God Â‘reckoningÂ’ the believer as having satisfied the Law Â— all of the Law.<br><br><strong>It necessarily follows that to be justified in GodÂ’s eyes, is to be fully justified. It is not Â‘partÂ’ of the Law that must be satisfied, but all of it. Perfection is the standard. Likewise, it is not Â‘partÂ’ of our sins that were born by Christ, but all of them. This justification includes all of the sins of the believer (past, present, and future) or else we could not be justified.</strong><br><br>What does the Catholic Catechism Say?<br><br>The Catholic Catechism (paragraphs 1990-1992) says, "Justification detaches man from sin which contradicts the love of God, and purifies his heart of sin. Justification follows upon GodÂ’s merciful initiative of offering forgiveness. It reconciles man with God. It frees from the enslavement to sin, and it heals"...."Justification is at the same time the acceptance of GodÂ’s righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ..." and "...justification is conferred in Baptism, the sacrament of faith. It conforms us to the righteousness of God, who makes us inwardly just by the power of his mercy."<br><br>Of particular interest is the reference that "justification is conferred in Baptism, the sacrament of faith." There are many verses in the Bible that deal with baptism and Â‘putting on ChristÂ’ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:1-11). This paper is not intended to discuss the nature of baptism. Nevertheless, I strongly affirm that baptism is a covenant sign for the believer who is already justified by faith and for the children of believers who are under the covenant headship of the family. Baptism is not what justifies a person. Rather,<br><br>Justification is a gift by His grace through Jesus (Rom. 3:24)<br>Justification is by grace (Titus 3:7)<br>Justification is by faith (Rom. 3:28; 5:1; Gal. 3:24)<br>Justification is by JesusÂ’ blood (Rom. 5:9).<br>Justification is in the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. 6:11).<br>Justification is not equated with baptism, but with grace, faith, and the blood  of Jesus.<br><br>Jesus said, "It is finished," (John 19:30)<br><br><strong>Jesus bore our sins in His body, paid the penalty for them, and died. He said, "It is finished." In Greek, the phrase, "It is finished" is one word, tetelestai. In ancient Greek papyri texts that were receipts for taxes, when a debt was paid in full, the word tetelestai, was written on the document. This meant that the debt had been paid in full. In other words, Jesus had finished the work of atonement. But not only atonement (to make amends, to make right), but also of propitiation (turning away GodÂ’s wrath). He had fully paid the debt invoked by the sinner. There was nothing more to be done... It was finished.</strong><br><br>Yet, the doctrine of Purgatory, in effect, is saying that we must suffer in purgatory for sins not Â‘covered by baptismÂ’ and not covered by the cross. It is to say that the work of Christ is not finished and that there are things we must do to complete the sacrificial, cleansing work of Christ. This amounts to earning heaven by our good works, albeit, a work of suffering. Additionally, the doctrine of Purgatory implies that a person must atone for his own sins. It implies that the person must do more than what the Law of God requires of him. This is called supererogation.<br><br>When Jesus said, "It is finished," all that was necessary in the atonement was concluded and all in Christ were justified. We cannot complete or add to ChristÂ’s work through our suffering. Purgatory is not only unnecessary, but it contradicts GodÂ’s word.</span><br><br>i noe tt source is gg to spark some debate, but im not trying to start a flame war. the source is basing its argument on the Bible which is our golden standard of the Truth. so however u which to see it, its up to u. but ultimately, i hope we all remember to look back to the Word, which is God's infallible Truth.<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let us first agree that:<br><br>(1) Faith is absolutely necessary for salvation,<br>(2) We are absolutely commanded by God to do good works.<br>(3) Your works alone will not save you.<br><br>Catholicism does not teach that one is saved by good works apart from wholly unmerited grace from God, or apart from faith or the redeeming work of Jesus Christ. Rather, the Catholic view is that faith and good works are intrinsically and inevitably intertwined, as St. James clearly states ("faith without works is dead"). A person cannot save himself by his own works (i.e., not preceded by God's grace and supernatural assistance).<br><br>I believe that faith alone is not sufficient.
