            <div class='col-md body'>Never Give Up!<br>What do you know about the cheetah? Perhaps you know that it is the fastest known land animal and is found mainly in Africa. This slender, long-legged member of the cat family can run extremely fast, achieving speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. ThatÂ’s more than the speed limit in some areas! A skilled hunter, the cheetah is sometimes known as the Â“Hunting Leopard.Â” But in spite of its great speed and hunting skills, the cheetah lacks endurance. If it doesnÂ’t catch its prey after chasing it for 400 to 600 yards, this great runner and mighty hunter has to give up the chase.<br>Many of us lack endurance too, especially in our prayer-life. Our heavenly Father told us to pray. He did not call us to pray long drawn-out prayers, full of impressive-sounding words. He never suggested that we pray as loud as we can for all the world (or at least the neighbors!) to hear. He would not dream of challenging us to try to get our names in the Guinness Book of World Records for breaking the record of praying the longest prayer!<br>But He does want us to pray persistently. Many of us (including me) have a tendency to pray in fits and starts, depending on our moods and feelings. If we donÂ’t see quick results, we are easily disheartened and discouraged. Sometimes we even get mad at God and stop praying.<br>In todayÂ’s parable, Jesus told His disciples that they should Â“always pray and not give upÂ” (Luke 18:1), which means we should: Keep on praying. DonÂ’t be like the cheetahÂ—swift, yet lacking in endurance. Pray daily; pray constantly; persevere in prayer.<br>Â—Tanya F.<br>REFLECTION<br>Â•	When do I pray? Every day? Once a week? Before exams? When hit by a crisis?<br>Â•	How soon do I expect answers to my prayers? Do I give God deadlines?<br>Â•	Do I keep on praying, even when I donÂ’t see tangible results?<br>Â•	Do I view prayer merely as a way of getting things from God? Or as a two-way dialogue with a beloved Father and faithful Friend?<br><br><img src="http://lava.nationalgeographic.com/pod/pictures/normal/06571_32.jpg"></div>

Indeed we know that you are the God who knows us even when we were yet born. We pray that You will bless her womb and the baby and allow these period of gestation be one that is smooth and well one. Protect her from all illnesses and keep her in good health and condition. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.</div>
