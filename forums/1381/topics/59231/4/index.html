I pray Lord, that you will reveal yourself before them in their own lives. Manifest your presence in their lives. I pray that fellow Christian will not deny you and instead pick up the cross daily in their life to follow you. In every trials, allow us to emerge triumph. Lord, your grace is sufficient for us. Let your grace carry us through every trials in our lives. I pray for the victims of the Bali Bombing and the disaster in the West. Lord, protect every child of yours in everywhere they go. Father, bless us journey mercy and angel encamp around us. Father, you are the way, the truth and the life. I pray for our nation that in this time of terrorist attacks, Father you protect us from harms O Lord. You have been merciful to us at all times and Lord, let us look to You in times of trials. Father continue to use each of us to glorify your Name and Lord, continue to work through our lives.
