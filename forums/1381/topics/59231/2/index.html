            <div class='col-md body'>Once after a night of BBQ in East Coast, during the sunrise,<br>my friends went toilet. Haha, thats not the story.<br><br>I was alone, and contemplating life, when an old lady comes around, poking around the leftover plastic bags. She ask me if there is anything to eat. The BBQ pit was cleaned, and there are not cooked food already. Just some raw meat.<br><br>I told her no, I dont have any food left.I tried searchin gfor beehoon or anything that is already cooked, but alas. I gave her some money and she went away. It struck me she is not just any beggar. She could be homeless, without friends and relatives, and family. She could be abandoned, and refuses to go nursing or destitute homes. She could be at East Coast every morning begging for food, yet there are no expression of anguish or sadness on her face when i told her I dont have anymore food.<br><br>Many years ago, in secondary school, my friends and I used to visit Woodlands Home for the Aged. It was at first part of the NYAA criteria that we choses to go for charity work. At first, we just take equipment and do usual cleaning, painting, clearing longkangs. Quite fun too. After that we usually have chit chats with the superintendent of the home. We talk about the home, the senior citizens, the destitutes. All have stories behind them, and few were featured on the the show Extraordinary People. I remember there is this old lady with a middle aged mentally disabled son living right in the home. I was thinking, there are like no children for the son, and no fillial grandchildren waiting on the grandmother. The family line, the their lifes are passed just like that. I dont know what happen to them now, since the home is demolished to make way for the new Turf Club. It was used to be near Kranji MRT, and the scenery was used to be luscious green. The residents are dispersed, one of the new home being Bukit Batok Home for the Aged. I visited the place one time, and was surprised to see the Asst Superintendent there.<br><br>During a brief period in secondary school, I visited the Chidren Society Home in Marsiling. It was part of the school thingy about social service points need to be completed. We had fun, cleaning, thinking ways of cleaning the place, playing with the kids. Only thing is we were informed that they are orphans, and we must never mention their parents or talk about our own family. During one of the session, we ask the one of the kid what he wants, and he replied "I want my papa, he promise to bring me to the playground". The room was suddenly quiet, especially us guys, while the other kids still howling and playing away.<br><br>While in army, we visit it again, once a year. This time, I am already much older, and the staff told us more about them, like them being protected children, some are real orphans, some abandoned, some whose parents are engage in brawl and other reasons.<br><br>Hey guys, I was thinking like for all these people, they need our help. A story in the Aesop Fable tells about a poor farmer who used his earnings from sold-off grains to buy clothing for three statues on the bridge. The next morning, the statues are alive and gave him riches. Of course no statues comes alive for us, but I believe in give more, take less.<br><br>We can offer prayers according to our religions. But can we extend help? There are many things we can do, and I need not list it out. Even smiling and say thanks to people who wants you buy charity tickets, after you reject them for whatsoever reasons, is considered a kind act.<br><br>Instead of taking actions, you guys can think over the stories too.<br><br>Merry Xmas and Happy New YEar<br></div>
