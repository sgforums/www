We express our deep compassion to the Taize community."<br><br>The president of the French Bishops' Conference, Archbishop of Bordeaux Jean-Pierre Ricard, wrote to the Taize community expressing his "deep grief" after the murder of "this great figure of a researcher and witness of God, impassioned by unity among Christians and reconciliation."<br><br>Roger was awarded the UNESCO prize for peace education in 1988 and is the author of many books on prayer and reflection, asking young people to be confident and committed.<br><br>Overnight here at the community many young people remained meditating in the church while others wandered around outside, shocked and haggard. - AFP/de<br><br></div>
