            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Robotics999:</div><div class="quote_body">Back to topic.<br>So basically, a typical service involves tithes, followed by a talk on a verse/chapter of the Bible, lessons learnt/to learn, singing(?), then summary of the whole service? But for those that are more knowledgable to the Bible, won't they feel bored going for services? and pardon my ignorance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>For Protestant services, usually worship comes first. There is a practical reason to it: to allow more latecomers to come in without disrupting the sermon later .. and ensure they are in time for the offerings<br><br>Maybe another practical reason is for the speaker (can be your own pastor or other church's pastor or reverend) to get prepared.<br><br>The worship leaders run the show for the first part. Then they pass the mike to the speaker. In between you can have the monthly eucharist and offerings session (where they pass the bags around).<br><br>The sermon is usually about how to live your daily Christian living, how the works of the biblical figures are relevant in today context. You might be knowledgable but still can find some insights or two.<br><br>A service is about worship too. You sing song and praise the Lord. Don't think anyone can get bored by this?</div>
