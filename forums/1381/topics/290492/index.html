I fail to grasp your point that St Paul was preaching to pagan priests or what not. The Sacred Writer was writing to Christians in the Church of Corinth and had clearly ordered them (and his protege Timothy) not to allow women to teach or speak in Church (not pagan temples). It is hence impossible for women to be a Bishop and yet she must be silent and unable to teach. An analogy would be a teacher who isn't permitted to teach anything.<br><br><blockquote>As in <strong>ALL the CHURCHES of the holy ones</strong>, women should keep silent in the churches, for they are not allowed to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. But if they want to learn anything, they should ask their husbands at home. For it is improper for a woman to speak in the church. Did the word of God go forth from you? Or has it come to you alone? If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or a spiritual person, he should recognize that what <strong>I am writing to you is a commandment of the Lord. </strong></blockquote>Henceforth, I conclude the following arguments:<br><br>i) The Sacred Writer was addressing to Christians and was not sending a Watchtower Tract to pagan priests.<br><br>ii) The Sacred Writer reminded the Christians in Corinths that they must conform to a male ministry for - a) The Lord commands it to be so<br>- b) ALL Churches practiced it<br><br>iii) The Sacred Writer explains that women cannot speak in Church but must be silent instead and they must cover their heads in prayer!<br><br>iv) There are no instance of a female bishop being ordained in Scripure.<br><br></div>

(impt later .. read below)<br><br><blockquote>1Tim 3<br><br>The saying is sure:* whoever aspires to the office of bishop* desires a noble task. 2Now a bishop* must be above reproach, married only once,* temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, an apt teacher, 3not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, and not a lover of money. 4He must manage his own household well, keeping his children submissive and respectful in every wayÂ— 5for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of GodÂ’s church? 6He must not be a recent convert, or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. 7Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil. </blockquote>While only 'bishop' is described here, notice how similar it is to the description in Titus. And bishops should be married only once.<br><br>From verse 8, Paul talks about deacons. (refer to Calvin's fourfold office)<br><br><blockquote>Phil 1<br><br>Paul and Timothy, servants* of Christ Jesus,<br>To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops* and deacons</blockquote>Yup, once again bishops and deacons.<br><br>To reiterate, my point is that the office of bishop is not mentioned in Scripture.</div>

The idea of married Priests is an ancient tradition. Eastern Catholics and Eastern Orthodox priests are married. The celibacy laws is a western tradition.<br><br>Paul goes on to describe the office of the Bishop - Steward of God.<br><br>Steward means to be a representative. In Scripture, the Apostles were appointed to be Christ's Steward when Christ gave Peter the Keys. As a result, Paul was illustrating that the Bishop's role is similiar to the Apostle's role. This is where Apostolic Succession comes in.<br><br><blockquote>Acts 20<br><br>Keep watch over yourselves and over the whole flock of which the holy Spirit has appointed you Bishops, 6 in which you tend the church of God that he acquired with his own blood. </blockquote>Bishops are mentioned as being shepherds of the flock. This too was the role of the Apostles whom Christ called to be Sheperds. This again shows that the role of the Bishops is similiar to the roles of the Apostles.<br><br>Eventually, the role of the Bishop lies in its Apostolic Duties, Teaching and Temporal Matters within the Church admin.<br><br>Inevitably, it was only around the 2th century when the distinction between priests and bishops became clear through the various Ignatius's epistles.</div>

This means that the Bishops not only possese the similiar Apostolic office but they also continue to succeed the Apostle and their successors in turn do the same. So in some sense it is a continued role of similarity (if that made sense).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Apostles - Sheperds, Stewards, forgiveness of sins<br>Elders/Priests - Presided over Communion, teaching,<br>Bishop - Oversee elders, Sheperds, Stewards, forgive sins.<br>Deacons<br><br></div>

Hence bishops overseeing the elders do not make sense.</div></blockquote>As the apostles began to pass from the scene, they appointed certain non-apostles-e.g., Timothy, Titus, Mark, Philip, and Apollos-to oversee multiple local congregations and to appoint  and discipline  individual presbyters within them. Since they oversee only a single and individual congregation/region, they are technically the first bishops. Within this congregation, they have enouh authority to do the following -<br><br>i) Appoint priests within a local congregation<br><br><blockquote>Titus 1:5<br>For this reason I left you in Crete so that you might set right what remains to be done and appoint presbyters in every town, as I directed you</blockquote>ii) Discipline, judge and remove Priests<br><br><blockquote>1 Tim 5:19-20<br>Do not accept an accusation against a presbyter unless it is supported by two or three witnesses. Reprimand publicly those who do sin, so that the rest also will be afraid. </blockquote>Naturally the distinction between bishops and priests or the three-fold office only came into being through Ignatius Epistles.<br><br>Ignatius:<br><br><blockquote>"See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God.</blockquote>I personally feel that a one century development of the three-fold office pales in comparision to the 3 century development of the NT Canon haha!</div>
