            <div class='col-md body'>In the months of November and December of 2006, there was a spate of posts in sgForums that were religious inflammatory.  A few sgForums members made snide and degrading remarks about religions.<br><br>During these events, a complain was lodged with the police.  This complain was against an individual who had posted remarks such as "using the bible as toilet paper", "Christians are worse than MLM agents", "Muslims are terrorists".  I do not have a full list of the remarks he made, but these include remarks made in all the religion-based forums in sgForums.<br><br>I have been asked by the police to assist in this investigation.<br><br>This post is to remind everyone to be thoughtful in their remarks made in an open forum such as sgForums. Remarks regarding religions is always a sensitive issue. We do not want to allow any individual to prey on our faith to cause any unrest.<br><br>At Eternal Hope, we want to have a environment which the Christians can get to know each other. At the same time, we hope to answer questions that others may be interested in an amicable and rational manner.<br><br>Once again, we respect everyone's right to practise their own beliefs. We do not want to impose our faith on anyone here. We gently remind all Christians to also be sensitive to all members of sgForums, and to the people around you.<br>Note: The individual made an apology after the complain to the police was made (the complain was unknown to the individual at that point of time). I have made known during that investigation that the individual had apologised to the Christians, and that I have accepted the apology.</div>
