              <p>Hey, your thoughts not wrong.<br>Like what Chin Eng wrote....Just go to a church, smaller ones. <br>Talk to the leader or pastor, i am sure they will be able help you.  <br>But if you are not comfortable talking to them yet, just go attend the service first. When you are more comfortable, then talk to the leader or pastor.</p>

              <p>It's a good feeling to know that you are not alone in this world that you have a God that shares with you your everyday struggle. A God which is always be with you. A God which is only a whisper away. A whisper that could break the bondage of evil or even shook the ground where you stand <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">...A God which may let you know the secret of the future or what lies in a man's heart...A God which could you give such a peace like you never had felt before such an overpowering peace that gives you joy...though you must be careful not to forfeit this peace as I did...I've been trying to get that peace again....I hope I don't have to wait for too long and next time it would be forever instead of being 6 weeks. But that was because of my own fault....</p>
              <p>It may take some time before you realize that if you decide to follow Christ that . . . you are more than you thought. You are a part of Christ. I hope you will eventually find that out yourself if you are true to Christ.</p>

              <p>I agree that you should avoid those mega-churches........personally, I know of some dubious way they mis-quote the bible and teachings.</p>
              <p>Take China Eng's advice and talk to some priests or pastors to know more.....</p>
              <p>Personally, I think you can give Catholic Church a try as they are starting their RCIA (Rite of Christian Inititaion for Adults) journey about this time and it takes about 10 months or so to complete. There is no one to push, physco or pressure you at the classes - you are free to come and go....</p>
              <p>Get baptise only if you agree with their doctrines / teachings.....</p>
              <p>In case you wonder why I recommend the Catholic Churches is because historically, they are recognised as the original Church the Jessus build. Prostant Churches are "break-away" Churches during the reformation and there are many similiarities among the churches and teachings. So, Prostestant churches is also ok.</p>
              <p>Find some friends to go with you....</p>
              <p>Again avoid those mega-churches.... if you do decide to go, be careful and always remember that you are there for God and to worship God nothing else....and always verify their teachings with your Christian friends from other churches. Don't get brain-washed.</p>
              <p>There are some discussion about negative effect of mega-churches which you can find  at <a title="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Online+Story/STIStory_159724.html" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Online+Story/STIStory_159724.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Online+Story/STIStory_159724.html</a></p>
              <p>Hope this will help and hope you will have a fruitful journey finding God.</p>

              <p><br>There is another practical reason why mega-church should be avoided.</p>
              <p>To avoid burning yourself up. A mega-church is usually very happening and you may be presssured to go with the flow or be left out. Even when you happily embrace the flow, your personal life may be affected. Eg. family life, study life etc.</p>
