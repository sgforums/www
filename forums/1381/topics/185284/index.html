Does that increase the likelihood of a reunion in after-life?<br><br>Many thanks...<br></div></blockquote>Ec 3:21 Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and <strong>the spirit </strong>of the animal, which goes down to the earth?<br><br>animals do have spirits. the difference however is in the direction they go after the body dies.<br><br>I do believe that man unlike animals is a trichonomy, that is, man is composed of body, spirit and soul. The animals only have the first two.<br><br>there is no record in the Bible that animals go to heaven or hell after death.<br><br>However, let it be known that when our Lord Christ died, He redeemed <strong>all things</strong> to God.<br><br>Col 1:20 and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.<br><br>We thought that Christ came only to redeem sinful man. Yes, that is true but that is not the whole picture. When sin entered the world. it infected all of the universe: man, the earth, the planets, the heavenly bodies, animal life, plant life and etc.<br><br>that's why all around us we see defects in nature. three footed cows, two headed animals, and other defects.<br><br>But all that, Christ has redeemed. In the case of creatures other than man, it is not atoning. Because these are not moral creatures. It is only in the case of man.<br><br>When Christ will come again to rule for a thousand years, you will see creation being in its original beauty and splendor and glory.<br><br>Please read these verses:<br><br>Ro 8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.<br><br>20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope;<br><br>21 because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.<br><br>22 For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now.<br><br>It was and still is the will of God that man should have dominion over animals and other creation in this universe. Man failed the first time. This will of God was never fulfilled by Adam or any of us after him. We could not since we too are infected with sin.<br><br>But God wants His will done. And so in the Second Coming of Christ with Christians, He together with redeemed humanity will fulfill this will where Adam failed.<br><br>Here's a picture of the Mellinium:<br><br>Isa 11:6 "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, The leopard shall lie down with the young goat, The calf and the young lion and the fatling together; And a little child shall lead them.<br><br>Isa 65:25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, The lion shall eat straw like the ox, And dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain," Says the LORD.<br><br>Isa 35:1 The wilderness and the wasteland shall be glad for them, And the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose;<br><br>2 It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice, Even with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, The excellence of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the LORD, The excellency of our God.<br><br>The land whole land which will be desolate in the coming Great Tribulation will be restored like the Garden of Eden:<br><br>Eze 36:35 "So they will say, 'This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.'<br><br>There are other vivid and beautiful pictures written in the Old Testament about the coming Mellinium. Animals will lose its predatory nature, nature will be under man's domininon and etc.<br><br>Read Psalms 8, Psalms 148, Isaiah 11 and other Mellinial verses.<br><br>This was the kingdom offered by the Lord Jesus when He first came. A kingdom which ruleth all things. A kingdom of beauty and splendor and glory.<br>But the Israelites did not know what they were missing.<br><br>Who will enter into the Mellinial Kingdom? All those who have repented from their sins and trusted in Christ alone for salvation.<br><br></div>

The Bible is really silent on this issue.<br><br>I believe there will be no reunion in the after-life between the pet and the human being.<br><br>although i believe that animals have spirits, i don't believe it is a spirit capable of having personal conscious interaction with us humans. It is a different kind of spirit from what we humans have. Way different.<br><br>Actually, scholars are varied in their interpretations with this verse:<br><br>Ec 3:21 Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the spirit of the animal</strong></span>, which goes down to the earth?<br><br>[this is one of the most difficult verses, if not the most difficult to interpret, in Ecclesiastes]<br><br>The NIV translates the word 'spirit' there as breath. So some scholars just say:"it is not saying the animal has a spirit, 'spirit' there just means breath"<br>But that interpretation although plausible, still has problems. We will not go into that for now.<br><br>No. my friend. I believe there will be no reunion in the after life between the pet and the human being.<br><br>just my two cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[/u]</div>
