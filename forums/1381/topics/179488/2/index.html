Note that when you start a thread, the title and the first post is the one that leads the rest. Everything goes back to these two elements as points of reference. By stating "Christian" and "Premarital Sex" you have defined the framework for discussion.... but in your subsequent posts, the "Christian" element is completely missing because you had already answered you own question.<br><br>Here's where I hope you are not feeling that I am picking on you.... you seem to have a good heart and want to share your thoughts, but you need to be clearer in the things you hope to achieve.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
