And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 6 But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment. 7 For I wish that all men were even as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.<br>8 But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am; 9 but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.<br><br></div>

Does the ADAM &amp; EVE refer to a population of humans? if not then how to populate cause they both gave birth to sons (Cain &amp; Able). its not mentioned in the bible dat God took the ribs of Cain &amp; Able to further produce (hehehe...like cloning) more humans.<br><br>Then wont it be incest (Adultery) to do it the natural way? anyone can answer me this?</div>
