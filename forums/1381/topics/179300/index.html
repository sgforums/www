There are other names that were used to describe the one who opposed Christ. It can mean the many who is against Christ, it can also mean the one identified in Revelations. As I had previously said - too many people have spent too much time on this futile exercise. Futile because there is no way anyone of these researchers are able to prove one way or another. Better it be for a believer to focus on his personal walk with God and his relationship with those around him than to go searching for shadows.<br><br>Since sillyme had already closed the other thread, there is really no good reason to start it again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
