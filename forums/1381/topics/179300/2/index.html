I said if we wish to discuss the anti-Christ we should read it from the Bible and not some speculations from some websites who may not be analyzing stuff correctly.<br><br>As I'd said before, go to your browser and type in "who is the anti-christ" and you will find a whole gamut of personalities. Sure we can discuss all these and find the most like candidate, then what? Does that bring joy, comfort, encouragement and edication? or does it bring dispute and quarrel.... you decide. ....</div></blockquote>Surely we need to read about it in the Bible. We can also read from the websites or from books, but the figures and facts and even the credentials of the authors of these articles or books need verification and people should bring up an book or article for discussion after they had read, digested and found it worthwhile. Quoting a book, or an article from website is the same as voicing our own opinion, we need to substantiate it. I think I have said enough about how responsible ppl should be when posting on any forum.<br><br>The main point is: are we assuming that antichrist is a person, so there are many candidates to choose from? or is antichrist just an icon of worship for all those who are against Christianity, or it is a general description of all those who are not for Christ!!<br>By definition quoted from the Bible by Vince69 Â“By Definition in the Bible, this so called Antichrist is someone who claimed to be Christ but actually is not, hence a False ChristÂ”, then who claimed to be Christ? or do we expect antichrist to come from among the christians? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>One thing we know about this antichrist, as Paul said in 2 Thess. Â“The coming of the lawless one will beÂ…Â…Â… displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders, and in every sort of evil that deceivesÂ…Â” so what counterfeit miracles, signs, wonders and deceiving evil are we seeing right now?<br><br>We are being warned against the deceiving acts of the antichrist during end times, and we are calling for people to repent and accept salvation because end time is here, I think among Christian, we should have some idea about what we should be guarding against.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chin Eng:</div><div class="quote_body">I am sorry, but I totally disagree with your statement: Many things in the Bible are interpreted to suit diff ppl and diff situation. The important thing is the result of such interpretation. This statement is wrong at best, and heretic at worst. The issue of interpretation is NOT different meaning, but different context of how any verses were used basing on the translation of the original language and understanding of the cultural context at the point of writing. If the Bible is to be taken to suit different people and different situation, then the Bible is NOT the word of God, because chaos will rule. ....</div></blockquote>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> may be my expression was wrong.

So isn't God the problem here?</div></blockquote>To trace the origin and development of the God-idea, one must go back to the time when civilization was still in its infancy and modern science was still unknown. Primitive people, out of fear of and admiration towards natural phenomena, had believed in different spirits and gods. They used their belief in spirit and gods to form religions of their own. According to their respective circumstances and understanding capacity different people worshipped different gods and founded different faiths.<br><br>At the beginning of the God-idea, people worshipped many gods--gods of trees, streams, lightning, storm, winds, the sun and all other terrestrial phenomena. These gods were related to each and every act of nature. Then gradually man began to attribute to these gods, sex and form as well as the physical and mental characteristics of human beings. Human attributes were given to the gods: love, hate, jealousy, fear, pride, envy and other emotions found among human beings. From all these gods, there slowly grew a realization that the phenomena of the universe were not many but were One. This understanding gave rise to the monotheistic god of recent ages.<br><br>In the process of development, the God-idea went through a variety of changing social and intellectual climates. It was regarded by different men in different ways. Some idealized god as the King of Heaven and Earth; they had a conception of god as a person. Others thought of god as an abstract principle. Some raised the ideal of Supreme deity to the highest heaven, while others brought it down to the lowest depths of the earth. Some pictured god in a paradise, while others made an idol and worshipped it. Some want so far as to say that there is no salvation without god?no matter how much good you do, you will not receive the fruits of your actions unless you act out of a faith in god. The Atheists said, 'No' and went on to affirm that god did not really exist at all. The Skeptics or Agnostics said, 'We do not or we cannot know.' The Positivists say that the God-idea was a meaningless problem since the idea of the term god 'was not clear'. Thus there grew a variety of ideas and beliefs and names for the God-idea: pantheism, idolatry, belief in a formless god, and belief in many gods and goddesses.<br><br>Even the monotheistic god of recent times has gone through a variety of changes as it passed through different nations and people.<br></div>
