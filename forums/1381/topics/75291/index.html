            <div class='col-md body'>Are You Troubled?<br><br>"He said to them, 'Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?'" (Luke 24:3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Jesus said to me, "Why do you have doubts?" I doubt because I rely on my senses more than I rely on God. That's the lesson of a story from the 1800s. A skeptic stood on a street corner, preaching his contempt for Christ. He said, "People tell me that God exists, but I can't see Him. People tell me that there is a judgment to come, but I can't see it. People tell me that Jesus has died and risen for me, but I can't see Him." He stepped down from his pulpit to a smattering of applause. Then another man stepped up to speak: "People tell me that there is green grass all around, but I can't see it. People tell me that there is blue sky above, but I can't see it. People tell me that there are trees nearby, but I can't see them because I am blind." Actually, both men were blind. One was blind physically. The other was blind spiritually.<br><br>On Good Friday, there were many who stood before the cross, blinded by their doubts. The Pharisees and priests were blinded by their hatred for this new Messiah and their fear that this crucifixion might not silence His message of salvation by grace. Jesus' disciples might also have been blinded, believing that His death would be the end of the hope He had given. Today we sometimes stand before the cross and cannot see the Lamb of God Who has died so that we might live. We are blinded by our doubts and troubles. "Can God really help me?" we ask. "Does He really have the answers that I need?" How wonderful it would be if our eyes were always open to see that Jesus died for me! For MY sins. For MY troubles, doubts, and fears. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now am found, was blind, but now I see.<br><br>Dear Lord Jesus, I believe, help my unbelief. When I see the cross, let me see Your love and grace. In Your Name. Amen.<br><br></div>
