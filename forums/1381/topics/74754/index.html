            <div class='col-md body'>A testimony worth reading.   An example to all as a survivor and a true man of courage. MEL GIBSON'S TESTIMONY - A True Story by Paul  Harvey You may be surprised to learn whom this young man turned out to be. Years ago a hardworking man took his  family from New York State to Australia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this man's family was  a handsome young son who had aspirations of joining the circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow,  biding his time until a circus job or even one as a stagehand came along, worked at the local shipyards which  bordered on the worst section of town. Walking home from work one evening this young man was attacked by five  thieves who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his money the young fellow resisted. Unfortunately they  'bested him' easily and proceeded to beat him to a pulp.  They mashed his face with their boots and kicked and beat  his body brutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police found him lying in the road they assumed he was  dead and called for the Morgue Wagon. On the way to the morgue a policeman heard him gasp for air. They  immediately took him to the emergency unit at the hospital. When he Was   placed on a gurney a nurse remarked, to her horror, that this young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket was  smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, His nose literally hanging from his face, alll his teeth were gone, and his  jaw was almost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared he spent over a year in the  hospital.When he finally left, his body may have healed but his face was 'disgusting' to look at. He was no longer the  handsome youth whom everyone admired. When the young man started to look for work again he was turned down  by everyone just on account of the way he looked. One potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak  show at the circus as The Man Who Had No Face. And he did this for a while. He was still rejected by everyone and  no one wanted to be seen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide.   This went on for five years ('Oh, can you imagine his heartache and despair?') One day he passed a church and sought  some solace there. Entering the church he encountered a priest who had seen him sobbing while kneeling in a pew.  The priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they talked at length. The priest was impressed with  him to such a degree that he said that he would do everything possible for him that could be done to restore his  dignity and life, if the young man would promise to be the best Catholic he could be and trust in God's mercy to free  him from his torturous life. The young man went to mass and communion every day, and after thanking God for  saving his life, asked God to give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man he could ever be in His eyes.      The priest, through his personal contacts, was able to secure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia.  There would be no cost to the young man, as the doctor was the priest's best friend. The doctor too was so impressed  by the young man, whose outlook now on life, even though he had experienced the worst, was filled with good humor  and love. The surgery was a miraculous success. All the best dental work was also done for him. The young man  became everything he promised God he would be. He was also blessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, and many  children, and success in an industry which would have been the furthest thing from his mind as a career if not for the  goodness of God and the love of the people who cared for him. This he acknowledges publicly. Who was this man?  Mel Gibson. His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie "The Man Without A Face". He is to be  admired by all of us as a God fearing man, a political conservative, and an example to all as a survivor and a true man  of courage. And to think I admired him before I knew any of this! He is quite a man! - Paul Harvey "The Passion of  the Christ", produced and funded by Mel Gibson will be released into theatres on February 25th, Ash Wednesday.  This movie on the final 12 hours of Christ's life is based on the Bible and is a TRUE accounting according to God's  Word from Jesus' close friend and disciple. Billy Graham calls it the most important movie ever.....it opens in The US  on Ash Wednesday. Please pray for Mel Gibson, his family and Anyone associated with this life-changing film. He  has been receiving many death threats. While the movie was being filmed on location, there were actual Physical  healings of workers and many came to believe and accept Christ as their Savior. Mel Gibson shared this information  when he recently visited Saddleback Church in Irvine.   Please note that the movie is rated 'R' due to the violence that Jesus actually suffered. It was not the Jews who were  ultimately responsible for Jesus' horrible, sad, heart-wrenching death; it was my and your sin. "What the enemy  meant for evil (to kill/destroy Mel Gibson when he was a young man), GOD turned into GOOD!' as He always does  when we seek Him and when we make Him Lord of our lives as Mel Gibson has.</div>

That Image<br>of Satan holding an ugly child is an anti-Madonna<br>image. The child<br>represents the future persecutions of the body of<br>Christ, the Church. The<br>child is ugly because evil is a deformation of good.<br>The child is stroking<br>the face of Satan because evil perverts what is good.<br>The stroking<br>symbolizes the love of evil, much like a child would<br>love its mother, but in<br>a perverted way. Remember this image happens when<br>Jesus is<br>being scourged. His body is being wounded. His body is<br>being persecuted. It<br>is an image used by Mel Gibson to show Satan flaunting<br>his future plan of<br>persecution of the Church in the face of the sacrifice<br>of the Lord.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sure.<br><br>We see in Exodus 20 the Ten Commandments and the 2nd Commandments says<br>"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.'' Exodus 20:4<br><br>We know that Roman Catholics will strongly oppose this because in the Roman Catholic bible, the whole Exodus 20:4 is missing(or replaced).<br><br>As i mentioned, do some research on the background of the movie and you will find the Roman Catholics hand in it.<br><br>I reason i mentioned Exodus 20:4 is as below:<br><br>If you had watched the movie, when you read the bible and think about our Lord Jesus, do you now have a image of the movie? Are the images from the movie bearing such an impression on you that it comes to you everytime in your mind?<br><br>The Word of God says very clearly, "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." Romans 10:17. You need only the Scriptures, prayers and the prompting of the HolySpirit for your salvation, and communion with the Lord.<br><br>Many churches are supporting the movie as a revivial of Christianity. However, if it is steamed from the Roman Catholics, are we still able to say its a revivial from God?<br><br>That's my opinions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm what i feel is that its just a movie, watch it with decernment. and just enjoy the artistry. its not 100% accurate. but it's sorta opened my eyes abt the suffering Jesus went thru. i mean. u read abt the crucification, but did u ever felt the horror and know the real cost of your salvation?<br><br>i mean. so far, its had positive impacts on me.. i don't go worshipping mary and all that nonsense. and i still am skeptical about catholic believes. i guess its how u interpret the movie for yourself. christianity isn't abt rules and regulation, this cannot see, that cannot see, etc is just going to bind the believeres to legalism. thats a load of bullshiat.<br><br>christianity is a relationship. and a good clean fun one too.<br><br>this movie is pretty cool artistically, who cares if the pope likes it. he's human too,. not the devil. why can't he like a movie? just because he likes pork sausages, does it make it bad for us? think abt it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

He is the one who made eve for adam? isn't God the one who "matchmakes"?<br><br>and yet another statement she made about prayer, she said that we can pray to st joseph, he bao ka liao (meaning he can handle everything)<br><br>this are what catholics are saying in their catholic meetings. but to the outside world, christians or non christians, they say stuff like, nah, they pray to God... they only ask mum mary to intercede.. etc.</div>
