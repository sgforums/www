            <div class='col-md body'>Here is a very interesting portion of the Scripture for Icemoon. Read Exodus 25 to Exodus 28. TheLord God of Israel gave very very very very (i can't further emphasise it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> ) detailed instructions for the Israelites to build the tabernacle, alter, showbread. Right up to the measurement and material of cloths to be used.<br><br>Now you may argue that the Roman Catholics are just doing the same now, however, Exodus is of the old testament. Our Lord Jesus had torn down the veil in the temple from top to bottom and we Christians no longer need to go to the temple and the ark of covenent or a priest to have direct communion with God.<br><br>Back to the topic on the "Passion", if anyone noticed, the movie was opened in the US on Ash Wednesday,part of the unscriptural holy days of the Roman Catholic Church, after Mel Gibson gave a special presentation of the preview of the 'Passion' to Pope John Paul II.<br><br>Now, i am going to be very honest and to declare my stand here. It may sound that i am bashing the Roman Catholics. However, it must be understand that Roman Catholics are NOT Christians, they are not saved. I love my Roman Catholics friends whom i have tried to witness. I hate the Vatican, the Church because they are quite clearly, the Harlot riding on the Beast mentioned in Revelation,decieving so many people in the world.<br><br>We can discuss this if someone opens another thread. And prayerfully i can have some support from some other members that i think (never met or spoken to them before, only through readingtheir posts) on the same line of fire as i, namely dumb!dumb! (not so dump after all eh?) and ChinEng.</div>

The rest of it is similar though punctuation might be different. I mention that coz punctuation makes a lot of difference in an indentical statements.  And there are many different sects of catholicism, Mel Gibson belongs to a very conservative one called Pius X (I not sure about the exact name) which the catholic church does not recognize.
