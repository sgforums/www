            <div class='col-md body'>I re-emphasise my stand clear that i do not hate Roman Catholics. I have a number of friends who are Roman Catholics who i have been trying to witness to by sharing the gospel with them. However, its the Church, the Vatican that I oppose because it is decieving people with a twisted gospel.<br><br>Firstly, i like to give some replies from the posting from Guest006.<br><br><strong>And if you are takling about the influence and the sublimal message of works, I dont think so coz Mel Gibson said on national tv in the US( i think its on 60 minutes) that he believe that the only way to heaven is through Christ. </strong><br><br>The fundamental beliefs of Roman Catholics on The Lord Jesus as the only way to salvation is similar with Protestants. So i am not surprised that Gibson said those words on TV because all Roman Catholics will say that. But its the beliefs and practice beyond this.<br><br>Who is the Intersessor? - Mary?<br>Mother of God? - Really  such a thing in the Bible?<br>Queen of Heaven? - Such a thing in the Bible?<br>The Pope? - Such a position in the Bible?<br>Purgatory? - Is there such a place?<br>Eucharist? - what?<br>and so on....<br><br>This draws to the point about Predestination.<br><br><strong>And yes, catholics are saved. From what I understand from my bible teachers, anyone who accepts Jesus as their savior at any one time in their life is saved.</strong><br><br>DumbDumb and Icemoon were also in "deep" discussion over this issue. I am a Presbyterian and Predestination is a fundamental doctrine that we believe in. (I am not going to discuss about Predestination here because it will take another 5 day church camp to go through everything). With this in view, i believe that some Roman Catholics are predestinated to be called unto salvation but do not know the gospel yet.<br><br>Someone of you might wonder, "What is this guy talking about? What about not knowing the gospel yet? Don't they already know it?" It's different. Two different gospels. Protestant upholds a Gospel of salvation through faith and faith only, while Roman Catholics preaches salvation through faith PLUS works. I can try to explain this if anyone would like to know.<br><br>About different versions of Bible.<br><br><strong>The Catholics have a few "extra" books in the bible. The rest of it is similar though punctuation might be different. I mention that coz punctuation makes a lot of difference in an indentical statements. </strong><br><br>Apart from the few "extra" books mentioned, there were also numerous (alot) verses that were either added or removed for the benefit of the Vatican. Exodus 20 is the most classic example. We know that the Ten Commandments are mentioned twice in the Old Testament. Once in Exodus and once in Deuteronomy.  Ten Commandments in both Books are the same. But wait a minute, it is different in the Roman Catholic Bible. The 2nd Commandment was strangely removed from Exodus 20. Now, in the Roman Catholics Catechesim materials, to teach new belivers of the fundamental beliefs,  - when it comes to the Ten Commandment ONLY Exodus 20 is taught.<br><br>So whats the 2nd Commandment? This:<br>"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.'' Exodus 20:4<br><br>Now you can see why.<br><br>Guest006 also mentioned:<br><br><strong>It is more about christians having a visual images of their Lord's sacrifice. Just as the differnt books of the bible were written for differnt purposes, this movie has its own purpose.</strong><br>This hit Exodus 20 right on the bull'seye. Do consider this verse in the Bible,<br><br>"Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. " John 20:29<br><br>The purpose of the movie is what we are contesting here. Some argue that its for evangelical, some other argue just for monetary gain. I think it is much more profound and Guest006 correctly pointed them out in his posting.<br><br></div>

I'm not going into detail here, but I think as long as christians dont worship the movie or place too much importance in it then it is ok to make a movie. Maybe some people can understand better visually, meaning to say that they "read" the bible through watching instead of reading or audio.<br><br><strong>The purpose of the movie is what we are contesting here. Some argue that its for evangelical, some other argue just for monetary gain. I think it is much more profound and Guest006 correctly pointed them out in his posting.</strong><br><br>I agree. There are profound things that we may not be able to understandd till it is revealed to us in heaven. Btw, I'm a "her".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

I have a number of friends who are Roman Catholics who i have been trying to witness to by sharing the gospel with them. However, its the Church, the Vatican that I oppose because it is decieving people with a twisted gospel.<br><br>Firstly, i like to give some replies from the posting from Guest006.<br><br>[b]And if you are takling about the influence and the sublimal message of works, I dont think so coz Mel Gibson said on national tv in the US( i think its on 60 minutes) that he believe that the only way to heaven is through Christ. </strong><br><br>The fundamental beliefs of Roman Catholics on The Lord Jesus as the only way to salvation is similar with Protestants. So i am not surprised that Gibson said those words on TV because all Roman Catholics will say that. But its the beliefs and practice beyond this.<br><br>Who is the Intersessor? - Mary?<br>Mother of God? - Really  such a thing in the Bible?<br>Queen of Heaven? - Such a thing in the Bible?<br>The Pope? - Such a position in the Bible?<br>Purgatory? - Is there such a place?<br>Eucharist? - what?<br>and so on....<br><br>This draws to the point about Predestination.<br><br><strong>And yes, catholics are saved. From what I understand from my bible teachers, anyone who accepts Jesus as their savior at any one time in their life is saved.</strong><br><br>DumbDumb and Icemoon were also in "deep" discussion over this issue. I am a Presbyterian and Predestination is a fundamental doctrine that we believe in. (I am not going to discuss about Predestination here because it will take another 5 day church camp to go through everything). With this in view, i believe that some Roman Catholics are predestinated to be called unto salvation but do not know the gospel yet.<br><br>Someone of you might wonder, "What is this guy talking about? What about not knowing the gospel yet? Don't they already know it?" It's different. Two different gospels. Protestant upholds a Gospel of salvation through faith and faith only, while Roman Catholics preaches salvation through faith PLUS works. I can try to explain this if anyone would like to know.<br><br>About different versions of Bible.<br><br><strong>The Catholics have a few "extra" books in the bible.
