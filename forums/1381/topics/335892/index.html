            <div class='col-md body'><div id="post_message_199833"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Friends,</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">I’m going to get straight to the point here - GOD HATES FAT PEOPLE! And if you hang around with fat people, or have fat friends, or have a wife or husband who’s a fat greasy pig, he’s gonna hate YOU too! </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Proverbs 23:20-21 warns us, " <strong>Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty</strong>: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags." </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">From this, it is clear to us not only does God detest fatties, but he detests people who even associate with these grotesquely obese beasts!</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Proverbs 28:7 declares, " Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but <strong>he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father</strong>.”</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">A companion of riotous men brings shame and disgrace to is father! Well, you don’t get anymore riotous that a fat folks! The Bible teaches us not to disrespect our parents (Deuteronomy 5:16), and anyone who does must be suitably beaten (Proverbs 22:15, Proverbs 29:15). However, if they still continue to associate with these fat freaks, and continue to show rebellion against their parents, they must suffer the same punishment as fat folks! (Deuteronomy 21:18-21 – see below). </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">But what punishment does God have for fat people? </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Proverbs 23:2 proclaims, " <strong>Put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite</strong>."</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nice! So let’s be clear here, folks. God wants ALL fat people to take a knife to their own throats! They want to act like big fat pigs? Then God thinks they should be treated like fat pigs! </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">And if they won’t do the honorable thing, their parents must do it for them!</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Deuteronomy 21:18-21 teaches, "If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, <strong>This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die</strong>: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear."</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">While this may seem a little harsh to most secular folks, to most Bible believers this is a fitting punishment - for defiling the once-perfect body that God has given these repulsive sweaty beasts! See, what most of these fat retards seem to forget, is that their own bodies do not belong to them. They belong to God! The way you live your life in everything you do, every way you act, and especially every way you treat your body, must be to the glory of god. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">1 Corinthians 3:16-17 teaches, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<strong> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are</strong>."</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yes, our bodies are the temples of the Spirit of God. Unfortunately, many non-believers today have turned their temples into a junkyard! Stuffing their big fat faces with as many candy-bars, donuts, flame-grilled grease-burgers, triple-thick shakes, pizzas, buckets of fried chicken, and cakes cakes cakes as possible! It's disgusting! </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Remember, our physical appetites are just another example of our ability to control ourselves. If these fat retards are unable to control their own eating habits, they are probably also unable to control other habits, such as those of the mind (lust, covetousness, anger), and unable to keep their big fat mouths from gossip or strife. You must not let your appetites control you, but rather you are to have control over your own appetites. (See Deuteronomy 21:20, Proverbs 23:2, 2 Peter 1:5-7, 2 Timothy 3:1-9, and 2 Corinthians 10:5.) The ability to say "no" to anything in excess—"self-control"—is one of the fruits of the Spirit common to all believers (Galatians 5:22).</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">God has blessed us by filling the earth with foods that are delicious, nutritious, and even pleasurable. We should honor God's creation by enjoying these foods, and by eating them in appropriate quantities, while controlling our appetites, rather than allowing them to control us.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">And the sad part is that these fat slobs probably believe the condition of their bodies has very little to do with their eternal salvation. How wrong these pork-chops are! If these grease-balls think they can just gorge themselves on as much food as possible, to the point where they feel like they are going to explode, and think that God will let them away with it, they have another thing coming! </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Matthew 12:36 warns, "But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">God knows what they’re doing, and He DOES care, and they will have to give account for their gluttony, their greed, their immorality, their laziness, their blasphemy, their stupidity, and their grotesqueness. They will give full account to God for all their actions! </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">I can't wait till God throws ALL these greasy fat pigs into Hell! Glory!</span></div></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Gluttony seems to be a sin that the John 3:16ers Christians like to ignore. We are often quick to label smoking and drinking as sins, but for some reason gluttony is accepted or at least tolerated. Many of the arguments used against smoking and drinking, such as health and addiction, apply equally to overeating. Many non True Christian believers would not even consider having a glass of wine or smoking a cigarette, but have no qualms about gorging themselves at the dinner table to the point that they feel like they are going to explode. This should not be!<br><br>Proverbs 23: 20-21 warns us, "Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags." Proverbs 28:7 declares, "He who keeps the law is a discerning son, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father." Proverbs 23:2 proclaims, "Put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony." I would take that to mean that god wants us to rebuke and if needed harpoon them. <br><br>They will sure burn real good in hell. Fat makes a wonderful fuel it's like whale blubber.</p></div>

              <p>anyway, for all sins committed by us, it has already been forgiven. by the very blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, all sins have been forgiven... (here's the catch) once we repent and proclaim that Jesus is Lord, God Almighty... once we've accepted that we are mere sons and daughters of God, we are saved. once we believe that God is the creator of Heaven and earth, we are saved...</p>
              <p>so what's the meaning? simple; all fat people who believe and have faith in Christ are already saved, end of story.</p>
