              <p>another super lame interpretation.....</p>
              <p>proverbs 23 starts with:</p>
              <h4>Proverbs 23</h4>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-17046" class="sup">1</span> When you sit to dine with a ruler, <br>       note well what is before you,</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-17047" class="sup">2</span> and put a knife to your throat <br>       if you are given to gluttony.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-17048" class="sup">3</span> Do not crave his delicacies, <br>       for that food is deceptive.</p>
              <p>if i have a buck each time a person takes scripture out of context, I'd be a very rich man by now.....</p>
              <p>the context of Proverbs 23 has nothing to do with skinny or fat, but with the attitude one has towards the attitudes of the world wisdom....</p>
              <p>even if you are take <span style="font-family: Arial;">Proverbs 23:20-21 at face value, " <strong>Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty</strong>: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">drunkardness and gluttony has nothing to do with weight. it has got to do with one's attitudes towards what we put into our mouth.... i know of skinny people who eats more than me. it merely means that the skinny person's metabolic rate is higher than mine, it does not mean God loves him more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nobunaga, don't be stupid..... </span></p>

U got you noun . your verb  and what else..  oh wait u have a 'BUT' exactly after ur first sentence. Clearly trying to reinforce something opposite in nature of u wouldnt use the word 'BUT' and u end with ' ..................

              <p>let me show u where i get the idea from aight ? now,lets see..
              Ur first sentence.</p>
              <p>' I was about to kind of think maybe the god that christians
              worship is all loving.'</p>
              <p>As u can see ,u are clearly making a statement. Your mumbo jumbo
              'kind of think maybe' i mean come on man.. i can say u playing mind
              games too by not being  precise with ur words. U got you noun
              . your verb  and what else..  oh wait u have a 'BUT'
              exactly after ur first sentence. Clearly trying to reinforce
              something opposite in nature of u wouldnt use the word 'BUT' and u
              end with ' .................. ' so, based on that inference , i
              take it that '...............................' or maybe ur
              ....................... is  this -_-" . I dun know.. u never
              say , so.. i assume.</p>

              <p>You just killed yourself dude. If you had compassion n love, why not go out and get a life or do some charity, instead of CRITISIZING me. I really think you have nothing better to do. But then like i said. You have the freedom. What goes around comes around.</p>

              <p>Very true Omnia. But Nobunaga Oda's post does have a good point.</p>
              <p>What I have garnered from Nobunaga Oda's post - the jewel amidst the pile of distorted usage of scripture - is that we should develop self-control as a response towards God's love for us; He bought our bodies with his blood, and we were bought at a price; therefore we should honour God with our body (I Cor 6:20). This point is valid and edifying.</p>
              <p>But what is distorted about his view is that he completely ignored the 'love' aspect of God. God is love (I John 4:16). Yes, God is holy, and righteous, but He is love. His judgments are with grace. And no, He does not delight in sending gluttons, sinners, or even distorters of truth to hell. He died for them. He loved them. He hates the sins but He loves the sinner.</p>
              <p>So if you're a person who eats without self-control; just to satisfy the cravings of your belly (I can remember succumbing to this temptation quite awhile back this week), just repent. Stop eating like a glutton. Exercise self-control. And most importantly do this because you love God.</p>
              <p>And if you fail, don't condemn yourself - God doesn't condemn you. Come back under His cleansing blood and loving arms, and treat every irrational hunger pang (e.g. you just had a full dinner half an hour ago and you suddenly have a craving for two large slices of cake) as an opportunity to excercise self-control.</p>
              <p>Be filled with His love!</p>
