              or paradoxes, then good luck to you, because you really needed it.
              I am just here to explain the paradoxes of a god religion.</p>

              <p>This is the funny part.</p>
              <p>There are no paradoxes here. You have again shown none. These paradoxes again are created by yourself again. While you can equally believe in ... like I said, no begining and no end,  why is it absurd to believe that something that has no beginning and no time to begin with ?</p>
              <p>While I may not be no physicist, the basic understanding of E=mc^2 means that matter and energy are interchangeable. What IF, the possibilities are here, that God is not matter or energy,he is the platonic realm, i.e. the world of logic and information; the <span id="lw_1292874564_0" class="yshortcuts">physical world</span> is emergent from the platonic realm. When I meant God is energy, it is not energy in how we understand it. Why then is it not possible that God has been here , around us, and or/ in another plane ?<br> <br> Matter and energy are part of od but not God himself. The equation 
              E=mc^2 is part of God, and since that is part of the platonic realm it 
              is closer to what God is. That is the wonders of mathematics. Where there is order and mathematics, it denotes some form of intelligence.</p>
              <p>Dont understand ? How about the 3 laws of Thermodynamics ? If you understand how it works, you should understand that the laws cannot contradict each other.</p>
              <p>We know matter CAN be destroyed. It's something we call nuclear fusion. U say energy ? Then what about blackholes ? Are u going to give me answers like the singularity and darkmatter energy conversion ?  If that is so, how absurb that we are still trying to understand the universe and that our limited understanding is that perhaps we came to existence by matter that is already in existence ?  Are u saying that science has mastered the understanding of the universe ?</p>
              <p>We believe the universe is the answer, but damned if we know the question right ?</p>
              <p>What if there is an eternal source ? Are u going to get on your knees unzip my pants and open your mouth when when science suddenly discovers something to explain another that has reasons to believe what we know is wrong and there is another way to explain it ? Because since u are that certain, I am sure you can put that wager on.</p>
              <p>All I am saying is, while u are supposedly "awakening" us, perhaps I am also "awakening" you.</p>
              <p>I dont understand how you can use both
               using science and false claims to empiricism and objective unbias, to 
              make any claims they can... rhetoric... to form convincing yet 
              unprovable arguments against God.</p>

              <p>I am not trying to confuse you. I am trying to be as simple as I can to explain to you the subtleness of His design. Even if you were told then, you would not understand.  But they exist regardless of whether you are told or not.Atoms and Molecules are just terms, given to explain what is already there.</p>
              <p>The Bible simply expressed the seeming "creation" of man in words that 
              could readily be understood; in fact, the right term is just as you put 
              it - "put together."<br> <br> Genesis 2:7<br> "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed 
              into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." <br> <br> Man was "formed" and "breathed" and "became". How God did it we do not 
              know.  Perhaps the so called existing matter?  He "doeth great things past 
              finding out; yea, and wonders without number" (Job 9:10)</p>
              <p>Back then, they didnt know geohpysics , geotechnical and seismic, all they did then was just follow instructions, and booom... the walls of Jericho comes tumbling down.</p>
              <p>Fastforward to now, we understood the WHY and HOW and what is that ? Its called Seismic, its called Vibrations, its called Frequencies.</p>
              <p>Hope that further clarifies my points.</p>

              <p>Faith is mere cowardice, an excuse <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to avoid thinking and evaluating or srutinizing evidence that is espoused for the hypothesis that ''God'' is the creator and the arbiter.</span> Ít is a mere ''belief'' labelled otherwsie - nothing more nothing less! It does not allow for one to understand onself or the world around onself.<br>The delusion of one is insanity and the collective delusion is ORGANISED <em>religion</em>. ... organized why? to circumsribe, to dicate, to keep one tethered to vested interests, in fact it is per ser <span style="text-decoration: underline;">religion politicised (aka ideology)</span> for the benefit for a few who are on the top echelons of the church, temple or ... anything that is defined is dead! In fact why is there a need for a mediator to expereince "God" or whatever one assumes to be divine. It is because of the fear and when one is not rooted to reality that this futurizing that something beyond us (in this instance, god) is going to save us that is being exploited by those hoisted on the pedestal of theology. Is this not deluding oneself? If the hypothesis is that god created the universe and yet he/she/it is capable of being judgemental and can dictate who needs such a ''god'' ?</p>
              <p>When one's mirror is thick with the dust of the past, one cannot see clearly what is - one is most likely to project was one has collected within and superimpose on what is herenow or right in front of one. Hence the stance is this: one only sees what one wants to see,and inexorably what is bound to be missed and distorted is the perception. One cannot respond to what is. One merely reacts and all one does is use the past. The past is dead, it is only ''alive'' in the mind. It is akin to one who is holding on to an expired cheque and trying to validate it. Yes, it is given validity most times, but the validity is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">merely psychological</span> and divorced from what is reality or what is real. A such one can only be relating to ''ghosts'' of the past. The wise is cognizant of such a stance and its inherent folly n knows and accepts that the illusion of certainty cannot co-exist with existential uncertainty. At the most, one is clutching at straws of certainty (aka past)! Beliefs bind and what is true (not truth) frees.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;"></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It takes intelligence and courage to see thru this undignifying charade. Simply, quoting texts, historical documents or even so-called religious tomes is woefully befitting of this sobriquet: apathy and fear!</p>
