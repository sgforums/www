              <p>I am not trying to confuse you. I am trying to be as simple as I can to explain to you the subtleness of His design. Even if you were told then, you would not understand.  But they exist regardless of whether you are told or not.Atoms and Molecules are just terms, given to explain what is already there.</p>
              <p>The Bible simply expressed the seeming "creation" of man in words that could readily be understood; in fact, the right term is just as you put it - "put together."<br><br>Genesis 2:7<br>"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."<br><br>Man was "formed" and "breathed" and "became". How God did it we do not know.  Perhaps the so called existing matter?  He "doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number" (Job 9:10)</p>
              <p>Back then, they didnt know geohpysics , geotechnical and seismic, all they did then was just follow instructions, and booom... the walls of Jericho comes tumbling down.</p>
              <p>Fastforward to now, we understood the WHY and HOW and what is that ? Its called Seismic, its called Vibrations, its called Frequencies.</p>
              <p>Hope that further clarifies my points.</p>

              <p>doesnt it sound the same as othe religion? other religion also said the same thing, ie their god created this and this and that? creationist theories are getting debunked and disproved all the time.</p>

One more thing needs to be proven, Buddha said there were higher intelligence out there , which is what scientists trying to prove, the existence of aliens.

              <p><br>Who do you take Jesus as?    You flip and flip and flip, you have many times condemned christianity like you do to buddhism now.    One moment you declare yourself a christian, then later become buddhist to condemn christianity, then back to be christian and then back again to become buddhist and the latest now is you declare you are a christian.</p>
              <p>Please, you think God is not aware of your inconsistency to know your insincerity.   Truly if you love God you will not behave so fickle.     Please do not shame God.</p>
