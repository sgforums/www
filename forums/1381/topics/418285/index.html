              <p>Religion, or at least a belief in some kind of creator, is not 
              incompatible with science, nor should it be.  Faith, by it's very 
              definition, is not a function of logic, but something very human.  Where
               one runs into problems is when faith attempts to subvert empirical fact
               with doctrine.  Or, conversely, when science attempts to destroy faith 
              by the misapplication of fact.</p>
              <p>Big bang of a big bang ? Are u proposing infinity + 1 ? Sure. If that makes you guys feel comfortable with.</p>
              <p>Eventhough I am no cosmologist or some astrophysicist, I dont jump the gun as if that is the truth. lol.  If you guys can be so sure on such conjecture, I really got nothing to say. It just suprises me that you guys can give in to that much possibility on something that is in it's infancy while discounting the possibilities of the opposite. So I think you guys are just sucking in and spewing out whatever that fits you agendas, without even going through something we call.. a brain.</p>
              <p>Lets not be gullible and ignorant. Just as interesting as dumb people's confidence is the honestly tentative and uncertain language used by really smart people.</p>
              <p>Dont forget that when your job is developing models, you become well aware of how imperfect they are (despite being useful and safe).</p>
              <p>A question then, if the Universe is timeless, why don't we see evidence of other 
              civilizations that have figured it out, beat the odds and succeeded in 
              vastly expanding their sphere (or 3-spheres) of influence. There must be

              <p>Thats it ? A two sentence statement about me made by you ? You said it not me. I already said I am fully capable of accepting possibilities. But whether they are pursuasive is another matter.</p>
              <p>The bible is just a stepping stone in understanding the nature of God once u believe there is such a divine being.</p>
              <p>The basic arguments for the
              existence of God do not involve the Bible. The big question is whether
              there is any God, anything out there beyond the physical world that we
              can perceive through our five senses.</p>
              <p>The existence of God does not depend on the Bible. Cosmological,
              teleological, ontological, moral, and philosophical proofs of God’s
              existence can be made with no appeal to scripture.</p>
              <p>But then again, if you dont believe, I am not here to pursuade you. Just here to show you the possibilities only. Because you guys seem to be on a jihad or something in proving your point, by what other people write of course. lol</p>

              <p>That has nothing to do with the failure of creationist theories. It only fails because again you are limiting God to your own understanding.</p>
              <p>Just like your "Can God create something he cant lift" Again.. another limitation imposed by you even after u acknowledge that he is God. Seems that you keep asking the same questions. Either you are stupid or you just cant accept the answers given to you.</p>
              <p>What if God has always existed. There is no need for a beginning nor an end. What if it IS energy in itself ?</p>

              <p>Religion, or at least a belief in some kind of creator, is not

                                      definition, is not a function of logic, but something very human.
                                      Where one runs into problems is when faith attempts to subvert
                                      empirical fact with doctrine. Or, conversely, when science attempts
                                      to destroy faith by the misapplication of fact.</p>

              <p>you still dun get the statement do you, energy cannot be created nor destroyed. energy manifest itself as matter , so doesnt need a creator to create anything in this universe. I dun tink you can grasp this concept without the concept of a creator.</p>
              <p>god as energy in itself? that is even more ludicrous, as energy cant be created, how can it go on create things. you are contradicting this scientific fact.</p>
