              <p>the bible translation is a very tedious yet joyful work that does not allow a wee bit of error. not even a grammactical one.

              <p>hence, the surest way to know is by ref to the bible and not just to humans religious teachers. even with them, we must always fall back on the bible again. and pray before reading the bible or having a discussion that thru the holy spirit we may understand.</p>

              <p>Not all, but most christians have bad attitudes and some are evil.   Be careful of them.   Look out and be careful of those who preach but their actions show otherwise.  </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Not most of the Christian have bad altitudes nor most of them are evil. I hope u are not offended by what I said.  Have u really been interacting with people ( Christians and non-Believers) ? If not, do move around and interact. There are many more other Christians than those u have just described. Because If based on what u said are true, it means that most people have become worst after believing in JESUS ....  the govt would have already closed down the Churches. </p>
              <p>I  just read the newspapers recently that it reported  some local organizations including Christian organizations are donating to the 2 Asia disasters. Does what they preach and their actions show that they are evil or having bad altitude as well ?????</p>

              <p>Agree with you. Politics and Christianity just dont go well together, or whatever self-centred reason sinful man might use it for. Such actions speak more about man than the teachings of Christ (to me). If the gun was invented for the purpose of hunting animals, people (mis)use it to kill one another, can i blame the inventor?</p>
              <p>So you're cool with the bible, GOD, JC and the HOly Spirit as individual entities, but can i ask you where does the Holy Spirit come from?</p>

                                      individual entities, but can i ask you where does the Holy Spirit
                                      come from?</p>
              <p>Yodh Heh Wah Heh is the name of God,(in cases of trinity,it is the name of abba father,now known as yahweh or jehovah since translation into mordern english from hebrew gets YHWH or JHVH). the pronounciation can actually get from psalms ard chap 110 or 113 i cant remember..interesting side note is that every 1st word of psalms were actually starting with the alphabets of the hebrew language.</p>
              <p>Sects of nicholas were mentioned by the christ in revelation if i remember correctly.it mentions that in the last of days(apprantly since his return to heaven) to armageddon,there will be many different sects of people who claims to preach his and Yodh Heh Wah Heh's words but yet sides with the serpents. this "coincides" nicely with mordern christianity.</p>
              <p>God, Yodh Heh Wah Heh, and all his titles is the father.the almighty God we know.</p>
              <p>Yeshua,Jesus,christ,messiah and most of his titles am the son. in subjection to the father.</p>
              <p>Holy Spirit is kind of a queer. it is mentioned the least in both OT and NT.first appearance in genesis where God sent it over the land mass and creation to start.it was never mention to have a personality like christ or God. it simply behaves like some kind of holy energy. some kind of active force.(imagine wind on a wind mill??) and of cuz it has to come from God(as in the father)</p>
              <p>as for politics and religion..well, its being repeated enough.be no part of this system cuz the god of this wicked system is mr satan the boogey man..</p>

Sin is transgression of Yahweh's Mitzvot. Like any government, Yahweh is the ultimate ruler of the universe, so its really His government, in all governments if we don't follow the laws of the land, we get punished, and this can result in death, just so happens that, if we don't follow the law of this land, the punishment is death, but I guess that Yahweh is merciful in that it is eternal destruction and not eternal hell and torment. So really the choice is yours, do you want to live for a while and be forgotten forever or to have a chance to see what a world in tune with Yahweh could really be like?</p>

              <p>Hi Breyton I am a Christian(Catholics) and I believe what you are saying about eternal destruction about being forgotten forever and being nothing or ceasing to exist to be somewhat true. I say this from my own past experience about a year after my 7th grade unless what I saw was the devil in disguise. When I saw a once a man and now not of this world I thought this in my heart: Why would this important person come to see me, a really unworthy(sinful) me that is to live only for a very short time and then be forgotten/lost forever. I don't know why that was the first very thought that came to my mind after seeing the apparition in my 8th grade. My second impression on the apparition was that the once a man now holds great power(authority). So great that I felt I wanted to be like him so I uttered the following in my heart believing  the apparition able to hear me: If you could make it, I could also. Whatever you endured  while living to get you what you have now I could get it through aswell. Basically saying that I wanted to be like him. I never want to be like someone else, never, ever, except to be like that man who appeared to me in my bedroom in my 8th grade. His face was covered with something very very dark so I couldn't see his face at all.</p>
              <p>However I believe even in the old testament there is a verse<br> about God mentioning that none of the living man has ever stood on the gate of hell. The book of Job I believe.</p>
              <p>The new testament is full of mention of hell by Jesus like one below:</p>
              <p><strong><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=16&amp;verse=18&amp;version=9&amp;context=verse">Matthew 16:18</a></strong><br> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the <strong>gate</strong>s of <strong>hell</strong> shall not prevail against it.</p>
              <p>Well what I'm saying that there is a probability that both are true in a way. That ceasing to exist and hell are both true. But this is entirely my personal opinion of course.</p>
              <p><br> How these both could be true I really don't know. Yes perhaps I could speculate but there is no point of speculating without some sound foundation.</p>

              <p>Actually it is a common misconception caused by the media that bend the potrayal of hell as the place where satan reign.</p>
              <p>And it's not biblical at all. Hell is the place where satan and his angels are punished. Not a place for them to reign. satan doesn't reign in hell. So obviously you haven't read the bible.</p>

              <p>Actually it is a common misconception caused by the media that
              bend the potrayal of hell as the place where satan reign.</p>
              <p>And it's not biblical at all. Hell is the place where satan and
              his angels are punished. Not a place for them to reign. satan
              doesn't reign in hell. So obviously you haven't read the bible.</p>
