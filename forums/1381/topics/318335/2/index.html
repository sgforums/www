              <p>It true that there are tons of christians out there who think they are doing a "heavenly job" by "spreading the good news". The intention is good but the execution is questionable because of the teachings of different churches. For your info, Jesus preach by action and not talk alone.</p>
              <p>Hope this do not lead one to start having negative feelings about Christianity (the fault lies with christians). The faith has been around for more than 2000 years and the various historical facts associated with this faith is certianly worth something.</p>
              <p>Before anyone write off Christianity, at least try going to different churches and find out for yourself.</p>
              <p>There are plenty of denominations to choose from and different denominations have different doctrines. Use your wisdom to guide you and choose one that do what they preach and preach what Jesus is teaching (which you can read from the bible).</p>
              <p>Not one that talk only as talk is cheap. If they insult you or your current belief, it is likely that they do not do what Jesus preach. Christianity is all about faith, hope and love.</p>
              <p>Forgive christians and don't hate christianity for Jesus died for us - it's up to you to find out and belief. No offence if christinaity is not your cup of faith. God bless all.</p>

              <p>Christianity had been abused, still is abused by some and will always be.</p>
              <p>I'm a Catholic(read Chrisitian) and have been dismayed by many fellow Christian people and have decided not to expect anything from fellow Christians.</p>
              <p>The reason that I'm still Christian is because I believe and have found out the truth in Christianity that Jesus is God my savior. I know that may sound fanatical but that is the truth that I've come to find living God in Christianity. I'm not a saint but I try not to deviate too much in terms of sin because I do not want to lose the grace that I've recieved from God.</p>
              <p>I wish that I could tell you what the graces that I've recieved so far but they at least one or two of them may sound so impossible  that I choose to try to keep them to myself. Yes I tell about those graces to my own family, close friends which is mostly met with indifference LOL and even in this forum but I do not insist upon them to believe me. I already have my solace that I speak the truth not fabricated lies to 'sell' Christianity. Of course some people could always defame me as being crazy or delusional but I know that I shall not be embarrassed.</p>

              <p>Christians need to ensure that they are not the cause of such bad experiences.....to do that, one need to check the pastor or priest before taking his words seriously....all pastors and priest should be trained and ordained.</p>
              <p>Just like if one is sick, they go to a qualified doctor right?</p>

              <p>I am a Christians and I know what you mean.....the Church I go never teach us or ask us to do that. You need to know that if you want to go to a Church, it's your free will...if you decide not to, it's also your free will.....no one can force you and don't ever let anyone forced you.</p>
              <p>Yes, we do invite people to Churches etc....but never force or anything. But if you do go, go with an open mind.</p>
              <p>Before you go, go read the bible....(look into Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) which is interesting like a story book. It just tells you the story of Jesus's life. Things he do and teaches...including the last supper etc...</p>
              <p>When you have done that, your interest may be drawn to the other parts of the bible...stories in Genesis and Exdous may also excite you and give you some basis to think if you want to find out more.</p>
              <p>So when you go to the Church, you will not be bored because you don't know wthat the pastor or priest is talking about....</p>
              <p>Don't say you want to go to hell lah....if you want, find out what that is too....you might be suprised that most of your freinds and relatives are not there ! Then you so lonely there.....ha.ha.ha....</p>

              <p>Mind sharing why you said what you did? How did the bible contradict? Was the mother of God not a mortal woman? Is there something wrong with the trinity? Which bible are you reading or refering to? Curious to learn your point of view as you seems to know something many of us don't.</p>

              <p>That could be a reason but some christians also do not know christianity....if they think evangelisation is trying to force your belief down someone else's throat..... thinking that "we are trying to save you" and doing "God's work". Actually, they unknowingly become anti-christ by driving people away and causing people to hate christianity.</p>
              <p>I think most of most did not really hate Christianity. They hate christians....those who do think they know christianity and think that they are some super hero trying to save the world.</p>

              <p>Dear Mrlimkopi</p>
              <p>the bible itself does not contradict. but the doctrines do. go through the bible a million times and you notice not once did Christ says anything about himself being God. instead, one can only see Christ subjecting himself to Yodh Heh Wah Heh the father. even the Christ knows not the hour of armageddon. but he exclaimed that the father does. know if Christ is God, can he not know?? God who has no equal subject himself to someone else? No man can see God and yet live we all know this. we also know no man has seen God. how many saw the Christ again when he was walking among people?</p>
              <p>does this not contradict the teachings in the bible? Yodh Heh Wah Heh the alpha and omega meant He has no beginning nor end. to say a mortal mary gave birth to God means not only was God originated by a mortal sinful woman. but also made that woman in a higher position than God. again this doctrine contradicts with the teachings is it not?</p>
              <p>til now i have not found a single pastor,church leader,so on and so forth that can clearly explain trinity to me. nor can i find it in the bible.(maybe the pope can help on this)</p>
              <p>as most already knows, mordern christiandom was founded by constantine the roman emperor. and again most also know he is a immoral pagan who used religion to unite his people. thus a certain religion after him modelled lots of pagans' beliefs into christainity. corrupting the pure worship of 1st century christians.</p>
              <p>also an interesting point to note is that pagans( from ancient bablyon to mordern religions) tend to worship gods/goddesses in groups of 3s and 4s or even more.more interesting is that they claim the particular deity is 3 yet one godhead.</p>
              <p>again let us see what a typical cath has at home. usually is an alter which the ceramic idol of mary,Christ(infant or otherwise) may include some "saints".and they usually pray to God? in front of such alter,even openly addressing to mary.reminds us of something forbidden in the Bible?</p>
              <p>Rosaries were used.but again contradict Bible. Another major thing in the bible was to be of no part of this system as said by Christ.yet look at vatican. why even the 2 world war was sparked by diff sects of christiandom.</p>
              <p>as for what bible i read..i got them from bookstores like Popular, Mph&lt; kino and such..even city harvest,christians shops. only bible i cant finish is cath bible.</p>
              <p>kindly advise me on all your diff point of views that i may have more research materials.</p>
              <p>btw,i research many types of religions.</p>

              <p>me protestant. probably dont belong in the "most already know" category.</p>
              <p>As i know it, Constantine I didnt found modern Christiandom, it was during his reign that he <em>called</em> for the Council of Nicaea to consolidate a uniform Christian belief system. It was there that the Bible was canonized and to combat other false teachings out there. Within the whole situation, there were a lot of politics within (his motivation was partly to consolidate his power), and Christianity was almost taking off but a lot of people wanted to abuse this faith. It's not as if Constantine I himself was a pious believer of it too.</p>
              <p>He couldnt have corrupted the 1st century Christians, cuz he lived in the 4th century. Time travel?</p>

              <p>my dad found God, when he, when struck with a face infection with no cure, was cured by God. My aunt and family found God, when she had cancer, and so many miracles occurred to them, small blessings of hope, when she's alive.</p>
