              <p>i am right to say if you believe in god, then all your bad things will go away? Ok if you are a true believer, why not we both head down to the cancer foundation, AND DO SOME GOOD DEEDS, and get some of the patients to believe in god, which they will since you say that " What you need
                                      is a personal disaster, and have nowhere else to turn to, except
                                      for God. but are you willing to go through that?" , then we observe their conditions, we go the the law firm to sign papers.</p>
              <p>If they are cured, then i give you all my possesions, if you lose the other way around, hows that? We can do good deeds and spread the good will of god, the money you get you can donate to chruch if you want</p>

              <p>Dear Mrlimkopi</p>
              <p>the bible itself does not contradict. but the doctrines do. go
              through the bible a million times and you notice not once did
              Christ says anything about himself being God. instead, one can only
              see Christ subjecting himself to Yodh Heh Wah Heh the father. even
              the Christ knows not the hour of armageddon. but he exclaimed that
              the father does. know if Christ is God, can he not know?? God who
              has no equal subject himself to someone else? No man can see God
              and yet live we all know this. we also know no man has seen God.
              how many saw the Christ again when he was walking among people?</p>
              <p>does this not contradict the teachings in the bible? Yodh Heh
              Wah Heh the alpha and omega meant He has no beginning nor end. to
              say a mortal mary gave birth to God means not only was God
              originated by a mortal sinful woman. but also made that woman in a
              higher position than God. again this doctrine contradicts with the
              teachings is it not?</p>
              <p>til now i have not found a single pastor,church leader,so on and
              so forth that can clearly explain trinity to me. nor can i find it
              in the bible.(maybe the pope can help on this)</p>
              <p>as most already knows, mordern christiandom was founded by
              constantine the roman emperor. and again most also know he is a
              immoral pagan who used religion to unite his people. thus a certain
              religion after him modelled lots of pagans' beliefs into
              christainity. corrupting the pure worship of 1st century
              christians.</p>
              <p>also an interesting point to note is that pagans( from ancient
              bablyon to mordern religions) tend to worship gods/goddesses in
              groups of 3s and 4s or even more.more interesting is that they
              claim the particular deity is 3 yet one godhead.</p>
              <p>again let us see what a typical cath has at home. usually is an
              alter which the ceramic idol of mary,Christ(infant or otherwise)
              may include some "saints".and they usually pray to God? in front of
              such alter,even openly addressing to mary.reminds us of something
              forbidden in the Bible?</p>
              <p>Rosaries were used.but again contradict Bible. Another major
              thing in the bible was to be of no part of this system as said by
              Christ.yet look at vatican. why even the 2 world war was sparked by
              diff sects of christiandom.</p>
              <p>as for what bible i read..i got them from bookstores like
              Popular, Mph&lt; kino and such..even city harvest,christians shops.
              only bible i cant finish is cath bible.</p>
              <p>kindly advise me on all your diff point of views that i may have
              more research materials.</p>
              <p>btw,i research many types of religions.</p>

              <p>You are strong unbeliever....no amount of things christians says
              will convince you. I agree with you here.</p>
              <p>As most of us here are converts, it means many of of ancestors are not christians. Some may be bad but I am sure that they will be some good man among them. Most have not seen people from the other end of the country - what more of seeing a Jew or christians.</p>
              <p>Where do these people go? I certainly do not want to worship a God that send all my ancestors to hell regardless if they deserve it.</p>
              <p>What happen to the great, loving, caring and forgiving God?</p>
              <p>Sending only christians to heaven even when they don't deserve it?</p>
              <p>I trust that you can find answers if you approach the right church with the right frame of mind. If answers is what you want, you may find it.</p>

              <p>me protestant. probably dont belong in the "most already know"

              <p>As i know it, Constantine I didnt found modern Christiandom, it
                                      was during his reign that he <em>called</em> for the Council of
                                      Nicaea to consolidate a uniform Christian belief system. It was
                                      there that the Bible was canonized and to combat other false
                                      teachings out there. Within the whole situation, there were a lot
                                      of politics within (his motivation was partly to consolidate his
                                      power), and Christianity was almost taking off but a lot of people
                                      wanted to abuse this faith. It's not as if Constantine I himself
                                      was a pious believer of it too.</p>
              <p>He couldnt have corrupted the 1st century Christians, cuz he
                                      lived in the 4th century. Time travel?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe my choice of words was wrong. constantine was the one responsible to "unite" christiandom through the council and consoilidated the bible.thus roman cath are born through this.mixture of pagan belief and Biblical truth.</p>
              <p>of cuz constatine wasnt a pious believer of it.he was a thorough pagan til death.any notion that he was a cath was a political move.</p>
              <p>what i meant by he corupting the 1st century pure worship was not he went back and corrupt.but twisted what the pure christians during the 1st century had preserve.the 1st century christians certainly did not believe in trinity as Christ did not teach them that way. nor was it introduce it yet.</p>

              <p>as for religion evolving with human race.i agree to a certain extent. however,the bible somehow teachings never outdate.</p>
              <p>quote--If a religion is really so good and god LOVES US ALL, then why should the
              non-believers be comdemned to hell, if jesus really loves us? If your son is
              naughty, you will still love him at the end of the day, even when hes naughty,
              why not just let it flow by itself and i dun think that making threats would
              force people to believe out of their own beliefs, I think that perhaps show the
              world examples, would be a better way to do it.--end</p>
              <p>true christiandom never condemn non-believers to hell for a few reasons.1st is cuz no hell exist. 2nd, during armageddon, many will be resurrected and given a chance to know Yodh Heh Wah Heh. and to accept His sovereign rule.only those that despite being shown the truth of what happen still decide to side with the slanderer will die a permanent death.(read not ending up in hell but permanent death)</p>
              <p>not very sure about what you meant by naughty son part. if you meant the satan, then if he is given all the time in the world to wreck havoc means Yodh Heh Wah Heh has no justice...kindly clarify on the naughty son part.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'> i am right to say if you believe in god, then all your bad things will go away?
              Ok if you are a true believer, why not we both head down to the cancer
              foundation, AND DO SOME GOOD DEEDS, and get some of the patients to believe in

              <p>the thing about believeing in God or not is do we understand what was the whole cause of it. why was the perfect and beautiful angel known as satan the devil?why people have to take sides?once you understand that, then you will answer your own qns. and Yodh Heh Wah Heh loves his subjects to ask qns about him.not just blind faith like so many exhibit now.</p>

              <p>that would be what the forerunners of the modern Christian cult (Jehovah's Witnesses) would claim. The Arians.</p>
              <p>Did the first Christians believe in the trinity? John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, certainly did. His gospel is replete with such teachings. Paul's parting message in  2 Cor 13.14: <em>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. </em> (2 Cor 13.14)</p>
              <p>Phil 2.6-11: <em> Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being
              in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be
              grasped, 7 but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a
              servant, being made in human likeness. 8 And being found in appearance
              as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death -- even death
              on a cross! 9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave
              him the name that is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus
              every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11
              and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
              the Father.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em><br> This incredible hymn is one of the OLDEST witnesses to what the very
              early church believed. Although it is used in Philippians (which was
              written around 60ad), Paul probably picked it up in his early years in
              the churches in which he worshipped--late 30's</p>
              <p>And of course, the all famous Matt 28:19, <em>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </em>(this is an explicit statement of three-in-one: it is ONE 'Name', but
              THREE agents! This linking of the Son with the divine names of God and
              Holy Spirit is quite a statement) However, if you have the JW version, it'll probably be plural ("names").</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Polycarp</strong> (70-155/160). Bishop of Smyrna. Disciple of John the Apostle. <br>      "O Lord God almighty...I bless you and glorify you
                  through the eternal and heavenly high priest Jesus Christ, your beloved Son, through whom
                  be glory to you, with Him and the Holy Spirit, both now and forever"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Irenaeus</strong> (115-190). As a boy he listened to Polycarp, the disciple of John. He
                  became Bishop of Lyons. <br>       "The Church, though dispersed throughout the whole
                  world, even to the ends of the earth, has received from the apostles and their disciples
                  this faith: ...one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
                  all things that are in them; and in one Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who became incarnate
                  for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit, who proclaimed through the prophets the
                  dispensations of God, and the advents, and the birth from a virgin, and the passion, and
                  the resurrection from the dead, and the ascension into heaven in the flesh of the beloved
                  Christ Jesus, our Lord, and His manifestation from heaven in the glory of the Father
                  ‘to gather all things in one,' and to raise up anew all flesh of the whole human
                  race, in order that to Christ Jesus, our Lord, and God, and Savior, and King, according to
                  the will of the invisible Father, ‘every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and
                  things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess; to him,
                  and that He should execute just judgment towards all...'" (Against Heresies X.l)</span></p>
              <p>The earliest Aramaic-speaking Christians refer to Jesus as "Lord" in the
                earliest extra-canonical Christian book, <em>the Didache</em>, which scholars
                agree was written no later than the late 100s. The word "Lord"
                (Greek <em>Kyrios</em>) was used by the Greeks to designate divinity. Justin
                Martyr, a second-century church father, baptized new believers in the name of the triune God
                - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, acknowledging the equality of the
                three distinct persons of the Trinity</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More from where all these came from, but i'd say that the early Christians subscribed to the idea of the Trinity.</p>
