              <p>What I feel is that Singaporeans don't really reflect the true christian spirit. At least not to me. There are some really good christians around.</p>
              <p>Even Ghandi once said "You people have one of the best scriptures in the world, it can change the lives of people no matter where this is preached, but do you people (referring to christians) actually practice what is preached?"</p>
              <p>"I would've became a christian if there are not any christians in the world"</p>
              <p>A little humiliating and ironic but I find that it's the fact. I mean, I was a christian too. For about 5 years, until I started wondering, does God really exists? Yes, I am very certain "he" or rather "it" (Referring to the bible itself" does made me a better person.</p>
              <p>But if I were to use this book and forget about the christian craps. Would I still be a good person?</p>
              <p>Answer is yes, I'm an Atheist now.</p>

              <p>to a certian extent i agree with TS, i have this christian friend. forever preaching about God. When the class is watching a anti-christ movie, or somehow i dont know how it is anti-christ, he'd scream at the top of his voice, wanting us to change movie. i dont know why, can't he just, be more open minded? Like when people say God dont exist, he'd once again go, " f- you larh, if there is no God blahblahblah. " When during movies, the actors go " Oh my God !" he'd scream, " DONT SAY THE G WORD. " or something so. It's really irritating.</p>
              <p>i mean, even as a buddhist, if people go "Buddha doesnt exist." "Buddha sucks." i wouldnt bother much because i know deep down inside, Buddha do exist, and i believe in Buddha's teachings, all i need to know is myself, i dont have to think about what others think.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, i do have more of the open minded christians, where they yeah..almost totally opposite of the not-so-open-minded christians? hah.</p>

              <p>even when i c on tv tat ppl boycotted some movies bcoz it is abt anti-christ.. i feel is really not necessary to do it or make into such a huge scene.. coz if one really truly believe tat god or jesus really existed, tis movies wun have any impact on u... maybe they r scare tat ppl will question abt it once they watch..in some sense they maybe dun have any confident in their faith...</p>

              <p>playboy 1985..the emotions u felt about the christiandom is very normal...cuz they do not know what they are preaching at all.the worldwide christiandom is the one where stated in the bible that when the christ returns,he will not know them when they call him master.</p>
              <p>mordern christiandom preach twisted doctrines and they usually use young people of the opposite sex to attract young recruits. once in, they pay and pay.justified by the 10% thingy.while they are over zealous in proving their God is alive yet do not know even his name. any slight sign of disregarding them might result in a small scale jihad.</p>
              <p>and its very common for priests and such people of power to be child lovers(toss 1 boy in a pit with 2 priests and the winner gets to fight MJ) or anal lovers. when the congregation finds out?? just transfer them to other churches.</p>
              <p>even WWI n II arise due to christians fighting among christians. so its little wonder u feel that way about christians.</p>
