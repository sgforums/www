              Hmm i dont know what to say but sometimes its really awful to see people condemning other religions. I tell you, in Singapore race is not a problem as the government had made measurements, thus no race riots. But religion-wise, i seriousy do not know. 
              
              I have some people condemning non-believers to hell and said they are filled with the holy spirit. Ok, so if they are filled with holy spirit why they still condemn people? I thought God is very universal and omnipotent, and uses kindness to touch people's heart rather than condemning? It just goes to show that they are not filled with the holy spirit YET, though they claim to do so. 
              
              Didnt Jesus ever said to love enemy as one loves oneself, or to turn the other cheek? How many actually practicing what they preach?

              <p>Some of them Christians are overzealous. They come with good intentions. They are just farmers of God eager to sow the seeds of His Gospels. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>No doubt many non-Christians are annoyed by these overzealots' actions.</p>

              <p>Hi Wilson, I'm a Christian myself and I've seen that not only some Christians do not practice what has been preached in the bible they do things that are against the teaching. Sad indeed.</p>
              <p>But I myself feel that it is very very difficult to follow all what the bible teaches. So it's a struggle for me too especially on turning the other cheek as this to some people means allowing yourself to be subjected to prolonged persecution or devaluing yourself to sub-human. But again when a man really follow what the bible teaches he would be turned like Jesus and not only in character but also in deeds even greater deeds than what Jesus did. Most 'good' Christians are still struggling to minimize the sins, doing good and cultivating good characters and a good heart in my opinion. But many well at least some come to the church without knowing why and has no respect for God in their life.</p>
              <p>Men who are full with the holy spirit in my opinion are most of all are filled with overwhelming peace and joy so yes they are not likely to condemn others but would most likely to feel love for others. </p>

              <p>according to the bible, the God is not just a god but the only living God. all other gods,deities,goddesses are false gods and worshipping them are a very detestable thing in the God's eyes.</p>
              <p>people should not just condemn, but instead turn away from it and keep doin good works..</p>
              <p>and M&amp;P made a very good point..many so called christians are not doing what the bible teach.</p>
