            <div class='col-md body'>Millions "profess Christ." But in poll after poll, these professing Christians freely admit that they do not really study the Bible. In fact, scarcely more than one-third of Americans can even name the four GospelsÂ—let alone understand what they say.<br>What about you?<br>Most of you are probably professing Christians. But do you study the Instruction Manual for all true ChristiansÂ—the Holy Bible? And what is your real attitude toward the Bible? Do you view the Bible as the real authority in your life? Do you feel it was directly inspired by God, or do you think of it as just a good book with "wise sayings"?<br><br>Coming to understand and to LIVE the right answer to these questions is a major KEY to attaining eternal life.<br>Without the Bible as their authority, men and women everywhere feel "free" to make up their own rules and religions as they go along. In past generations, some Roman Catholic leaders felt "free" to torture and burn nonconformists. Many Protestant Puritans felt free to burn those they labeled "witches." And without the guidance of God's Word, the Nazis felt free to torture and finally exterminate millions of Jews and others they called "undesirables"Â—even during the lifetimes of many of you reading this article!<br>And, of course, in a society cut off from the understanding and authority of God's Word, men and women feel "free" to commit adultery and practice homosexuality, transvestism and even bestialityÂ—doing virtually anything that "feels good." If their sexual "freedom" brings unintended consequences, they do not hesitate to destroy the human life growing inside the mother's womb. They offer clever reasonings and "catch phrases" to make these abominable practices seem correct. They say: "A woman has the right to control her own body."<br>Sounds good?<br>Yes. But what about "controlling" her emotions and her body so that she does not become pregnant outside of marriage? And if she becomes pregnant in marriage, it should be done in a "controlled" manner so that she is RESPONSIBLE for the OTHER human life within her body.<br>What about the countless millions of young people deprived of parents through the tragedy of divorce? Should people feel "free" to divorce for any reason, as so many do today? Jesus Christ clearly said: "But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery" (Matthew 5:32).<br>I can hear many people saying right now: "I think that is too strong! I don't agree with that!" Or they may say: "Jesus said that 2,000 years ago, so it doesn't apply today." This is the kind of reasoning even millions of professing Christians use to get around scores of plain and clear biblical teachings.<br><br>exerpt taken from Roderick C. Meredith</div>

Our sins are cleansed away. Praise God! So every time God looks at us, it will be as if we are sinless bcos of the blood of Jesus &amp; the Cross. He will look at times when we are faithful instead of times when we were unfaithful. Thank God!</div>
