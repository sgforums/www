              <p>When the debate motion is framed in a neutral manner as "Does God Exist?" both sides of the debate must present their arguments for or against. Atheists can no longer take the easy way out by alleging that the burden of proof rests upon the theist.</p>

              <p>Firstly, if u attend enough church, the "god's" words can easily

              <p>Secondly, millions of innocent people have been killed and

              <p> </p>
              <p>Thirdly, if we ask all faithful believers to pray that there

I will basically argue from the standpoint of Logical Absolutes, Objective Moral Intuitions and Problem of Evil.

              <p><br>This thread is primarily to debate and discuss the motion "Does God Exist?" so feel free to share your views. We can simply debate the merits of theism or atheism first and then later debate on why I think if there is a God that it is the one revealed in the Bible. I suggest to discuss Biblical Inerrancy in the other thread I started on the Word of God. While related they are quite distinct issues.</p>
              <p>Yes, I am familiar with the Christian apologists you mentioned, though I have read more by Craig than the others. Plantinga does not really write for the layman in my view.</p>
              <p>Lets start with the kalam cosmological argument then, defended most robustly by William Lane Craig.</p>

              do, but it won't get you anywhere</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>12.When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called
              insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called
              Religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>13.Everything is more or less organized matter. To think so is
              against religion, but I think so just the same. When did I realize
              I was God? Well, I was praying and I suddenly realized I was

              introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined,
              and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch toward
              uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half
              of the world fools and the other half hypocrites.â€�</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>16. Religion easily has the best bullshit story of all time.
              Think about it. Religion has convinced people that thereâ€™s an
              invisible manâ€¦living in the sky. Who watches everything you do
              every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a list of ten
              specific things he doesnâ€™t want you to do. And if you do any of
              these things, he will send you to a special place, of burning and
              fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever, and
              suffer, and burn, and scream, until the end of time. But he loves
              you. He loves you. He loves you and he needs money</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>17.Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day; teach a man to
              fish and he will eat for a lifetime; give a man religion and he
              will die praying for a fish.</p>

              <p>I assume that u r talking about the Christian god?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, if u attend enough church, the "god's" words can easily be translated to "worship me or I'll torture u forever. Have a nice day."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, millions of innocent people have been killed and tortured ever since the introduction of Christianity. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thirdly, if we ask all faithful believers to pray that there will b peace and harmony in the world, it will not happen. </p>

              <p><br>Yes I am referring to the God that Christians worship.</p>
              <p>1. You have confused translation with interpretation. Anyway, Christians worship God not because they are terrified of hell. Kids don't love their parents because they are afraid of being caned. You seem to have a pretty warped view of relationships.</p>
              <p>2. I agree that millions of people have been killed since Christianity was introduced 2000 years ago. But just because event B followed event A it does not mean that A caused B. Anyway, neither Christ nor the NT teaches believers to kill innocent people.</p>
              <p>3. Peace is not just the absence of war and physical conflict. The Bible does not teach that the existence of God means the absence of conflict in this present time. We live in a fallen world but a time will come when there will be no more tears and wars. God will draw the final curtain on human history.</p>
              <p>Anyway to sum up, none of your three points above have any relevance to the issue of whether God exists. If you think there is, you would have to argue your case.</p>

              <p>My reponse - Consider the question "What created time?"

The assertion presented is that since everytime thing that begins to exist in the universe has a cause, therefore the universe has a cause.

              <p>If I am not wrong, it is agreed that time, space and matter (catch all phrase for the universe) had a beginning. Secular folks call it "The Big Bang" that supposedly happened billions of years ago. The Bible calls it "The Beginning" that took place about 6000 years ago. But the recent scientific conclusion that the universe has a beginning merely confirms what the Bible has been saying for millennia.</p>
              <p>Causality simply requires that effects have causes. If time is an effect, then its cause must be outside of time. There is NOTHING contradictory or self-refuting about that at all. I am not saying that there was a time before time began. The Bible does not begin this way either. BTW, that fits very well with the Biblical view of God, who stands outside of time (dwells in eternity) and created time. Our finite brain hurts to think of what eternity is like because we are space bound and time bound.</p>
              <p>You argue that it is a fallacy of composition to say that the universe must have a cause. You have failed to understand the Kalam argument. It says that everything that has a beginning must have a cause. The universe has a beginning, therefore it must have a cause. There is no fallacy here at all, not even one of composition.</p>
              <p>It is true that the Kalam argument only tells us just so much about what the cause must be, but not much more. However, at this point we have already one less atheist in the world. We simply need to move on and see if there is anything else that might reveal more of what this cause is like. But I am sure you appreciate the point that this timeless, spaceless, immaterial cause fits very well with the Biblical God.</p>

              <p>Just to be clear about one point, I'm not here for the fun of anything. If you do not intend to have a serious discussion, then really there's no point going on. If you are going to make a mockery out of this thread and forum then let's just end it here. Because I think it is disrespectful to the other person who take it seriously that you are just doing it for the fun of it. I mean, you can have fun discussing things in the sense that you have enjoyed it. But if means by having fun that you don't intend to invest any seriousness to it then it is meaningless.</p>

              <p><em><span style="font-size: large;">W</span>hat you don't understand is that it is possible to be an atheist, it is possible<br>not to know if God exists or why He should, and yet to believe that man does<br>not live in a state of nature but in history, and that history as we know it now<br>began with Christ, it was founded by Him on the Gospels.</em><br>~ Boris Pasternak</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: large;">N</span>o one can be an unbeliever nowadays. The Christian Apologists have left one<br>nothing to disbelieve.</em><br>~ Hector Hugh Munro</p>

              <p><em><span style="font-size: large;">A</span>mong the repulsions of atheism for me has been its drastic uninterestingness<br>as an intellectual position.

              <p><em><span style="font-size: large;">A</span>theism is rather in the life than in the heart of man.</em> <br>~ Francis Bacon</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: large;">A</span>theism is the result of ignorance and pride; of strong sense and feeble reasons;<br>of good eating and ill-living. It is the plague of society, the corrupter of manners,<br>and the underminer of property.</em><br>~ Jeremy Collier</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: large;">A</span> disbelief in God does not result in a belief in nothing; disbelief in God usually<br>results in a belief in anything.</em><br>~Arthur Lynch</p>

              <p><em><span style="font-size: large;">A</span>n atheist is one who hopes the Lord will do nothing to disturb his disbelief.</em><br>~ Franklin P. Jones</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: large;">T</span>o doubt is not sin, but to be contented to remain in doubt when God has<br>provided "many infallible proofs" to cure it, is.</em><br>~ Irwin H. Linton</p>

              <p>Firstly, there is no such thing as a neutral or unbiased person. You are not even one yourself to begin with, for crying out loud.</p>
              <p>Secondly, what we should be examining are the arguments presented. Arguments and views may be biased but we still need to examine them on their own merits for validity and soundness.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, why should dinosaurs worship God? Only humans are created in the image of God and can have fellowship with God.</p>

              <p>It is absolutely impossible to expect the christians to be unbiased, it is like asking the muslims to eat pork.    Christianity is a religion or faith as the christians called it which God is suppose to be number ONE and centre of their lives.    God is the alpha and omega to them this is what the bible is teaching.    Anything not of God is considered satanic.</p>
              <p>Yes, I believe in the existence of God but God is a bias God, selectively having favours to whom he wants to help and love.   I have seen how evil christians are so blessed at the same time they are evil to the innocent and the God keeps blessing them.     IT IS CLAIMED THAT GOD HAS AGAPE LOVE, so untrue, IT IS ALL CRAP! If it is agape love why only help some and neglect the rest and worst allow he evil christians to give hell to the innocent.   Bible is very contradicting and is overrated by christians.   Don't forget he favours Israel, this has been written at least a few times in the bible.   It is said he is a perfect god ,   a god that practises partiality is absolutely 100 percent not perfect.      Bless the evil kind of God I don't respect.</p>
              <p>Basically, you need to be willing to be brainwashed to become a christian.   Thank goodness I have woken up no longer brainwashed.   Thank you god for not delivering what you promise and all the evil christians' evil work.  </p>
              <p>They the christians are not neutral.  In fact in the bible it is said they are not to judge but they judge.     They are very fast to jump to conclusion to point fingers that it is you , you and you ......    blah blah blah.      Thank goodness, I have overcome the shit of it the faith!!!!</p>

              <p>Just to be clear about one point, I'm not here for the fun of
              anything. If you do not intend to have a serious discussion, then
              really there's no point going on. If you are going to make a

              Because I think it is disrespectful to the other person who take it
              seriously that you are just doing it for the fun of it. I mean, you
              can have fun discussing things in the sense that you have enjoyed
              it. But if means by having fun that you don't intend to invest
              any seriousness to it then it is meaningless.</p>

              <p>I have fun in the sense of enjoying what I do and discuss. Everything in life is and can be really fun, if only it'd be given the chance to be. I'm certain you can tell from my replies that they have been serious and intellectually defensible thus far. I don't wish to call this ad hominem per se; but it seems to me, that you have a propensity of shooting down our discussion on emotional grounds by means of the claim that critics aren't serious about these discussions.</p>
              <p>Not sure how to multi quote your previous reply but I'll try to squeeze what I can in here. Time is not an effect; time is a pre-requisite for cause and effect. Causality is necessarily temporal, which means it involves an a priori "before" and "after". The concept of before and after is absurd, not to mention self contradictory in the absence of time. Kalam works by an appeal to our cognitive faculties. We observe that "in this universe", everything that begins to exist has a cause. It is then said that therefore, the universe has a cause. But how are we to ascertain if causality exists "outside the universe" if all we've got are occurences of causality "in the universe"? This is the fallacy of composition which I'm referring to. I would also like to add that Kalam does not compel people from atheism, because of the plethora of "creators". One could just as well believe that a blue potato was the uncaused, changless and timeless creator without necessarily believing that said blue potato is a supernatural diety.</p>
