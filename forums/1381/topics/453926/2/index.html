              <p>It is absolutely impossible to expect the christians to be unbiased, it is like asking the muslims to eat pork.    Christianity is a religion or faith as the christians called it which God is suppose to be number ONE and centre of their lives.    God is the alpha and omega to them this is what the bible is teaching.    Anything not of God is considered satanic.</p>
              <p>Yes, I believe in the existence of God but God is a bias God, selectively having favours to whom he wants to help and love.   I have seen how evil christians are so blessed at the same time when they are evil to the innocent and the God keeps blessing them.     IT IS CLAIMED THAT GOD HAS AGAPE LOVE, so untrue, IT IS ALL CRAP!   Bible is very contradicting and is overrated by christians.   Don't forget he favours Israel, this has been written at least a few times in the bible. </p>
              <p>Basically, you need to be willing to be brainwashed to become a christian.   Thank goodness I have woken up no longer brainwashed.   Thank you god for not delivering what you promise and all the evil christians' evil work.  </p>
              <p>They the christians are not neutral.  In fact in the bible it is said they are not to judge but they judge.     They are very fast to jump to conclusion to point fingers that it is you , you and you ......    blah blah blah.      Thank goodness, I have overcome the shit of it the faith!!!!</p>

              <p>1. It is impossible NOT to be biased. Show me a person with zero bias and I will show you a non-human.</p>
              <p>2. You said you believe in the existence of God. OK, that means you are not an atheist. But if so, what kind of God do you believe in? What can you know about this God and what do you know about this God? Where you get your information about this God from?</p>
              <p>3. There are professing Christians who soil the name of Christ and there are true Christians who live out the faith even though they continue to struggle with sin in their lives. That's part of life. Why point to so-called evil Christians to justify your rejection of Christianity? Why not look at the lives of exemplary Christians and believe? Biased aren't you?</p>
              <p>4. Yes, God chose Israel. But if you have any knowledge of the Bible at all you would have noted that God judged Israel harshly too at times.</p>
              <p>5. Yes, Christians need to be brainwashed. Paul tells us to be renewed in our minds. Either you are brainwashed by the Bible or you are brainwashed by worldly wisdom. You have opted for the latter.</p>
              <p>6. You failed your Bible knowledge. The Bible did not say not to judge. Please note the proper context. It teaches that we should not judge maliciously and hypocritically. Believers are called to judge right from wrong, truth from error.</p>
              <p>7. It seems that what you left was not Christianity, but a distortion of the faith. You never really entered the true faith judging by your distorted ideas about what Christianity is about.</p>

              <p>I have fun in the sense of enjoying what I do and discuss. Everything in life is and can be really fun, if only it'd be given the chance to be. I'm certain you can tell from my replies that they have been serious and intellectually defensible thus far. I don't wish to call this ad hominem per se; but it seems to me, that you have a propensity of shooting down our discussion on emotional grounds by means of the claim that critics aren't serious about these discussions.</p>

              <p>I don't presume to know your background but I can certainly form my judgement based on my experience with reading your postings. By my lights they do not reveal someone who is really informed about Christianity. What you rejected is hardly the God of the Bible. I have had bad things done to me by those whom have called me their dearest brother in Christ. But that's no reason to turn my back on God.</p>
              <p>If you think my words are harsh on you, I say it is different strokes for different folks. If you come across nicely I assure you that I can be as gentle as a lamb and handle you with care. Perhaps you have not realised how judgemental you are in your replies.</p>

              <p>1. It is impossible NOT to be biased. Show me a person with zero
              bias and I will show you a non-human.</p>
              <p>2. You said you believe in the existence of God. OK, that means
              you are not an atheist. But if so, what kind of God do you believe
              in? What can you know about this God and what do you know about
              this God? Where you get your information about this God from?</p>
              <p>3. There are professing Christians who soil the name of Christ
              and there are true Christians who live out the faith even though
              they continue to struggle with sin in their lives. That's part of
              life. Why point to so-called evil Christians to justify your
              rejection of Christianity? Why not look at the lives of exemplary
              Christians and believe? Biased aren't you?</p>
              <p>4. Yes, God chose Israel. But if you have any knowledge of the
              Bible at all you would have noted that God judged Israel harshly
              too at times.</p>
              <p>5. Yes, Christians need to be brainwashed. Paul tells us to be
              renewed in our minds. Either you are brainwashed by the Bible or
              you are brainwashed by worldly wisdom. You have opted for the
              latter.</p>
              <p>6. You failed your Bible knowledge. The Bible did not say not to
              judge. Please note the proper context. It teaches that we should
              not judge maliciously and hypocritically. Believers are called to
              judge right from wrong, truth from error.</p>
              <p>7. It seems that what you left was not Christianity, but a
              distortion of the faith. You never really entered the true faith
              judging by your distorted ideas about what Christianity is
              about.</p>

              <p>To all: Temperance is stressed time and time again in the bible. I know, me included, many are not temperate at times. Hence, chill or it will be ludicrous to fight for Christ without the fruit of the spirit.</p>
              <p>Plus, there is only one Chrisitanity, the only way (John 14:6). </p>
