              <p>Even Hawkings concede the point of singularity, that time has a
                  beginning. Again Kalam states that what began to exist must have a
                  cause. There is again no logical flaw in this premise. Neither is
                  there one in the case of the finite universe requiring a cause.
                  What has been established is that the universe did not always
                  exist. Logic then demands that something must have caused it to
                  exist, even if it is timeless and outside of this universe, an idea
                  that you are apparently not comfortable with. Whether we can
                  ascertain anything outside our universe is irrelevant to the
                  argument about causation. You would be confusing the proof with the
                  logic of the argument.</p>
              <p>Even, if for the sake of argument, you wish to argue that the
                  cause of the universe is many creators, we can invoke Occam's Razor
                  and dispense with the many when all we need is just ONE being or
                  entity capable of creating the universe. Is God the same as a
                  blue potato? What properties do you wish to endow your blue potato
                  with? How you know it is blue? Blue is a property of matter, and
                  thus fails the immaterial attribute you mentioned earlier. Again
                  remember, whatever this cause is, it must at least be timeless,
                  immaterial, all powerful (to be able to bring the universe to
                  existence), and personal (to be able to exercise the choice to
                  create the universe).</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hawkings has conceded that time has begun to exist, no doubt. There are 3 possibilities if the universe has a beginning in time. Either time begins with the universe, time began for a finite time before the universe, or time existed for an infinite period before the universe. Kalam rejects the last 2 possiblities so we'll just go with the first one. If the act of God creating the universe coincided with time in the beginning of the universe, then that act must have began to exist. This means the act must have had a cause (God). The cause (God) must have also began to exist, and so an infinite regress threatens.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Suppose, then, that God starts time before the universe. Perhaps he has a countdown: "5, 4, 3, 2, 1... kaboom!" In this case, the beginning of time would be an event in the mind of God - the start of the countdown. But here again, if God's act of starting the countdown is the beginning of time, that act begins to exist, and the temporal cosmological argument requires that that act also have a cause. Once again the infinite regress abyss yawns. Furthermore, as the British philosopher Le Poidevin pointed out, the 3rd premise of Kalam will be false if time was eternal or if time existed as a close loop with each moment preceding and following each moment.</span></p>
              <p>Kalam claims that the cause of the universe is outside "the universe" Hence, it is of upmost importance that we verify how causality works outside of the universe. How then, can it be said that the universe MUST be caused if one does not know if causality even exists outside of the universe! The assumption of Kalam is that since what we observe in this universe follows the line of cause and effect, therefore the universe must also follow the principle of cause and effect. Which is like I pointed out, a fallacy of composition.</p>
              <p>Occams Razor is a very interesting concept. I'm glad you brought that up. You see, Occams Razor does nothing to demonstrate what is true, it only demonstrates what is simple. Furthermore, if Occams Razor were to be employed, would the American physicist Lawrence Krauss be correct in asserting that the universe began out of virutal particles (a view quite a number of physicists hold - Alan Guth, Michio Kaku, Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson). Blue is immaterial, blue is a concept. Blue is simply something affected by photon diffraction on a line spectrum. Photons themselves have no rest mass; so cannot be considered material.</p>

              <p>If you ask me, I think it is pointless to argue what was prior to "In the beginning God...". It's just academic. But we all agree that there was a beginning. The clock started ticking. If it started then something must have caused it to start. Now, we already said that whatever created the universe must be timeless, so why do you now suggest that it is not and thus requires a cause? We can either go infinite regress which explains nothing or we start with a necessary being God. There is nothing illogical about an uncaused cause.</p>
              <p>Let's again not confuse the proof with the logic of the argument. Like it or not, there is no way we can transcend our confines to observe anything outside the universe. This is our limitation. But this does not in anyway proves that there is no cause that is outside of the universe. Cause and effect is a universal law, so it is perfectly logical and reasonable to apply it to the universe. Remember, your issue is more of how to verify the cause, not that there is no cause. Agnosticism about the cause is not the same as denial of the cause.</p>
              <p>Occam's Razor is a method of reasoning, not a proof of anything. It is invoked to remove UNNECESSARY entities to explain something. The simpler the explanation it should be PREFERRED over those that multipliy entities unneccessarily. There is no need to burden ourselves with extra entities when a simpler one is available.</p>

              <p>You are not my choice of christian to share with you .     To me you are a nasty christian whom I don't think it is wise for me to share.    I have shared with the very few pleasant and non judgemental christians and you don't belong to this category.    You sound destructive than being spirit filled to love souls to win souls for God.   All you are doing is building walls against non believers.    I have seen too many of your kind around in churches, work places, and social setting</p>

              <p>I have been a Christian long enough to say that I do have a pretty good understanding of Christianity which is more than adequate to point out where your misunderstanding is. But what has that got to do with being here and posting? Yes, Christians admit that we are screwed up, which is why we need a Saviour. And so do you.</p>
