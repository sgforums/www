              <p>wrong concept. A person need to be willing to accept Jesus is the saviour of him/herself. Then pray the repentance prayer seriously and sincerely (not a hypocrite), then the holy spirit will come into him/her and the person will be a Christian ( baptism of the holy spirit). Once again, for a person to see his sin depraved self, the holy spirit will need to come into him. Who will get the holy spirit is up to God election and do not discredit me here for saying that God is selfish or what or claims this is a paradox (which trolls like to do), God is our creator which have exclusive rights to decide on our fate. </p>

              <p>Time is not an effect; time is a pre-requisite for cause and effect. Causality is necessarily temporal, which means it involves an a priori "before" and "after". The concept of before and after is absurd, not to mention self contradictory in the absence of time. Kalam works by an appeal to our cognitive faculties. We observe that "in this universe", everything that begins to exist has a cause. It is then said that therefore, the universe has a cause. But how are we to ascertain if causality exists "outside the universe" if all we've got are occurences of causality "in the universe"? This is the fallacy of composition which I'm referring to. I would also like to add that Kalam does not compel people from atheism, because of the plethora of "creators". One could just as well believe that a blue potato was the uncaused, changless and timeless creator without necessarily believing that said blue potato is a supernatural diety.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Even Hawkings concede the point of singularity, that time has a beginning. Again Kalam states that what began to exist must have a cause. There is again no logical flaw in this premise. Neither is there one in the case of the finite universe requiring a cause. What has been established is that the universe did not always exist. Logic then demands that something must have caused it to exist, even if it is timeless and outside of this universe, an idea that you are apparently not comfortable with. Whether we can ascertain anything outside our universe is irrelevant to the argument about causation. You would be confusing the proof with the logic of the argument.</p>
              <p>Even, if for the sake of argument, you wish to argue that the cause of the universe is many creators, we can invoke Occam's Razor and dispense with the many when all we need is just ONE being or entity capable of creating the universe. Is God the same as a blue potato? What properties do you wish to endow your blue potato with? How you know it is blue? Blue is a property of matter, and thus fails the immaterial attribute you mentioned earlier. Again remember, whatever this cause is, it must at least be timeless, immaterial, all powerful (to be able to bring the universe to existence), and personal (to be able to exercise the choice to create the universe).</p>

              <p>From your postings you did not show you have proper knowledge of God or the Bible or the Christian faith, so why should I not be suspicious of your claims? Unless you wish to tell me that you were only a Christian for a few weeks and that you were not properly taught in the faith, even though you were sincere about it.</p>

              <p>I will put it nicely that it is an epic fail of Bible interpretation. Matt 7 is not a command against judging. Again you need to know basic rules of hermeneutics, and look at the context. But just to convince you that you failed, I shall refer you to this <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/do-not-judge.html">http://www.gotquestions.org/do-not-judge.html</a></p>
              <p>Now, if you got questions you know where to go, ya?</p>

              <p>Christians may fail him, but God will not. If winsomeea is really looking for love God is just a prayer away. And God can direct him to people who can show him all the affection he needs.</p>
              <p>But methinks you still need to give him that chill pill.</p>

              <p>I give u one week to find god and show him to the world. If u can't find god, then Christianity is a bunch of lie. If u can find god, I be all Christians's slave forever. By finding god, I mean calling him down from heaven and then make him show himself to the world. </p>
