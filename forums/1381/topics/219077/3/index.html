It is like asking the question - how many angels did God create? Obviously we dunno the answer .. and only God knows.<br><br>Regarding the article .. I have problems no matter how I read it.

To use logic would mean that the creator cant be created. Whether our assumption is right or wrong, the author is unaware of the fact that the creator cant be created.<br><br>Vince says here that the 'thing' creating God can be anyone or NoOne.(seen from the latter). Which means that under this statement, 'anyone' creating God is also part of the possibility. Now this contridicts with the fact that the creator cant be created, which is generated by logic.<br></div>

Mr Sankaran HAS TO deal with this question: <strong>Who created God?</strong> For a site intended to answer basic Christian question, it will come up. Whether he is capable in answering this question or not is another question.<br>2. He said he does not know the answer. Honest enough.<br>3. So he ask another question: <strong>Who knows the answer?</strong> Obviously no one human has this answer. Then who has? Only God has the answer.<br>4. I don't see any inferences in whether is was God who created God, or someone created God, or that God had a beginning.... only that God has the answer, and the concluding statement is: we'd rather have God on our side when we ask this question than God not on our side when we meet Him.<br><br>personally, I don't see anything wrong with the answers that Mr Sankaran had given, it's simplistic, yes, and may not appeal to those who want a higher level of philosophy, but it don't think that it was his intention to engage anyone for a high level philosophical discussion.<br><br>if it's anything else, I think that it is more orthodox than many Christian websites in some foreign land.</div>

Mr Sankaran HAS TO deal with this question: [b]Who created God?</strong> For a site intended to answer basic Christian question, it will come up. Whether he is capable in answering this question or not is another question.<br>2. He said he does not know the answer. Honest enough.<br>3. So he ask another question: <strong>Who knows the answer?</strong> Obviously no one human has this answer. Then who has? Only God has the answer.<br>4. I don't see any inferences in whether is was God who created God, or someone created God, or that God had a beginning.... only that God has the answer, and the concluding statement is: we'd rather have God on our side when we ask this question than God not on our side when we meet Him.<br><br>personally, I don't see anything wrong with the answers that Mr Sankaran had given, it's simplistic, yes, and may not appeal to those who want a higher level of philosophy, but it don't think that it was his intention to engage anyone for a high level philosophical discussion.<br><br>if it's anything else, I think that it is more orthodox than many Christian websites in some foreign land.[/b]</blockquote>God has the answer .. to what question?<br><br>I regret to say most people who are seeking answer are more intelligent than that. Just think, if you are not intelligent, you won't even ask such a philosophical question.<br><br>There is something wrong with his answer because we all know the answer (the standard answer) that is different from his answer. If we all know the answer, how come no-one knows the answer?</div>
