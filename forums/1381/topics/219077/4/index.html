Scripture teaches that God is a spirit and doesnt have physical parts like a man(John 4:24) The bible uses anthropomorphic expressions, such as"the hand of God" only to accommodate our human incapacity to think in any other terms. The strong prohibitation against man's representing God by graven image was given becauseno one had ever seen God; therefore, no one could know wad he looks like. Nothing on earth can represent his spirit(deut 4:15-23)<br><br>The image of God in man has to do, rather, with personality. According to D.M. edwards, ""Man has a free, self consious, rational personality like that of God. A nature, capable of distinguishing right and wrong, and of ascending to the hights of spiritual attainment and communication with God""<br><br>The feeling qualities of feeling, sorrow, communicateing and desire for relationship are part of His personality<br><br>--The original man was intelligent. he could give names to all the animals when they were presented to him(gen2:19-20). He had the power of reasoning and thought, as displayed by SIS. In speaking, he could connect words and ideas. he could and did commune with God.<br><br>--Moral and spiritual qualities differenciated humankind from all other creatures. God's image gave then an awareness, a sense of right and wrong(gen. 3)This 'knowing' from God means that God's people love love and hate evil and differenciate between the two options. This is not an optional software! the new testament calls this 'conscience'.<br><br>--Individual seperateness distinguishes the God and mankind from each other-each beinghis own person. All people are endowed with God's image and seperate form all other ppl. Obviously,I am not you and you r not me and neither of us is God.<br><br>The significance of this seperatenessis that it clarifies our understanding of God as an approchable individual. He is not an amorphous blob, a genie, a pgost, or even 'the force'. We can communicate person-to-person and understand each other.<br></div>
