              In my opinion this looks like another thread that begs to be locked. BTW have you ever tried googling for the answer? Try searching it on Creation.com for the answer to this common question and a host of others.

              <p>this is a valid, but good question.</p>
              <p>this is the paradox of creationism theory isnt it. there is a chinese saying, bu gong zi buo meaning, no need to attack, will self destruct by itself. similarly the notion is flawed from the outset.</p>

              Alex,
              
              I shall assume you are sincere in your question and not be like Tcmc.
              
              Have you tried Creation.com? The answer is that Adam and Eve had other sons and daughters who married each other, see Gen 5:4. This us the most sound and Biblical answer. Pre-Adamite races or separately created humans simply do not make the cut.

              <p>Look around you. Even if there are knowledgable christians in here, do you think it is healthy to debate or to discuss the differences of our denominations before being de-railed by haters, trolls and anti-religioun anti- christian zealots ?</p>
              <p>I am sure there are plenty of knowledgable christians, be it in scriptures, about the faith.. the church or whatever. But the discussions can go no where as you can clearly see.</p>
