              I think it is more the case that you are here having a fun time engaging in Christisn/Bible bashing. When a Christian replies you will be more than happy to poke holes at it. Seems to me you just want to see how far you can make fun of and humiliate the Christian faith.

              <p>Wow, I was asking about some Christianity questions and then I
                      came into this thread, and then I realize, not sure if I had wasted
                      my time posting a new thread... the Christians don't believe this
                      way and if they do, I have no confidence in their answers... it's a
                      total contradiction from God's teachings...</p>

              <p>LoL...</p>
              <p>Let me get this right.</p>
              <p>First of all, you got these trolls.. they come in. And they talk so much shit. And when someone responds. They are not mature and not christian like. Because mature christians do not believe in such a way.</p>
              <p>Do you know how ridiculous that sounds ? So how are u supposed to find answers when in a situation of conflict ? So we all just gonna stand there , turn the left cheek and let you guys slap it too ? Is that what u are saying ?</p>
              <p>So you can come in here.. kick us i the nuts, spit in our faces and to show you guys how Christian we are, we have to recieve it with a smile. Is that what u are saying ?</p>
              <p>And then u gys come INTO a Christian Forum n say the Christian God is fake.. its not real. We are all stupid and ignorant.. WHILE demanding us holding thrue to the Christian belief ? And that is alrite ? That is so reighteous ?</p>
              <p>THAT is exactly WHY... I wont stand for it. Somebody has to stand up and point to what these trolls are doing is wrong. And if you think what I am doing, standing up to what is right as being a troll is wrong, you have no sense of justice. No sense of honour and integrity.</p>

                  sgforums is.. the history remains forever… at least on the net.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">In my secondary, I had a gal friend who is a passionate
                  christian, and she did once made me sit down in the canteen, and reading with
                  her on The Daily Bread. Well, after that I told her I am not prepared to accept
                  Christ in my life, but she was understanding, and we still remain friends.<br> <br> In my JC, I had a gal friend who is passionate about Christianity, for her
                  Jesus is everything, but we still get along, altho her passion scares other
                  Christians away. So left me one guy only talk with her.<br> <br> For me, aiyah, passionate or not, it doesnt matter, as long as they not
                  overbearing, like keep pestering or even saying wrong things during an
                  emergency like the above, just make sure dont be so overbearing and in the end
                  piss people off. But at same time, everyone here should try to communicate with
                  everyone...its challenging to communicate with someone so different, so
                  passionate...try it!</p>

                  have over internet content, especially with regards to using the religious
                  harmony act.<br> <br> Since its mabbe quite limited, some people use this chance to profess their
                  hypocritical views on other religions here, which they couldnt do outside since
                  they could be immediately be held under citizen arrest by people who are
                  listening.<br> <br> But it will be helpful to post some legal statutes here so that we can see how

                  Which means 2233 hours.<span>  </span>But that can be
                  shortened if I skip every 2 pages. Time can be shortened of course by giving it
                  out to employees that have too much free time and don’t mind a little bit of

              <p>At the moment I am pointing out the differences from a Moderated forum and an unmoderated forum.</p>
              <p>If we cannot agree that Moderators do make a difference, then I am compelled to take the long and hard road. Time and time again I expressed my intention that I will cease and desist as long as you.. Laurence82 stop supporting your trolls. But time and time again you refuse to come down to an understanding and work towards a reconciliation. I have always believed that mediation can come out from conflict. I am wrong now. It cannot work on forums as long as you cannot see the person face to face instead, they hide behind thier computers promoting conflicts.</p>
              <p>Hence, somebody has to do it. If we cannot agree and reconcile now, then I have no choice but to go piece by piece.. posts by posts detailing from 2005 to 2009. The fall of the Moderators then, the reasons, the trolls form both christians and non-christians. Non-christian trolls supported by non- other than Laurence82. Lets not forget, I came in actively into Eternal Hope in late 2009.</p>

              <p>“I am not sure how much of jurisdiction can the goverment have over internet content, especially with regards to using the religious harmony act.<br><br>Since its mabbe quite limited, some people use this chance to profess their hypocritical views on other religions here, which they couldnt do outside since they could be immediately be held under citizen arrest by people who are listening.<br><br>But it will be helpful to post some legal statutes here so that we can see how much of that act has been flouted here.<br><br>cheers”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This is July 2004. Don’t believe me ? Read the content of the thread.</span></p>

              <p>“btw, if anyone say i am pursuing an agenda here, yes i am, but not against Christians, but its about religious sensitivity... <span><img src="/C:/Users/BLACKB~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif" alt="Cool" width="15" height="15"></span>, so i hope i wont be called anti christ or something...<br><br>The last time i discuss this seriously when someone also raise abt the same topic last time...not abt ancestors, but generally on non believers too...<br><br>but i am glad we guys discuss this in a nice non flaming manner.. <span><img src="/C:/Users/BLACKB~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif" alt="Cool" width="15" height="15"></span>”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">-This is where we can see his motive and ‘agenda’ reveal itself. This is the beginning of his crusade. Notice how offensive posts are edited by then moderator SillyMe . Notice how discussion still being civil.</span></p>

              <p>They may call out the Lord's name everytime, but they aint bad.<br><br>Besides, my friends from those churches turn out all right, and quite mature too.<br><br>You should see instead the behaviour of some Christians from traditional churches in this forum. Absolutely disgusting.”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Still reasonable. Mentioning of trolls like Aloska is natural. U will always have one or two of them people like those around.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This thread is on Christians dating non Christians. The discussion inside is very civil. No personal attacks. No demeaning remarks. No supportive comments by trolls on trolls. All is nice and dandy.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Notice how the discussions are STILL civil. With your usual StupidIsSmart explaining away why it isn’t so. But interestly, Laurence82 actually partaked in a meaningful discussion. Good times to read. I remember reading them.</span></p>

              <p>I admit, its going to take some time to form a timeline. Given that your posts are 111,665 at 12/12 06.22am.<span> </span> And that is 248 times more than Hasene’s. Which means 2233 hours.<span> </span> But that can be shortened if I skip every 2 pages. Time can be shortened of course by giving it out to employees that have too much free time and don’t mind a little bit of bonus.</p>
              <p>But it does bring back some good memories. The good old times when we at least saw eye to eye. But that will all change in 2008. Leading up to 2009.</p>

              <p>This is one piece of work you did here, must have spent lots of time.</p>
              <p>Talking about old time, still remember learning a lot from the discussions among, Chin Eng, NeonTetra, breytonhartge, Honeybunz, Icemoon, Stupidissmart, Miracles &amp; Prophecies....and even John The Baptist and Dr Who. Many non Christians voiced their views, but much much less of offensive ridicules and names callings.</p>

              <p><br> I think it is more the case that you are here having a fun time
              engaging in Christisn/Bible bashing. When a Christian replies you
              will be more than happy to poke holes at it. Seems to me you just
              want to see how far you can make fun of and humiliate the Christian
