              <p>Precisely, that's the way life is. How do we know anything?</p>
              <p>1. Personal Experience</p>
              <p>2. Authority (parents, teachers, professors, scientists,
                  sacred books etc)</p>
              <p>When it comes to intelligent life out there, short of you going
                  to outer space by yourself, we simply have to depend on what others
                  say, those we consider as authorities. Humanly speaking, no one has
                  seen intelligent life aka little green men out there. If Buddha is
                  your choice of authority, then you just have to trust what he
                  says.</p>

              <p>You say that now we have to go to outer space ourselves to be 100% sure that there is extraterrestrial life. But then for your eternal places, you apply special pleading error and say that "it doesnt mean if we never go there it's not there"</p>

              <p>Moreover, the theories of alien life is not based on faith. And no one says 100% that there is alien life. Alien life is not just based on a 4000 year old book. It;s based on astronomy, biochemistry, evolution etc.</p>

              <p>You know exactly what I meant.</p>
              <p>There are studies that show that brain activity is responsible for consciousness, or awareness and perception. Of course you would rather believe that there is consciousness after death (without a shred of evidence) than believe in these research studies?</p>

              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>Underlying that above reasoning is the fallacy that truth is a matter of personal preference. One's mode of transport is one's preference. No one is saying that it is wrong to take a car or a bicycle to work. Debating matters of taste and preference to me is a pretty waste of time. But if we are serious about truth, then we cannot afford to take a relativistic approach to truth, which is rather self-refuting anyway. Whatever the superficial similarities we see between religions, the fact is that the differences are deep and often times contradictory. Only a callous disregard for truth will lead anyone to say that it matters not what one believes, especially when we are dealing with matters of eternal consequences.</p>
              <p>I don't know who said this but I find this quote rather true to what the Bible teaches: All roads lead to God. It's where He sends you that matters.</p>

              <p>Confirmation bias - using only ur religious book to prove a

              <p>Arguing in circles - Back to same point</p>
              <p>Special pleading - you can use bible as evidence while others
              cnanot use their religious books as evidence</p>
              <p>Appeal to "authority"</p>
