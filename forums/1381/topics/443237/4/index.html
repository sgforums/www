              Because nothing in your postings suggest you are sincerely seeking for answers. You are merely engaging in elephant hurling and trying to justify your abandoning of the Christian faith but bashing it. You show no knowledge of the standard apologetic answers to your questions and keep repeating the old canards that have long been addressed. You say I don't have the answers, but yet you whine about the Christian websites that I point to you. There's no intellectual honesty and integrity displayed by you at all.

              Well, Tcmc mentioned that many Christians do not believe in a young earth. Well then, why is Tcmc not convinced by them either? So please don't give the lame excuse that it is my young earth views that bother you or him.

              <p>Let me get this right.</p>
              <p>First of all, you got these trolls.. they come in. And they talk so much shit. And when someone responds. They are not mature and not christian like. Because mature christians do not believe in such a way.</p>
              <p>Do you know how ridiculous that sounds ? So how are u supposed to find answers when in a situation of conflict ? So we all just gonna stand there , turn the left cheek and let you guys slap it too ? Is that what u are saying ?</p>
              <p>So you can come in here.. kick us i the nuts, spit in our faces and to show you guys how Christian we are, we have to recieve it with a smile. Is that what u are saying ?</p>
              <p>And then u gys come INTO a Christian Forum n say the Christian God is fake.. its not real. We are all stupid and ignorant.. WHILE demanding us holding thrue to the Christian belief ? And that is alrite ? That is so reighteous ?</p>
              <p>THAT is exactly WHY... I wont stand for it. Somebody has to stand up and point to what these trolls are doing is wrong. And if you think what I am doing, standing up to what is right as being a troll is wrong, you have no sense of justice. No sense of honour and integrity.</p>

But you jumping to assumptions and judging others anyhow... you really need to read the bible sia... totally contradict the bible teachings... And while making a stand is correct, but God do not encourage you to kill someone just because they did something you don't like...

              <p><br> Exactly. Apparently I have not yet spent enough time. Now I have to set aside some time to do this. To slowly painfully piece this entire picture together. But somebody's got to do it. We been here long enough. We seen enough. We know what its like and what's not. 
                                
                                I assure you I do not like doing this.</p>
              <p>It takes up my personal time. It takes away my booze time.. my smoking time  my chillax time and my  climax time. I am a reasonable person. Its only when the unreasonable happens when I am forced to do wat I don't like to do. And the only consolation I get from that is to reveal the truth about the person.</p>

              <p>First of all, from my understanding, God is very forgiving and
                      from the bible teachings, we are supposed to lead by example.
                      Secondly, they are not kicking you in the nuts and certainly not
                      spitting at your faces, unless you can download saliva from the
                      modem nowadays and apply them to your face. Thirdly, since when did
                      I say God is fake. My conscience is totally clear. But you
                      jumping to assumptions and judging others anyhow... you really need
                      to read the bible sia... totally contradict the bible teachings...
                      And while making a stand is correct, but God do not encourage
                      you to kill someone just because they did something you don't
                      like... That is more like Satanic behavior, kill them, kill them
                      all, because they did something bad to you!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHAAHHA
                      KILL THEM ALL!!!</p>

              <p>Hey, my point exactly. Because of æ¬ºå–„æ€•æ�¶çš„äºº.</p>
              <p>This is the problem. I cannot get any useful discussion with Christians enlightening me on the bible when you got trolls disrupting every single conversation.</p>
              <p>And the worst thing is, you guys now come in and post bible verses in my face. Personally, if that is not rubbing IN YOUR FACE.. I do not really know what that is.</p>
              <p>Did I say that God allows ? I never said that did I ? Now you say I am more judgemental ? What are u doing ?</p>
              <p>Did I go into another person's house and scold him about the way he lives and tell him his faith in mankind is flawed and illogical ?</p>
              <p>If God is going to send me to hell for standing up to what is right, then so be it. What happened to you guys talking on and on about that its about good deeds and all that stuff.  Why the double standard now ? Glad you guys know that there are different kinds of Christians and you should not be ignorant and start generalising.</p>

              <p>You guys talk all you want about how I am being satanic and a bad christian and all that stuff.</p>
              <p>But mark my words, when you guys are in the same situation, being bulled by æ¬ºå–„æ€•æ�¶çš„äºº. You are going to wish there is someone who will stand up for you. You are going to wish when you are being bashed by a group of people in the public that someone just come out and yell..'STOP! What u guys are doing is wrong!'</p>
              <p>I am trying not to be hypocrite. But I will be a hypocrite if I do not admit I am. I believe in the message of Love. I try to hate the sin and not hate the sinner. But no where in the bible did I see that we cannot stand up to what is right when you see æ¬ºå–„æ€•æ�¶çš„äºº.</p>
              <p>Post all the bible verses to me. I assure u I am very liberal. And I take a very liberal interpretation. Thats why I believe in not throwing pearls at pigs. I believe in standing up for justice and what is right. I believe that turning your cheek is fine as long as they do not continuely rub it in your face after you have shown love and compassaion and that they are rubbing it in your face because of the love and compassion</p>
              <p>There are those Christians that will be non violent till the end. Accepting the bullet with love. And there are Christians that will fight and die for thier belief.</p>

              <p>Winsomeea, the more you post the bible verses the worse you will look. Because it shows that you DO understand something about the bible and Christianity. And since you know that Christians who you so call being satanic will go to hell, then why are u here ?</p>
              <p>1# You do not believe in Christianity</p>
              <p>2# You do not believe in a God or a supreme entity</p>
              <p>3# But You tell us we are going to hell because of what we do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So do you believe or do you NOT believe there is a God ? Make your stance now. You notice how u are slowly digging yourself a very big hole you cannot get out off. I am giving the game away for your benefit. But whatever you say now its too late. Because this is proof enough of your motive, your character and your intention.</p>

              <p>lols... why are things getting so heated up here? when all TS asked was a basic question on creation where he tinks that he cant get a satisfactory answer through google-ing.</p>
              <p>For religious issues it would always be preferred to have an open mindset to criticisms and questioning. What i see here are a bunch of non christians trying to ask some questions but a bunch of christians who are so upheld about that faith that they take it so personally that these non christians are trying to bash their faith. Even up till now i dun see ppl like TCMC sprouting anything abusive against the religion itself. I do not know how was it being perceived as a religion bash or a word bash. It honestly felt more like it when questions are post that could not be answered, it becomes a bash on the reliability of the religion. Haven't one realised that all religions have questions that cannot be answered?</p>

              <p>In my secondary, I had a gal friend who is a passionate
                  christian, and she did once made me sit down in the canteen, and
                  reading with her on The Daily Bread. Well, after that I told her I
                  am not prepared to accept Christ in my life, but she was
                  understanding, and we still remain friends.<br> <br> In my JC, I had a gal friend who is passionate about Christianity,
                  for her Jesus is everything, but we still get along, altho her
                  passion scares other Christians away. So left me one guy only talk
                  with her.<br> <br> For me, aiyah, passionate or not, it doesnt matter, as long as they
                  not overbearing, like keep pestering or even saying wrong things
                  during an emergency like the above, just make sure dont be so
                  overbearing and in the end piss people off. But at same time,
                  everyone here should try to communicate with everyone...its
                  challenging to communicate with someone so different, so
                  passionate...try it!</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">As you can see.
                  Laurence82 is still reasonable then. Because he is
                  new.<span> </span> His posts are during a time of moderators.
                  And he is not directly attacking Christianity. Just enlightening us
                  on perhaps the misconception of it.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This one is interesting.
                  Laurence82 actually advocates for statute based religious
                  harmony.</span></p>
              <p>“I am not sure how much of jurisdiction can the
                  goverment have over internet content, especially with regards to
                  using the religious harmony act.<br> <br> Since its mabbe quite limited, some people use this chance to
                  profess their hypocritical views on other religions here, which
                  they couldnt do outside since they could be immediately be held
                  under citizen arrest by people who are listening.<br> <br> But it will be helpful to post some legal statutes here so that we
                  can see how much of that act has been flouted here.<br> <br> cheers”</p>

              <p>I admit, its going to take some time to form a
                  timeline. Given that your posts are 111,665 at 12/12
                  06.22am.<span> </span> And that is 248 times more than
                  Hasene’s. Which means 2233 hours.<span> </span> But that can
                  be shortened if I skip every 2 pages. Time can be shortened of
                  course by giving it out to employees that have too much free time
                  and don’t mind a little bit of bonus.</p>
              <p>But it does bring back some good memories. The good old
                  times when we at least saw eye to eye. But that will all change in
                  2008. Leading up to 2009.</p>

                  already deep hatred and a personal vendetta against Christians in particular.
                  You can see that he starts to reveal his true nature. Someone how is
                  intolerant, who is anti- religion, anti-christianity and we do whatever it
                  takes to bad mouth or talk down a Christian be the Christian a good or bad one.
                  He cannot be an objective person. Have a read. His discussion back then was
                  still civil and makes sense. You can feel he wants to attack.. but was being

                  pave the way and started the MLM business in US in 1950s. It is plausible they
                  use christian evangelism as a model to start MLM.<br> <br> But i beg to differ that CHC or in fact any evangelistic or charismatic
                  churches are MLM in structure and form. There are few very technical
                  differences i must say, one being churches deal with spirituality while mlm
                  deals with business strategies.<br> <br> Although there are seemingly few similarities between them, i dont its right to
                  label churches directly as having mlm structure. i will use it only in
                  discussion regarding churches that seemingly want to con people out of their
                  money. Even so, it is not right to label CHC as having mlm structure, the point
                  being pointed out in earlier post.<br> <br> 'direct selling' or single level marketing or SLM' would be the best parallel

              <p class="MsoNormal">“Basically, i have very specific reservations, not about
                  god, but about chhristianity, esp when someone call himself the prophet of god,
                  and link himself to god thru this 'holy trinity'.<br> <br> I have very specific reservations abt the Protestants, who used to justify
                  their breakaway, among other stuff, including the reasons of Pope's excessess..<br> <br> Now if you look, its more like Protestants' excessess, whereas the Pope, or the
                  last Pope, try to reach a interfaith peace and harmony<br> <br> I have very specific reservations against preachings by hypocrites who only
                  make statements out of the Bible. Remember the time when your old-school dad
                  demand total respect, obedience and attention, without any question about the
                  way he do stuff, even of you know its wrong and ilogical?<br> <br> Yup... <span><img src="/C:/Users/BLACKB~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif" border="0" alt="Laughing" width="15" height="15"></span>”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #800000;">----Ladies and gentlemen, as you can clearly see. He has
                  made his agenda intention clear.<span>  </span>He is
                  out against Christians. Especially Protestants. Since 2005.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #800000;">My question to you Laurence82, why are you still in Eternal
                  Hope ? His answers can be found in the next thread:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“Again, i dont condone this sort of actions, so dont expect
                  me to shove off easily. Besides, the discussion in this forum provided much
                  needed laughter and entertainment. <span><img src="/C:/Users/BLACKB~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif" border="0" alt="Laughing" width="15" height="15"></span><br> <br> If you think you are quite justified, go and challenge stupidissmart. Only few
                  were able to match his level of reasoning, rather than just being silly and
                  discuss other faiths as if you know so much abt them.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #800000;">----Let me assure you. You can see how he supports trolls,
                  supports those that are in his line of thinking and not looking at things
                  objectively. That was 6 years ago. And while StupidIsSmart has improved in his
                  vocabulary and knowledge, while his reasonings are logical, they both exhibit
                  the same character of not trying to understand the other person’s position and
                  that you are always WRONG and they are RIGHT. Now in 2011, he still has the
                  exact same mentality. But while StupidIsSmart has improved, Laurence82 clearly
                  has not.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">As you can clearly see. The topic was <strong>Old Testament</strong>. Now its supposed to be a discussion between Christians
                  . But then u got StupidIsSmart and Laurence82 coming in giving their piece of their
                  mind. Its odd as they DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE BIBLE… but yet they kept coming in
                  to challenge the veracity of the bible.</p>

                  are either philosophically against Christianity or are against the individuals
                  who are Christians. While most of the more "seasoned" EH contributors
                  are avoiding a protracted, thus pointless, discussion with the anti-Christians,
                  we will be more than happy to discuss and when possible nudge seekers the way
                  we see to be right. After all, as laoda, and myself (in the past) had
                  maintained, this is a CHRISTIAN forum. No different from those who reside in
                  Light of Atlantis or the Buddhist threat who may advice their seekers to go
                  those ways, and as I have said before, it would be totally wrong to preach
                  there. This is EH, you either come in to share, to seek or to argue. I'd ignore
                  those who wants nothing more than to pick a fight.<br> <br> To anyone who does not believe in God (or the Christian God), the prayers would
                  not offend 'cos to these people God does not exist, thus the prayers will NOT
                  work.<br> To believers, it is well within our agenda to try to nudge non-believers to our
                  faith.<br> While, as most forumites may know, that I am totally against the
                  forcing-down-your-throat brand of Christianity, I will be more than happy to
                  provide some comfort and answers, and if such answers will lead an individual
                  to Christ I will unabashly do it.<br> <br> <em>If I am addressing the needs of a specific individual and this individual
                  feels that these needs are met, I would not consider the opinions of those who
                  are not involved. They are totally unimportant.</em></span></p>

                  mod Chin Eng. Obviously knows Laurence82 and his antiques. And when someone
                  posts IN a Christian forum discussing about Christian belief and system,
                  Laurence cannot take it. And this is his reply. Let me show that this was in
                  2005. </span></span></p>

                  have non believers in their heart etc, despite many speeches that say so<br> <br> its always 'our' way, 'our beliefs, that to acknowledge the presence and views
