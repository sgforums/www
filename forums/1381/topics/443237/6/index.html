              <p>Hi bro,</p>
              <p>just read through the posts from Badzmaro, in which Chin Eng said in 14/7/2005, I find there is great wisdom and wish to share with you.</p>
              <p>"This is EH, you either come in to share, to seek or to argue. <span style="color: #0000ff;">I'd ignore those who wants nothing more than to pick a fight.<br></span><br>To anyone who does not believe in God (or the Christian God), the prayers would not offend 'cos to these people God does not exist, thus the prayers will NOT work."</p>
              <p>On the last sentence, to me it simply means that our fundamentals are different, so even prayers won't work, what would all these discussions, argument, ....brings? nothing. It does sharpen our mind though.</p>

              <p>Thanks Bro! I read that too. I am already trying to keep my responses to the likes of Tcmc short. Yes I agree that our fundamentals are different, which is why it is important to realise that it is a matter of worldviews, not of throwing evidence at each other, because our worldviews determine what we do with the evidence. </p>

              <p>2. Sorry, there is no assumption made when we say there are no gods. We make the decision based on available religious texts from the main religions, do comparisons. We make the decision based on the inability to detect or measure "spiritual entities". </p>

              <p><br>what started off the debate is about something that happened thousands of years ago... and what went on become a war on proving events and stuffs. It has already derailed from purely being religion and faith. Whatever that is going on here is an obvious brought over from another thread frm a heated debate b/w TCMC and BIC. As i've said, read properly first, then think through before you sprout nonsense. A joke trying to make a joke out of others.</p>

              <p><br>what started off the debate is about something that happened thousands of years ago... and what went on become a war on proving events and stuffs. It has already derailed from purely being religion and faith. Whatever that is going on here is an obvious brought over from another thread frm a heated debate b/w TCMC and BIC. As i've said, read properly first, then think through before you sprout nonsense. A joke trying to make a joke out of others.</p>

              <p>the discussion has derailed, but what prolonged the argument remains, there is a fundamental difference in the belief, one belief in God, a Christian God, the others doesn't. anybody ask anybody to believe in Christian God here? but many are trying to prove that the Christian God doesn't exist. What happens not is purely academic.</p>
              <p>you may have different views on what goes on here, but too fast to claim other views as as nonsense is a nonsense itself.</p>

              <p>BIC,</p>
              <p>But you are taking many of your baseless statements as facts and telling the whole world they are facts (e.g earth is 6000 years old)</p>
              <p>I dont mind you saying that it is a BELIEF of yours that the earth is 6000 years old, but it is not a fact!</p>
              <p>So when there is a dispute in the accuracy of your statements, then something academically sound must be enforced. Like providing evidence, and using diff sources to back your claim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BIC, I remember, you have not answered one of my previous questions.</p>
              <p>Regarding the age of the earth, do you trust the process of radiometric dating to date the earth as 4.5 billion years old?</p>

              <p><br>thats different. medical science is a very specialised area while religion or in this case proving of something that happens a few thousands years ago, is something that is not so specialised. To prove something has happened, it can be a eye witness account of jus 1 side ma. Medical practice is a many to one incident. meaning many researching to benefitting on a more minor scale but the proving of god or whatsoever thing, is a one to many thing. If really want prove he exist or wad... cannot be onli proving from a christian pov.</p>
