              <p>Tell me, is carbon dating being used to date the age of the earth? As an evolutionist you should know and be able to tell me whether evolutionists employ carbon dating to date the earth.</p>

              <p>Aliens as in little green men from Mars or other galaxies far far away? Well, the Bible is silent on them. The place of action is earth. But that does not mean that aliens aka little green men therefore exist because the Bible is silent. The belief in aliens is completely based on belief that evolution is true, that billions of years exist, and that life has evolved elsewhere. But if the Bible is correct that the universe is only about 6000 years old, then there is no room or place for aliens.</p>

              <p>No scientist or anyone will say that there is definitely life out there. I didnt say that too. We can only say there is a high chance that there is life out there because of the numbe rof planets out there. It's called probability. You learn it in pri sch and sec sch maths? But no one can be 100% sure ,just like you can nv be sure there is no life out there. ?</p>

              <p>Yes, I do believe in reincarnation....the consciousness lived on (after we die) and transform into or enter another "new body"...can be animal, insect, or human... some of these transformations may be "not immediate" depending on the Karma factors....I think the scientific explanation to this is the "transfer of energies"....</p>

              <p>No scientist or anyone will say that there is definitely life out there. I didnt say that too. We can only say there is a high chance that there is life out there because of the numbe rof planets out there. It's called probability. You learn it in pri sch and sec sch maths? But no one can be 100% sure ,just like you can nv be sure there is no life out there. ?</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>It doesn't follow that just because the universe is large, and there are believed to be planets out there, therefore the chances are that intelligent life is out there. Remember such belief is entirely predicated on evolution being true.</p>
              <p>Of course if you ask me in my personal capacity how I can be sure I would say that I can never be sure there is no intelligent life out there. But since the Bible is my authority, on the basis of what the Bible teach I am of the view that there is no aliens out there. Can you prove me wrong? You can't. Neither can I prove my view. But let's take stock of things at present. We have had the SETI program scanning the universe for signs of intelligence out there for many years. The result is zip, zero, nada. I think so far this is consistent with the Bible. Not only that, distances are so vast that the nearest galaxy is many light years away. Scientists have calculated the near-impossible amount of energy required to travel vast distances in a reasonable period of time.</p>
              <p>And before I forget, why are evolutionists so adamant on intelligent life out there? Simply because of the notion that intelligent life on earth was seeded by such beings out there, which to me is an implicit admission that life on earth was intelligently designed but that they would rather that it be little green men than the God of the Bible. The idea that life on earth could have happened by chance is simply preposterous so they have to invoke aliens.</p>
