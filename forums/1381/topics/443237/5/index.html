              <p>You guys know Facebok Timeline?</p>
              <p>Well let me give u a glimpse of yourself. One thing
              about sgforums is.. the history remains forever… at least on the
              net.</p>

              <p>In my secondary, I had a gal friend who is a passionate
              christian, and she did once made me sit down in the canteen, and
              reading with her on The Daily Bread. Well, after that I told her I
              am not prepared to accept Christ in my life, but she was
              understanding, and we still remain friends.<br> <br> In my JC, I had a gal friend who is passionate about Christianity,
              for her Jesus is everything, but we still get along, altho her
              passion scares other Christians away. So left me one guy only talk
              with her.<br> <br> For me, aiyah, passionate or not, it doesnt matter, as long as they
              not overbearing, like keep pestering or even saying wrong things
              during an emergency like the above, just make sure dont be so
              overbearing and in the end piss people off. But at same time,
              everyone here should try to communicate with everyone...its
              challenging to communicate with someone so different, so
              passionate...try it!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This is you laurence82,

              2004</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">As you can see.
              Laurence82 is still reasonable then. Because he is
              new.<span> </span> His posts are during a time of moderators.
              And he is not directly attacking Christianity. Just enlightening us
              on perhaps the misconception of it.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This thread sheds some
              light into the position of Laurence82. Still civil. Albeit it was
              in an Aunt Agony thread. WITH a moderator monitoring of
              course.</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/12/topics/84761">http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/84761</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Notice that in these
              conversation in Eternal Hope, its still civil. Moderator SillyMe
              was still there during that time.</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/86625">http://sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/86625</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This one is interesting.
              Laurence82 actually advocates for statute based religious
              harmony.</span></p>
              <p>“I am not sure how much of jurisdiction can the
              goverment have over internet content, especially with regards to
              using the religious harmony act.<br> <br> Since its mabbe quite limited, some people use this chance to
              profess their hypocritical views on other religions here, which
              they couldnt do outside since they could be immediately be held
              under citizen arrest by people who are listening.<br> <br> But it will be helpful to post some legal statutes here so that we
              can see how much of that act has been flouted here.<br> <br> cheers”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This is July 2004. Don’t
              believe me ? Read the content of the thread.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">DaVinCi Code. Nothing
              major. Just showing that he was not the troll that he is
              now.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Catholics. Nothing
              major.. still within the 2004 period</span></p>

              <p>Laurence82 31 of August 2004</p>
              <p>“btw, if anyone say i am pursuing an agenda here, yes i
              am, but not against Christians, but its about religious
              sensitivity... <span><img src="/C:/Users/BLACKB~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif" alt="Cool" width="15" height="15"></span>, so i hope i wont be
              called anti christ or something...<br> <br> The last time i discuss this seriously when someone also raise abt
              the same topic last time...not abt ancestors, but generally on non
              believers too...<br> <br> but i am glad we guys discuss this in a nice non flaming manner..
              <span><img src="/C:/Users/BLACKB~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif" alt="Cool" width="15" height="15"></span>”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">-This is where we can see
              his motive and ‘agenda’ reveal itself. This is the beginning of his
              crusade. Notice how offensive posts are edited by then moderator
              SillyMe . Notice how discussion still being civil.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Nice and civil. The
              likeable Laurence82 by everyone.</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/98364">http://sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/98364</a></p>
              <p>They may call out the Lord's name everytime, but they
              aint bad.<br> <br> Besides, my friends from those churches turn out all right, and
              quite mature too.<br> <br> You should see instead the behaviour of some Christians from
              traditional churches in this forum. Absolutely disgusting.”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Still reasonable.
              Mentioning of trolls like Aloska is natural. U will always have one
              or two of them people like those around.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This thread is on
              Christians dating non Christians. The discussion inside is very
              civil. No personal attacks. No demeaning remarks. No supportive
              comments by trolls on trolls. All is nice and dandy.</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/102335">http://sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/102335</a></p>
              <p>Reconciliation between Chrstianity and science.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Notice how the
              discussions are STILL civil. With your usual StupidIsSmart
              explaining away why it isn’t so. But interestly, Laurence82
              actually partaked in a meaningful discussion. Good times to read. I
              remember reading them.</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/103641">http://sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/103641</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I admit, its going to take some time to form a
              timeline. Given that your posts are 111,665 at 12/12
              06.22am.<span> </span> And that is 248 times more than
              Hasene’s. Which means 2233 hours.<span> </span> But that can
              be shortened if I skip every 2 pages. Time can be shortened of
              course by giving it out to employees that have too much free time
              and don’t mind a little bit of bonus.</p>
              <p>But it does bring back some good memories. The good old
              times when we at least saw eye to eye. But that will all change in
              2008. Leading up to 2009.</p>

              <p>I admit, its going to take some time to form a timeline. Given
                                      that your posts are 111,665 at 12/12 06.22am.<span> </span> And that is 248 times more than Hasene’s. Which means 2233
                                      hours.<span> </span> But that can be shortened if I skip every
                                      2 pages. Time can be shortened of course by giving it out to
                                      employees that have too much free time and don’t mind a little bit

                                      Someone how is intolerant, who is anti- religion, anti-christianity
                                      and we do whatever it takes to bad mouth or talk down a Christian
                                      be the Christian a good or bad one. He cannot be an objective
                                      person. Have a read. His discussion back then was still civil and
                                      makes sense. You can feel he wants to attack.. but was being

              <p>11 Feb 2005</p>
              <p>“I am afraid u guys have to read up on Amway, who
                                      officially pave the way and started the MLM business in US in
                                      1950s. It is plausible they use christian evangelism as a model to
                                      start MLM.<br> <br> But i beg to differ that CHC or in fact any evangelistic or
                                      charismatic churches are MLM in structure and form. There are few
                                      very technical differences i must say, one being churches deal with
                                      spirituality while mlm deals with business strategies.<br> <br> Although there are seemingly few similarities between them, i dont
                                      its right to label churches directly as having mlm structure. i
                                      will use it only in discussion regarding churches that seemingly
                                      want to con people out of their money. Even so, it is not right to
                                      label CHC as having mlm structure, the point being pointed out in
                                      earlier post.<br> <br> 'direct selling' or single level marketing or SLM' would be the
                                      best parallel in business world to compare with CHC.”</p>

                                      difference. But If I were to fast forward to 2010. Which I will
                                      eventually point out, he claims Christianity IS MLM. Notice

                                      shows his state of mind during the earlier years. Don’t believe me

                                      challenge their faith. It’s not just a recent

              <p>13 June 2005</p>
              <p>“Basically, i have very specific reservations, not
                                      about god, but about chhristianity, esp when someone call himself
                                      the prophet of god, and link himself to god thru this 'holy
                                      trinity'.<br> <br> I have very specific reservations abt the Protestants, who used to
                                      justify their breakaway, among other stuff, including the reasons
                                      of Pope's excessess..<br> <br> Now if you look, its more like Protestants' excessess, whereas the
                                      Pope, or the last Pope, try to reach a interfaith peace and
                                      harmony<br> <br> I have very specific reservations against preachings by hypocrites
                                      who only make statements out of the Bible. Remember the time when
                                      your old-school dad demand total respect, obedience and attention,
                                      without any question about the way he do stuff, even of you know
                                      its wrong and ilogical?<br> <br> Yup... <span><img src="../../../C:/Users/BLACKB%7E1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif" alt="Laughing" width="15" height="15"></span>”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">----Ladies and gentlemen,
                                      as you can clearly see. He has made his agenda intention
                                      clear.<span> </span> He is out against Christians. Especially
                                      Protestants. Since 2005.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">My question to you
                                      Laurence82, why are you still in Eternal Hope ? His answers can be
                                      found in the next thread:</span></p>
              <p>“Again, i dont condone this sort of actions, so dont
                                      expect me to shove off easily. Besides, the discussion in this
                                      forum provided much needed laughter and entertainment.
                                      <span><img src="../../../C:/Users/BLACKB%7E1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif" alt="Laughing" width="15" height="15"></span><br> <br> If you think you are quite justified, go and challenge
                                      stupidissmart. Only few were able to match his level of reasoning,
                                      rather than just being silly and discuss other faiths as if you
                                      know so much abt them.”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">----Let me assure you.
                                      You can see how he supports trolls, supports those that are in his
                                      line of thinking and not looking at things objectively. That was 6
                                      years ago. And while StupidIsSmart has improved in his vocabulary
                                      and knowledge, while his reasonings are logical, they both exhibit
                                      the same character of not trying to understand the other person’s
                                      position and that you are always WRONG and they are RIGHT. Now in
                                      2011, he still has the exact same mentality. But while
                                      StupidIsSmart has improved, Laurence82 clearly has not.</span></p>

              <p>As you can clearly see. The topic was <strong>Old
                                      Testament</strong>. Now its supposed to be a discussion between
                                      Christians . But then u got StupidIsSmart and Laurence82 coming in
                                      giving their piece of their mind. Its odd as they DO NOT BELIEVE IN
                                      THE BIBLE… but yet they kept coming in to challenge the veracity of
                                      the bible.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">----Seriously.. wha’ts up
                                      with that ? Is that a Chronic Troll or what ? Who the hell
                                      persistently goes into another’s house and tells them how to run
                                      and decorate their furniture ? Read for yourselves.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; line-height: normal;"><span>I echo your sentiments, laoda.....<br> I guess by and large, most of the Christians here are familiar with
                                      those who are either philosophically against Christianity or are
                                      against the individuals who are Christians. While most of the more
                                      "seasoned" EH contributors are avoiding a protracted, thus
                                      pointless, discussion with the anti-Christians, we will be more
                                      than happy to discuss and when possible nudge seekers the way we
                                      see to be right. After all, as laoda, and myself (in the past) had
                                      maintained, this is a CHRISTIAN forum. No different from those who
                                      reside in Light of Atlantis or the Buddhist threat who may advice
                                      their seekers to go those ways, and as I have said before, it would
                                      be totally wrong to preach there. This is EH, you either come in to
                                      share, to seek or to argue. I'd ignore those who wants nothing more
                                      than to pick a fight.<br> <br> To anyone who does not believe in God (or the Christian God), the
                                      prayers would not offend 'cos to these people God does not exist,
                                      thus the prayers will NOT work.<br> To believers, it is well within our agenda to try to nudge
                                      non-believers to our faith.<br> While, as most forumites may know, that I am totally against the
                                      forcing-down-your-throat brand of Christianity, I will be more than
                                      happy to provide some comfort and answers, and if such answers will
                                      lead an individual to Christ I will unabashly do it.<br> <br> <em>If I am addressing the needs of a specific individual and this
                                      individual feels that these needs are met, I would not consider the
                                      opinions of those who are not involved. They are totally
                                      unimportant.</em></span></p>

                                      we have the mod Chin Eng. Obviously knows Laurence82 and his

                                      about Christian belief and system, Laurence cannot take it. And

              <p>For religious issues it would always be preferred to have an open mindset to criticisms and questioning. What i see here are a bunch of non christians trying to ask some questions but a bunch of christians who are so upheld about that faith that they take it so personally that these non christians are trying to bash their faith. Even up till now i dun see ppl like TCMC sprouting anything abusive against the religion itself. I do not know how was it being perceived as a religion bash or a word bash. It honestly felt more like it when questions are post that could not be answered, it becomes a bash on the reliability of the religion. Haven't one realised that all religions have questions that cannot be answered?</p>

              <p><br>i do not totally agree with you on that though becuase i do not feel that it is absurb for him to complain about the answer being predominantly christian. To me, it is highly unreliable if im asking for some proving and the source is used to prove the source. If u really wanna shut him up or to convince him whatsoever, it would prove more convincing to cross reference instead of using a christian source to prove a christian source. If it is not convincing at all, to ppl who are reasonably logical, such answers might be seen as no where near convincing ma.</p>

              <p>1. You failed to see the kind of bias and prejudice again. Creation.com has more than 7000 articles, you gave a point by point refutation of the contents in that website? You lying bro?</p>
              <p>2. Fact is, I did not quote from one source. Quoting two websites is two sources. You are merely complaining about my source being Christian. Anti-Christian bigotry bro?</p>
              <p>3. This shows you were not truthful at all. Creation.com articles almost always have footnotes that cite secular sources. Did you know that? Of course not. You just want to take the easy way out of generalising things out of the way.</p>

              <p>1. You failed to see the kind of bias and prejudice again.
              Creation.com has more than 7000 articles, you gave a point by point
              refutation of the contents in that website? You lying bro?</p>
              <p>2. Fact is, I did not quote from one source. Quoting two
              websites is two sources. You are merely complaining about my source
              being Christian. Anti-Christian bigotry bro?</p>
              <p>3. This shows you were not truthful at all. Creation.com
              articles almost always have footnotes that cite secular sources.
              Did you know that? Of course not. You just want to take the easy
              way out of generalising things out of the way.</p>

              <p>1. Lying again. This i already have answered you too. Stop arguing in circles. I have said that you showed me only ONE page of the wbesite that was relevant to our discussion. ONE PAGE relevant to our discussion. Either you are lying or not reading. I refuted that points in that one page about proving the bible with itself. Remember?</p>
              <p>2. Dont play the word changing game. One source = christian sources. When I say more than one sources, i mean christian and nonchristian sources. You should know what i mean because we have been discussing this for so long. I have always told you christian and nonchristians sources. Acting daft?</p>
              <p>3. Lying again. You showed me one page of that wbesite which was relevant to our discussion. Not the whole wbesite. Need me to paste the discussion for you and what link you posted?</p>

              <p>You have confused bias with credibility. Just because one is biased does not mean he is discredited. He is only discredited if his bias has resulted in his case being false or his argument being false. And you also confused being bias with being wrong. As I said before, EVERYONE is biased. There is NO exception. When you say it should bear a question mark, that already betrays your biasness towards that person. Proved my point isn't it? And what's the chance of an atheist being truthful about writing a book on atheism? Can I trust an atheism to be truthful and faithful to handling the Bible? Why should I?</p>

              <p>Honestly i do not understand how a bias source can be reliable and credible. A bias source means it is no longer objective but subjective. It means it only offers a partial viewpoint essentially favourable to the likes of the person who created the source. When a source's credibility is already in question, it shld not be even considered in an argument already. Bias and credibility are not 2 seperate issues imo. A bias source is a discredited source imo. Precisely because everyone is biased, thats why when we are trying to do proving, we need multi sources from various avenues to prove something is right. In the proving of an event from many years back, it is usually prove only through multiple sources from various avenues speaking of the same incident then there's credibility. What i feel TCMC is doing here is that he needs more evidence from various sources other than christianity source to prove an event. Yes a christian source may be able to prove an event in a bible, but it is not as reliable as if u got get sources from other religions or even from non religious sources to prove the event right.</p>
