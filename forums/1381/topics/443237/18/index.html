              <p>I know what you mean. Trolls like him are not interested in the answers. These links are for the benefit of those who are of a noble character and who would bother to really understand what Christianity is about.</p>

              <p>There are 8 persons living under one roof in my family.</p>
              <p>My aged parents are Catholics.</p>
              <p>My sister and I are Catholics too (naturally) although we also subscribe to Buddhism.</p>
              <p><em>(In fact, my house has a simple Buddhist and a simple Catholic altar existing within less than 2 meters of each other on the same shelving cabinet)</em></p>
              <p>My Brother-in-law is Protestant Christian.</p>
              <p>My Wife is a strident ATHEIST (uppercase for emphasis because she's vehemently anti-religion. Hahahaha..).</p>
              <p>Our 2 teenage children (17 and 15) are agnostics and i let them find for themselves whatever that works for them.</p>
              <p>If you could believe this, peace actually reigns in my family 24/7 because we are bound by genuine love and respect for each other as individuals with our own set of personal beliefs. We do not impose on each other and we still find plenty of common ground. We have no problems at all. </p>
              <p>But having read all the exchanges in this forum and the arguments put forth by so many informed individuals, I suddenly feel confused. </p>
              <p>So what should my family do? Convert all to Catholicism or convert all to Christian Protestantism or convert all to Buddhism or take my wife's lead to become atheists or maybe agnostics like my children? </p>
              <p>The way i see it, if we can achieve so much peace, love and mutual respect amidst our diversity, we most probably will be able to achieve even much more of the same if we were all to align our beliefs, wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>What does everyone here think?</p>

              <p>I believe it is ideal that the family unit shares the same faith. It is always easier to be travelling in the same direction. The father, being the head of the house, can exercise significant influence over the rest of the family members to bring about an alignment of religious beliefs, but it should not be compelled. I think there will be greater relationship bonding when both hearts and minds are won through rational and moral persuasion. If you seriously desire to see it happen, I wish you the best.</p>

              <p>Some families work very well with different religious beliefs.</p>
              <p>On the contrary I have seen families with the same faith (all christian, or all muslim) breaking apart and having frequent fights.</p>
              <p>Not every father desires or wants to be the head of the household like you.</p>
              <p>In many MODERN families (your mindset is still very medieval), fathers and mothers are both heads.</p>
              <p>THE WORLD does not only work with your morals and your way of life.</p>
