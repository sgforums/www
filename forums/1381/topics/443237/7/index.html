              <p>You did not read properly. The process is OK. The issue got to do with the initial assumptions. What you get out depends on what you first put in. Dead Sea Scrolls we already know who wrote them, so even if you don't use carbon dating (which only date thousands of years, something you probably did not know) also not a huge problem. In any case, we are talking about dating human writings which do not go back more than about 5000 years old, versus the idea that the earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Indeed you are playing daft and guilty of caricaturing my beliefs.</p>
              <p>I said the process is OK. If you ASSUME the rate of decay is constant, and ASSUME intital conditions of parent and daughter elements, and ASSUME that throughout the whole period nothing happened to disturb the process, and know the ratios at present, you can always plug in the figures and derive a calculated age. But did you miss the point about the ASSUMPTIONS?</p>
              <p>Carbon dating only dates thousands of years. Like I said which you conveniently ignored, the DDS were known to be written by the Essenes which lived during the intertestamental times. We roughly know their age already. I mean, what is the accepted date for writing? It is only in the thousands of years. Carbon-testing merely confirmed the age of the documents. Carbon dating also suffer from the same limitations as radiometric dating methods, they require assumptions to be made. But like I said, they only date thousands of years old. This is different from dating something SUPPOSEDLY millions of years old. </p>

              <p>Jacky,</p>
              <p>You also believe the Bible teach that the earth is about 6000 years old? How did you come to this conclusion when Tcmc will say that the Bible does not teach it?</p>
              <p>When you dig a fossil it does not come attached with an age label. The age is derived from the rock layers in which it was found. And dating the rocks require the making of those assumptions I highlighted earlier. It isn't rocket science like you make it out to be. You think a 6000 year old earth does not make sense. Tell me, does it make sense to find soft tissue or red blood cells in 65 million year old fossil? Or how about finding living fossils that still look the same after supposedly 65 million years have passed. They stopped evolving while during that time dinosaurs were believed to have evolved into parrots and eagles?</p>
              <p>The Bible talks about a global flood that would account for the fossil record. Not all dinosaurs died in the flood. Those in the Ark survived and that's where we have documented accounts of ancient knights killing dragons, or the drawings and sculptures of dinosaurs in ancient buildings. Again I take it that you are IGNORANT of all these.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>If you think dinosaurs are capable of sinning, all the more you
              expose your own shallowness and false claim that you were some
              Bible study expert. You are just a fraud.</p>
              <p>And did you say using carbon dating to date the age of the
              earth? LOL! You really know nuts about radiometric dating.</p>

              <p>Excuse me, I know both are different but still you answers would most probably be "Oh they are accurate for christian relics only and not so accurate for age of the earth or fossils."</p>
              <p>Your answer will be the same, no matter radiometric, cabron or uranium lead dating etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BIC, i didnt say dinosaurs can sin. I was referring to Jacky's question to you, that you didnt answer</p>
