              <p>Do you have any proof that there was an ape in your ancestry? Which fossils as prove? Not only do you NOT have proof, the idea is also irrational and absurd.</p>
              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>Common sense tells us that there is NOTHING unreasonable or illogical in Adam and Eve being our first human parents who were created by God fully formed, mature and functioning in all ways just as they were designed to. And neither is there any evidence against the Biblical record of our first parents. And since the Bible has been vindicated many times and shown to be historically reliable, we also have good reasons to accept the historicity of Adam and Eve. See <a href="http://creation.com/pseudo-history">http://creation.com/pseudo-history</a> and <a href="http://creation.com/historical-adam-biologos">http://creation.com/historical-adam-biologos</a> </p>

              <p>As an open forum any post will not just be for one person to read, even if it is directed at him. So at the very least chronic ranters like Jacky cannot say Christians have not rebutted their rantings.</p>
              <p>And perhaps others who are more noble than Jacky and his ilk may have the intellectual honesty and integrity to at least check out the articles and know our responses to their rantings.</p>

              <p>No where does the Bible says we are not allowed to touch incense. It's like what Eve said in the Garden of Eden. God said not to eat from the tree, but Eve added to say that God forbade even the touching of that tree. It's what we do with them that matters. Had Eve merely touched the forbidden fruit, but taken heed of God's Word and not eat from it, things would be Edenic still!</p>

              <p>Urr...bowing heads is not saying OK about worshipping ancestors. It's paying respects to the dead. But on an "existential" note, I think we should pay more attention to honoring and respecting the living while they are still with us, esp our loved ones like our aged parents.</p>

No praying or worshipping needed. Is that anyway offensive to christianity itself?

              <p>Interpretation according to context is definitely yes. And from interpretation sometimes we can derive principles that can be translated across time to help us apply to present circumstances. But generally speaking where circumstances and contexts are similar to the Bible's teachings, then I think application should be in accordance to that context.</p>

              <p><br>well... im a non christian but personally i do feel that it shld be alright to just at least be present. Its the same as a christian going through a relative's buddhism/taoism funeral... kinda disrespectful to not even be present just becos of different religious beliefs imo. Well i've seen some christians doing that which is partly why i have this distaste over some of their actions.</p>

              <p>Then may I suggest that your dislike or distaste for their actions/behaviour be distinguished from the truth claims of Christianity? In other words, your rejection of the faith should not be because of the actions of some Christians which may not be consistent with what the Bible teaches.</p>

              <p>BIC,</p>
              <p>i guess it may be better if i gave some egs and we discuss from there? lets start wif sth simple...''be fruitful and multiply'' according to context means God telling Adam to be fruitful and and populate earth...in other words produce offsprings...if i use this verse in modern day context to mean be fruitful in wadever we do and multiply wadever gifts and abilities God has given to us, would u see this as taking the verse out of context?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>means ppl tell me god say christians cannot touch insence... so i cannot touch. Or christians cannot attend buddhist funeral or taoist funeral 1... so i nvr go lor and another thing that made me quite unhappy was my friend say "chruch meetings cannot miss" so her grandma's hospital appointment had to be missed cos she needs to go church. These are some that i rmb... but my belief is that christianity doesn't propogate such actions but these ppl use the religion as a cover for these actions and thus, alot of ppl gets the wrong idea.</p></div>

              <p>i would say this is the result of the original sin...BIC did mention tat God told Eve not to eat the forbidden fruit but serpent asked Eve whether God said not to touch the forbidden fruit and Eve conveniently treated touch and eat as the same...</p>
              <p>the bible may teach tat we shld nt worship ancestors, kneel or bow to them...but humans, having the original deception of satan in us(see above) may stretch things further to mean cannot touch incense...reason being incense is related to ancestral worship...wad if i was merely passing the incense to someone else? is it wrong?</p>
              <p>another possible reason why believers may stretch the actual meanings could be due to cultural influence. In the more conservative and traditional churches, believers are tot to be extra cautious in living life...so while touching incense is strictly speaking not wrong but since its linked to ancestral worship, dun do it at all...its like one toe is rotting, its better to amputate the whole leg...hope u get wad i mean...</p>
