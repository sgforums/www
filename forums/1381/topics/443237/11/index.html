              <p>You don't seem to know the meaning of special pleading.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think I mentioned it before that I am not using the Bible to prove anything. I am using the Bible as the lenses with which to understand the world. If I am using the Bible to prove anything, it would be to prove that it teaches certain things. People who say the Bible does not teach the Trinity? I will use the Bible to prove them wrong. People who say the Bible teach universal salvation? I will use the Bible to prove them wrong. And please don't hide behind other religions (Islam or Buddhism) to make your point, I know what you are trying to do here, trying to start a Christianity vs other religion thing so that you can sit on the sidelines and see how each try to out-argue each other. Come on lah, you don't even believe any religion out there, so quit using other religions. It's really patronising. Just compare Christianity and your atheism.</p>
