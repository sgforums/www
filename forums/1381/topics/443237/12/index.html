              <p>You think I would agree with your categorisation? Please lah, be honest here and deal truthfully, which of the religions (except for Christianity) has salvation by faith? And neither are you dealing truthfully with Christianity by saying it is salvation by faith and works, and then claiming it is so because faith without works is dead. Do you even know what that means? You see works you automatically think salvation is by works? Again this is shoddy thinking.</p>

              <p>As for Christianity, the Scriptures are clear that salvation is by grace, NOT by works lest anyone should boast. Where does works come into the picture?

              <p>1. If you are not an OSAS christian then you believe that grace/faith and works are both necessary for salvation.</p>
              <p>Unless you are an OSAS christian, then i got nothing to say!</p>
              <p>Because OSAS christians really believe that it is only grace only!</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">Whoever said "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah" and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of a barley grain will be taken out of Hell.

              <p>Dude, where is the words that say salvation is by faith? Of course every religion got this element of belief what! What are you harping about here? The point is whether it is the faith that save them or the works that save them. At least the Bible mentioned clearly that salvation is by faith only, not by works.</p>

              This is just so lame an argument! Ok let's just grant you this point then. Every religion will talk about belief as a pre-requisite to salvation. But note that belief is not the same as having faith. Anyway, the question is, is belief by itself sufficient for salvation in these religions? The answer is no. They require good works to be done to merit salvation, and even then there is no assurance of salvation. For all these religions, including Roman Catholicism, it is always works that must be added. Belief and faith alone is just not enough. This is not the same for Christianity.
              
              Bottom line is this: there is a world of difference between doing good works to be saved, and being saved to do the good works that God has called us to do. Only Christianity is about the latter.
              
              I do know a fair bit about Islam but please don't hide behind another religion that you have rejected to use it as a diversion for examining and defending your own beliefs.

              <p>Actually you are asking about catholics and protestants. </p>
              <p>Protestants are not the mainstream christians because worldwide, there are alsmot equal number of catholics and protestants.</p>
              <p> So you are actually asking the difference between catholics and protestants. Protestants include evagelicals, methodists, presbyterians, OSAS christians, independent, charasmatics, baptists, conservatives, liberals, mormons, JWs etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similarities between catholics and protestants -</p>
              <p>1. Both see Jesus as God and worship Him as God (except for Mormons and JWs)</p>
              <p>2. Both believe in the trinity.(except for Mormons and JWs)</p>
              <p>3. Both believe in the virgin birth and the bible.</p>
              <p> 4. Both call themselves christians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Differences between catholics and protestants -</p>
              <p>1. Catholics have more books in the bible than protestants. Protestants have 66 books and catholics 73.</p>
              <p>2. Catholics see the pope as a central authority while protestants do not have a central figure, which explains the 20,000 denominations they have.</p>
              <p>3. Catholics venerate mary (they do not worship her) and put her in a special position, favoured by God. Protestants dont.</p>
              <p>4. Catholics pray through dead saints. Protestants dont.</p>
              <p>5. Catholics build statues of saints andJesus as reminders and point of focus for prayers. Protestants usually don't. That said, there are some protestants like Anglicans who do build statues too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>**Take note that within protestanism's 20,000 denominations, there are many doctrine/belief differences too.</p>

              <p>Protestants are not the mainstream christians because worldwide,
              there are alsmot equal number of catholics and protestants.</p>
              <p> So you are actually asking the difference between
              catholics and protestants. Protestants include evagelicals,
              methodists, presbyterians, OSAS christians, independent,
              charasmatics, baptists, conservatives, liberals, mormons, JWs etc
              etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similarities between catholics and protestants -</p>
              <p>1. Both see Jesus as God and worship Him as God (except for
              Mormons and JWs)</p>
              <p>2. Both believe in the trinity.(except for Mormons and JWs)</p>
              <p>3. Both believe in the virgin birth and the bible.</p>
              <p> 4. Both call themselves christians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Differences between catholics and protestants -</p>
              <p>1. Catholics have more books in the bible than protestants.
              Protestants have 66 books and catholics 73.</p>
              <p>2. Catholics see the pope as a central authority while
              protestants do not have a central figure, which explains the 20,000
              denominations they have.</p>
              <p>3. Catholics venerate mary (they do not worship her) and put her
              in a special position, favoured by God. Protestants dont.</p>
              <p>4. Catholics pray through dead saints. Protestants
              dont.</p>
              <p>5. Catholics build statues of saints andJesus as reminders and
              point of focus for prayers. Protestants usually don't. That said,
              there are some protestants like Anglicans who do build statues
              too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>**Take note that within protestanism's 20,000 denominations,
              there are many doctrine/belief differences too.</p>

Therefore please don't any-o-how ascribe beliefs to me lest you be embarrassed again and again.

              <p>1. Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, so that no man may boast</p>
              <p>2. Works is NOT needed to be saved. Why? See #1 above</p>
              <p>3. Salvation is conditional upon one's continued faithfulness and abiding in Christ, if we deny Christ He will deny us.</p>
              <p>4. Christians are dependent upon God's power to keep them in the faith</p>
              <p>5. Baptism is NOT required for salvation. It is the prescribed mode by which one professes faith.</p>

              <p><strong>Stephen Hawking says universe not created by God</strong></p>
              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>God did not create the universe, the man who is arguably Britain's most famous living scientist says in a forthcoming book.</p>
              <p>In the new work, The Grand Design, Professor <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Stephen Hawking" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/hawking"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Stephen Hawking</span></span></a> argues that the Big Bang, rather than occurring following the intervention of a divine being, was inevitable due to the law of gravity.</p>
              <p>In his 1988 book, A Brief History of Time, Hawking had seemed to accept the role of God in the creation of the universe. But in the new text, co-written with American physicist Leonard Mlodinow, he said new theories showed a creator is "not necessary".</p>
              <p>The Grand Design, an extract of which appears in the Times today, sets out to contest Sir Isaac Newton's belief that the universe must have been designed by God as it could not have been created out of chaos.</p>
              <p>"Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing," he writes. "Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist.</p>
              <p>"It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going."</p>
              <p>In the forthcoming book, published on 9 September, Hawking says that M-theory, a form of string theory, will achieve this goal: "M-theory is the unified theory Einstein was hoping to find," he theorises.</p>
              <p>"The fact that we human beings – who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature – have been able to come this close to an understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph."</p>
              <p>Hawking says the first blow to Newton's belief that the universe could not have arisen from chaos was the observation in 1992 of a planet orbiting a star other than our Sun. "That makes the coincidences of our planetary conditions – the single sun, the lucky combination of Earth-sun distance and solar mass – far less remarkable, and far less compelling as evidence that the Earth was carefully designed just to please us human beings," he writes.</p>
              <p>Hawking had previously appeared to accept the role of God in the creation of the universe. Writing in his bestseller A Brief History Of Time in 1988, he said: "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason – for then we should know the mind of God."</p>
              <p>Hawking resigned as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University last year after 30 years in the position.</p>

              <p>1. BIC, take away good works/merit and just by faith/alone, will a christian definitely go to heaven? A christian who does not live a good life, who drinks/smokes/do drugs/ or even murder. Will he still go heaven?</p>
              <p>2. Same as #1. Take away good works and just do the faith thing, like the OSAS christians. Do you think they will be saved?</p>
              <p>3.  AH! Salvation IS "CONDITIONAL!" Yes thats the key word! Conditional! Salvation is conditional, subject to whether the christian live a christ-like life and to live a christ-like life, he/she has to be good!</p>
              <p>4. About baptism, like it or not, there are christians who believe baptism IS necessary for salvation.:) Its just that you are not in their camp. If not you will be defending their doctrine too, and with bible verses!</p>

              <p>Inevitable due to the law of gravity? Prior to the universe existing got law of gravity? This begs the question, where did this law come from and who established it? Or is this an eternal law? If so, then you are making a metaphysical claim, not a scientific one.</p>
