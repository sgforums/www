            <div class='col-md body'>Adam was made in the image of God. He was not God. You see the mirror, u see your image, but that image is not you. So to assume that he has all the qualities of God is not right just becos he was made in the image of God.<br><br>He was perfect and good in God's eyes. What was the idea of perfection then and what our idea of perfection now could be different. We may think perfection means basically the person WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER do wrong becos he IS PERFECT and CANNOT DO WRONG by design.<br><br>But when God sees ADAM as PERFECT, His idea of PERFECTION was not that. Adam was perfect not by our own standards but BY HIS STANDARDS. And His standard include giving ADAM a free will. A free will is not complete if it doesnt include the ability to choose the wrong thing.<br><br>Who is to blame for Adam choosing to eat the wrong apple?<br><br>Was God wrong? Nope. God did not force him to eat the apple.<br>Was Eve wrong? Nope, she merely gave the apple to Adam.<br>Was the serpent wrong? Nope, it merely gave Eve another perspective to the apple<br><br>When EVE ate the apple, it is becos "the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it" (Gen 3:6) She then gave it to Adam who ate it.<br><br>From the beginning till end, no one forced Adam to eat the apple. Thoughts and Desires came into him as with free will. All I can say and I believe is that Adam and Eve sinned becos they entertained the wrong desires.<br><br>James 1:13-15 tells us this " When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."<br><br></div>
