            <div class='col-md body'>I have another question: One of the characteristics of being God is to be omnipresent, which means the ability to be present in every place at any, and/or every time; unbounded or universal presence. If this is so, then why did God have to ask Adam where is he as he walked into the Garden of Eden after they have eaten the forbidden fruit? Why did God have to ask both Adam and Eve whether they have eaten the fruit when he should already have known? Is it because he gei xiao know already but still want to ask? Or is it because he really isn't as powerful as we have thought?</div>
