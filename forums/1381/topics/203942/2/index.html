            <div class='col-md body'>I have yet another question: This has to do with the forbidden fruit. I understand that God wanted to give free will to both Adam and Eve and that's why he planted the Tree of Knowledge. But contrary to what most people think, the problem is not whether he chose to give Adam free will but whether he had KNOWN that Adam and Eve would eat the forbidden fruit.<br><br>If God had KNOWN, it means Adam did not have free will as he was already destined to eat the fruit. So who controls destiny? Due to his omnipotence, it must be God. But if he did not control Adam's destiny and had KNOWN beforehand, then there must be something above the power of God that controls destiny in order to let him know the future events.<br><br>In contrast, if God had really not known beforehand that Adam was going to eat the fruit, then God is probably not as powerful as we have thought. The only conclusion that I can draw is that omnipotence and free will simply cannot exist on the same plane. So, what's your take on this issue?</div>
