            <div class='col-md body'>Hebrews 11 lists many men and women of faith, speaking of them as<br>"having obtained a good testimony through faith." Similarly, King David<br>in his Psalms writes with an assurance of salvation that he already<br>holds in confidence.<br><br>In John 3:3 Jesus stated clearly "I tell you the truth, no one can see<br>the kingdom of God unless he is born again." In Romans 10:9 we read, "If<br>you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart<br>that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." We believe these<br>Scriptures to be true. However, Melchizedek and Job never knew clearly<br>who Jesus Christ was, and yet they were saved.<br><br>Jesus said there is no other way unto the Father but by Him. we know<br>that all salvation is accomplished through the shed blood of Jesus<br>Christ and its atonement for the sins of the world. Still, there is a<br>mystery here, in the sense that there were obviously many Old Testament<br>saints who were saved by Christ's death on the cross even though they<br>had never heard His name.<br><br>It is wrong to attempt to judge the salvation of others. Many people who<br>fluently speak the language of evangelical Christianity and speak<br>confidently of their "personal relationship" with Jesus Christ show few<br>of the fruits of the Spirit. In addition, some people are simpler than<br>others, and not as able to follow or express abstract doctrinal truth.<br>Yet when Jesus walked the earth, His special love and affection was for<br>those who were willing to "become like children."<br><br>It is difficult to know about the heathen or about nominal Christians<br>who have either had not contact with the gospel or who have received a<br>gospel that is badly distorted with traditional beliefs and false<br>doctrine. Many Jews, agnostics, and adherents to other religions have<br>not witnessed true Christianity to a significant degree. Instead, a<br>corrupt and worldly Christendom has distorted their view of Christ.<br><br>Just as Old Testament saints were redeemed by Christ's blood in spite of the fact that they never had a clear understanding of Christ and His work on our<br>behalf, so others in this age of grace who have never received the clear<br>gospel message can be saved if they have genuine faith in God.<br><br>This does not, however, mean that the final decision to accept Christ<br>still remains to be made by Old Testament saints or by the faithful of<br>this age who have not yet heard the good news of Jesus Christ. From the<br>divine perspective, the atonement offered mankind in Christ has an<br>eternal application, reaching back into the past all the way to Adam and<br>Eve and onward into the eternal future. Revelation 13:8 speaks of the<br>redeemed as having had their names written in the "book of life of the<br>Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."  Although e have searched<br>for Scriptures which would point toward the possibility of a "second<br>chance" after death, we have concluded that no solid biblical support<br>for such a position exists. As succinctly stated in Hebrews:<br><br>It is appointed for men to die once but after this the judgment.<br><br>The indication of Scripture is that at the time of our deaths our<br>courses are already set for eternal life or eternal damnation.</div>
