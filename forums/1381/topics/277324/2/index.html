You mean wearing bermudas will sexually tempt someone? OH MAN, if someone can be tempted sexually just because another wear bermudas, this person seriously need a psychiatrist! He or she will probably get horny hundreds of time every day when in the public cos he will probably see a bermudas every 3 minutes.<br><br>2. As for wearing your best when you meet God. Tell me when do you meet GOd?<br><br>You meet God when u pray. You meet God when u worship. These are the things we do everyday. So by right, you should wear nicely even when you are praying to him at home cos you are MEETING GOD. Why do it only on SUndays. NO DOUBLE STANDARDS please.<br><br>I agree with CHIN ENG on this. As long what you wear is culturally accepted as decent, why should anyone care?<br><br>Thats all, then the next time i think i have something to say haha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>technically what you wear shouldn't matter...then again it's just a little bit of respect to dress up, surely you would dress better when you are meeting someone of position....it's a worship afterall, if your god is worth the worship, wouldn't you want to be more respectful? that's why you have the term 'in your sunday best', it would be different if it's just a gathering of friends of cell group or whatever....<br><br>by dressing up, it doesn't mean you have to be in tie and suit but surely not what you would wear to go to the beach...lol</div>
