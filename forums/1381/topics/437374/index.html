              <p>Extracted from Stomp : Foreigners shoo family away from Botanic Gardens landmarks because they "booked it"</p>
              <p>Comments by one person I found require attention.</p>
              <p>By SophiaRosieHart</p>
              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>
              <p>6.@Darn walk out on a job i get paid 30 grand a month for mate you must be joking,found a job like that in new zealand nope because they all taken and i would rather travel the world i've been to most of asia i must say singapore was the worse place i ever landed in and i cant wait in till i get to move</p>
              <p>7.and u see i already have another job lined up thats mine if i want it and most of the new zealanders here get moved around by the same company they dont keep them here because they know they dont like it just like my boss knows i hate singapore thats why next is Bangkok or Dubai or Aussie.<br>he probably worked his ass of an lied to get the job thats why he cant move anywhere because he sucks and no one wants him ouch that must hurt hahahahahahahahahaa like no one wants you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess our Governement is not aware of all these. Keep talking about about "talent". The Government need to have a system to weed out such Foreigner.</p>

              <p>STOMPer Jean, who came across the postings online, was enraged by the foreigner's comments.<br><br>She wrote to STOMP:<br><br>"I chanced upon some outrageous comments made by Ms Rachelle Ann Beguia who is one of the many netizens who commented on Ms Penny Low's Facebook.<br><br>"The discussion took off when MP Ms Low was apologising for being caught using her iPhone when the National Anthem was being played at the recent NDP. In the midst of heated discussion, Ms Beguia made a few insulting and hurtful remarks about Singaporeans.<br><br>"She said: 'These moronic 'Singaporeans', their code, their morals, their 'loyalty' and 'patriotism'... all dropped at the first sign of trouble... just ask any of them if they want to be excused from serving NS and they will be the first to raise their hands... Require any of them to serve an extra month of NS and they will riot in Singapore... Ask them to fight a war, almost all will declare they are ready to pack up and run.'<br><br>"Is she trying to say all our NSMEN are cowards? On what grounds was she making such accusations?<br><br>"She further explained the followings to one of the Facebook users: 'But when foreigners like Bangladeshi, Thais and Indians come and provide labour for building flats and roads, you didn't seem to have complained about it...if tomorrow the government decides to hire foreigners to become soldiers and no more serving of NS for all men let's see if you will make the same comment...By the way, if foreigners can come and snatch your jobs and flats it only shows one thing.... how incompetent you are.'<br><br>"I strongly believe she owes Singaporeans and our NSMEN an apology. She insults our soldiers, their commitment to the nation and the lives lost for the safe protection of her and her family to grow up in Singapore.<br><br>"These insults are totally uncalled for."</p>

              <p>She has been named sacred prostitute, devadasi, temple dancer, hierodule. ... Likewise, Kwan Yin is Lady of Infinite mercy and Most compassionate One and is ...</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The first reason would be the stories about her unique beginnings.<span> </span> One states that she began life as a male who later became a female, she is sometime shown as half male and half female and she is also shown as a female. Another story that states that the worship of Kuan-Yin is older than Buddhism and that she is the original Earth Mother and the original Triple Goddess.<span>  </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The second reason is the correlation between this last information and the information that came up in my research on Hecate my Patroness Goddess.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>        </span> She is the Goddess that you can reach out to when you need to learn how to give yourself and others unconditional love, compassion, and forgiveness and healing.<span> </span> If you ask for her help she will never turn you away.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #800000;">So buddhist is either just love praying to a transexual</span> <span style="color: #800000;">or they just dunno they are praying to pros......LOL!</span> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #800000;">Why not pray to my dick better!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>
