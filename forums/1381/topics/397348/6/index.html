              <p>Right from the start of this topic, on more than just one page, I have always maintained that what I've said in the first post is applicable not just to one specific group of people. If you think for some reason, this seems more applicable to yourself than some other people, then maybe from your own perspective you can ask yourself why is it to you it seems so.</p>
              <p>I thank you again for at least acknowledging that even among Christians there are differences. It is the same among non-Christians. Which is why I've made it a point not to say non-Christians at large and be specific. Again I say it would be an insult to say non-Christians in general are like the anti-Christians here.</p>
              <p>You are fully aware that there are good Christians, and bad Christians. Personally it doesn't matter whether you think I am a good Christian or a bad Christian. <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Just be very aware that some of the people you talk to here, especially the anti-Christians do not share the same stand and make the same distinction you do.</strong></span> The gross generilisation they accuse others of, that you yourself hade made sure not to committ, they themselves are doing it to others.</p>
              <p>To say you are like the rest of them would be a very unfair statement as well.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #339966;">I maintain once again as I have before, the words </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #339966;">I have said are intended not only for non-Christians but Christians as well</span></strong>.</p>

              <p>To add hsene, just because you are not  a Christian any means you have to agree and follow with those who are not.</p>
              <p>For example, just because I am not a muslim, it means I have to agree with another no-muslim who insists and claims all muslims are members of Al Qaede.</p>
              <p>I also want to point out to you that Christians have been unhappy with is not non-Christians at large, but the anti-Christians here posting in EH. Yes, the behaviour of some has been wrong, many have responded badly, which is why I've said the words I've posted in this thread are not meant just for non-Christians but also Christians as well.</p>

              <p>If you don't wish to acknowledge what happened there might be a misunderstanding, at least know I am trying to clear it with the person in that thread.</p>
              <p>But what about yourself and your actions of deliberately encourage more conflict? So many a times already and not just in EH, the person is trying to make peace no matter whose fault it is. Yet you insist on stirring up the conflict, to encourage the mudslinging and all. This is so unlike the Laurence that started the first few years in sgforums.</p>
              <p>Tell me then where does your heart really lie? To get a point across? To inform? To clarify?</p>
              <p>If it is so, is there another way in which you could do it? Is there more than one way to phrase what is it you want to say?</p>
              <p>Or is there another intention altogether behind the posts you make?</p>

              <p>ummmm, you should ask this question to those who are bashing ,
              flaming non christians here .    </p>
              <p>I guess you ignore the bashing, usage of vulgarity, flaming of
              these evildoing christians (I refer to christians here who
              intentionally refuse to repent and practise the love of God) to non
              christians.   </p>
              <p>I know when the evil ones read this post, they will attack and
              flame me with their response.

              <p>I also came across somewhere and read about you saying I have made some posts to you before in the past? Honestly I can't remember, and before someone twists things I'm not saying I didn't, I just can't remember.</p>
              <p>What posts were they and what were they about? Because from those posts you actually used that to compare with the way another forumer posted and said I am the same person.</p>
