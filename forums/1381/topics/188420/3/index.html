That you need to believe in fantasy. You see, normal inteliigent healthy people live in reality; they face reality and take what reality has to offer with all its sadness and suffering and joy.</div>

'Christians' are 'followers of Christ'; 'Believers' are 'those who believe'. Among people who go to church, believers are taken as those who believe in Christianity; if you are in a Buddhist temple, 'believers' refers to those who believe in Buddhism. "believers" does not necessarily mean those who believe in Christianity??

But the purpose of the NT is more than an expansion of the ten commandments.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">The purpose of the NT is how so more than the expansion of the commandments? In Yeshua our Lord and saviour is the fulfilment of the commandments. And it states that to Love God is to Keep His commandments. That is all it is about. Grace for salvation and keeping what is important to God. It still boils down to keeping the commandments, even Yeshua said, love the Lord thy God and love thy neighbour as yourself. It is about God fulfilling by Himself His own requirements He has set for us for eternal life. It is about God's plan to save the world, by blinding for a season the true vine. But make no mistake, He has not forsaken them. </span><br><br><strong>Ans: Yes we have gone thru all that. But the main focus should still be about grace. Commandments are not the main focus.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Actually I disagree with you on that. Whilst grace is important, the church today does not stress enough about keeping the commandments of God (not as works for salvation) to the effect that we now have a problem of "cheap grace" . If the new believers do  not understand about keeping what is important to God, how can they then have a clear picture of who God is? God is the same from the OT till today. So if we profess to be Christians, then we must have that understanding of who GOD is. How do we do that except to know His commandments and to keep them. </span><br><br><strong>Ans: Being a Christian, I am the worst of the sinners who spiritually need Christ, how can I be spirtually higher than "believers" who insist Christians are going the wrong path by e.g. profess their faith or celebrate Christian festivals such as Easter and Good Friday?</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">on this one, what does God want you to do here in regards to these festivals? Do you know the Fathers heart? There are many who believe in God/Jesus/Holy Spirit that do not celebrate these festivals. </span><br><br><strong>Ans: I do not really like sharpening sometimes, it is not edifying.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Then why are we asked to do so? Proverbs 27:17<br>As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.</span><br><br><strong>Ans: Variety of opinion is impt, but if anything is written to undermine the Christian faith or cause confusion what Christianity is all about, a respond from Christians is needed. </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">The question here returns to what is the Christian faith about? MC has said it very well, the core of our faith is to KNOW THE FATHERS HEART and what He wants from us.</span></div>

But the purpose of the NT is more than an expansion of the ten commandments.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">The purpose of the NT is how so more than the expansion of the commandments? In Yeshua our Lord and saviour is the fulfilment of the commandments. And it states that to Love God is to Keep His commandments. That is all it is about. Grace for salvation and keeping what is important to God. It still boils down to keeping the commandments, even Yeshua said, love the Lord thy God and love thy neighbour as yourself. It is about God fulfilling by Himself His own requirements He has set for us for eternal life. It is about God's plan to save the world, by blinding for a season the true vine. But make no mistake, He has not forsaken them. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">The purpose of the NT is so much more than the expansion of the commandments. It is God's ultimate plan for salvation for mankind. Keeping the two basic commands by Christ is something we do to show that we love god, not becoz Christ is a task master who insist we must keep all the laws to earn his love. We can do nothing more to earn his love, and nothing less.</span><br><br><strong>Ans: Yes we have gone thru all that. But the main focus should still be about grace. Commandments are not the main focus.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Actually I disagree with you on that. Whilst grace is important, the church today does not stress enough about keeping the commandments of God (not as works for salvation) to the effect that we now have a problem of "cheap grace" . If the new believers do  not understand about keeping what is important to God, how can they then have a clear picture of who God is? God is the same from the OT till today. So if we profess to be Christians, then we must have that understanding of who GOD is. How do we do that except to know His commandments and to keep them. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Admittedly, "Cheap" grace is a problem especially in modern mega churches, but asking christians to keep the law so that grace won't appear so "cheap" is not a solution. It means reverting back to the OT (to me it is like telling god I dun need your grace, give me the law will do).</span><br><br><strong>Ans: Being a Christian, I am the worst of the sinners who spiritually need Christ, how can I be spirtually higher than "believers" who insist Christians are going the wrong path by e.g. profess their faith or celebrate Christian festivals such as Easter and Good Friday?</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">on this one, what does God want you to do here in regards to these festivals? Do you know the Fathers heart? There are many who believe in God/Jesus/Holy Spirit that do not celebrate these festivals. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">And there are many who do celebrate these festivals. Do you know the Fathers heart? I am still learning.</span><br><br><strong>Ans: I do not really like sharpening sometimes, it is not edifying.</strong><br><br><strong>Ans: Variety of opinion is impt, but if anything is written to undermine the Christian faith or cause confusion what Christianity is all about, a respond from Christians is needed. </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">The question here returns to what is the Christian faith about?
