Good Christian still kena hum tum. Or else why so many martyrs for Christ or why so much persecution for some Christians. Why even though when Christians live out their lives as a good Christian according to what MC said, people still despise them or persecute them? I myself have undergone great persecution just bcos i am a Christian. False accusations have been leveled against me &amp; every little fault is magnified to accuse me of being a bad person just bcos i am a Christian.<br><br>I think unbelievers have to realise they have a set mentality against Christians no matter good or bad ones. They will give reasons not to believe bcos of this sin of this Christian lah &amp; that sin of that Christian lah when they are not supposed to fault find other people but to examine themselves &amp; come to God on their own terms. They cannot stand before God one day &amp; say hey those Christians are an awful bunch of people so i didnt believe bcos of them so cannot fault me God.
