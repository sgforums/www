But I know some people who are very deep believers. They just can't help themselves sinning. They have some issues with sloth and lust, u get the idea. In this case then how? Afterall all men are supposed to be sinners, some are weaker than others. Is it accurate to use the amount of sin one commits as a marker of how deeply one believes?

U look at a lot of those who devoutly attend church, but don't improve their daily lives, u'll know what I mean.<br><br>So now im even more confused as well. Are u saying as long as one's a true believer one is 100% saved? Or are u saying God reserves the right not to offer salvation to even a 'true believer'? If u're saying true believers are100% saved, then by what basis do we judge if one's a true believer, and by what basis do we judge how much a person's sins determine his status as a true believer?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

I'm not sure God sees everything that is to happen in the future, but rather in some curious way our world may have already ended for Him.<br><br>This might be only strange because we are withing the confines of this creation and being the hybrid creatures of spirit and flesh that we are. It may not actually reflect any true incongruence between free will and omnipotence and ominiscence at all. When I transpose a higher medium into a lower one, some things are going to have to be compacted. The same note might play both the piano and the brass part.<br><br>I for that matter have no issues with God knowing everything and yet giving us utter free will to choose or reject Him. I suspect that the very reason free will might even exist at all is that He used His own Will to will it into reason, and doing so He made us moral creatures.<br><br>He maintains the processes that runs our free wills, but I seriously doubt He is trying to control every apsect of our though or has it scripted out (as much as He knows what choice I will make). What it seems to me is that He's trying to get our wills to align to His own through a curious method of wooing. In us He deliberately makes Himself small by allowing us the freedom to choose yet Him.<br><br>It seems to me that He's reacting to our wills, instead of controlling us. Reacting in such a fashion that still leaves us effectively free to choose. If you ask me there is only one real choice to make in this life, and that is to walk to Him or away... seems to me all other choices are just subsets of this ultimate reality in our universe.<br><br></div>
