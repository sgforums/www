Â“The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heartÂ”[a](that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br><br>Hebrews 10:28-30 (New King James Version)<br>28 Anyone who has rejected MosesÂ’ law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 29 Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know Him who said, Â“Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,Â”[a] says the Lord.[b] And again, Â“The LORD will judge His people.Â”[c]<br><br>Galatians 5:13 (New King James Version)<br>13 For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.<br><br>It is clear from these verses that<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> those who do not believe will be judged not by Jesus, but by the words which Jesus has spoken.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> if we confess with our mouth and believe in our heart we will be saved<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the grace given is not a licence to sin wilfully<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> that if we take for granted God's grace, we will be judged, if you read through the book of revelation, when the angel talks about the seven churches, it talks about God's judgement on the church.<br><br>The curx here being a true and sincere repentance of the heart and always and forever keeping in that state of gratefulness for God's grace and having a soft heart that is obedient before God. If a person confesses that he believes and then does not have the works to back it up, do you not think that the Lord will not see? It is already said in the bible, in Isaiah 29:13 that the Lords people draw near to Him with their lips, but their hearts are far away...<br><br>If we truly believe and repent, then we will not walk another way, we will not abuse the grace that is given because it is a prized gift. We will cherish it. Those who do not will only have to face the consequences as stated in Hebrews 10. If you sin, God will judge you, but you will not lose your salvation, unless you completely reject the Lord again and go back to your old ways...<br><br>God's judgment here is with an eye to correction and not just punishment for the sake of punishment. God's judgement here is so that we are made aware of our faults so that we work towards overcoming them in His grace, by His guidance as we yeild our spirits, soul and body to Him.<br><br>Proverbs 3:11<br>My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD, Nor detest His correction;<br><br>Proverbs 3:12<br>For whom the LORD loves He corrects, Just as a father the son in whom he delights.<br><br>Know that by Yeshua's work on the cross, our pardon is 100% assured if we believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths... but it still does not mean we do not have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling, being mindful always of God's grace so that when we sin(and this not the wilful type of sinning and taking the grace of God cheaply), we can come back to the Lord and repent, for we are now no longer under condemnation. But note that our walk is according to the Spirit and not the flesh...<br><br>Rom 8:1<br>1 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,[a] who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.<br><br>Philippians 2:12<br>[ Light Bearers ] Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;<br><br></div></blockquote>hmm according to laoda99 its not a free licence to sin, but he also says as long as u believe, u're 100% saved<br><br>u say a true believer will not abuse the grace, so it is not likely someone who sins more than a true believer "should" is a true believer. But I know some people who are very deep believers. They just can't help themselves sinning. They have some issues with sloth and lust, u get the idea. In this case then how? Afterall all men are supposed to be sinners, some are weaker than others. Is it accurate to use the amount of sin one commits as a marker of how deeply one believes? And if what u say is true, then a whole load of Xtians I know, are simply false believers. U look at a lot of those who devoutly attend church, but don't improve their daily lives, u'll know what I mean.<br><br>So now im even more confused as well. Are u saying as long as one's a true believer one is 100% saved? Or are u saying God reserves the right not to offer salvation to even a 'true believer'? If u're saying true believers are100% saved, then by what basis do we judge if one's a true believer, and by what basis do we judge how much a person's sins determine his status as a true believer?<br><br></div>
