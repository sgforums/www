            <div class='col-md body'>I believe in the existance of ghost... I got this experiences... Few years ago before my grandma passed away... I saw the most horrifying scene in my life.. Before she died, she keep on talking by herself... At first she just calling "Ah ma.. ah pa.."... then she started to scream, trembling and her eyes opened wide... Then there was one catholic pastor (a friend of my brother) came, prayed for her and after that only I can see my grandma calmed down... The pastor told me that he has prayed for her and avoid her from ghosts' hands.  The next day, I saw her passed away peacefully...her face is just calming.. not like one of my uncle who died long time ago, can see his face like very very scared of something... Thats reallllyyyy scary. Since then all my family members believe about ghost and God..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John The Baptist:</div><div class="quote_body">Hello sillyme,<br><br>I dont quite agree with you. In Jude, it is written: from v.8: "Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, &amp; speak evil of dignitaries. YET WHEN MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL, IN CONTENDING WITH THE DEVIL, WHEN HE DISPUTED ABOUT THE BODY OF MOSES, DARED NOT BRING AGAINST HIM A REVILING ACCUSATION, BUT SAID, "THE LORD REBUKE YOU!" But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves." etc etc. [b]Even Michael an ARCHANGEL, I REPEAT, AN ARCHANGEL(VERY POWERFUL ANGEL) ALSO SCARED OF POWER OF SATAN WHAT MORE US MERE MORTALS WHO ARE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS?<br><br>Pls read whole book of Jude. Very short chapter. U will have a very clear understanding of what the end time church is like.</div></blockquote>[/b]<br><br>Firstly, contextually it is wrong for you to say that.<br>Michael is not 'scared' of the powers of satan.<br><br>Secondly, there is a need to bring forth the issue of 'The body of Moses' on what and why they are in a dispute.<br><br>Thirdly, this verse or contextually. I doesn't prove that Archangels and 'Mere Mortals' are less powerful and afraid of satan's power.<br>In fact, your theology is warpped.<br><br>I suggest you read on Jude again to have a much clearer understanding.<br><br>Commentary on Verse 9:<br><br>Though this contest was mightily eager and earnest, and <span style="color: red;">Michael was victorious in the issue,</span> yet he would not bring a railing accusation against the devil himself; he knew a good cause needed no such weapons to be employed in its defence.<br>It is said, he durst not bring, etc. Why durst he not?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Not that he was afraid of the devil, but he believed God would be offended if,</span> in such a dispute, he went that way to work; he thought it below him to engage in a trial of skill with the great enemy of God and man which of them should out-scold or out-rail the other: a memorandum to all disputants, never to bring railing accusations into their disputes.<br>Truth needs no supports from falsehood or scurrility.</div>
