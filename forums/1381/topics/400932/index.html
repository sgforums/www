              <p>there're simple questions but the answers to them are never so easy. maybe to you, it's black and white, no shades of grey which is why you're only to comprehend as little as you can. my suggestion to you is stay within your own worldview, because that's the only one that allows you to be closed minded and irrational. your mind isn't quite able to take in more than that at the moment. so there's still hope! take heart!</p>
              <p>karma, faith, rebirth, what goes around comes around ... are you a buddhist who's trying to convert other people by attempting to call out the so called "inconsistencies" but ignoring your very own personal ones? </p>

              <p>Why even create this thread in the first place. If you really wanted to ask questions in  a christain point of view, why even insult it, comes back to why even ask it in the first place. , tossing accusations back and forth with
              no true allegation and bear nothing but animosity towards it proc them
              to do the same to you. You attack them, they attack you. So where does
              it end? When the other side is eliminated?</p>

              <p>the religion was started from there. why is it do u think Jews are god's chosen people if it was not written by a Jew?</p>
              <p>the reason is simple. like you and many others, they were hoodwinked for they do not know the truth. the truth of the matter is the concept of god was clearly invented and created by a Jew, a man.</p>

              <p>and can you prove beyond a shadow of a double that G_d was invented by man? you cannot can you? so can you be entirely sure that G_d does not exist? this will run both sides, and having been on both sides, I would say without a shadow of a doubt that G_d exists. It's like the matrix, when you see you see, when you don't you still live in the system... now the question is this, are you so sure that you are the one that is out of the system?</p>
