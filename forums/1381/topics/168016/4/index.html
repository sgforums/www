It is the most effective pharmaceutical treatment for patients at risk for cirrhosis and other liver diseases.<br><br>All microorganisms need iron to reproduce, including HCV. HCV-positive patients with higher serum iron levels are more likely to develop chronic infections, and those with lower levels are more likely to resolve infections spontaneously.<br><br>There were favorable results in all arms of a trial of pegylated interferon-a in combination with mycophenolate mofetil, amantadine, and ribavirin for the treatment of relapsers and non-responders to interferon-a. All pegylated interferon-a combinations had appreciable virologic response rates. Pegylated interferon-a plus amantadine and ribavirin had the most favorable benefits.<br><br>Drugs to Reduce Side Effects of Interferon and Ribavirin<br><br>Epoetin Alfa. Interferon-a and ribavirin combinations sometimes induce anemia severe enough to force dose reduction or discontinuation of ribavirin. When epoetin alfa was added to the combination treatment in a 16-week trial, patients were able to maintain their ribavirin dose and hemoglobin levels. In anemic patients, epoetin corrected anemia and enabled 84% of patients to maintain their ribavirin dose.<br><br>Dronabinol. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting are common side effects of ribavirin and interferon-a as well as major causes of discontinuation of treatment. Dronabinol is a synthetic cannabinoid approved for treatment of side effects AIDS patients on cancer chemotherapy. In a clinical trial, 40% of the patients agreed that dronabinol was an effective treatment of major side effects caused by ribavirin and interferon-a.<br><br>A more recent therapy is Infergen. I would think a combination than mono therapy is more effective.<br><br>http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/hep_c/treatment/infergen.html<br><br>And please avoid alcohol.<br><br></div></blockquote>Thanks macjoe...i am already on pegylated interferon and ribavarin before I relapsed. So far I do not think Singapore has infergen.Will have to see what my doc says on 30th dec.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things to do:<br><br>1). Try to eat food that is good for your liver, not sure, maybe must check out library or internet or ask nutritionist advice. Most probably, so chinese herbs or vegetables, etc, or certain vitamins.<br><br>2). Rest more, perhaps you over exerted. Have at least 8 hours sleep a day, drink more water, exercise regularly.<br><br>3). Think positively, maybe next time you go for check up, it could have gone away liao, i.e. registered negative.<br><br>4). Dont use needles, tattoos, etc, dont eat raw foods, like raw seafood, muscles, clams, etc<br><br>5). Maintain correct frame of mind, be positive, and seek divine help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  go temple pray once in a while.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
