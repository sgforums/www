              <p>There is help and hope available for homosexuals who are discontented with their unwanted homosexual tendencies and desires. I encourage homosexuals who are unhappy to seek change. With God's mercy and grace, the homosexual can overcome his struggles.</p>
              <p>Here is some practical advice for homosexuals who wish to change. Change takes time, it is a process. We cannot seek instant solutions to complex problems. Since homosexuality is a developmental disorder, the homosexual must be humble in being patient and persevering, trusting God always.</p>

              nah dont be so harsh on TS. Afterall, I think practical advice for heterosexuals who want to change would also be in good order. 
              
              The real trouble is the segregation into two camps - heterosexuals and homosexuals. if we all realised that sexuality is a transient fluid identity, then there is no major leap to "switch camps" - we could all love whoever we wanted too, whoever they might be. We could go back and forth, we could let be and maybe we could be happier people. But well, humans are always making themselves unhappy, so....

              <p>The problem is not that people disagree with homosexuality, it is that people should be able to carry out their convictions in a way that does not impose on the free will and dignity of others, nor deny them their rights.

              <p>Well I don't mind drama, but when it costs lives I will.</p>
              <p>I came from a fundementalist church ministry that had serious shortfalls in dealing with the issue of homosexuality. It showed the condition as a basic defect with stock answers for dealing with it and expected outcomes of people who struggle with it. The characters who struggled with the issue are always shown as cardboard characters in the church plays, sermons, and what have you not. Youth pastor also used scientifically incorrect information to back up his stance, saying homosexuality is not natural because even animals did not do it, which flies quite in the face of the over 3000 species of animals who are observed to do it. But these are the kinds of things that were fed to our minds.</p>
              <p>Turned out one of my friends who was a leader in the ministry stuggled with the issue, and when it came to light nobody knew how to handle it. Basically I personally felt it was mishandled because everybody had no idea what it really was like, as well as an empathy for the situtation. They desired a particular outcome so much for him it seems they missed out the person entirely. Anyway long story short I think they blotched their attempts to help him because they were simply unable to think out of the fundementalist box they've locked themselves into.  </p>
              <p>So yes, I think it's imperative that Christians who WANT to show what the love of Christ is do not see this as simply a culture or value war, or something that should be fought from across the picket lines. Truth is, if anything, it is the general poor treatment any understanding of homosexuals and their struggles that gives a lot of steam to the pro-gay movement.</p>

              <p>My belief that homosexuality is a developmental disorder comes from the idea that all of us are truly heterosexuals but homosexuals experience what Michel Foucault and many others would describe as "gender inversion". How this "gender inversion" comes about is primarily because the person's development --- in terms of social, gender, psychological, emotional etc. --- does not go the way it ought to. In other words, homosexuals are actually heterosexuals who have homosocial and homoemotional needs which are not met during their formative years.</p>
              <p>I am a Christian who believes that God's Word tells us that homosexuality is a sin. I encourage all homosexual Christians who are struggling to find help and hope in the power of the Holy Spirit. Pastoral counselling and secular psychotherapy will help a repentant homosexual to sort out his problems. And of course having a close group of male heterosexual friends to provide emotional, moral and spiritual support will be useful too.</p>
              <p>As mentioned, I must highlight the fact that I am not here to IMPOSE my views and opinions on others. I have no right to do so, neither the power. Yet, in an online forum such as this, surely I am given the chance to offer my beliefs and this is exactly what I am seeking to do here. To offer help and hope for those who are discontented with their UNWANTED homosexual tendencies and desires.</p>
              <p>If you are gay, and you have no wish to change and you are perfectly happy with your life, then surely this thread would prove to be of no relevance to you.</p>

              <p><br>You are correct. However it's another thing to say that these views cannot be expressed or brought across to the other side.</p>
              <p>The METHODS these views are brought across are extremely important... the way it was done in AWARE however I see it, are probably not ethical at all. One has to draw the line between communication and trying to convince someone, and imposing on their free will. </p>
              <p>However in recent times there is another push which I do not agree with as well, and that is the push to supress, censor, or at least render any expression of these views as socially unacceptable.</p>
              <p>Basically the perception has been pushed that if you express opinions that disagree with homosexuality then you are a homophobe or that you ought to be "deconverted" of such a position with social pressure... this is also not acceptable.</p>
