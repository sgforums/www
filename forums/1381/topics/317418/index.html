              <p><br>sorry if i had sounded that way.</p>
              <p>the more regular folks here are use to my answers.</p>
              <p>1. insomuch as Jesus was a Jew, he lived as a Jew. But he also considered the norms and cultures of the non-Jews and had on various occasions gone beyond the accepted way of life of a Jew. For example, His interaction with the Samaritan woman, and his parable of the good Samaritan is a good example. Jews and the Samaritans do not mix. The Samaritans are considered to be pariahs to a good Jew.</p>
              <p>2. if you read Paul's writings, you will find that he even admonished (or tell off) the other church leaders then, that they should not enslave the Gentiles with Jewish laws (which he noted that even the Jews had problem keeping).</p>

              <p>i think it's alright la. he's a new believer. my dad when he first became a christian nearly joined the mormons. even worse right lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hmm. if you believe in Jesus, then you should believe what He said is the truth, and that no one can go to the Father except through Him, and He is the way, the truth and the life. that's one of the things that the jews cannot accept about Jesus. that he is the son of God, and thus they reject him as messiah. in fact, if you believe in Jesus, and His words as truth, you'll know that He gave a parable that the jews will be cast out and the gentiles will be accepted instead.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000099;">The beliefs of B’nei Noah align with the Thirteen Principles laid out by Maimonides as the fundamentals of Jewish faith. </span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #000099;">We believe with perfect faith the G-d is the Creator and Ruler of all things.  He <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alone</span> has made, does make, and will make all things.<br><br></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000099;">We believe with perfect faith that G-d is ONE.  There is no unity that is in any way like His. He <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alone</span> is our G-d — He was, He is, and He will be.<br><br></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000099;">We believe with perfect faith that G-d does not have a body.  Physical concepts do no apply to Him.  There is nothing whatsoever that resembles Him at all.<br><br></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000099;">We believe with perfect faith that G-d is first and last.<br><br></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000099;">We believe with perfect faith that it is only proper to pray to G-d.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One may not pray to anyone or anything else</span>.<br><br></span></li>

              <li><span style="color: #000099;">We believe with perfect faith that the entire Torah that we now have is that which was given to Moses </span><blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000099;">We believe that Israel was given the Torah at Sinai and chosen by G-d to be a “light unto the nations.”  As such, they have the authority to teach the Seven Laws of Noah from the Torah to the Gentiles.<br><br></span></p>

              <li><span style="color: #000099;">We believe with perfect faith that G-d knows all of Man’s deed and thoughts.  It is thus written (Psalm 33:15), “He has molded every heart together, He understands what each one does.”<br><br></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000099;">We believe with perfect faith that G-d rewards those who keep His commandments, and punishes those who transgress His commandments. </span><blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000099;">These commandments are applicable to those to whom they were given. For the Jews, this means the 613 commandments of the Torah, as applicable to each person -- man or woman, Kohen or Israelite, king or citizen.  The commandments to which B'nei Noah are obligated are the Universal Seven Laws of Noah:</span></p>

              The only part of Judaism that Christians have the duty to follow

              <p>How about this commandment: " Remenber the sabbath day and keep it holy." Exodus 20:8 Tanakh JPS.  Just ask around,  how many christians really observe the sabbath and keep it holy.  If what you said is true, don't you think that it is better for Christians to follow the teachings of Rabbinic Judaism? Rabbinic Judaism only obligated gentiles to observe the 7 universal laws of Noah.</p>
