I didn't even add in anythign orginal from me, but cutand paste from an article tat reads "What the bible says-and doesn'tsay-about homosexuality"<br><br>OR r u gonna say the bible is not relevant to christian ? If the bible is not mentioned in tis discussion, may I enquire on wat ground should homo be sinful to god ? In fact it seems to be complementary to your coments about bible stating tis and tat yet conveniently forget rules such as the ones written by the author of the attachment.</div>
