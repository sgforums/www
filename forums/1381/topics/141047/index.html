Both homosexuality and adultery are grave sins in the OT, but wait b4 u make a judgement whether it is ok or not: Jesus forgave the woman from committing adultery by saving her from being stoned to death. Is Jesus condoning adultery? I dun think so....what I believe is...all man have sinned....and Jesus forgave men's sins by dying for us on the cross....that is most important<br><br>Sometimes I feel we get too concerned over what is ok and what is not, until we really forget that Christ teach us to be loving and forgiving, not quick to judge one's wrong...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>People on both sides of the issue often misunderstand the sin of homosexuality. In trying to argue that there are acceptable types of homosexual relationships, some try to define the sin of homosexuality by limiting it to specific forms of sexual behavior between those of the same gender such as pederasty (sex between men and boys). Defining unhealthy same-sex behavior in this manner, however, does not reflect the spirit or language of the Bible.<br><br>On the other side of the issue are those who fail to recognize the difference between experiencing same-sex attractions and choosing to pursue homosexual lust and/or behavior. Generally speaking, those who feel same-sex attraction experience desires that are not initially chosen. They are conditioned. The attractions usually stem from early influences and are developed outside of a personÂ’s conscious awareness (see Do people choose to have sexual attractions for the same sex? ).<br><br>Feeling sexual desires for the same gender is not the sin of homosexuality. Romans 1:26-27 elaborates:<br><br>"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."<br><br>Phrases such as "inflamed with lust" and "men committed indecent acts with other men" show that the homosexuality the apostle Paul had in view was lust and behavior, not merely feeling sexual attraction for same gender. Many who have felt unnatural sexual attractions for those of the same sex have not crossed a moral line into sexual lust and behavior any more than those who naturally feel sexual attractions for those of the opposite sex. ItÂ’s not until they cultivate fantasies about or engage in sexual behavior with another person of the same gender that they commit the sin of homosexuality.<br><br>As with any type of immoral thought or behavior, homosexuality is fundamentally a sin of the heart. PaulÂ’s statements about women who "exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones" (v.26) and men who "abandoned natural relations with women" (v.27) demonstrate that the sin of homosexuality comes from a heart that rebels against God by forsaking His natural design for relationships and pursuing abnormal relations with those of the same sex.<br><br>As can be seen from this, it is definitely not right.</div>

Your spouse may be heartbroken (read the news a few years back, two lesbians commited suicide and one of them had a boyfriend)? Your church may be heartbroken?
