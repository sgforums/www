            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">God did not intend for people to be homosexual. It is not as the maker intended it. But God still loves the person and NOT THE SIN. </div></blockquote>hi!<br><br>I would agree with Breytonhartge that GOD loves the person even though he is homosexual.<br><br>I think GOD loves everyone and he is not quick to condemn us sinners but gives us forgiveness with his grace.<br><br>Let me say a few words regarding this issue:<br><br>1) The OT did say GOD detest pple of the same sex sleeping with each other, even saying that it is an abomination (a very strong word used I think) in the eyes of GOD. This is more than confirmed.<br><br>The argument is always about whether this law is still applicable in today's context. For me, my stand as a christian is: I believe it still is. But what I believed also is: GOD does not hold it against u if u sinned in this aspect. He is a forgiving GOD and loves all his children, including homosexuals.<br><br>2) The bible does not approve of sexual immorality, be it homosex, adultery etc. However, we also know that there is no eternal condemnation in Christ. If Christ can forgive the adulterous woman from being stoned to death, I do not believe we should condemn homosexuals. A side note: one of the grey areas brought up by some theologians is that Christ in the NT never says anything good/bad abt homosexuality. What I believe from a reformed point of view:  we only do what GOD says we can do, and not do anything which GOD says we cannot do. I think I am a bit conservative here, but it is my own opinion based on the reformed faith.<br><br>What I believed: Men, being fallible, will never be able to not commit these sins entirely. Only Christ who is our lord can keep us from falling into these sins. If we truely love Christ, we should keep his commands to love GOD and each other. I remember when Christ healed the paralysed man, he also said:" Sin no more." This shows if we really love Christ, we shouldn't sin anymore. GOD has gives us his grace, if we love him we should try to keep his commandments. I believed every parent would be heartbroken if the child keeps committing the same mistake. As children of GOD, we should stand fast to our faith and not disappoint GOD, who has faith in us even though we of little faith always stray from him.<br><br>3) I have frens who are homosexuals and transgendered pple. They are very nice people, in fact nicer than many of my 'normal' frens. Many of them, esp the transgendered pple are outcasts of society. They can't hold their jobs for long, probably due to discrimination or probably becoz they want more money. Some of my transgendered frens are quite pitiful; i find them strong on the outside but weak on the inside, taking drugs and sleeping around to numb themselves. From my research done on the internet, their lifespan is shortened due to the hormones they took. HIV/AIDs also have a high toll on them.<br><br>I think as fellow human beings, we should accept them and treat them like any of our normal frens. They are already living upside-down lives and I believed the only way we can help them is to be their frens, not their enemies. In the bible, Christ gives great hope to the desperate, underpriviledged and condemned in society, promising them that "theirs is the kingdom of heaven." He condemned the self-righteous pharisees who enforced the law without love for their fellow men.<br><br>I believed as Christians we should emulate Christ's love for these pple. Dialogue/discussion with them should never be closed and in fact encouraged to be more open and frank. Only thru this way we can live in a peaceful world with each other.<br><br></div>

I believe it wholeheartedly, otherwise my faith cannot stand.<br><br>So as a Christian, I do not condone homosexuality, but I do not condemn homosexuals, they are humans just like all of us and deserve an equal amount of respect. I love them as I would love anyone else, in fact, some of my best friends are homosexuals. They have accepted the Lord and are Christians but do not practice the lifestyle because they have very strong convictions that it is wrong.<br><br>Homosexuality is an unnatural act. It just does not fit. But I do not abhor the person, just the sin. (it would be a sin to me because I believe what the bible says).<br><br>Please do not get upset or take the moral high ground here, this is a christian view point, and I think like laoda says, one shared by a lot of us.<br><br>If you would like a more indepth discussion on the topic, I suggest you get a copy of Sy Rogers one of the boys, he was a homosexual, who considered a sex change who is now a proud father and husband... his life was turned around and he now speaks actively on this subject as well as the subject of sex and christianity... he will be in singapore in august and I strongly recommend that you go listen to him.

I believe it wholeheartedly, otherwise my faith cannot stand.<br><br>So as a Christian, I do not condone homosexuality, but I do not condemn homosexuals, they are humans just like all of us and deserve an equal amount of respect. I love them as I would love anyone else, in fact, some of my best friends are homosexuals. They have accepted the Lord and are Christians but do not practice the lifestyle because they have very strong convictions that it is wrong.<br><br>Homosexuality is an unnatural act. It just does not fit. But I do not abhor the person, just the sin. (it would be a sin to me because I believe what the bible says).<br><br>Please do not get upset or take the moral high ground here, this is a christian view point, and I think like laoda says, one shared by a lot of us.<br><br>If you would like a more indepth discussion on the topic, I suggest you get a copy of Sy Rogers one of the boys, he was a homosexual, who considered a sex change who is now a proud father and husband... his life was turned around and he now speaks actively on this subject as well as the subject of sex and christianity... he will be in singapore in august and I strongly recommend that you go listen to him. He has a website as well called Sy Rogers Communications.<br><br>Hope this answers your question.</div></blockquote>No religions condone or condemn homosexuality. Why should they?

This is answering the thread. Whether other religions condone or condemn homosexuality, we do not bother, as Christians, we are called to walk the same standards that Jesus did, but we always have one thing, GRACE.</div>
