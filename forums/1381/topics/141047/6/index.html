My homosexual friends are well-educated individuals with stable income; Some are self-professed christians, know it is sinful but just do not want to stop. Whenever they see someone 'cute', they just cannot resist the temptation.<br><br>My transgendered frens lived upside-down lives and numb themselves in drugs and sex. They are quite pitiful as all their only aim in life is to earn $$$ to finance their sex operation and lifestyle.<br><br>I do not believe in condemning homosexuals. They are individuals who needed help most, not rejection. Irregardless of Christianity, I do not believe our society and culture, esp chinese culture condone homosexuality. But we know that GOD is a loving GOD and Christ dies for all sins. We should always emulate Christ's love for them and try to bring them back to reality.<br><br></div></blockquote>The problem I have is not arguing if homosexuality is sin or not. The answer is obvious.<br><br>Back to the thread starter question.<br>My problem is, the inappropriate usage of scriptures was used on this sensitive topic.<br><br>By unappropriate usage, i mean the stand in Christianity though stays the same.<br>However the usage of scriptures is too sensitive to make it stand.<br>Refer to my earliest msg?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">It's all about acceptance.<br>There are many practices in church which changed due to modern era.<br>So why should this issue stick so closely to the word?<br></div></blockquote>If i were to draw out scriptural verses (on Leviticus and Deuteronomy mainly) to counter question on the relevancy of scripture on this issue. The bible scriptures must stand. We will have a Word war. (Which SIS did already, his question against the verses I thought, is very valid. But in the wrong thread.)<br><br>To me, homosexuality does not hurt God, more so as the children of God using the word and creating their own standards by emphasizing the verses which they interpret - selective quoting/preaching.<br><br>My conclusion: Homosexuality is sin, but do we accept homosexuals and their habits in church? Leave the love the sinner and hate the sin aside. Think carefully on what was taught in the bible about Love.<br><br>Christianity is personal. God's Love is personal as well.<br>The spiritual encounter is personal.<br>Since it was claimed that Christianity is a relationship, not a religion.<br>Let's not 'speak for God' and claim the bible.<br>Personally, I never believe in that any Christians should stand up and speak up for the word, when has the word of God needed any one to speak for anyway?<br><br>We are not perfect. We could only be perfect because of Christ became our sacrifice hence Christians can have a relationship with God.<br><br>Homosexuals have their own experience with God as much as you do. They might have excellent qualities attributed from the Holy Spirit more than thestraights<br><br>I dont know a lot bout homosexuals, but I know Christians should deliver a message. The message of  the Old Rugged Cross.<br><br>Since we are not perfect. Lets remember Gods grace is to all.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
