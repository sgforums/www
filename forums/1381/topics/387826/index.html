              <p> </p>
              <p>Below is an extract of book 2 - Baptised by Blazing Fire</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><em><span style="color: #000080;">"As I fervently prayed in tongues, Jesus appeared.  I quickly sensed that He was about to take me to hell once again.  It looked as though the Lord was a bit hesitant to disclose my trip.  Before the Lord was able to ask me a question, I asked Him.  "Jesus, why are you being hesitant? I know you are about to take me to hell again, right?" The Lord gave me an awkward expression.  However, I could not disobey the Lord.  "Jesus! If you do not show me my family in torment, I will follow you to the ends of hell.  I just do not want to see my parents in torment." The Lord held my hand and did not say a word.</span></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>As usual, once the Lord held my hand, we were already in hell.  We began to walk through a narrow path.  Within a short time, the smell of rotten corpses began to fill the air.  We arrived at an open wide field.  The were crosses endlessly lined up.  All the crosses were dug deeply into the ground.  There were already many people hanging on the crosses and many more who just arrived were waiting in long lines to be crucified.  My mother was also present among the crowd waiting to be nailed onto a cross.  She stood under one of the unoccupied cross.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>A large frightening creature guarded the crosses.  When it was my mother’s turn, the creature tied my mother onto the cross and prepared her to be nailed.  The creature glanced at me and as he turned to her spoke.  "Tell your daughter not to go to church and to stop believing in Jesus this instant.  Otherwise, you will really die today!" My mother looked very frightened.  The creature looked toward me and busted out.  "If you say that you will stop believing in Jesus, I will spare your mother and I not torment her.  Say it! Say you will stop believing!" It attempted to bargain with me.  "Say it now! Make your vow! Hurry!" The creature demanded.  The situation was very tense and nerve racking.  The creature had a human body with the head of a horse.  It was heinous, I could not look at it straight in the eye.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>The horse headed creature drew a large bright sword and commanded his subordinates.  The subordinates quickly obeyed and moved.  The creature then pressured my mother.  "Quickly! Tell your daughter! Now! Hell is in chaos because of your daughter.  The church in which your daughter is attending prays all night long.  We are hindered in every way.  Humans who are suppose to be coming to hell are going to church and we are frustrated.  Quickly! Ask your daughter now! Her Pastor is writing a book that will reveal our identities and reveal hell.  We must stop him from writing that book.  Now, quickly ask your daughter!"  ..... "</em></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Below is an extract of book 2 - Baptised by Blazing Fire</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em><span style="color: #000080;">"As I fervently prayed in tongues, Jesus appeared.  I quickly sensed that He was about to take me to hell once again.  It looked as though the Lord was a bit hesitant to disclose my trip.  Before the Lord was able to ask me a question, I asked Him.  "Jesus, why are you being hesitant? I know you are about to take me to hell again, right?" The Lord gave me an awkward expression.  However, I could not disobey the Lord.  "Jesus! If you do not show me my family in torment, I will follow you to the ends of hell.  I just do not want to see my parents in torment." The Lord held my hand and did not say a word.</span></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>As usual, once the Lord held my hand, we were already in hell.  We began to walk through a narrow path.  Within a short time, the smell of rotten corpses began to fill the air.  We arrived at an open wide field.  The were crosses endlessly lined up.  All the crosses were dug deeply into the ground.  There were already many people hanging on the crosses and many more who just arrived were waiting in long lines to be crucified.  My mother was also present among the crowd waiting to be nailed onto a cross.  She stood under one of the unoccupied cross.</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>A large frightening creature guarded the crosses.  When it was my mother’s turn, the creature tied my mother onto the cross and prepared her to be nailed.  The creature glanced at me and as he turned to her spoke.  "Tell your daughter not to go to church and to stop believing in Jesus this instant.  Otherwise, you will really die today!" My mother looked very frightened.  The creature looked toward me and busted out.  "If you say that you will stop believing in Jesus, I will spare your mother and I not torment her.  Say it! Say you will stop believing!" It attempted to bargain with me.  "Say it now! Make your vow! Hurry!" The creature demanded.  The situation was very tense and nerve racking.  The creature had a human body with the head of a horse.  It was heinous, I could not look at it straight in the eye.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>The horse headed creature drew a large bright sword and commanded his subordinates.  The subordinates quickly obeyed and moved.  The creature then pressured my mother.  "Quickly! Tell your daughter! Now! Hell is in chaos because of your daughter.  The church in which your daughter is attending prays all night long.  We are hindered in every way.  Humans who are suppose to be coming to hell are going to church and we are frustrated.  Quickly! Ask your daughter now! Her Pastor is writing a book that will reveal our identities and reveal hell.  We must stop him from writing that book.  Now, quickly ask your daughter!"  ..... "</em></span></p>

              <p>why the lord and the daughter did not save the mother, instead watching the mother being tortured by the creature ? i really don't understand this story. the daughter did not plead the lord to save her mother. why ? i thought lord has all the power to do everything because God is the creator so He has the power to stop it, isn't it ?</p>
              <p>it is very cruel to just stand and watch the torturing. i am not god but if i have seen it, i will also try to stop the torturing even i know i do not have the power but at least i try</p>

              <p>Because that's hell and those who dont accept Jesus in their lives will end up like that. But I think the bible is bullshit now anyways.</p>
