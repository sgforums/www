              <p>creationist theories apparently failed in so many aspects and reasonings. in this day and age of scientific discoveries &amp; technologies invented, I reckoned creationist  theories are seriously irrelevant.</p>
              <p>we do not regard thunders, storms, typhoon as acts of gods anymore, maybe in the 19th century and before, yes. but now we know that it isnt, but just natural occurences and mother nature at work. but then comes this, creationist theories will tell you, what makes the mother nature and they will tell you its god. then you have to ask them, if its god at work, why god sent a tsunamis in 2004 that killed 200,000 people? is god wacko or what? this is something they can never or will explain. this is just one facet of inept reasoning, that is really redundant, irrelevant and out of syn in this day and age.</p>

              <p>So did the families, who have their members died in Tsunami 2004, know what exactly have they sinned.  Did anyone or prophet or god or spirit or whatever tell them specifically what have they sinned.  Are you sure that everyone who died in Tsunami 2004 is all more guilty than the other people who did not suffer the tragery.  And have they learnt their mistake, since no one inform them of any of their particular sin?  On what basis you can be so sure that the reason God sent a Tsunami in 2004 is because of their sin?  Did God tell you that or you assume out of the bible context?  If therefore God sent disasters to discipline mankind, why He did not send diasters to so many wicked to discipline them?  Are their sins heavier than the wicked people?  Are their sins more intolerable to God? On what basis, it cannot be the basis of the Job?</p>
              <p>I can tell you one thing for sure.  They remember this as a disaster and they don't ever recall they do deserve this because of sin. (REMEMBER THIS IMPT PT)  So if God did send this Tsunami, this disaster is blatantly just a useless killing disaster..</p>

              <p>sure evolution is not an exact science, but slowly and surely we are getting there with new discoveries by science, rather than relying on a holy book, which said its due to people's sins, which really is a half baked concept and idea. now whose half baked idea of sin came from? you bet, man made religion, which was 2010 years ag, gee, that was like how many millenniums ago? those days science is almost non existent and people then have no qualms accepting this sin thingy, but now is 2010 years later, where science, medicine and technology are so advanced considered to the primitive past.</p>

              <p>evolution is not really that simple and mechanistic...it requires an "agent"...the agent of change is not just external but internal reactions as well....the DNA is an "intelligent sensor to changes for survival and transformation" ...but it is too easy to denounce old archaic notions for the new and advanced...that internal reactions requires a freewill to choose and create as well...</p>
              <p>there are no absolute evidences on both sides (be it faith or in science)...science has successfully move the edge of limits and still trying to resolve the universal puzzle with unified grand theories...and still keep trying on how it really began...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It really depends on who u talk to. Such a question such as the one u raised is really quite impossible to answer and has remained the most contreversial question for decades. Rooney9, what u are doing is taking in the perspective of logicality and arguing from it, but then religion has always defied logic so how is it possible then to argue with religion? It ends up being a question if 'logic' or what we basically kniw rit now or the supernatural. U cant disprove the supernatural because ure an atheist and given, yet evolution while promising, is not a proven science either. Mind you, darwin's theory has never been accepted by the scientific community and progress has not been promising. It is quite impossible to pit the supernatural against logic and lastly then, how much exactly do we know? How sure are we of the world as we think it should be? As einstein put it, we are but merely a child trapped in a library of many books of foriegn tongues, we struggle to understand, but we tread slowly, blindly. Evolution is a possilbility, but so is the supernatural. Have u thought of that? How much then do we as humans think we know?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And how does arguing with logic ever solved the question then? Can u argue with the supernatural? This debate as i said will prob go on forever and like i said, one can chiose not to believe supernatural then, but as of now neither do i see reason to believe in evolution, for since u argue of the rationale of evidence and logic, it seems that time and again, science has not been able to prove evolution so i am quite intrigued by which side  u actually stand on as since going by your basis of argument, is it not true that both sides then cannot be true?

              <p>Its not about terming something we don't understand as supernatural. Its about speculating.</p>
              <p>Besides, ancient societies with religions before believed in things that took scientists hundreds of years to confirm. There might just be some secret behind those knowledge.</p>
              <p>imagine one day you found a book that ravels many scientific truths unkown to men at present and u do not know the authorship yourself? would you throw it away?</p>
              <p>i believe science today shouldn't be arguing with faith. becoz truly that would be the real madness. science is about observing the nature of things. faith is about believing in the nature of things. Two different things yet similar. The only main difference is that faith is more about society and way of life than it is about counting one to ten and photosynthesis.</p>

              <p>you are right to say there is no right and wrong, but its totally wrong to say Tsunamis was the result of people sins who have died. tell that to the family and relatives of these people who died from the 2004 Tsunamis. this is highly an irresponsible and reprehensible statement, which is totally BULLS.</p>
              <p>does it mean, does who live now, is free of sins? those who died if natural diasters are result of sins? see the obvious paradox here? think critically for yourself!</p>
