                                The question is why nonbelievers would worry about getting into heaven. I thought they never believed and thus never cared what would happen after they died.

                                However a doubtful atheist who starts to question his 'theist' would probably ask that question. And if an atheist start to doubt his 'theist' then I say why don't he go and find out if there is a God.

              <p>Therefore, I'm asking the question to seek an answer to find out if there is a God. In your 1st paragraph, you skirted my question. In the 2nd, you ask me to "find out if there is a God." Can you see the contradiction in logic?</p>

              <p>So basically, we have to know God if we are to go to heaven. But what if a person never had a chance to get to know the gospel?</p>
              <p>For eg, </p>
              <p>A) A new born baby or young child that died early.</p>
              <p>B) When the European powers colonize America (in the name of God?), they killed off the Red Indians before they had a chance to understand what is Christianity.</p>
              <p>So for the above 2 cases, who goes to heaven and who goes to hell? </p>

              <p>for A), christians have 2 diff answers to tis. it boils down to whether they believe in predestination or freewill. predestination believers wil say tat those babies tat were predestined from the beginning wil make to heaven, the rest wun. freewill believers wil say tat the baby wil go heaven cos he/she is too young to have the knowledge of wads rite n wrong.</p>
              <p>for B) the bible did say tat anyone who has nvr heard the gospel in AD yrs wil be judged by the law...whether or not they wil make it to heaven depends on God's judgement which we humans wun noe for sure. but in modern days, almost everyone has heard the gospel, hence few fall into tis category of nvr heard the gospel b4...</p>

                                                  I think there is no better thing in life than finding about God. 
                                                  
                                                  Everyone who wants life should seek God, everyone who craves for power lol should seek God, everyone who wants everything literally everything that one could ever hope even more should FALL IN LOVE WITH GOD BIG.
                                                  
                                                  <br><br> There is NO luckier person who has walked the earth and who will walk the earth than those who truly be in love with God. . . . .literally.
                                                  
                                                  <br><br>but that is a blessing itself and doesn't not come from man himself/herself. Man cannot love God with his own effort.
