            <div class='col-md body'>Two men, both seriously ill, occupied the same<br>hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in<br>his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain<br>the fluid from<br>his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only<br>window. The other man had to spend all his time<br>flat on his back. The men talked for hours on end.<br>They spoke of their wives and families, their<br>homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military<br>service, where they had been on vacation.<br><br>Every afternoon when the man in the bed by the<br>window could sit up, he would pass the time by<br>describing to his roommate all the things he could<br>see outside the window.<br><br>The man in the other bed began to live for those<br>one hour periods where his world would be<br>broadened and enlivened by all the activity and<br>color of the world outside.<br><br>The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.<br>Ducks and swans played on the water while<br>children sailed their model boats. Young lovers<br>walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color<br>and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in<br>the distance.<br><br>As the man by the window described all this in<br>exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the<br>room would close his eyes and imagine the<br>picturesque scene.<br><br>One warm afternoon the man by the window<br>described a parade passing by.<br><br>Although the other man couldn't hear the band - he<br>could see it. In his mind's eye as the gentleman by<br>the window portrayed it with descriptive words.<br><br>Days and weeks passed.<br><br>One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water<br>for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the<br>man by the window, who had died peacefully in<br>his sleep. She was saddened and called the<br>hospital attendants to take the body away.<br><br>As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man<br>asked if he could be moved next to the window.<br>The nurse was happy to make the switch, and<br>after making sure he was comfortable, she left<br>him alone.<br><br>Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one<br>elbow to take his first look at the real world<br>outside.<br><br>He strained to slowly turn to look out the window<br>beside the bed.<br><br>It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse<br>what could have compelled his deceased<br>roommate who had described such wonderful<br>things outside this window.<br><br>The nurse responded that the man was blind and<br>could not even see the wall.<br><br>She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage<br>you."<br><br>Epilogue:<br><br>There is tremendous happiness in making others<br>happy, despite our own situations.<br><br>Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness<br>when shared, is doubled.<br><br>If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you<br>have that money can't buy.<br><br>"Today is a gift, that's why it is called the present."<br></div>
