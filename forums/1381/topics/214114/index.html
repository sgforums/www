            <div class='col-md body'>I will try, on the assumption that this is not a flame-bait.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by technoboy:</div><div class="quote_body">1) How do you guys know whether the things written in the bible is correct? Especially when you all claim that it is written more then 2000 years ago?<br></div></blockquote>There are many ways to look at this. The most common one for Christians and the one least acceptable to non-Christians, I think, is by faith. Therefore, I will not use this as a reason. When we look at the culture written about those periods, there have been cities, such as Ur of the Chaldees (where Abraham was said to have come from) that was not presumed to have existed. Archaelogical evidence have discovered that there is sucha place. So if all other issues are unacceptable to non-Christians, at least the historical part has been proven. Note, too, that most documentaries produced by non-Christians do not actually doubt the "HISTORY" of the Biblical stories, only the "DIVINITY" of the stories.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by technoboy:</div><div class="quote_body">2) Where did the world come from? God created it? So who created god? And who created the one who created god?<br></div></blockquote>Again, the question is directed to the Christian world view: yes, God created the world. There have been some theories that perhaps, Earth is NOT the only world the God has created (but such theories do not affect the theology that is of this world). Who created God? The Bible said that God was never created. God existed from the beginning..... but this kind of question goes round and round, and unless one accept that God existed from the beginning, no one has the answer.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by technoboy:</div><div class="quote_body">3) Why is it that people who doesn't believe in Christianity will go to hell? Is there even such a place? So those infants who died will go to hell immediately, since they are not even able to think and choose what religions to believe in?<br></div></blockquote>Again another question to the Christian worldview.... What is hell? Is it the opposite of heaven? Or is hell a place that bad people go. Note also that the<br>"hell concept" is not exclusive to the Christian faith. Most other faith has such a place. It might be a place, or it might be a vivid description of the destruction of the soul, eternally.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by technoboy:</div><div class="quote_body">4) I think that Christianity is just one of the many religions in the world, so why do Christians have to say that the other religions are not real whereas theirs are?

Pick "MY" religion, because it's the only one that will bring you to the truth.<br>Each religion will fall into one of the above categories.<br>Yup, I have heard even pastors preaching that other religions are not real etc etc. From the theological stand point, it's in accordance with Biblical teachings. However, as an individual, would I SAY it out: probably not, because, as you had said, it is quite insulting (but this is a personal conviction), no different from, say, I think you are ugly, but I won't say it to you in the face.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me have a shot and I will try to supplement parts which Chin Eng have missed out.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by technoboy:</div><div class="quote_body">1) How do you guys know whether the things written in the bible is correct? Especially when you all claim that it is written more then 2000 years ago?</div></blockquote>The bible is unique among all the religious scriptures because it is falsifiable. Christianity was born because of one historical event - the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus. Most academics believe He existed, the question is whether the event really happened and His divinity. And since Jesus quoted from the Old Testament, it is implicit that they are correct too.<br><br>Chin Eng is right that archaeology and history can be used to tackle the question, but I think the approach is ultimately a weak one, since you can "verify" other faiths like Judaism and Islam the same way.<br><br>So I guess the best answer to a non-Christian is, we dunno. If you understand how the bible came into being, then you know how tricky is the whole issue ..<br><br><blockquote>2) Where did the world come from? God created it? So who created god? And who created the one who created god? </blockquote>In theology, God is the uncaused Cause. So naturally nothing created God.<br><br>In biblical language, God has existed since "the beginning" (c.f. John 1:1 - In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God and the Word was God.)<br><br><blockquote>3) Why is it that people who doesn't believe in Christianity will go to hell? Is there even such a place? So those infants who died will go to hell immediately, since they are not even able to think and choose what religions to believe in?</blockquote>Chin Eng did not actually answer your question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>To answer your question, we should not focus on hell first, but the Christian view of SIN. This is a long topic but the the summary is that we are all sinners in one way or another and only Christ Jesus can justify you in front of God. God is perfect, He can't stand sin, so in order to go heaven (it is either up or down for every of us), you must be sinless.<br><br>Regarding infants, there are indeed Christians who believe that they will not go to hell. This is an accepted belief among orthodox Christian, meaning it is not a heresy.<br><br><blockquote>4) I think that Christianity is just one of the many religions in the world, so why do Christians have to say that the other religions are not real whereas theirs are? Isn't that an insult to the other religions?[/</blockquote>Actually it is not as bad as you think, just that many Christians do not see the big picture.<br><br>If they say other religions are not real, an analogy will be this - 'chiong' Prada bags. Christianity is the authentic Prada bag, whereas others are counterfeits to varying degrees. So maybe one religion is 'A' Goods (if your religion has a god) but another one is straight fake (if you have many many idols).<br><br>But I think the real picture could be this - Christianity is the authentic Prada bag, with the real Prada certificate of worksmanship, but others are either early defects (and Prada disposed them early during the manufacturing process, only to be found by other craftsmen) or that some clever craftsman stole the design from Prada and built their own imitation.<br><br>I think most of us agree that there are many religions but some are more real than others. For example Buddhism vs. Shamanism. The Old Testament has harsh criticisms for other religions like the worship of Baal and Asherah but it could be that they were distracting the Hebrews from worship of the true God YHWH (God for the Jews and Christians).<br><br>If you fast forward to the New Testament Book of Acts Chapter 17, you find a totally different story from the relentless OT condemnation of other religions.<br><br>22 Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: "People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. 23 For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worshipÂ—and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.<br><br>There was no condemnation!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>(I actually learn this unknown god in the Catholic catechism class .. I guess Protestants will never tell me that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )</div>

The Christian POV is that while, yes, the books were selected, they were selected based on a strict criteria of authorship.<br><br>Nope the Bible was NOT WRITTEN 100 yrs after the death of Christ.
