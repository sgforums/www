U should know that Christians follow Christ's commands becoz we love him, not becoz of some oral tradition which says die die must do so. Grace precedes over law, so now we dun keep the law for the sake of keeping it, but becoz we love Christ and wants to emulate his love for others.<br><br>The desire to do good/avoid sin should always come from inside of each individual who loves Christ, not becoz out of fear of punishment/want to gain merit from GOD.<br><br>We can only be justified in GOD's/Christ's righteousness, not self-righteousness/hypocricity.<br><br>U believe that Jews can only try their best to follow the torah. Then u should know that nobody can keep all these laws completely. But it doesn't mean we continue to sin since everybody is sinning. It means we 'run' to the cross whenever we want to sin, and let us be reminded what Christ paid for us a hefty price so dearly on the cross that if we love him, we should not sin anymore or give GOD a broken heart.<br><br>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. -Rom. 5:20<br><br>I may not agree some of Charismatic Christians' doctrines, but I do agree with them on the topic of grace. It is the most important thing that GOD can gives us to deliver us from the bondage of sin. Otherwise, one would still be bound to sin and trying to fulfill all these laws in vain.</div>
