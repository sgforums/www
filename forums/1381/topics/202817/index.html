And sin is bad. So why did he create sth bad? Thought he saw all his creations as good.<br><br>remember satan dont make us sin. we make us sin ourselves.</div></blockquote>This is for ur first question<br><br>from http://www.scripturessay.com/q32.html<br><br>seems like a reasonable explanation<br><br>To answer the many questions here... 1st of all, God did not create evil. When Satan was first brought forth from God's creative hands he was good. Satan has not existed eternally, he was created.<br><br>Revelation 12:7 - 9(NASB):<br><br>7 And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. And the dragon and his angels waged war,<br><br>8 and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.<br><br>9 And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.<br><br>This I believe is the clearest account of Satan's activities before being cast down that I know of in the Scripture. We know it was Satan, in the form of a serpent, that tempted Eve in the garden of Eden. 1 Chron. 21:2 says that Satan was responsible for causing David to commit sin. Job 1:6-12 and 2:1-7 we see the activity of Satan in tempting Job.<br><br>He is called Satan,<br><br>The Devil (Mt. 13:39);<br><br>the Dragon (Rev. 12:3);<br><br>Beelzebub (Matt. 10:25);<br><br>Belial (2 Cor. 6:15);<br><br>and Lucifer in the KJV in Isa. 14:12.<br><br>He is referred to as the Evil One (Matt. 13:19);<br><br>the Tempter (Matt. 4:3);<br><br>The god of this world (age) (2 Cor. 4:4);<br><br>the Ruler of the kingdom of the air (Eph. 2:2);<br><br>the prince of this world (Jn. 12:31).<br><br>Two passages that are often used to teach about Satan are Ezekiel 28:11-19 and Isaiah 14:12-14. Both of these passages should be used with extreme caution.<br><br>One should always be aware of the context of a Biblical passage before trying to teach anything from it. In its context Ezek. 28:11-19 is a description of the King of Tyre. To go beyond this in explaining this passage is to go without biblical support. NEVER in Scripture is the context in Ezek. 28 used to speak of Satan.<br><br>Similarly, Isa. 14:12-14 speaks of the king of Babylon. The KJV adds "Lucifer" to verse 12 for unknown reasons. Isa. 14 is speaking in figurative language of the downfall of the nation of Babylon.<br><br>It could be said in both these passages that the King of Tyre and the King of Babylon were the very personification of Satan. In this case we can assume that certain characteristics of these evil kings are characteristics of Satan.<br><br>What we do know about Satan is this. He was a created being, an angel, who was judged because of his rebellion, which the New Testament hints was sparked by his pride (1Tim.3:6). He is the one responsible for introducing evil to this world. Now he desires to devour God's creation by tempting man to reject his Creator.<br><br>This is then the lesson we must learn. Satan--an angel created by God--was given the free will to choose whether or not he would obey God. He disobeyed, and that disobedience was evil.<br><br>Satan made himself evil by choosing to do evil.<br><br>In the same way, humans may choose to do right or wrong, and through their choices, evil flourishes.<br><br>So... it was choice that caused Satan to be evil, not an act of Creation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>doesn't exactly answer ur other questions, but it talks abt the concept of Free Will which i found to be pertinent in understanding the concept of sin<br><br>anyway, it was taken from http://www.carm.org/questions/didGodcreatesin.htm<br><br>Did God create sin?<br><br>No, God did not create sin. God is holy and He would not create that which is contrary to His nature. Sinfulness is the opposite of holiness. It is lawlessness (1 John 3:4). God is the author of the Law which is a reflection of His holy character (Exodus 20). Therefore, God cannot create that which is in direct violation of the Law any more than a person can wish himself to be bigger than the sun. It just isnÂ’t possible.<br>But, if God didnÂ’t create sin, then where did it come from? This is a question that has been debated by theologians and philosophers for many years. I cannot say that I have any better answers than they. Nevertheless, let me venture a guess.<br>God created the conditions where free will creatures would be able to make a choice between obedience and disobedience to God. This condition existed when God created an angel called Lucifer who was without sin yet, apparently, had free will. Lucifer chose to rebel against God and sin (Isaiah 14:12-15; Ezek. 28:13-15). Likewise, Adam and Eve, having been made by God without sin, listened to the devil and chose to sin against God (Gen. 3).<br>But God did not cause them to sin (James 1:13). In the freedom of their wills, each decided to rebel against God and sin entered the world (Rom. 5:12). God simply allowed the condition to exist where sin was possible.<br>An analogy can be found in the relationship between a parent and a child. A parent can create the condition that makes disobedience possible yet the parent remains innocent if the child sins. For example, if a parent tells his child to clean up his room and the child does not, he has rebelled. But, the parent is not responsible for the childÂ’s sin, nor did he cause the child to sin. The child had a choice to obey or not to obey.<br>Likewise, God has created the condition in the world where the ability to rebel against Him was possible. Yet, he is not responsible for that rebellion once it has been committed. Therefore, sin originated with Lucifer who was the first to rebel and entered the world through Adam who likewise chose disobedience.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>last few hrs to boost our rankings<br><br>so as icemoon mentioned; why did God plant the Fruit in the Garden of Eden<br><br>Question:  "Why did God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden?"<br><br>Answer:  God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden to give Adam and Eve a choice Â– to obey Him or disobey Him. Adam and Eve were free to do anything they wanted, except eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Genesis 2:16-17, Â“And the LORD God commanded the man, Â‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.Â’Â” If God had not given Adam and Eve the choice, they would have essentially been robots, simply doing what they were programmed to do. God created Adam and Eve to be Â“freeÂ” beings, able to make decisions, able to choose between good and evil. In order for Adam and Eve to truly be Â“freeÂ” Â– they had to have a choice.<br><br>There was nothing essentially evil about the tree or the fruit of the tree. It is unlikely that eating the fruit truly gave Adam and Eve any further knowledge. It was the act of disobedience that opened Adam and EveÂ’s eyes to evil. Their sin of disobeying God brought sin and evil into the world and into their lives. Eating the fruit, as an act of disobedience against God, was what gave Adam and Eve knowledge of evil. Genesis 3:6-7, Â“When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.Â”<br><br>God did not want Adam and Eve to sin. God knew ahead of time what the results of sin would be. God knew that Adam and Eve would sin, and would thereby bring evil, suffering, and death into the world. Why, then, did God put the tree in the Garden of Eden and allow Satan to tempt Adam and Eve? God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden to give Adam and Eve a choice. God allowed Satan to tempt Adam and Eve to force them to make the choice. Adam and Eve chose, of their own free wills, to disobey God and eat the forbidden fruit. The result Â– evil, sin, suffering, sickness, and death have plagued the world ever since. Adam and Eve's decision results in each and every person being born with a sin nature, a tendency to sin. Adam and Eve's decision is what ultimately required Jesus Christ to die on the cross and shed His blood on our behalf. Through faith in Christ, we can be free from sin's consequences, and ultimately free from sin itself. May we echo the words of the Apostle Paul in Romans 7:24-25, Â“What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God - through Jesus Christ our Lord!Â”<br></div>
