It is only in some cases where free will bring sinful nature (such as killing someone, or scold someone etc) but than if we do not have the capability of doing such actions, things r actually better.<br><br>And since free will is endorsed by god, why does he punish us for practising the free will ? On one hand he is supposed to encourage us to have free will, which inevitably and 100% led us to sinning, then he punish us for practising the free will. Is tat giving free will or tat a trap ? It is stated by jesus itself tat he rather cut off his limps and gorge out his eyes in order to get eternal life. Why doesn't he do tis to human ? I, perhaps most people, rather have a lesser degree of free will such tat we do not have the capability of sinning in order to have eternal life than eternal damnation.<br><br></div></blockquote>i see where u r coming from. but do u see where i am coming from? Free will is given so that we may live life to the fullest. However, evil sprouted from the gift of free Will. oh Sis, i am not God and i cannot answer your question.

Do u agree with tat ?<br><br>And about your sinning and "redemption of the cross", it doesn't work because evil and sin is still plentiful now.

He wouldn't send a big flood and kill almost every single being neither will he curse men to always have conflicts among themselves. He has shown to always "act" and not let the world "itself be itself". Strangely he did not stop typhoon, diesease or earthquake tat kill thousands if not million of people.
