If we only worship and obey god as suggested above, then we r automations according to the reply here. If god want men to be like tat, he can simply flick a finger and given his omnipotency, men become the form he want. However then u say god did not want men to be automation, and not worship and obey continuously, which create sin, and then punish us for the sin.

He was questioning where evil came from if God made all things and because he was good al things were good. He went on to posit that there was a privition of good, and that evil was a non-being. Think abt it this way, like dark is not darkness but a lack of light. Thus Evil is not evil but a lack of goodness. u get wad i'm driving at here? i can't articulate it properly.<br><br>Hmm, let's try a philosophical approach then, let's go back to the concept of free will. in that in creating the world, God allows the world to be itself but having the independance or the freedom that was the result of the love of God? this would explain why natural disasters happen. I think i am driving somehwere towards the chaos theory though not exactly there.. but that God is in control of the world, not in minute details but more of maintaining the order of going of events. Erm... infinite possibilities through abitrary events but yet, an assurance of development. i hope i am not getting too confusing<br><br>There is like this precariousness. but there is advancement, but the precariousness causes a movement towards a controlled unknown. and this precariousness and unknown is where the evil sprouted from?<br><br>u get wad i am inching towards?<br><br>i will try to rephrase it again</div>
