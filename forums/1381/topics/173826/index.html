            <div class='col-md body'>I recommend another book. This time by a Christian pastor Max Lucado. It's titled as above. It's a real touching read. He showed the Saviour's great love for us sinners. Go read it also. It's also in the public library. Anyway, I am holding the MP branch one.<br><br>Anybody read it before? Care to comment? I think it's quite old version.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also recommend to you another book. almost 400 years old. still very, very popular. in fact, it is the next best selling book after the Bible in the Christian world. Written by a tinker-a mender of pots, utensils and other things.<br><br>In it you will read  God's work of grace that is common to  every true Christian - the grace of conviction of sin, the grace of repentance, the grace of faith.........justification.........sanctification and etc.<br><br>In it also you will read a Christian's struggle against sin, against doubts, a Christians loss and discourgements and etc.<br><br>What book is this? Well, who doesn't know PILGRIM'S PROGRESS by the great Puritan author John Bunyan.<br><br>The great preacher Charles Spurgeon read it more or less 100 times. Christian teachers tell it to their young students in their classes.<br><br>It's actually an allegorical adventure book..........you'll enjoy it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>by the way look for the contemporary version not the old one. Old one's english is sometimes soo hard to understand.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As in this book, Christ Jesus laid down His life for His brethren, disciples, mother, &amp; the world &amp; even for the criminal on the cross beside Him. How much more ought we to lay down our lives for our brethren, family, colleagues, friends &amp; the world. This is to follow the eg of Jesus. This is to carry our own crosses after Him.<br><br>I have been subscribing to the Voice of Martyrs newsletters.
