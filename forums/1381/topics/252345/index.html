            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">Recently our minister mentor had a lot of comments about homosexuality. In the event that homosexuality become legalised in Singapore, what should be the church's stance on this?</span></strong><br><br><a href="http://www.fridae.com/newsfeatures/article.php?articleid=1907&amp;viewarticle=1&amp;searchtype=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.fridae.com/newsfeatures/article.php?articleid=1907&amp;viewarticle=1&amp;searchtype=all</a><br><br>So, is it useless then? No, I don't think it's useless. The Church says: I proclaim that this is bad. But if you do it, you will know that you are doing something which somebody in high authority have thought over and think it's wrong. You can overrule that, this is your decision, you do it. But I think in the same way we have to decide on behalf of society what is the long-term effect of this, and if you prohibit it will it work, and if it doesn't work and it is flouted, does it do harm? Which is better? - to let it run freely or say, "No", have it surreptitiously flouted at the margins - you've got to weigh the two odds. But, I mean you take this business of <strong>homosexuality. It raises tempers all over the world, and even in America. If in fact it is true, and I have asked doctors this, that you are genetically born a homosexual because that's the nature of the genetic random transmission of genes, you can't help it. So why should we criminalise it? But there's such a strong inhibition in all societies. Christianity, Islam, even the Hindu, Chinese societies and we are now confronted with a persisting aberration. But is it an aberration? It's a genetic variation. So what do we do? I think we pragmatically adjust, carry our people... don't upset them and suddenly upset their sense of propriety and right and wrong, but at the same time let's not go around like this moral police do in Malaysia, barging into people's rooms and say "khalwat". That's not our business. So, you have to take a practical, pragmatic approach to what I see is an inevitable force of time and circumstance.</strong><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>Below is a statement from National Council of Churches of Singapore (2003) on the homosexuality issue. Wonder if they are going to update this or not. Any Catholic statement on this?</strong></span><br><br><a href="http://www.nccs.org.sg/homosexuality.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nccs.org.sg/homosexuality.php</a><br><br>National Council of Churches of Singapore<br>Statement on Homosexuality<br>__________________________________________________<br><br>Preamble:<br>There has recently been wide discussion in the press and the Internet on the issue of homosexuality with different views expressed. Christians, like other thoughtful citizens, are also concerned about this issue. We present our position below as a guide to Christians in our member churches and as our witness, as concerned citizens, to the society in which we belong.<br><br>Our stand:<br>1)  Recognizing the Bible as the authoritative standard for its faith and practice the Church has historically and consistently held the view that the practice of homosexuality is clearly incompatible with the teachings of the Christian faith. The only sexual relationship, sanctioned by God and given as a gift from God, is between a male and a female within the bounds of a monogamous marriage.<br><br>2) Therefore, we do not condone homosexual practice and we consider homosexual lifestyle as sinful and unacceptable.  However, this does not mean that we reject or despise homosexuals (homophobia).  We acknowledge that every person is loved by God and we all live under the grace of God. Homosexuals should be regarded and treated no less as persons of worth and dignity.<br><br>3)  The Church is called to be a caring community and a sanctuary, always extending ministry to all persons. As sinners ourselves, we are committed to the path of true freedom made possible by the grace of God and found in and through obedience to Jesus Christ. Without minimizing their struggles, the Church offers those beset with homosexual desire the same opportunity to receive God's forgiveness and fulfillment in Jesus Christ and to experience His transforming power. Not accepting homosexual practice and lifestyle must not be confused with homophobia.<br><br>4)  In public debate about homosexuality scientific data have sometimes been used to support certain claims. To the layperson, science has been unsuspectingly regarded as an objective discipline and conclusions based on its findings have been assumed as irrefutable and authoritative. But that is an assumption we do not accept especially with regard to attempts to give biological explanations to homosexual inclination and behaviour. We note that there is no clear evidence that homosexuality is biologically determined.<br><br>5)  Though we deem homosexual lifestyle totally unacceptable on the basis of the Bible and our faith, we believe that unless there are legitimate reasons homosexuals, as individuals, should not be discriminated against in areas such as employment. It does not follow, however, that our society should be re-ordered or allowed to evolve to the extent that eventually homosexual practice is endorsed, permitted or encouraged as an alternative lifestyle.  In this regard, we urge our government to maintain:<br>a) current legislation concerning homosexuality;<br>b) its policy of not permitting the registration of homosexual societies or clubs;<br>c) its policy of not allowing the promotion of homosexual lifestyle and activities.<br><br>6)   As churches we seek to remain faithful to our Christian faith and practice. We shall strengthen the education of our members in the teachings and practices of our faith. We are committed to serving our nation by helping to preserve and promote wholesome values and lifestyles that will contribute to the well-being of our society.<br><br>29 July 2003</div>

Nevertheless, we consider homosexual acts to be sinful, abhorrent and deviant, whether consensual or not. The NCCS commends the Government on taking a clear, unequivocal and bold stand of neither encouraging nor endorsing a homosexual lifestyle and opposing the presentation of the same as part of a mainstream way of life. At the same time, we do not condemn homosexuals as the Bible calls us to hate the sin but love the sinner. Given that section 377A PC criminalises homosexuality whether done private or publicly, we are of the view that a similar prohibition ought to be enacted in respect of lesbianism, considering that lesbianism (like homosexuality) is also abhorrent and deviant, whether consensual or not.'</div>
