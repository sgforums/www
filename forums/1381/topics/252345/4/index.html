Even though we glibly claim that the Bible is the Word of God, we must readily admit that it was not transmitted by God to us in a written form and certainly not in English or any language we know, not even Hebrew or Greek. The writers of the different books of the Bible interpret their experiences as individuals or community with God in their lives. Other interpretations exist but did not get the approval of the Jewish and Christian leaders who compiled the books of the Bible.</span></div></blockquote>At this juncture it is safe to note that Rev Yap has stated very clearly that, in his view, the Bible WAS NOT TRANSMITTED BY GOD IN A WRITTEN FORM and that the writers of the different books INTERPRET THEIR EXPERIENCES AS INDIVIDUALS. This totally discounted the "inspiration of the Holy Spirit". Once removing the divine influence, the Bible no longer is the Word of God, it is merely, at best, a historical account. That being the case, it will be totally unnecessary to debate any Bibilical doctrine, seeing that, in reality there is none.<br><br><strong>Once this stand is taken... the Bible loses all authority, because there is no longer any authority.</strong><br><br><blockquote><strong><span style="color: red;"><br>Each faithful follower has to make his or own interpretation and which may or may not reflect that of the religious institutions. The teachings of the institutions themselves change according to the changing times. Homosexuality is one issue which is in the process of change and hopefully, the time will come also for more religious leaders to be gay-affirming. </span><br></strong></blockquote>If the interpretation and teaching is going to continue to change, then there is no need even to talk about marriage, acceptance of Christ as a personal Saviour, or even the works of the Holy Spirit in our lives.<br><br>In all honesty, in all my years in the Methodist church, I have never even heard of Rev Yap. His name is never mentioned at all. Previous bishops and leaders have been invited from time to time to my church, never once was Rev Yap invited.</div>
