            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://fonsus.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fonsus.livejournal.com/</a><br><br>During the session, I took down some of the main points. Father Renckens shared with us about his personal views on the issue of homosexuality, some of which are not congruent with the current teachings of the Catholic Church.<br>Â• He defined homosexuality in his own understanding Â– that describing the condition as an inclination or a tendency is incorrect, and that it is basically an orientation.<br><strong><span style="color: red;">Â• He went on to talk about the 3 schools of thought Â– nature (i.e. genetic makeup, Â‘born like thatÂ’), nurture (i.e. influence from the environment/surroundings, Â‘shaped into beingÂ’), or a combination of both Â– on how homosexuality originated. If these schools of thought hold true, then our condition cannot be considered a sin, because we did not choose to be such.<br>Â• He also made it clear that the acts which were condemned in the Bible were against the order of nature, because it was the case of heterosexuals engaging in homosexual activity due to the fact that they were deprived of same-gender contact, and not because they had love for the other party (meaning that they were using the other party for fornication to derive self-pleasure).<br>Â• Â‘Objective disorderÂ’ Â– the term used to describe the condition now. He talks about the changing views of how the scriptures were interpreted over time, i.e. slavery. In the past when the Bible was written, there was no such thing as psychology, psychiatry or behavioural research; now there is, and therefore with this added knowledge, the Church has changed its views that sexual orientation is not necessarily a matter of choice. Today the Catholic position has become somewhat conflicted: homosexuality is natural and even biological, but still disordered. Father Renckens hopes that in time, the Â“homosexual orientation will be understood as a Â‘variantÂ’ or Â‘diversityÂ’ of our human condition.Â”<br>Â• Jesus died on the cross for the world, not only those who were baptized, but also those who do not know him (because Jesus knows us all).</span></strong><br>I think it is very refreshing to attend such a workshop. Back in school, I was taught that all sinners go to hell, and that as a gay person, I was destined not to pass the gates of heaven. It was quite a traumatizing experience, one which made me decide to conform to societal demands. The end result was that I was living a lie. That was very difficult and every day seemed to be another test for me. I felt that this workshop was able to allow us to really come together to share our own personal views and opinions, especially through the small group discussions, which I think was very effective in getting everybodyÂ’s input. More of such sessions should be organised as they would help to bring people together who would not usually sit down together and discuss and interact to successfully relate to each other. More so for us from the GLBT community. I truly felt this was a great learning experience for me. Kudos to the organiser =p</div>

Despite the availability of literature which says that the Bible verses which are frequently used to condemn homosexuality have been mistranslated or misinterpreted, they find it hard to let go of what they were taught earlier. How best do you think they can come to terms to this?<br><br>Rev Yap: <span style="color: red;">We must first of all try to comprehend how the Bible itself came into existence. Even though we glibly claim that the Bible is the Word of God, we must readily admit that it was not transmitted by God to us in a written form and certainly not in English or any language we know, not even Hebrew or Greek. The writers of the different books of the Bible interpret their experiences as individuals or community with God in their lives. Other interpretations exist but did not get the approval of the Jewish and Christian leaders who compiled the books of the Bible.<br><br>Each faithful follower has to make his or own interpretation and which may or may not reflect that of the religious institutions. The teachings of the institutions themselves change according to the changing times. Homosexuality is one issue which is in the process of change and hopefully, the time will come also for more religious leaders to be gay-affirming. </span><br><br>...........................................................................................................<br><br>Ã¦: What do you say to Christians who believe that the Bible incontrovertibly condemns homosexuality? How easy or difficult is it for you to make a Christian who believes that homosexuality is disallowed by God to change his or her mind?<br><br>Rev Yap: <span style="color: red;">My advice to them is to really study the Bible and see the teachings relating to homosexuality in the context of those olden days</span>. It is extremely difficult to change the mind of the homophobic person. But even though these persons once had no reason to challenge their assumptions, they are now forced by gays who have come out and straight people who are gay-affirming to re-examine their views on the issue of homosexuality.<br><br>Ã¦: Why do you think so many people are unwilling to question the idea that the Bible condemns homosexuals?<br><br>Rev Yap: <span style="color: red;">This is because it is a majority view and was never challenged to the extent that we do today, and by the people who are brave enough to come out. </span></div>
