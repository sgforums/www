However, it can and should be pointed out that that there are plenty of Christians who would disagree with the line taken by the NCCS.<br><br>In the first place, not all churches belong to the NCCS. The Singapore archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church, for example, does not, though that church is no less homophobic. But even those churches that are in the NCCS, e.g. the Anglican and the Methodist Churches in Singapore, would find their stance contested by Anglican and Methodist churches in other countries. That the local bishops' positions are hardly the last word on the matter is worth bringing to the public's attention.<br><br>The other thing worth pointing out is that Christians form a small minority in Singapore, at most 20 percent of the population. To this, the churchmen tend to respond by saying, "All major religions abhor homosexuality" Â– a stock phrase that comes from the fundamentalist churches of America. This is patently untrue. Buddhism and Taoism (about 50 percent of Singaporeans) have nothing to say on the subject. Nor does Hinduism, I am told, if one removes the Victorian prudishness that has blanketed it. Not least, let's not forget that there are atheists and free thinkers among us.<br><br><strong>What this leads to is the charge that church leaders are expecting the government to impose Christian ideas of morality on non-Christians through law. This is the truly abhorrent idea. It is abhorrent to a secular state that promises freedom of religious belief and practice to its citizens to allow any religious group to dictate the laws of the land. That is why the NCCS statement must be resisted.</strong></div>

Fridae speaks to Rev Yap Kim Hao and highlights several gay affirmative churches in Asia.<br><br>Ã¦: Many Christian gays and lesbians - who after coming out to themselves - decide to stop going to church and/or feel that they cannot continue being a Christian because of churches who preach that homosexuality is unacceptable. Despite the availability of literature which says that the Bible verses which are frequently used to condemn homosexuality have been mistranslated or misinterpreted, they find it hard to let go of what they were taught earlier. How best do you think they can come to terms to this?<br><br>Rev Yap: We must first of all try to comprehend how the Bible itself came into existence. Even though we glibly claim that the Bible is the Word of God, we must readily admit that it was not transmitted by God to us in a written form and certainly not in English or any language we know, not even Hebrew or Greek. The writers of the different books of the Bible interpret their experiences as individuals or community with God in their lives. Other interpretations exist but did not get the approval of the Jewish and Christian leaders who compiled the books of the Bible.<br><br>Each faithful follower has to make his or own interpretation and which may or may not reflect that of the religious institutions. The teachings of the institutions themselves change according to the changing times. Homosexuality is one issue which is in the process of change and hopefully, the time will come also for more religious leaders to be gay-affirming.<br><br>Ã¦: Some other Christians do not come out as gay in their church fearing rejection. Do you think gay Christians need to come out in their church for their own spiritual and mental well being?<br><br>Rev Yap: We are always challenged to be true to ourselves and accept our sexual orientation as from God. If the Church rejects gay Christians then it is hypocritical to preach that they love all people. It is certainly good for one to come out and call the church to question. Otherwise, we are aiding and abetting and condoning their homophobic stance.<br><br>Ã¦: While some churches believe that they have a responsibility to welcome and be affirmative towards their gay and lesbian members, these members are in turn expected to be celibate and this is a major consideration for many. What is your take?<br><br>Rev Yap: Affirmation of LGBT members is to affirm also that they can enter into same-sex relationships as an expression of their love to one another. To demand them to be celibate is a denial of that affirmation. It is not only a half-hearted response but also a faint-hearted one. We do not demand celibacy from the heterosexuals. Celibacy is a choice but not homosexuality.<br><br>Ã¦: The Christian fundamentalist movement which originated in the US is taking root in Asia such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan where they are - to borrow their favourite phrase - proving to very militant in promoting their anti-gay agenda in the public sphere. And what is the best defence for Christians who disagree with the anti-gay fundamentalist movement?<br><br>Rev Yap: The way to counter-act against the anti-gay agenda is for the LGBT community and its members to come out as gay and proud. This will help develop the responsible and positive gay lifestyle perception to shatter their negative perceptions of the community.<br><br>Ã¦: You have been most open in supporting the gay community by writing to the press and your autobiography A Bishop Remembers you wrote: "I wanted the public to know that there are clergy and lay members who cannot accept the view of their churches in good conscience and there are those who are willing to declare it publicly. Many of my friends have joined me in support of the gay movement and by my action I have forced others to think seriously and study the issue carefully. At least they cannot be indifferent and continue harbouring their stereotypes and misconceptions of homosexuality." In interacting with Christians, what are the most common stereotypes and misconceptions of homosexuality they have?<br><br>Rev Yap: Christians have difficult accepting the homosexual act. To them it is unnatural and incompatible. They have the concept that God created only male and female and the only sexual relationship they consider normative is with the opposite sex. They perceive the gay lifestyle to be free and loose without commitment and only for the satisfaction of their selfish sexual drives. They see the frequent changing of partners and the breakdown of relationships.<br><br>Ã¦: What do you say to Christians who believe that the Bible incontrovertibly condemns homosexuality? How easy or difficult is it for you to make a Christian who believes that homosexuality is disallowed by God to change his or her mind?<br><br>Rev Yap: My advice to them is to really study the Bible and see the teachings relating to homosexuality in the context of those olden days. It is extremely difficult to change the mind of the homophobic person. But even though these persons once had no reason to challenge their assumptions, they are now forced by gays who have come out and straight people who are gay-affirming to re-examine their views on the issue of homosexuality.<br><br>Ã¦: Why do you think so many people are unwilling to question the idea that the Bible condemns homosexuals?<br><br>Rev Yap: This is because it is a majority view and was never challenged to the extent that we do today, and by the people who are brave enough to come out.<br><br>Ã¦: Coming back to Christmas, what would be your parting message to gay and lesbian Christians who have not reconciled their sexuality and spiritual lives?<br><br>Rev Yap: Gay and lesbian Christians in confessing their belief in God must come to accept that God has given them life and this includes the same-sex orientation. God has created all things different and all life in its variety is according to God's plan and purpose for our existence. At Christmas we are reminded of God's love. God loves you when you are specially and uniquely created. It is for God's purpose that gay and lesbian Christians were created and they legitimately belong to human family of God. Take courage and be proud and gay. God bless you all. Merry Christmas to you. Celebrate God's love for everyone.<br><br>Ã¦: Fridae wishes Rev Yap and all readers a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.<br><br>Last year, Fridae published Rev Yap Kim HaoÂ’s transcript of his talk on same-sex relationships from a Christian perspective.
