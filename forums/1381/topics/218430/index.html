But if you want to become enlightened it is important that you hear the teachings and practises that leads to liberation, enlightenment. As I have mentioned, Jesus taught many teachings out of skillful means that is the practise of virtuous qualities -<br><br>...He argued that the Buddha knew people were not always ready for the higher truth because it "wouldn't suit, wouldn't help." Therefore, lesser truths are sometimes taught because of the person's ignorance or condition. This is known in Buddhist dharma as the doctrine of uppayah, or skillful means. The Dalai Lama then applied this to the question about Jesus.<br><br>"Jesus Christ also lived previous lives," he said. "So, you see, he reached a high state, either as a Bodhisattva, or an enlightened person, through Buddhist practice or something like that. Then, at a certain period, certain era, he appeared as a new master, and then because of circumstances, he taught certain views different from Buddhism, but he also taught the same religious values as I mentioned earlier: Be patient, tolerant, compassionate. This is, you see, the real message in order to become a better human being." He said that there was absolutely no lying involved since Jesus' motivation was to help people....<br><br>According to Buddhism, by practising all these one will gain the blessings and ability in rebirth in virtuous realms. However to be totally liberated is not just a matter of practising these virtuous qualities. And the higher teachings of Jesus are often not taught, or misinterpreted, and as I mentioned,<strong> many of the teachings of Jesus are misinterpreted nowadays. </strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=214825&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=214825&amp;page=2</a></div>
