            <div class='col-md body'>yes indeed. the end of times. it so obvious when u consider how many bigots can hide behind the mask of religion. Something as sacred as religion being used as a justification of human's own petty inability to not engage in something as terrible as discrimination. End of days indeed, for only the devil condones such a terrible act of inhumanism.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh by the way i have a few questions for u repented john 2.<br><br>the news article cleary states that Leviticus 18:22 says it an abomination for man to lie with another man. End of debate. However, I need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to best follow them.<br><br>a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?<br><br>b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br><br>c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br><br>d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Indonesias, but not Malaysians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Malaysians?<br><br>e) I know many people who work on the Sabbath, such as those who work in the shops and restaurants on the one day our family can go out as a family. Exodus 35:2 clearly states they should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill them all myself? Or can u lend a hand in excecuting these immoral people and their perversions?<br><br>f) A friend of mine who eats shellfish even thought its an abomination (Lev 11:10), How should he be outcast by society like homosexuals are?<br><br>g) Lev 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I am short sighted. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some room for leniency here?<br><br>h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, (and i believe u do too!) even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev 19:27. How should they(and you) die?<br><br>i) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev 24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)<br><br>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help.<br><br>Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.</div>

Jesus says to you: "I know your works, that the last are more than the first but u have left your first love. Now repent &amp; go back to loving ppl or i will take away your lampstand if u dont repent."<br><br>God still loves u as He loves everyone on earth, even the blinded satanists. So u should start loving ppl &amp; not quarelling with them even if u are right. I know it's your zealousness but Jesus says He knows your heart that u are zealous for Him but go back to your first love.<br><br>Just my humble opinion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Ok The Elder. I am sorry for being quarelsome. Yes, i am very zealous for God. Maybe too zealous. I will try to start loving people but i really find stubborn difficult people hard to love. They don't want to repent &amp; they still try to justify themselves using God's words. They even take God's grace for granted.<br><br>I am sorry. Yes, God loves the satanists even if only they knew. May God even convert the satanists to become a shining light for Jesus! Hip hip hooray for Jesus! Nothing is impossible for God!</div>
