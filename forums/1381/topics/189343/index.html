            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What is Torah?</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Torah is the Hebrew word meaning teaching. It's root means to throw or shoot an arrow.  YHVH uses this word Torah in scripture to signify His Teaching to His people. The Teaching which G-d gave Moses (Moshe) is called the Torah of Moses, but this does not mean that Moses authored it, only that he received it from G-d.<br><br>When Torah is mentioned it is most often associated with the Torah of Moses, meaning the Torah, or Teaching, which God gave to Israel in the wilderness. However, YHVH uses the word Torah to signify His instructions throughout the Hebrew scriptures, including the Prophets and the Psalms. Since all of His Word is His Teaching, all of it is His Torah.<br><br>Some believe, traditionally, that YHVH gave oral teaching to Moses, besides that which Moses wrote down. Many religious Jews believe these oral traditions to be the Word of Elohim also and as equally binding on them as the written Word of God, therefore they accept and observe the oral traditions as Torah commandments. This is a great error. The scripture says,<br><br>"Moses came and told the people all the words of YHVH and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, 'All the words that YHVH has spoken we will do.' And Moses wrote down all the words of YHVH," (Exodus 24:3, 4 emphasis mine).<br><br>Moses gave the people only the words that he wrote down, and that was all which YHVH had told him. Therefore, what is written in the first five books of the scriptures is the complete teaching that was given to Moses. Also, the covenant between G-d and His people is based exclusively on the written words of YHVH and nothing else.<br><br>Christians usually call the Torah "the Law," because most English translations of scripture translate Torah as Law. The reason this came about is because pre-Yeshua rabbis translated the Hebrew scriptures into Greek, called the Septuagint. The Septuagint translated Torah into the Greek word Nomia. Nomia was used in Greek culture to mean an unalterable law. Following this tradition, the Greek New Testament also used nomia to signify the Torah. The Torah is unalterable, and technically it is Law, since breaking it does have penal consequences. (Remember, this includes all that God gave to the Prophets.) However, the Torah is first of all the teaching of a protective parent, the Most High Father, Abba, who loves His children enough to preserve them in righteousness.<br><br>"For the commandment is a lamp and the Torah is light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life," (Proverbs 6:23).<br><br>"The Torah of YHVH is perfect, reviving the soul; the decrees of YHVH are sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of YHVH are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of YHVH is clear, enlightening the eyes; the fear of YHVH is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of YHVH are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and drippings of the honeycomb. Moreover by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward," (Psalm 19:7-11).<br><br>This is the way which the Most High wanted His people to view His instructions. To view Torah as arbitrary condemnatory legalese, used as tedious entrapment against mankind, is the gravest of lies and misconceptions. Many in Christianity have had this erroneous view of Torah, and thus, feel impelled to find any excuse to discount or destroy its value.<br><br>Another Greek word used in the New Testament is dogma. Sometimes this word is falsely translated as ordinances, but the proper translation is the authoritative opinions of men. This word is confused with nomia, and thus Torah, by many, yet they have nothing in common. It is dogma which Yeshua has overcome and put away, but He Himself said the Torah would never, in time, pass away, because the Torah is His Word.<br><br>"For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the Torah until everything is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven," (Matthew 5:18, 19).<br><br>Since the New Testament confirms that the Torah is holy, righteous and good (Romans 7:12), Torah cannot in any way be a thing to be disdained or disregarded by true Bible believers. Also, Bible believers should consider that the very concept of Torah must include ALL that God ever commanded to be written as His instruction. If you believe the New Testament was given by G-d, then that makes it a part of YHVH's Torah. Thus, to disdain Torah is to disdain the New Testament also.  The Most High does not differentiate His Word, since He is always the same.<br><br>"All scripture is G-d breathed and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone who belongs to G-d may be proficient, equipped for every good work," (2 Timothy 3:16, 17).<br><br>So to sum up:<br><br>Torah is all the written Teaching of YHVH, from Genesis to Revelation, and that alone<br>Torah is not the oral traditions or commentaries of men, whether Jewish or Christian<br>Torah is holy, right and good; and useful for everyone who belongs to G-d<br>Therefore, be warned beloved, do not accept the traditions of elders or sages as Torah, neither toss away the written Torah as useless. For both these ways seem right to many, but neither of these paths are righteous and true remembrance before G-d.<br><br>"In everything do to others as you would have them do to you; for this is the Torah and the Prophets. Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction, and there are many who take it. For the gate is narrow and the road is strewn with obstacles that leads to life, and there are few who find it. Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves," (Matthew 7:12-15).<br><br>- Messianic Rabbi David M. Hargis<br></div>
