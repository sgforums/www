              <dl><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Cameron Macaulay was six-year-old, always
                  talking  about his mum and family.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">He liked to draw pictures of his home - a long single-storey,
                   white house standing in a bay.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But it sent shivers down his mum's spine - because Cameron
                  said  it was somewhere they had never been, 160 miles away from where 
                  they lived.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">And the mother he was talking about was his "old
                  mum."</span></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The Glasgow lad said they were on the Isle Of Barra.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Mum Norma, said: "Ever since Cameron could speak
                  he spoke of a childhood on Barra.''</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"He spoke about his former parents, how his dad
                  died, and his  brothers and sisters.''</span></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"In nursery his teacher told me  all the things Cameron was saying about Barra. He missed
                  his mummy  and his brothers and sisters there.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"He missed playing in rockpools on the beach beside
                  his house.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"And he complained that in our house there was only
                  one toilet,  whereas in Barra, they had three.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"He used to cry for his mummy. He said she'd be
                  missing him and  he wanted to let his family in Barra know he was all right.''</span></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"He wouldn't stop talking about Barra, where they
                  went, what  they did and how he watched the planes landing on the beach
                  from  his bedroom window.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"He said his dad was Shane Robertson,

                  what  would happen.''</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"He recognised it immediately and was overjoyed.''</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"But as we walked to the door all the colour drained
                  from  Cameron's face and he became very quiet.''</span></dt><dt><br></dt></dl>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"There were lots of nooks and crannies and Cameron
                  knew every bit  of the house - including the THREE toilets and the beach
                  view from  his bedroom window. In the garden, he took us to the 'secret

              <p>Besides Christianity, there are many religions able to "close" the ying yang eyes. Buddhism, Taoism etc.......... Just like Islam, Buddhism. Taoism are able to "to cure" their followers who are being possessed. Just like what forumer kenn3th said, you should read more, watch more, see more and listen more. You seems to have less exposure.</p>

              <p>The cultivation of religion is a very complex process. One has to accept this harsh fact that each and every individual is entitled to follow the teachings of another religion. If another individual has ideas and beliefs that opposes your beliefs,  one shouldn't overly enforce or protect and claim that your beliefs are the absolute. I doubt this is the essence of the teachings of it, rather, it's cohesion, understanding and seeing common ground shouldn't this be the essence of it instead?</p>
