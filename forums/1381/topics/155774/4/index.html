The Methodist Church in Singapore requires the parents of a teenager to approved before the baptism is carried out. This is done usually before the start of baptism class. For the next few weeks, the applicant is required to go through religious classes lead by the pastor-in-charge or a ministry staff. Confirmation is needed for 16 and before and that's the confirmation needed even when you are baptised already whether infant/child baptism. All baptism will come with a "Certificate" from the church.<br><br>Please do not drive the issue off-course by comparing it to other issues and that will make things complicated. For any further enquries, you can contact the MOE or BB HQ to clarrify and not start a flame war. It's unfair to fellow brothers &amp; sister here as well as assosiates of the Boys' Brigade.</div>

It's set clear always that BB is a Christian Organisation.<br><br>To answer someone's enquiry regarding the permission for converting/baptism. The Methodist Church in Singapore requires the parents of a teenager to approved before the baptism is carried out. This is done usually before the start of baptism class. For the next few weeks, the applicant is required to go through religious classes lead by the pastor-in-charge or a ministry staff. Confirmation is needed for 16 and before and that's the confirmation needed even when you are baptised already whether infant/child baptism. All baptism will come with a "Certificate" from the church.<br><br>Please do not drive the issue off-course by comparing it to other issues and that will make things complicated. For any further enquries, you can contact the MOE or BB HQ to clarrify and not start a flame war. It's unfair to fellow brothers &amp; sister here as well as assosiates of the Boys' Brigade.</div></blockquote>so parent's consent is required after all.<br><br>btw are BB only active in missionary schs or other govt sch as well ?</div>
