            <div class='col-md body'>I believe I am in good position to speak since I am a BB officer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In my school, we make known to the parents that we are a Christian-based CCA and that their child will be exposed to Christianity.  We do this on the day of recruitment.  We also invite the parents to the enrolment service.  We make no attempts to hide our Christian beliefs. We do invite them to attend church service, and our cirruculum does involve Christian education. But our activities also revolve around other areas such as leadership training, community work, adventure skills, etc.<br><br>The MOE knows the nature of BB.  I suppose schools should have a good knowledge of what the CCAs do (If not I wonder what the principals are doing).<br><br>At any time, the child can choose to stop his participation.  If the parents feels uncomfortable, then they may ask their child to do so.<br><br>A bit of background.  BB is the first uniformed unit for Boys.  Sir William Alexander Smith, founder of the BB, intended the BB to place where Christian values can be imparted.  Our Object is "The advancement of Christ's kingdom among Boys and the promotion of habits of Obedience, Reverence, Discipline, Self-respect and all that tends towards a true Christian manliness".<br><br>The Scout movement branched out from the BB.  Badon Powell was a member of the BB.  The Scout association was formed with not religious background.  So it's another alternative to a uniformed group to choose from if the parents wants .</div>

We tell them what we are about.<br><br>Also, the new members will go through a training camp.  We invite the parents down for a "Meet the Parents" session.
