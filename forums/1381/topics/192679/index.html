            <div class='col-md body'><strong> The Holy Spirit making the Law effective [whether law of conscience or Law of Mt. Sinai] is our tutor to Christ.<br></strong><br><br>Ga 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them."<br><br><strong>I. What is the law here? </strong><br><br>Law refers to the Old covenant made by God to the Israelites. it includes the 10 commandments. Then the text says that those who are under the works of the Law are under the curse.<br><br><strong>II. What does 'under the works of the Law' mean? </strong><br><br>It refers to persons who seek to be saved by Law-keeping. they are said to be under THE [note the definite article. it does not say 'a curse' it says THE CURSE] CURSE. The curse referred to here is the ultimate curse of the law. What is that curse? it is death spiritual and eternal in hell.<br><br><strong>III. Why is it that those who seek to be saved by Law-keeping under the curse?</strong><br><br>notice the answer:<br><br>for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them."<br><br><strong>Question:</strong> does it say: 'Cursed is everyone who OCCASIONALLY does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them?<br><br>No it says: 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue [or remain] in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them."<br><br>The word continue there actually means REMAIN.<br><br>It is in the present tense in the Greek. Present tense in Greek describes an action that is continuing. So the verse is actually saying: "Cursed is everyone who does not continually remain in ALL things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.<br><br>a&gt; What are the things written in the book of the law?<br><br>all it's commandments, precepts and regulations.<br><br>b&gt; What is it to continually remain in all things which are written in the book of the law?<br><br>it means to obey it continually, abiding in it without the slightest break or infraction. <strong>In short? Perfect obedience from start to finish!!!!!!!! </strong><br><br>When it comes to the law God demands perfect obedience to His law. No sin in short.<br><br><strong>Again the question?</strong> Why is any man who desire to saved himself by Law-keeping under the curse?<br><br>Because <strong>a)</strong> God requires perfect obedience to the Law.<strong> b)</strong> Because no one can obey it perfectly. And the Law brings with it penalty. A law without penalty is not a law but an advice or suggestion. In our land we have laws, and it has its penalties.<br><br>REad it again:<br><br>Ga 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them<br><br>Bad news for us right? We have not obeyed perfectly all of His commands.<br>"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," [Romans 3:23]<br><br>The evidence that we have sinned against God's holy law [whether the law of conscience [ we Gentiles are under] or law of the Mt.Sinai [Israelites are under] is death. WE all die because we have sinned. The moral preacher down the street has sinned. The criminal there in prison has sinned. Ironside has sinned that's why we all die.<br><br>The wages of sin is death.<br><br>But look at verse 13 :<br><br>Ga 3:13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us............."<br><br>God never intended the Law for our salvation. He gave it to show us that we are sinners. Not to saved us. I have never heard of the 10 commandments dubbed as Savior. I have never seen the ten commandments being crucified on Mt. Calvary. The Law was given by God to bring us to Christ.<br><br>a) it was given to show us that we are sinners, spiritually sick and in need of THE doctor.<br><br>"What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions,....."[Galatians 3:19]<br><br>b) The Law was given to bring us to Christ and find our satisfaction of salvation in HIm.<br><br>"Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith." [Galatians 3:24]<br><br><strong><br>Practical Application:</strong><br><br>1) Are you aware of your sinfulness my friend?<br><br>2) Have you tried keeping the Law? WEre you succcessul in keeping it? I mean were you able to perfectly obey it thought, motive, intention, desires, words and actions?<br><br>3) If we are honest to ourselves, NO we have not obeyed it perfectly. We are under the curse of the Law. And that is eternal hell.<br><br>4) But don't despair:<br><br>Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."<br><br>Trust in His finished work on the cross alone!!!<br><br>When you do, you know what will happen? The Holy Spirit will indwelt you and enable you and empower you to fulfill the righteous requirement of the law:<br><br>Ro 8:3 "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh,"<br><strong><br>4 "that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
