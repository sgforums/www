I realize you like to quote Matthew 16:18.<br><br><blockquote>8And I tell you, you are Peter,* and on this rock* I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. 19I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.Â’</blockquote>Do you know why the verse cannot be used to support your interpretation for the papacy?<br><br>Because the author of Matthew has put a safeguard just a few verses down.<br><br>Can you quote verse 23 for us?

But they remained silent.<br><br>5He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. 6Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. </span><br><br>-So does Jesus want the thief to go to heaven or hell?<br>-Is God supposed to follow the law(if there is), that all believers should be baptised?<br><br></div>

Do not rely on the explanation given from the Catholic side.</div></blockquote>Here, Icey, summarised for you,<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>The Five Solas of the Reformation<br>Sola Scriptura - Part 1<br>Preached by Brett Baker<br>EASTSIDE EVANGELICAL FELLOWSHIP</strong><br><br>A Biblical Defense of Sola Scriptura<br>"But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work." 2 Timothy 3:14-17 NKJV<br><br>This Latin phrase which translated means "Scripture alone" is the starting place for our study because from it emanates our other topics. Before we consider what this means, letÂ’s consider what it does not mean.<br><br>It does not mean that the Bible is the only place where truth can be found.<br>It does not mean that the Bible is equally clear to all people.<br>It does not mean that the instruction of Church is not helpful and authoritative.<br><br>It does mean however, that the Scriptures are our only ultimate and infallible authority for faith and practice.<br>We are not talking here however about "solo Scriptura" which might be what we would call those who want themselves to be the only teachers (the "just-gimme-me-and-my-Bible" group) and to repudiate all others.<br>We are however saying that the Scriptures are our final authority and that they are infallible. All other authorities, even though equally as valid, are subordinate to the Scriptures and are fallible.<br><br>Central to the question of Sola Scriptura is the question of sufficiency. The Protestant understanding is that the Scriptures are complete and that they are absolutely sufficient for all that we need for instruction in righteousness, faith and salvation. There is a distinction to be made between formal sufficiency and material sufficiency. The first pertains to whether the Scripture alone (apart from instructors, parents, and church discipline) is sufficient for all training. The second concept states that the message or content of the Scripture is sufficient. The Protestant position is that God has given the offices and authority to the Church as a blessing for her. However in all cases the content of the Scriptures is ultimately authoritative.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Pope Nicholas:<br><strong><br><br>Sounds like John Calvin haha.<br><br>Catholicism believes that baptism removes original sin and gives a state of grace. Mortal sins destroy this state of grace while venial sins adds impurites which can either be claensed through penance or in purgatory.<br><br>Analogy:<br><br>In baptism, a cup is filled with water. When one commit mortal sin, the water is emptied and the cup becomes empty. During the rite of Penance, water is filled back and the person is in the state of grace. If a person commits venial sins, the water gets dirtied (but there is still water). Doing penance or indulgnece or prayers will act like a filter to remove this impurities, making the water pure again.<br><br>[b]If u die and ur cup is filled with clean water, u go to heaven.<br><br>If u die and ur cup is empty (mortal sin), u go to Hell<br><br>If u die and ur cup is filled with DIRTY water, u will go to PURGATORY to be cleansed b4 u go to heaven.</strong><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>You make it sound as if to get into Heaven, you have to not only believe in Christ, but also be good. That's not exactly true. When Jesus died on the cross, he took all of our sins. His last words were "tetelestai" -- paid in full. Thus, by saying that you have to have a "full cup with clean water" before you can go to Heaven, you're saying that going to Heaven is still dependent on your good deeds, which leads to saying that when Jesus died, he wasn't good enough to take away all of our sins. Jesus WAS good enough, however.<br><br>Romans 10:9<br>If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</div>

That's not exactly true.</span> When Jesus died on the cross, he took all of our sins. His last words were "tetelestai" -- paid in full. Thus, by saying that you have to have a "full cup with clean water" before you can go to Heaven, you're saying that going to Heaven is still dependent on your good deeds, which leads to saying that when Jesus died, he wasn't good enough to take away all of our sins. Jesus WAS good enough, however.<br><br>Romans 10:9<br>If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</div></blockquote></div>
