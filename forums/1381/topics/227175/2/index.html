This Baptism of blood, <strong>like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament </strong><br><br>1260 "Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery."63 <strong>Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved.

I never say they search the Scripture alone. I think you misunderstood the point about the Bereans. The point is - given any oral teaching, you should be able to find in Scripture.
