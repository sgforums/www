            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, very long discussion on many pertinent points.<br><br>I picked up the overall key issue. Whether is salvation is temporal, or permanent, and whether deeds (or penance) is necessary to maintain salvation.<br><br>Very heavy issues.<br><br>For one, I believe that salvation has a permanency, for Christ has declared his work on the cross is complete. For things that has passsed, and things that has yet to come. All sins. His blood is not that of oxen and lambs where repeated sacrifice is necessary. His sacrifice is considered perfect.<br><br>With that, works, deeds and penance cannot make you anymore saved or anymore saved.<br><br>However, it is further mentioned, that being saved means being known by God. This implied walking with Him on a daily basis. This means having a relationship. To have a constant renewal of your mind. This means that it is not your deeds or the need for any good works to accompany your salvation. Rather it is your continual personal walk with God to exists for you to be regarded as a 'true Christian'.<br><br>Not those that declare him as God and Christ has saved him, and yet live a life that clearly depicts that rejects all that has been given to him.<br><br>Therefore, there is no one concrete physical means to determine a person is saved. It all has to do with ones intimate moments with God. Only God knows.<br><br>It is very tricky, but one thing is for sure. If in your mind, you are clearly doing deeds/penance to make yourself right with God - that is self-righteousness and in no way related to salvation. Your righteousness is solely that of Christ.<br><br>I would have thought the baptism issue is a done deal - both for all Christians and Catholics. It is not necessary for salvation. Salvation is very simple, no need for any traditions or even people.<br><br>Tied in very closely to salvation is love. God's love for you. Consider that aspect. Do remember that God has revealed through Christ that he is not 'Lord', but Father to us. The preceding versus indicating 'Lord' could be used to describe the Jewish perception and relationship of God. This is not directly applicable to us under the new covenant.</div>
