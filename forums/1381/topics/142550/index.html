            <div class='col-md body'>As shown in:<br><br>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, <strong>who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. </strong>For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. (1 Timothy 2:3-6)<br><br>My comment: GOD's grace works both ways. He gives freely, but the individual must make a personal effort to receive it. This relationship works both ways. Only by acknowledging Christ as our savior can we be given everlasting life and spared from eternal condemnation.</div>

Even my BS teacher says in the book of Corinthians the command for women to wear scarves and to keep silent in church is for the Corinthians at that period of time only. We have to take into consideration why Paul gave that command in that context, and not just say all women are to do that now.<br><br>Which is why I believed we shouldnt 'read the bible' literally also.<br><br>But then, what is unchanging is: Salvation thru faith by GOD's grace. Christ is the way, the life and the truth. As Christians, our focus should always be on Christ. If we lose focus, we may lose faith and backslide, not knowing what is true/false anymore. When the situation becomes 'anything goes', then all the false teachings will come out.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why I disagree with anything-goes theory:<br><br>In the book of matthew:<br><br>Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? <strong>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</strong><br><br>Remember the luke-warm church in the book of Revelations? GOD will spit them out....(I know all about you: how you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were one or the other, but since you are neither, but only lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth. You say to yourself, 'I am rich, I have made a fortune, and have everything I want', never realizing that you are wretchedly and pitiably poor, and blind and naked too).<br><br>and<br><br>1 Corinthians 21: <strong>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. </strong><br><br></div>
