He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? [b]No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</strong><br><br>Remember the luke-warm church in the book of Revelations? GOD will spit them out....(I know all about you: how you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were one or the other, but since you are neither, but only lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth. You say to yourself, 'I am rich, I have made a fortune, and have everything I want', never realizing that you are wretchedly and pitiably poor, and blind and naked too).<br><br>and<br><br>1 Corinthians 21: <strong>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. </strong><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Come on......you pass this passages to any bible school child they can tell you right away that these are not Anything goes theory/teachings.<br>These are clear CUT.<br><br>Is this what you mean by -anything goes-?? So anything goes means following God and devil(ref 1Cor21,Matt)?<br><br>In my opinion, anything goes means, a religion which you can pick and choose the things you wish to do.<br><br>cheers<br></div>
