Becoz if u can call me dumb...u shd have a solid foundation of knowledge. And i also don't believe that u r majoring in material or engineering course. What the HECK??? Since when i mention about properties???? Properties is a macroscopic term. I just..JUST mention 3 phases co-existing. Dun misinterpete with properties. From my arguement...i view that water is like god. If he wans to be presence as father, son or holy spirit...is like water present itself in different phases. And if father and son and holy spirit exist at the same time...i try to tell u that solid , liquid and gas of H20 can also exist at the same time given the exact temperature and pressure. do u know that??</blockquote>I say your statement is dumb. And frankly, your conclusion tat I am not from an engineering or material course or tat I am not a postgraduate is wrong. Wat is your definition of properties ? Isn't whether a material is in solid or liquid form a property ? Isn't the triple point of the material property ? U don't know wat is property ? Wat do u mean by property is a macroscopic term ? Who tell tat to u ? Tat is so completely wrong ! Even a single atom exhibit certain properties !<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Property:<br><br>A characteristic trait or peculiarity, especially one serving to define or describe its possessor<br><br>A characteristic attribute possessed by all members of a class</span><br><br>In short, properties is another meaning for characteristics ! A triple point is a property of the material ! Why don't u go and ask around if the triple point is one of its properties. It is unique, and can only be achieve at a certain temperature and pressure. U don't know about science do u ? I thought in primary schools one already know enough english to know wat is properties.<br><br>Wat is the point of u telling me tat H2O can exhibits being a liquid, solid or gas ? I am telling u tat these form is not mutually exclusive. U don't even need to mention the triple point. There exists a line of variation in pressure and temperature where H2O can exists as water-gas, solid-liquid etc at the same time. It is not mutually exclusive ! An object can be liquid or solid at the same time. U can even say tat an object can be green or red at the same time too. It is possible !<br><br>But Father and son is different ! It is mutually exclusive  ! U cannot become your own father ! R u your own father ? Can u become your grandmother ? U can't ! Just because water can exists as liquid, solid or gas, doesn't mean u can become your father ! Just because water, in fact iron or mercury watever can become a water, solid and gas at the same time, does it means u can become your ancestors ? Just because carbon can exists as diamond and graphite, can u make your left hand can become a right hand ? U can't ! Wat r u talking cock about ?<br><br><blockquote>The last time i argued wif u about the creation of universe....i also told u that forces ( eg electrostatic force, magnetic force ) do not exist at the same time. </blockquote>Tat is again dumb. The physics of force, magnetic, gravity and electrostatic is there. U can't see it just because there is no matter. Does the law exists ? No one can say it doesn't.<br><br>It is like u saying there is no gravity just because it is almost negligible in deep space. The law is there, and u can only feel it when u r near an object with a large mass. Same as electrostatic force before the big bang. The theoretical law is there. It is just tat u do not have an object tat uses tis law doesn't means it do not exists. It is a theory tat an object of 9 dimensions create the whole universe. How do u know if this "9 dimensions" thing do not practise laws of electrostatic, magnetism etc ?<br><br><blockquote>I think u need to brush up ur science b4 u could argue. Checking in the internet and trying to understand such terms in a short time wouldnt help. </blockquote>u don't even know wat is property ! U can even say it is associated with macroscopic object ! Even my grandather know wat is property!! Am I arguing with a kid ?</div>

( again u mention it for the second time)<br><br>Now..my question back to u is...since when i mention about material is able to hold both properties at the same time???? i guess u super misinterprete what i say. Dont try to be smart and lecture me of what property.  I am talking about phases. Phases of water. Of coz triple point is a property of water...but i am not concern about what is the property of water when it is at triple point...i am ARGUING wif u about the PHASES at triple point ok...and i DIDNT mention anything about material is able to hold both properties. Are u trying to correct something that i didnt mention??? or acting smart?? and trying to be more macho as if i dunno what is property of a material. What i am trying to tell u that property is a macroscopic term...is that at triple point...the property of the material cannot be consider as a solid, liquid nor a gas. U must view it macroscopicly. Therfore...My arguement about triple point is all related to the phase that exist at that time..and NOT the property of the water at triple point.<br><br>So..about the Schrodinger Cat...u got nothing to say right. U know u make a fool out of urself of ur previous statement<br><br>and ur last reply u said "U can even say tat an object can be green or red at the same time too. It is possible !

It can either be a left hand or right hand, and not a left AND right hand. If there is a left AND right hand it just meant u have 2 hands isn't it ? How can it become 1 hand ? Doesn't tat sounds like a contradiction or a lie ? Either your waistline is fatter than 30 cm or thinner than 30 cm. It cannot be fatter and thinner than 30 cm at the same time. If u say it is fatter and thinner than 30 cm at the same time" ....<br><br>Ok..u keep on saying that The Father and Son are mutually exclusive...let me tell u something very important from the bible...They are ONE..1, ONE.

I REPEAT AGAIN...i didnt mention anything about the law governing these forces..<br><br>Do i make myself clear this time. wow...so u r a postgraduate from engineering course....which uni.....NUS??? NTU?? ... i am from NUS..considering whether to take master or not. Dun mind telling me ur name if u r from local uni...then i willl really wish to have a cup of coffee wif u...although u bash christianity up so much. U know how many prof in NUS is a christian.

Read back wat u have written before !<br><br><strong>Since when i mention about properties???? Properties is a macroscopic term.</strong><br><br>WHEN HAS PROPERTIES EVER BE ASSOCIATED WITH MACROSCOPIC TERM ???!??! U can't use it on microscopic object ? Hydrogen molecule have no properties ?

U never say about properties before, but does tat means I CANNOT START TO SAY ABOUT PROPERTIES NOW ? Wat is the properties of H2O at triple point ? It can be a solid, liquid or gas isn't it ? U can called them "phases", u can called them having tis "characteristic", u can use the term "behavior" instead, u can say they have 3 "states", or u can say it have these "properties" ! Wat physical state a material is by itself is a property isn't it ? Wat is wrong with using ANY OF THESE WORDINGS ? I am saying it is NOT UNUSUAL for matter to exhibit both STATES at the same time ! Therefore it is not unusual for them to hold both properties at the same time ! BUT IT IS REALLY UNUSUAL AND IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE A FATHER BEING ITS OWN SON. There r a lot of properties tat can be concurrent at the same time, such as the same object ha both the color of white and red. Wat is wrong with using tis comparison ? Just because all elements exhibits 2 states at a specified temperature and pressure doesn't mean tat u can be a father and son at the same time. Just because your bag can be white and red at the same time doesn't mean u have can have 2 heads and think u r great in science and english. I am telling u I can't see a connection here ! Unless u r teling me god is nothing but water, jesus is nothing but an ice cube while holy spirit is nothing but water vapour, then does it ever made sense !

U find anything wrong with tat statement ?<br><br><blockquote>What i am trying to tell u that property is a macroscopic term...is that at triple point...the <strong>property</strong> of the material cannot be consider as a solid, liquid nor a gas. U must view it macroscopicly. </blockquote>Whether u view it from a MACROSCOPIC or MICROSCOPIC angle, it still simply meant the property of a material is a solid, liquid or gas ! from a miscoscopic view, each molecule can exists as a solid, liquid or gas in tis condition at some time. U can't fix it its states ! From a macroscopic view, some of the molecules in the sample is gas, some liquid and some remains as solid ! Wat is wrong with using property ? If I use the word, "behavior", "characteristic", "appear", "as if" etc, it is still all correct ! In short, u fail your english and science and u blame it on people !<br><br>Wait a minute... I start using the word sample in the earlier passage. I can't use the phase "sample" because u haven't start using it yet ? Tat is DUMB !<br><br><blockquote>So..about the Schrodinger Cat...u got nothing to say right. U know u make a fool out of urself of ur previous statement </blockquote>Tat is funny, I thought Schrodinger Cat is applied to quantum physics. It is used because underlying the peculiar world of quantum mechanics is the notion that, under certain circumstances, matter can exist in more than one state or position at the same time. Tis therefore is applied to quantum physics itself.<br><br>So u r telling me your waistline can get to be above 30 cm and below 30 cm at the same time ? So u r telling me your left hand can become your right hand at the same time ? Can u do it ? Have u seen anyone done it ? Can u even come up with a model how can tat ever be achieve ? If u can't do it, then just shut up ! Why drag in Schrondinger Cat when it meant nothing ?!? Does Schrondinger Cat meant tat your left hand can become your right hand ever ? Does Schrondinger Cat meant tat your waist line can become above 30 cm and below 30 waist line at the same time ? U better go back and read about it ! Schrondinger Cat is telling people tat matter canot exists as 2 states at any one time. It actually run in line with my exlanation tat your left hand cannot be in another state, (right hand) at the same time.<br><br></div>

Buddha never say he is perfect. And the issue about nirvana and glowing head is unimportant, compared to the christian belief [to their grave] that Jesus is the Son of God, second person of Trinity and He died for our sins.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>BEYOND BELIEF<br><br>PREFACE<br>The purpose of this book is threefold. Firstly it aims to critically examine Christianity and thereby highlight the logical, philosophical and ethical problems in Christian dogma. In doing this I hope to be able to provide Buddhists with facts which they can use when Christians attempt to evangelize them. This book should make such encounters more fair, and hopefully also make it more likely that Buddhists will remain Buddhists. As it is, many Buddhists know little of their own religion and nothing about Christianity - which makes it difficult for them to answer the questions Christians ask or to rebut the claims they make.<br><br>The second aim of this book is to help any Christians who might read it to understand why some people are not, and never will be, Christians. Hopefully, this understanding will help them to develop an acceptance of and thereby genuine friendship with Buddhists, rather than relating to them only as potential converts. In order to do this, I have raised as many difficult questions as possible and not a few home truths. If it appears sometimes that I have been hard on Christianity, I hope this will not be interpreted as being motivated by malice. I was a Christian for many years and I still retain a fond regard, and even admiration, for some aspects of Christianity. For me, Jesus' teachings were an important step in my becoming a Buddhist and I think I am a better Buddhist as a result. However when Christians claim, as many do with such insistence, that their religion alone is true, then they must be prepared to answer doubts which others might express about their religion.<br><br>The third aim of this book is to awaken in Buddhists a deeper appreciation for their own religion. In some Asian countries Buddhism is thought of an out-of-date superstition while Christianity is seen as a religion which has all the answers. As these countries become more Westernized, Christianity with its "modern" image begins to look increasingly attractive. I think this book will amply demonstrate that Buddhism is able to ask questions of Christianity which it has great difficulties in answering, and at the same time to offer explanations to life's puzzles which make Christian explanations look rather puerile.<br><br>Some Buddhists may object to a book like this, believing that such a gentle and tolerant religion as Buddhism should refrain from criticizing other religions. This is certainly not what the Buddha himself taught. In the Mahaparinibbana Sutta he said that his disciples should be able to "Teach the Dhamma, declare it, establish it, expound it, analyse it, make it clear, and be able by means of the Dhamma to refute false teachings that have arisen." Subjecting a point of view to careful scrutiny and criticism has an important part to play in helping to winnow truth from falsehood, so that we can be in a better position to choose between "the two and sixty contending sects." Criticism of another religion only becomes inappropriate when it is based on a deliberate misrepresentation of that religion, or when it descends into an exercise in ridicule and name-calling. I hope I have avoided doing this.<br><br>I would like to thank Moses Chan and Paul Teo, two devout Christians and good friends, for the hours of stimulating discussions we had on some of the matters covered in this book. We agree to disagree but remain friends.<br><br>A.L.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok i know i'm a bit off topic here but there are just a few things i would like to clarify...<br><br>firstly, we Christians believe in the Holy Trinity, which is 3 Gods in one. Upon stating this, i would actually like to say that using the example of water being a solid, a liquid and a gas is a bad analogy, because it can only be a solid, a liquid and a gas at any one time.<br><br>God is God the Father, who sent His son to earth as a man named Jesus. He was born from the virgin Mary, and is still the son of God. He is sinless and He came so that He can die in our place, as the penalty of sin is DEATH.<br><br>Then after Jesus died on the cross, He resurrected from the dead and appeared to His disciples. Jesus had conquered death. He has bought our death. So why won't you believe in Him and have eternal life?<br><br>Anyway, Jesus later on went back up to heaven to be with His Father, but that is not to say that His presence is not here on earth. He left His Holy Spirit here to be with us.<br><br>So through this, we get the Holy Trinity (three-in-one), God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<br><br>I hope you understand it better now. Cheers!</div>
