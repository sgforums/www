This topic does not discuss differences in different beliefs, but rather on what our ancestors believed in, and whether they are saved thru Christ.<br><br>And we know they all practised Buddhism, Hindusim and hosts of other beliefs still in practice today. That also include our Chinese New Year, which have its basis on ancient folklore!<br><br>Yes, this topic (hopefully will not go into insults and flaming) may have lots of intellectual discussions, but there are still underlying implications. There are links from ancestors to other beliefs, and talking about how they were saved or not is akin to slapping them, and others still present, in the face.<br><br>Why would one not feel offended? How can one not feel offended? In your views yes, its allright to discuss for certain reasons, but sensitivity remains top priority for topics that include other beliefs. Be mindful, its allright for Christians to discuss salvation on non believers, but its not a common held views. We can all say such topics would not lead to serious consequences in the short run, but antipathy against Christianity may build up. Countless of people will be reading this topics, they may not start going around bashing up Christians now, but their hatred may start building up...<br><br>Seriously, it need not to be calling a Muslim pig or naturalist to go to hell.<br><br>That is directly expressed insults.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But isn't this a Christian forum?<br><br>So are we supposed to tell <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=1169" rel="nofollow">House Of FengShui</a> forum to be sensitive to Christians since Christians don't believe in fortune-telling and fengshui?  I am not trying to offend the owner of HOTS forum, but just making a point that this is a Christian forum.  So other religion people who get offended easily should not click on any topic here.</div>

The difference between Larry and some other forumites is the tone of his notes, which I must say is mostly unconfrontational. He is one of the many non-Christians I am able to reply to and at the end of it, agree to disagree, and walk away happy.<br><br>I am all for religious sensitivity myself. I refrain from commenting on other religions as well as RCs. Whatever gripes I have with any religious organisation is internal - ie within the folds of Christianity, the malpractice of some supposedly spirit-filled church.</div>
