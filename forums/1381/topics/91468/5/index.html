U have ur believe..we have our own. Billgates success lie in feng sui? Ang moh dunno feng sui, they position their wall, chair and doors all wrongly..that's y they are so poor today???? ppl who read fung sui in the streat..so good in telling ppl what to do..why dun they teach themselves first on how to generate wealth rather than walking down the streat begging for "business". </blockquote>U want to bang people there, go lor... I am not stopping u. I am not a taoist, believes in feng shui or buddhist too. Bang, please bang HOFS. Ask them all your questions. Do it. I believes in science. Bang science lah<br><br><blockquote>So ..no one call u to believe in Christ. Why so frust? U believe in karma right....so no one is stopping u. Ur aim of reading the bible is to find flaws and misinterpreting them to gang bang christians, not to understand it. </blockquote>Do I sound frustrated ? I think u should be the one tat checks your emotions first. My questions r not wrong. If u seek to understand the bible, u should really consider those questions seriously...<br><br><blockquote>I also got some questions. U say achieve nirvana...ok..who set the standard?? who is the one that say ok ..u achieve nirvana? Nature?? buddha.?? then who granted buddha nirvana?? nature?? What is this whole thing of nature? How u define nature? So..nature can think? nature can decide? nature says that u next round will become pig...or young handsome prince?? ..since u dun believe in GOd right....the " thing" that is going to judge u..is nature?? so.,.if nature can think, decide and pass judgement and upgrade a soul to achieve nirvana...so what exactly is this nature...Mother Nature??? </blockquote>I know nuts about nivana too. U want to find problems with it, do it. I don't care.<br><br><blockquote>There are alot of things to argue about ..which we DONT WANT TO DO IT..becoz of one thing call RESPECT. If i would enter house of feng sui and tell ppl what u believe is crap..u think i can CHANGE the ENTIRE FORUMITES view...u know u cant...but u r doing something quite similar here...i believe u have "mens rea" b4 u procede right. </blockquote>please do it. i implore u.<br><br><blockquote>ya almost forgot..what about this Hitler thing...y make it sound so difficult. simple..i can say i kill u for Christ sake...i can say i am a christian..i can SAY WHATEVER i want...so??? what;s the big deal...when i die ...then got judgement day lah. No one here is God..only He knows what is right. Actus reas and mens rea my fren. Actus reas is a tick for him liao...mens rea..only God knows. </blockquote>But then why deny he is a christ believer. He says he believes in christ etc, why want to deny it ? U know better than hitler on his religion ? u wanna leave everything to judgement ay, then I guess u can wait till the cow comes home and nothing wil happen.<br><br><blockquote>let me tell u one simple thing...which is..u can type a 10 thousand pages long of essay...BUT IT WILL NOT EVEN SHAKEN The FAITH OF ANY CHRISTIANS in this thread.

I have probably been attacked in such fashion for the many times by u. Tat in my impression, r is not only low class but also senseless and show your depth in such matters.<br><br>1) Is the points tat I had raised without logics and meaning ? Let the readers determine if the points I had raised up logical conclusions or not. Frankly most of the points tat I had raised up come from me myself only, not from websites. However for the other people, they tend to come up with faulty answers from their own religious website in which they have limited understanding on it. When question about it, they will jump at u for not "accepting" your answer.<br><br>2) And on the point of "lacking in the ability to write and spell coherently which makes understanding his writing extremely difficult", surely tat would have work against me during my replies. If u fail to understand wat I am trying to say, how can u come to the conclusion of me being an "eloquent debater". Just think about it, do we have to write proper queen's english in order to write in such forums ? Isn't writing such tat it is understandable be enough ?<br><br>3) Again u wanna raise my agenda for berating christians. Then again, wat is your agenda for berating me ? Wat is your personal vendetta for doing tat ?<br><br><blockquote>If he thinks that Christians are stupid misguided individuals, it's ok.

It surely meant meaning to u, a christian isn't it ? If someone insult u vulgarly on your parents in a dialect u do not understand, does it means it has no meaning to u and u should let them carry on their verbal assault on u ? On the issue here, it is on wat is the intentions and implications of the speaker or writer tat is of utmost importance. From the passage, obviously your intentions is again another verbal abuse on me. As such, why will it ever be "okay" for me ?<br><br><blockquote>Yeah, the Bible makes no sense until you submit to God's authority. So we look at this statement with regards to the topic raised. Is the bible relevant to those who have not heard of Christ?</blockquote>Why not ? it regards to your ancestors well being isn't it ? It is certainly relevant to everyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Not necessary.

Who is not borned out ? God make people conceive, yet punish people because they r conceived out. He might as well say breathing, drinking or eating  is a sin.<br><br>Ps. 51:5 <span style="font-style: italic;">"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me."</span><br><br><blockquote>Always remember sin is the cause of everything.

Believe in jesus christ as an important criteria makes no sense. There is already a faulty system of classifying sin</div>

I'd say that Christians preach that message because this is the truth as we see. Emphasing on the the phrase: <span style="font-style: italic;">the truth as we see</span>. Objectively speaking, anything that is perceived as the truth to any individual, it is likely that this individual will reject anything else contrary to that "truth". It is simply a natural process not limited to Christianity.<br><br>I do want to state that there are Christians who go overboard in the "preaching" as well as many of these with the holier-than-thou attitude.<br><br>"Believing in Jesus Christ makes no sense unless you see the reason behind it." - this is a good statement....<br><br></div>

There is no possible way tat a sinless non-believer can go to salvation even if he is borned from a rock and acts exactly like wat jesus had done when he is living.

The answer is the same as why does some christian want people of other religion to follow their religion. My intentions is to let people learn the truth, to let them be really free.<br><br>About hell, I am asking u why do u believe in a god tat is unfair, thus cease to be perfect. Throughout the bible it states tat god is like a rock and being perfect when he fails to be fair and is egoistic. Why don't u care about it ? Don't u realise tat everything u know about him may be wrong and it is all a lie spurned out by some people 2000 years ago. Why do u insist tat the bible is right when it has shown itself to be full of contradictions and illogical.<br><br><blockquote>For us christian, we view God as our Father too.

So...u think ur father will care how u treat the other ppl?? will he call u a good son? the answer is no. And in christian...we view God as our Father. </blockquote>If u ask me, as a parent I will forgive my son even if he turn against from me. When I find he is doing good deeds, helping society and generally a contribution to society, I will still be proud of him even though he do not acknowledge me as his parents. Tis is particularly true since I DO NOT GIVE concrete evidence tat I am his parents as well. Any tom dick and harry can claim he or she is the parent of this child, but he surely can'y believe in all of them.<br><br>For god, it seems tat u can treat him as a father, but he treats u as a slave. Throughout the bible he always consider u as his slave. Tis is even restated by jesus tat u r god's slave and he is a harsh master.<br><br><blockquote>2nd, u can be a murderer or a robber. U are HATED by the entire society. U r scorned. But...u love ur dad. U respect ur dad. And ur dad LOVES u.

From tis point doesn't tat make god seems unfair ? He not only do not care about his other "children" who do not believe in him for a good reason, he even went to the point of meting punishments on them like pouring acid on them and burning them when they r unaware. How loving and forgiving is tis "father" ?<br><br><blockquote>How can Jesus be a son and at the same time a father. U know what is triple point, euthetic point?? heard of them?? want to argue in science? </blockquote>Yah, I know the triple point, but wat has tat got to do with jesus ? I mean the triple point means a material can become a liquid, solid and gas at tis conditions... wat has it got to do with father and son ? Why talk about property of material to relationship ? Frankly I see little or no connections AT ALL.<br><br><blockquote>In case if u dont know...each element or compound have a triple point or euthetic point.

U might as well say a your bag is red and white at the same time, not completely red or white which is possible. For father and son, it is a property which is mutually exclusive. U can not hold both properties at the same time. A father has a child, and tis child cannot be his own father. It is mutually exclusive. It is like u only have a hand. It can either be a left hand or right hand, and not a left AND right hand. If there is a left AND right hand it just meant u have 2 hands isn't it ? How can it become 1 hand ? Doesn't tat sounds like a contradiction or a lie ? Either your waistline is fatter than 30 cm or thinner than 30 cm. It cannot be fatter and thinner than 30 cm at the same time. If u say it is fatter and thinner than 30 cm at the same time, it can only meant u r measuring different part of your body using different measurement system or on different people isn't it ?<br></div>
