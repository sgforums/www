            <div class='col-md body'>I have been pondering over this.<br><br>Our great grandparents and ancestors have not heard of Christianity, Jesus Christ and God.  The only religious divines they were taught to pray to during those time were money god, kitchen god, sea god etc.  They might have accept Christ if they were given a chance to.  But not many missionaries visited China.<br><br>Now they have all died.  Will they still go to heaven, cuz God is merciful and understands that it's not their fault not accepting Christ?  Or will they go to hell since they have not accepted Christ and thus they were not saved.</div>

They too have no way of hearing the gospel or understanding it, yet I believe that God is merciful and loving to them and will only judge them for what they do know not what they don't know. Now I will be the first one to say that with God anything is possible, so it is possible that God knows what decision they would have made if they had heard the gospel. I believe that is true of those in isolated countries who have never heard the gospel too. However, I think that if God did allow those who were mentally ill or killed before they reached the age of reason into heaven it would still be through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I believe that the aim of life is to attain nirvana and self-realization. Our souls, on death, will go to heaven for judgement. So that is probably what happen to our ancestors. They did not know the truth. When they are rebirth, they would probably know it. Its just a matter of time.  If we had did something bad, we would probably have to be rebirth as another human to clear off our karmic baggage. I think all religions are the same. They teach the same things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">I have been pondering over this.<br><br>Our great grandparents and ancestors have not heard of Christianity, Jesus Christ and God.  The only religious divines they were taught to pray to during those time were money god, kitchen god, sea god etc.  They might have accept Christ if they were given a chance to.  But not many missionaries visited China.<br><br>Now they have all died.  Will they still go to heaven, cuz God is merciful and understands that it's not their fault not accepting Christ?  Or will they go to hell since they have not accepted Christ and thus they were not saved.  </div></blockquote>Tis not for us to judge nor understand..<br>HE has HIS ways..<br>Let HIM decide for "them"..<br>As for us, we shld b glad dat we hav the chance which "they" did not..<br><br>Back-Slider-In-Christ  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shade343:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, I believe that the aim of life is to attain nirvana and self-realization. Our souls, on death, will go to heaven for judgement. So that is probably what happen to our ancestors. They did not know the truth. When they are rebirth, they would probably know it. Its just a matter of time.  If we had did something bad, we would probably have to be rebirth as another human to clear off our karmic baggage. I think all religions are the same. They teach the same things.</div></blockquote>I dont agree for some points.<br><br>Christianity do not believe in reincarnation, as I have learned in some topics here. Neither do Hindus believe in being saved through Jesus Christ.<br><br>To the rest...<br><br>If we were to examine all religious scriptures and holy books closely, it will be wrong to say there are no similarity, and it will be wrong to say there are no differences.<br><br>The point is this, while its alright to point out similarities or differences among different beliefs, continually speaking out about how non Christians can be saved or not be saved can have serious consequences.<br><br>In this case, this topic include our ancestors, generally, for Chinese, its ancestor worship, Buddhism and Taoism, Indian will be Hinduism and Buddhism, and for the Malays, Islam. Not just free thinkers.<br><br>These beliefs are still being practised today and some are recognised as offical religions in Singapore and other countries. To many here, it may sounds like a spiritual or an intellectual discussions. But please be mindful and be sensitive  when discussing such topics. Its tantamount to spitting on other beliefs because for many who do not believe in Christ. Not just because they feel offended, but they have their own strong reasons for not believing in Christ.<br><br>And if such topics heat up, what will be implications for the multireligious societies like Malaysia and Singapore? Worse ,if this debate is carried on offline and discussed with counterparts from other beliefs..?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks laurence for pointing out about being sensitive to everyone that reads the thread.<br><br>The discussions are in no way to change your beliefs. You still have to make your own choices. Also, please do not get personal in your remarks or insult the beliefs of others.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is no need to feel offended. If you do not believe in the christian worldview, there is no reason to feel offended. To you, the God who will judge and the God who pays for your salvation will not even exist in the first place.<br><br>People feel offended if the thing you say MEAN something to them. Like if you scold a Muslim a pig or dog, you know the reaction.<br><br>Similarly, how can a naturalist get angry if people condemn him to hell?</div>
