            <div class='col-md body'>Now read what I have to say. Wycliff died in 1384 of stroke. John WycliffÂ’s bones were burnt and ashes thrown into the Swift River in 1428. He was punished not for translating the bible, but for preaching heresy! John Wycliff 's version of the Bible was not a correct version, and he was using it as a means of corrupting the people's faith and of teaching them false doctrine! Catholic Church did condemn Wycliff's version, but at the same time allowed other versions of the Bible in English! He is not the first guy to translate the bible to English you know? Read the quote below.<br><br>"We shall . . . refute once more the common fallacy that John Wycliff was the first to place an English translation of the Scriptures in the hands of the English people in 1382. To anyone that has investigated the real facts of the case, this fondly-cherished notion must seem truly ridiculous; it is not only absolutely false, but stupidly so, inasmuch as it admits of such easy disproof . . .<br><br>To begin far back, we have a copy of the work of Caedmon, a monk of Whitby, in the end of the 7th century, consisting of great portions of the Bible in the common tongue. In the next century we have the well-known translations of the Venerable Bede, a monk of Jarrow . . . In the same (8th) century we have the copies of Eadhelm . . . of Guthlac, . . . and of Egbert . . . these were all in Saxon, the language understood and spoken by the Christians of that time. Coming down a little later, we have the free translations of King Alfred the Great . . . and of Aelfric, Archbishop of Canterbury . . . After the Norman conquest of 1066, Anglo-Norman or Middle-English became the language of England, and consequently the next translations of the Bible we meet with are in that tongue . . . such as the paraphrase of Orm (about 1150) and the Salus Animae (1250), the translations of William Shoreham and Richard Rolle . . . (d.1349) . . .<br>The translators of the Authorised Version, in their 'Preface,' refer to previous translations . . . :<br>Much about that time [1360], even our King Richard the Second's days, John Trevisa translated them into English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be seen that divers translated, as it is very probable, in that age . . . So that, to have the Scriptures in the mother tongue is not a quaint conceit lately taken up . . . but hath been . . . put in practice of old, even from the first times of the conversion of any nation."<br><br>{Graham, ibid., pp. 98-101}<br><br>Oh, all this took place in England. John Wycliffe was a Catholic priest.<br><br><a href="http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ508.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ508.HTM</a><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ms/seanie/deuteros/graham12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/ms/seanie/deuteros/graham12.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What about our friend Tyndale? William Tyndale was born in 1484. He studied at Oxford and became a priest, and was seized with the ambition of getting the Bible printed in England. But the church did not allow this. Why?<br><br>(I) Tyndale was not the man for the job. He says himself he was 'evil favoured in this world, and without grace in the sight of men, speechless and rude, dull and slow witted.' He had no special qualifications for the task of translation. Indeed, non-Catholic authors have admitted that the cause of Scripture reading in the vernacular was distinctly prejudiced by having been taken in hand by incapable men like Tyndale.<br><br>(2) He was acting entirely on his own account, and without authorisation from ecclesiastical superiors, either in England or in Rome; he was simply a private obscure priest, and was acting without commission and without sanction from higher quarters.<br><br>This guy was also teaching heresy and attacking the Catholic Church with his translation of the bible. About 1522 he had been suspected and tried for heresy; he had declared: 'I defy the Pope and all his laws'; and now he actually embodied in his English version Luther's notes and explanations of texts. It was full of mistranslations of sacred text and full of anti-Catholic notes.<br><br>Canon Dixon, the cultured Anglican historian, referring to the fact that copies of Tyndale's Bible were burnt, makes these striking remarks: 'If the clergy had acted thus simply because they would have the people kept ignorant of the word of God, they would have been without excuse. But it was not so. Every one of the little volumes, containing portions of the sacred text that was issued by Tyndale, contained also a prologue and notes written with such hot fury of vituperation against the prelates and clergy, the monks and friars, the rites and ceremonies of the Church, as was hardly likely to commend it to the favour of those who were attacked.'<br><br>Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, found it necessary to write a treatise against it, and asserted that to 'find errors in Tyndale's book were like studying to find water in the sea'.<br><br>But the most interesting point about the whole affair is that time has abundantly justified the action of the Catholic Church and proved that she did the proper thing in attempting to stamp out Tyndale's Bible. For the reading of this pernicious book produced most disastrous effects upon the morals of the people, who became rebellious, profane, and irreligious, and disaffected to the civil as well as to the spiritual authorities!<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ms/seanie/deuteros/graham13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/ms/seanie/deuteros/graham13.html</a></div>
