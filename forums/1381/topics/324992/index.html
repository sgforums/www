              <p><strong>                                                            Trophies of life</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">God gives to mankind the freedom to
                              choose, a free will to do whatever they choose to do, to be whatever they
                              choose to be. So God said to the children on earth: “You are free to choose
                              whatever trophy of life you would like to choose. Choose well because whatever
                              you choose it will be given to you!”.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">So the children of earth choose
                              each their own choice of trophies of life. Some choose to be famous scholar, some
                              others choose to be captain of industry, some choose to be famous celebrity,
                              some others choose to be king of realm. So each one of them picked up the
                              trophies of life of their choosing and lined up before God to be approved. Each
                              one of them believed that their trophies were the best ones for them. And God
                              being a gentle God let the children of earth to have their choice of trophies
                              of life. So God let them as their choosing and approved whatever trophies the
                              children picked.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">One of the children however found a
                              hidden trophy unlike the others that were picked by the other children. This
                              trophy was hidden inside the earth. And the small boy found it by pure luck
                              because he was not fast enough to grab the other trophies and hence started to
                              dig around in desperation in the hope of finding a trophy. Upon unearthing this
                              trophy an Angel appeared to the small boy and said to him: “This is no ordinary
                              trophy. This is the most precious one of them all”. The boy startled to see the
                              angel then asked: “Why is this one so different?” The angel replied: “Because
                              this is the trophy of everlasting life and everlasting power. Whoever choose
                              this trophy and carry it to the end would be given eternal power and eternal
                              life.<span>  </span>“The boy was so excited upon
                              hearing this and said immediately “I want this one!”. The angel then said ”Are
                              you sure? This is no ordinary trophy”. The small boy screamed “Yes of course I
                              want this one” The angel said “Then pick it up”. The small boy excitedly tried
                              to pick up the trophy that he had just unearthed. But he failed, the trophy
                              felt heavy, too heavy for him to pick it up and carry it to God. “Why is it so
                              heavy” The boy asked. The angel then replied “Because it is no ordinary
                              trophy”. Being persistent the boy then instead of picking it up tried to push
                              it with his own small body and it moved little by little. So the small boy pushed
                              his trophy little by little towards the line-up to be approved by the almighty
                              God but because the trophy was heavy he wasn’t able to pick other trophies that
                              he came to see along the way. The other children upon seeing the burden of this
                              small boy started to mock him saying: Hey why do you pick that trophy? It
                              doesn’t look good at all. The trophy is smaller than ours and it must be very
                              heavy<span>  </span>by the way you push it all the way
                              here, and he’s only able to pick only that one trophy. Some other children said
                              to the boy: Look at him and his small trophy. He’s all toiling and bearing
                              pains just to get it here. Poor guy he must have lost his mind to pick up that
                              trophy. But still the small boy didn’t pay attention to the other children
                              remarks and continued to push it until it was his time to see God. God then
                              said to the small boy: You have picked the best trophy of all. You are now in
                              pains but will no longer be. The trophy that you chose is the trophy of life.
                              You now will be given eternal power and eternal life because that is the trophy
                              of your choosing. The boy was out of words. He knew his struggle was not in
                              vain. He has found and chosen the best trophy of them all.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The parable is similar to one that Jesus spoke about a man who found a hidden treasure.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Matthew 13:44  <br> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field;
                  the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth
                  and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
