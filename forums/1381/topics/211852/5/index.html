The only negative things I said about the ACS family was that the skirts in ACJC getting shorter and shorter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The part about them losing their roots is just something ironic, as such I can't resist pointing it out. It is one of those schools with 'Chinese' perpetually etched into their name. Last time, there were many schools with names like XX Chinese Middle School, but had their names changed due to the bilingual policy. It is a pity the students are anything but chinese nowadays.<br><br>Don't worry, I have no ulterior motive, not trying to cause bad feelings. I am just the you3 hua4 zhi2 shuo1 kind of person.<br><br>Like I said, I already have the evidence. It is a simple matter of looking it up that's all.</div>
