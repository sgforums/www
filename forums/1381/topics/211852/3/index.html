Hence, even if the facts are far from the truth, the damage has been done. While not all students are Catholics as you correctly pointed out, it is rather damaging to the school reputation and no doubt the Catholic in charge will be saddened if he hears of it. Especially when the Catholic faith is so against abortion and sexual promiscuity, more than the Protestants.<br><br>The ACS vs CHS one, it is regrettable that I can't find any stats on CHS, now that they merged into HCI and their de-emphasis on academic results. I could find the ACS one though, but it is practically useless if I do not have the CHS one for comparison. Hence, until the day I dig out the CHS one, I shall take back my allegation, as per etiquette. <span class="large"><strong>I also apologize for any bad feelings caused to any ACS student or alumni.</strong></span><br><br>However, I will not take back my question as I feel my allegations are not far off from the truth, after all. I think there is no need to lie, the average ACS student is not exactly proud of his chinese result, in the academic sense.<br><br>Furthermore, if you ask them whether they think their chinese sucks more or the CHS english sucks more, I suspect they will say their chinese sucks more.</div>
