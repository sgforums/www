            <div class='col-md body'>on the Chinese issue, i reckon 9 out of 10 kids dislike mandarin more than english (i am trying very hard to recall any of my friends or students that actually mentioned liking mandarin, still can't think of more than a handful). That doesn't mean we are lousier at it. My grades for both subjects were the same, though my propensity towards english is much higher, i dislike mandarin coz i found it hard to study. i ended up memorising the words... it's the memorising part which i hated .. probably most kids feel that way too??<br><br>i dunno<br><br>just my view</div>
