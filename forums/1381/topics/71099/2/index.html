Didn't Jesus himself mention some things ONLY the Father in heaven will know?</div></blockquote>When the full equality of the Son(and Spirit) with the Father is denied, the result is subordinationism. The Arian heresy of the early fourth century is an example of subordinationism. Arius taught that Christ was created by the Father, and therefore not eternal and not fully sharing God's nature. To counter this teaching the Council of Nicea stressed that the Son was 'begotten, not made.' Some modern cults, such as the Jehovah Witnesses, teach a similar form of subordinationism. Note, however, that there is a proper sense in which we may speak of the Son's subordination to the Father. While it is heresy to speak of essential subordination, the Bible does show the Son voluntarily submit to the Father in various ways, in ways that are consistent with His identity as Son. For instance, it is the Father who sends the Son, not the Son who sends the Father. Thus Jesus can even say that His Father is greater than He (John 14:28  ).<br><br>Reference:<br><br>"You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I."<br>(John 14:28  )<br><br>(Doctrines of God - The Trinity by Tim Wiarda, Singapore Bible College)</div>
