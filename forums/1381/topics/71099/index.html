            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everybody! I just want to ask whether a born again Christian can hate God the father but love Jesus the Son. After all, we never once saw God and it was Jesus who demonstrated all the miracles of healing and deliverance and died on the Cross for us painfully and shamefully. The whole bible speaks of Jesus alone so where is God the father in this drama epic? I know of a man who hates God although he is a Christian bcos of the many things that happened in his life before and after he was a Christian, but loves Jesus still bcos he feels that Jesus understands him but not God as seen in Hebrews 2:18 which showed Jesus suffered and was tempted or tested and is able to aid those who are tempted or tested. He feels Jesus undertands bcos of His temptations as a man but God doesn't. He feels God is somewhere far away and he can only get close to God thru Jesus. He feels closer to Jesus than God. After all we are the bride of Christ. The Jews are the bride of the Father. God appears to Him like a stern father with Jesus the Son pacifying Him with His blood bcos without the blood, God will zap everyone in hell.<br><br>God appears to be omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. But this man feels He is schizophrenic bcos He can't be all powerful and yet does nothing to help the poor and oppressed. Only Jesus helped and brought laughter and consolation to this man. Jesus means so much to this man but not God. I believe when he goes up to heaven, he will spend more time with Jesus than God. Why can't God being all powerful do something if not for Jesus' cruxifixion? This man that I know have yet to be convinced that God loves him if not for Jesus bcos without Jesus, God can do nothing!</div>

True, mainline Christians believe in the doctrine of Trinity- ONE GOD -Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<br><br>I shall quote from Article One of the '39 Articles of Religion' :<br><br>"There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost."<br><br>If he truly and fully comprehends the above and have a good foundation of the written Word of God, he will know that Jesus is God. And the concept of Holy Trinity is NOT three slices of Pizzas making up one whole piece of Pizza.<br><br>To summarise:<br><br>1. God is One<br><br>2. Father, Son and Holy Spirit are personally distinct<br><br>3. Father, Son and Holy Spirit are spoken in terms of equal deity and dignity.<br><br>4. When the personhood of each member of the Godhead is denied, the result is modalism. (ie. God reveals Himself in different forms and modes at different times) THIS IS WRONG TEACHING.<br><br>5. When the unity of Godhead is denied, the result is tritheism (3 gods??)<br><br>6. Mentally separating the Father from the Son (or any other combinations) distorts sound biblical teachings about the Father as well as about the Son. All 3 Persons of the Trinity are equally merciful, loving, forgiving, holy, blessed, almighty and etc etc....<br>The Divine attributes and reverence to be given are all equal. Not a single of the member is inferior to the other two.<br><br>Lastly, the doctrine of Trinity is the profound mystery of God Himself and any attempt to fully comprehend, dissect and analyse using human mind is to seek the IMPOSSIBLE. There is a limit we can go about our exploration and wat we do know is based on the written word of God as He chose to reveal to us that much.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

So far all christian stand on the fact that the God of OT is the same as the NT.<br><br>The confusion comes when the bible describes God as Adonai, YHWH, Elohim and even El-Baal in some references. Some of these names like Elohim (creator) has similar relation with EL of canaan inhabitance, while YHWH (almighty) is a different God altogether for them. As for Adonai it means Lord God in a more paternal term. Its no wonder people gets confused over these names.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your theology is rather twisted. for one, God the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit are as one, called God. It's not 3 gods but 1 Triune God. contact your nearest pastor for assistance.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>second, as a christian, one shouldn't learn to hate. hate is destructive...and is not preached by christians in general. when in confusion, in a spiritual crisis or depression, bear the 3 essences of christianity in mind: faith, hope, and love.<br><br>Have faith in God, always. Hope in God, yes, even in hopeless situations. And love others, as in the Greatest commandment by Jesus. Like Job, you'll be rewarded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Various analogies have been proposed in an attempt to make the Trinity easier to understand, but none is truly adequate.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br><br>Most children who have attended Sunday school have probably heard analogies for Trinity. The Trinity is like a piece of clover:  one plant but three leaves.<br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:LkB1lz8KKe0J:indigo.ie/~monika/pics/shamrock.gif"><br><br>Or, the Trinity is like water:it is one thing, but can exist as solid, liquid, or steam. Despite their popularity, such analogies should be AVOIDED. They are misleading. The clover analogy, for instance, implies that the divine nature is divided into three parts. The water analogy teaches modalism.<br><br>(Quoted from 'Doctrine of God' by Dr.Timothy Wiarda, Singapore Bible College)</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another danger is that of <span style="font-style: italic;">mentally separating the Son from the Father</span>. Occasionally, Christians may think of Jesus as tender and forgiving, while picturing the Father in heaven as a stern judge. Such thinking distorts both the truth about the Father(whose love is revealed in Christ) and the truth about the Son(who judges sin every bit as much as the Father).<br><br>A third danger is <span style="font-style: italic;">mentally separating the Spirit from the Son</span>. This kind of thinking appears in various forms, particularly in context where debates and uncertainties about the works of the Holy Spirit. Some Christians are well taught about Christ, and confident in their relationship with Him, may feel that they do not really need the Holy Spirit. Others may feel that they have Christ, but now need something additional, the Holy Spirit. Some seek the Spirit's blessings without a strong sense that these are received from Christ, or speak of remarkable spiritual experiences that seems to have little connection with Christ. All such ways of thinking run counter to biblical teaching, in which the work of the Spirit and the work of Christ are always inseparably bound together.<br><br>(Quoted from 'Doctrine of God' by Dr. Timothy Wiarda, Singapore Bible College)</div>
