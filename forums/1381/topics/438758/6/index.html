              <p>The Bible warns about pride, so thank you very much, but I already know this. I am only asking you, since you warn about personal pride, whether atheists are guilty of that when they portray themselves as Brights or more rational than people who have religious beliefs. I note that you have steered away from answering this.</p>

              <p>I beg to differ. I think from what's going on in forums like these, it is more true that Christians are the easiest to pick on, because those who bash the Christian faith know they wouldn't get hit back, since they know Christians are somehow supposed to be so loving and docile and always turning the other cheek, ya? And of course if the Christian does demolish their objections they can always play the guilt trip and ask "Oh where's the love? So critical and so judgemental one!"</p>

              <p>1. You are the one committing genetic fallacy and not being objective. You refuse to accept the current meaning in the current context of atheism and instead try to use a false defintion from an irrelevant origin.</p>
              <p>2. Oh yes the US court did rule atheism as a religion but it doesnt make it a universal truth automatically. You assume too much and too quickly.</p>
              <p>3. Yup you too. Dont you also reject the idea of God/Gods too other than your own? You are also part atheist</p>

              <p>Christians who know God don't claim to be intellectually superior than anyone else. It is the atheist who thinks that it is a smart thing to reject belief in God and that only dull-minded people (the non-Brights) believe in God and all sorts of religious things.</p>

              <p>I'm not morally perfect so I will never say that I have obeyed ALL of the Bible's moral commandments. No where does the Bible teaches that Christians to be morally perfect in order to encourage another Christian to follow the Bible and obey God's commands. If this is a condition then it makes a mockery of the Bible's command that we exhort each other to be obedient to God's Word. Christians have feet of clay and all walk the same paths and face the same temptations and have personal moral failures. But having said that, it is one thing to have moral failures while working out our salvation with fear and trembling, it is quite another to not even talk or preach the Gospel to anyone in complete wilful disobedience to what God said. I mean, if motoway's cousins don't preach the Gospel to him because he has already slammed the door in their face before, that I can understand. But if he is telling me that his cousins do not even preach to anyone, then I think this is a problem. Agree or not? What does your Bible study tell you?</p>

              <p>I see nothing wrong with that poster. It uses coarse language, but otherwise the message is fair. It reminds me of the popular saying "Opinions are like assholes -- everyone's got one." It sounds like an insult, but it's just a crude analogy.</p>
              <p>Also, I've seen it posted on more popular forums like Hardwarezone. Haven't seen anyone carted off to the ISD for that yet.</p>

              <p>this is why we should suppress people like BIC, including religious evangelism</p>

              <p>The qualifier is the word "yet". And you even agree that it sounds like an insult, then it most probably is, whether crude or not. You may think you have more tolerance for crude language used on religion, but another person may not. So if you or anyone here wants to take your chances with the authorities, be my guest. I don't suppose motoway would dare air this "fair message" poster in bus-stops or publish it in newspapers. Would you encourage it? If not, why not?</p>
