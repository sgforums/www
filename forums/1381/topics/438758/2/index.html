              <p>From the starter of this thread,</p>
              <p>to all who commented (good or bad)</p>
              <p>i don't push you to believe on God (the creator of the universe and fortunately, the creator of your life). i just let you know, it's up to you to believe on  Him or not. I believe, that believing on God is not based by anything else but by yourself alone with the grace of God of course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About religion, let me say something on that. True Christians should understand that religion is not a savior and not all the way to the savior.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing that i observe by what most ministers and so called priests and pastors (but i'm not against them, instead praying for them for a change) really make profit out of thier founded denomination and other religious organization. Truly God blesses the cheerful giver but let not be the blessing be for greediness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>many ministers, pastors, priests and others, put up religious organization and defining WHO GOD IS?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you know, i for one, cannot understand what they are talking about, about God until, I, alone, searching who am i to God?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me give you this example. Religious people are defining God as a big ocean. How? they define Him as kind, generous God, loving God, and so on. but do you think you understand them all?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOu know, we as persons are compared to a glass, and if God is like an ocean which religious filling in to us as (glasses). we can never accomodate the ocean. there, we can never understand God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right, God is really big. bigger than any problem or any other name (Read your Bible, as i had told you, better if you search alone. it means you're sincere.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now what should we do? or what should i do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>simple, as a glass, emmerse yourself, myself in the ocean and you will really understand your/my God, our God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>where you are in, there you will understand the place. but you and i cannot understand the place if it is just and imagination. because God is more than imagination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another point that i want to reestablish here is what does faith means?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's upon you to define what is faith in your life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but let me share your what faith means to me, it really changes a lot of me and that's why i never give up with this even no matter what happen. because this is my own belonging that is gift from God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faith is believing for what eyes cannot perceive. that's all. that's how i define. but deep inside me, it is so meaningful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if i cannot see my God, i still have faith on Him. even if others are mocking me, laughing at me, or will kill me, never shall i surrender because Faith is believing for what eyes cannot perceive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if my prayers are not yet answered, still i believe that it is in progress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if my sorrounding is falling apart, or my nation is falling down, people arround me are dying, or any worst thing to be happen, still i have faith on God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's Faith for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but then, that's just for me, even if i share so much thing with this for you, if you don't have your own. you cannot understand what  i am talking about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, in summary my friend, you are responsible for your life. your pastor or priest or imam or friend or even i cannot do anything for your life except for one thing, to help or guide you understand who you are to Him, to God. but as what i had said, be PERSONAL on your spiritual life on GOD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheer up, God loves you my friend. See you in Heaven. </p>

              <p>First of all I don't understand why christians believe everything in the bible. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Bible has been changed many times and definitely different from earlier versions.</p>
              <p>2. The ORIGINAL scriptures have never been found so it's impossible to know if modern bibles has the same content as what the disciples of jesus read 2000 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So no one can be sure if the modern bibles are what the disciples read 2000 years ago. Just read the bible with a pinch of salt.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>From the starter of this thread,</p>
              <p>to all who commented (good or bad)</p>
              <p>i don't push you to believe on God (the creator of the universe
              and fortunately, the creator of your life). i just let you know,
              it's up to you to believe on  Him or not. I believe, that
              believing on God is not based by anything else but by yourself
              alone with the grace of God of course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About religion, let me say something on that. True Christians
              should understand that religion is not a savior and not all the way
              to the savior.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing that i observe by what most ministers and so called
              priests and pastors (but i'm not against them, instead praying for
              them for a change) really make profit out of thier founded
              denomination and other religious organization. Truly God blesses
              the cheerful giver but let not be the blessing be for
              greediness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>many ministers, pastors, priests and others, put up religious
              organization and defining WHO GOD IS?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you know, i for one, cannot understand what they are talking
              about, about God until, I, alone, searching who am i to God?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me give you this example. Religious people are defining God
              as a big ocean. How? they define Him as kind, generous God, loving
              God, and so on. but do you think you understand them all?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOu know, we as persons are compared to a glass, and if God is
              like an ocean which religious filling in to us as (glasses). we can
              never accomodate the ocean. there, we can never understand God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right, God is really big. bigger than any problem or any other
              name (Read your Bible, as i had told you, better if you search
              alone. it means you're sincere.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now what should we do? or what should i do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>simple, as a glass, emmerse yourself, myself in the ocean and
              you will really understand your/my God, our God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>where you are in, there you will understand the place. but you
              and i cannot understand the place if it is just and imagination.
              because God is more than imagination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another point that i want to reestablish here is what does faith
              means?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's upon you to define what is faith in your life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but let me share your what faith means to me, it really changes
              a lot of me and that's why i never give up with this even no matter
              what happen. because this is my own belonging that is gift from
              God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faith is believing for what eyes cannot perceive. that's all.
              that's how i define. but deep inside me, it is so meaningful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if i cannot see my God, i still have faith on Him. even if
              others are mocking me, laughing at me, or will kill me, never shall
              i surrender because Faith is believing for what eyes cannot
              perceive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if my prayers are not yet answered, still i believe that it
              is in progress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if my sorrounding is falling apart, or my nation is falling
              down, people arround me are dying, or any worst thing to be happen,
              still i have faith on God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's Faith for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but then, that's just for me, even if i share so much thing with
              this for you, if you don't have your own. you cannot understand
              what  i am talking about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, in summary my friend, you are responsible for your life.
              your pastor or priest or imam or friend or even i cannot do
              anything for your life except for one thing, to help or guide you
              understand who you are to Him, to God. but as what i had said, be
              PERSONAL on your spiritual life on GOD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheer up, God loves you my friend. See you in Heaven. </p>

              <p>2. The ORIGINAL scriptures have never been found so it's impossible to know if modern bibles has the same content as what the disciples of jesus read 2000 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So no one can be sure if the modern bibles are what the disciples read 2000 years ago. Just read the bible with a pinch of salt.</p>

              <p>religion is an opiate, by karl marx is very true. I once saw a documentary, discovery channel years ago in India, a temple where they worshipped a rat god omg. so many rats in the temple running and eating freely. the resident monk of the temple there, even shared his food with the rats and then ate it afterwards yuck. the disgusting part was, the rats urine, devotees treated it as some holy water from the rat god omfg <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>

              <p>Yes you are right we do not know if there's a being beyond our universe BUT we can conclude that present religious texts are NOT enough to establish the existence of Gods. THAT IS IF you study the religious texts carefully and question critically. :)</p>

              <p>the reply to your question is simple and straightforward.</p>
              <p>If god exists, it would be in science journals, magazines, textbooks already, as facts, evidences and concurred by scientists.</p>

              <p>First of all, God’s origin or location are outside our capacity for knowledge &amp; 
              comprehension. Similarly our understanding of eternity can only be 
              grasped in metaphors, whether a banquet on the one hand or a smouldering
               rubbish dump on the other.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you hinge so much on the texts. Now I am not a theologian nor a philosopher. Are you ? Have you spent years, decades or centuries on it ?</p>
              <p>Besides that fact, enlighten me. Are you saying that all theories are infallible ?</p>
              <p>How different are you from us in including your own fundamental 
              assumptions about the universe, is it not also a blind leap of faith, unsupported 
              by evidence?</p>
              <p>If everyone needs to be a specialist in thier field to comment on a subject matter, what qualifications then do you have to comment on this subject matter ?</p>
              <p>I posing these questions because I do not expect an answer from you. They are open questions for you to consider. IF you are certain, even more certain than the scientists, great thinkers, theologians and the likes. Feel free to. And I really dont expect a 500 word thread on it.</p>
