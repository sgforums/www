              <p>First of all, God’s origin or location are outside our capacity
              for knowledge &amp; comprehension. Similarly our understanding of
              eternity can only be grasped in metaphors, whether a banquet on the
              one hand or a smouldering rubbish dump on the other.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you hinge so much on the texts. Now I am not a
              theologian nor a philosopher. Are you ? Have you spent years,
              decades or centuries on it ?</p>
              <p>Besides that fact, enlighten me. Are you saying that all
              theories are infallible ?</p>
              <p>How different are you from us in including your own fundamental
              assumptions about the universe, is it not also a blind leap of
              faith, unsupported by evidence?</p>
              <p>If everyone needs to be a specialist in thier field to comment
              on a subject matter, what qualifications then do you have to
              comment on this subject matter ?</p>
              <p>I posing these questions because I do not expect an answer from
              you. They are open questions for you to consider. IF you are
              certain, even more certain than the scientists, great thinkers,
              theologians and the likes. Feel free to. And I really dont expect a
              500 word thread on it.</p>

              <p>1. You have agreed with me that it is not possible to detect or know where the God(s) are because right now. Let me bring you further why we can't know where they are or how they come about - Because there isn't any empirical evidence to support the existence of these entities. Because no one has seen/talked/touched/heard the Gods literally.</p>
              <p>2. You used the word "eternity" like it's a proven fact. It's not. What is eternity? Is it a fact or just a concept?</p>
              <p>3. Yes I have studied (though not MANY years) hindu, taoist, christian and buddhist texts. NOT ALL OF IT, but parts of these religious texts. But I have studied the christian and muslim texts extensively and have concluded (like many others) that these Gods are most likely not possible.</p>
              <p>4. I don't take leaps of faith to believe in things or entities that don't have a shred of evidence. I believe in facts and evidence. That's all.</p>

              <p>if I am a god, I will straight away make everyone in this cosmos including me disappear, de-exist, cos if you do not exists, you do not suffer isnt it. if you do not exists, there is no problem.</p>

              <p>First of all, since when can concept cannot be fact ? So what is eternity ? Does it matter if I know what eternity is to me if you don't believe in eternity ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, you claim to have studied hindu, taost, christian and buddhist text. So tell me. What is the message you have gathered from all these sacred texts? I sure as hell do not see an enlightened mind here. What happened to the supposedly learned traits of such a person ? I dont see it. Do you ?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, so you believe in facts and evidence. Fair enough. If you are the kind that can only believe in the tangible, then you should not believe that Love exists then right ? Where is the factual basis of such a 'concept' then ? mmmmmm ?</p>

              <p>Did I ever say that 'God works in mysterious ways ?' Show me a post that I actually said that. Show it.  Where ? I am gathering your posts and I am slowly seeing a picture here. And its not very flattering to yourself eventhough U want to appear to be non-condencending.</p>
              <p>So you want me to authenticate a Miracle. Is that it ? Does it matter if I authenticate somehting to someone who does not believe in miracles ? You have already claimed in your previous post that you can only blieve factual tangible things.</p>
              <p>So you must think that  a miracle is nothing more than a natural law not discovered.At the very least yes ?  So, you don't believe in miracles. You think everything can be explained 
              scientifically.  I don’t see how raising someone from the dead, restoring a blind man’s sight, etc. are natural laws not yet discovered.</p>
              <p>Now I am not a theologian. I stress that again. Mircales according to the Christian faith to my current understanding is that it follows the usual steps of observation, interpretation and 
              application, but since the miracles are stories, we will need to look at
               things like plot, character development, etc. to understand them fully.</p>
              <p>We need to study the events of the miracle (observation), determine what
               truths it teaches (interpretation) and then determine how the truths 
              apply to us (application).</p>
              <p>Some Christians have dont a good job convincing you. So why are u here ? Does it look like an enlightened mind here trying to seek answers? Or are you just someone who just got beef with people of faith, especially Christianity and is pretty much an intolerant discriminatory person.</p>
              <p>But really, does it matter ? You don't believe. But what are u doing here ? For someone who does not believe in some divine entity seems to be spending alot of time in here. Why ?You can say you are here to seek answers but are you really ? Really ?REALLY ?</p>

              <p>So everytime we question you seomthing about your religion that doesn't "make sense", you would just say "god is beyond our comprehension" or "god works in mysterious ways".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore now I am telling you try to authenticate the miracles in the bible practically. To prove that the miralces did happen and were real. Some christians have tried to convince me bfore and they did a good job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How about you? Thanks.:)</p>

              <p>First of all, since when can concept cannot be fact ? So what is eternity ? Does it matter if I know what eternity is to me if you don't believe in eternity ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, you claim to have studied hindu, taost, christian and buddhist text. So tell me. What is the message you have gathered from all these sacred texts? I sure as hell do not see an enlightened mind here. What happened to the supposedly learned traits of such a person ? I dont see it. Do you ?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, so you believe in facts and evidence. Fair enough. If you are the kind that can only believe in the tangible, then you should not believe that Love exists then right ? Where is the factual basis of such a 'concept' then ? mmmmmm ?</p>

              <p>your argument doesnt stand you in good stead really. does he represent for all non believers? do you want to take into account of the many xtians who left, cos they dun believe it any more., what about that?</p>
              <p>as for me, I can see clearly as day and night, too many inconsistencies and paradoxes in the belief system and I am not well verse in the bible. goodness me if I am well verse and I can even spot more of the inconsistencies and paradoxes even more. anyway I know the origination of religions, how and why it got started, than you who are hopelessly ignorant and still think you know it more?</p>
