              <p>1. Sorry I THOUGHT god was real, until i saw all the absurdities in the book. You defend the religion very poorly honestly. When you said the earth is 6000 years old based on the bible's chronologies, you already shut out christianity to all smart people. WHen you say the earth is 6000 years old, know that Many christians WILL NOT agree with you too.</p>
              <p>2. We are against the idea of christians pushing their religion as fact, not because we are angry with a god or a fairy.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. What do you mean by absurdities in the Bible? Anything that does not sit well with the naturalistic mindset you hold to? Perhaps I am a lousy defender of the faith, so be it. But it seems that you are not even able to hold your cup against a lousy defender of the faith. Again, smart people can also be wrong and believe the wrong things. Being smart does not mean you are right. I will only defend what the Bible clearly teaches. I do not see a need to dilute it or deny it just to make it palatable to "smart" people.</p>
              <p>2. What do you mean by Christians pushing their religion as fact? Define "pushing". BTW, you have no issue with people pushing their view that evolution (molecules changing to man over billions of years which were never observed by any man) is fact?</p>

              <p>laurence,</p>
              <p>The Bible warns about pride, so thank you very much, but I already know this. I am only asking you, since you warn about personal pride, whether atheists are guilty of that when they portray themselves as Brights or more rational than people who have religious beliefs. I note that you have steered away from answering this.</p>

              <p>I beg to differ. I think from what's going on in forums like these, it is more true that Christians are the easiest to pick on, because those who bash the Christian faith know they wouldn't get hit back, since they know Christians are somehow supposed to be so loving and docile and always turning the other cheek, ya? And of course if the Christian does demolish their objections they can always play the guilt trip and ask "Oh where's the love? So critical and so judgemental one!"</p>

              Tcmc,
              
              You claim that atheism is not a religion is because you have little idea what atheism entails. No honest atheist would dare say that he knows God does not exists. Instead he says he believe there is no God. Even the courts in the US have judged it to be a religion.
              
              And the patronising remark about appreciating religion is just to make yourself look good. Why are you fearful to declare that as an atheist you consign all religions to falsehood and delusions?

              <p>Die die a self righteous man will argue till the cock crows the next morning.  Self righteousness is a sin as stated in the bible so is arrogance.   The guy you are talking to has both.      If christians were to live with others with the love of God there will be more converting to christianity.     Sigh!    </p>
              <p>Christians can have good knowledge of the bible but if some of these refuse to show people God's love it is futile.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Tcmc, You claim that atheism is not a religion is because you
              have little idea what atheism entails. No honest atheist would dare
              say that he knows God does not exists. Instead he says he believe
              there is no God. Even the courts in the US have judged it to be a
              religion. And the patronising remark about appreciating religion is
              just to make yourself look good. Why are you fearful to declare
              that as an atheist you consign all religions to falsehood and
              delusions?</p>

              <p>By the proper definition of religion atheism certainly qualifies to be called such. See <a href="http://creation.com/atheism-a-religion">http://creation.com/atheism-a-religion</a></p>
              <p>Atheism is not a lack of religion, it is a DELIBERATE rejection of all religions. Please don't try to sanitise atheism and make it so innocent sounding, as if you cannot help it. And please don't try to force your warped logic on me about equating football with atheism. An atheist, while rejecting God, also believe in many things and make many metaphysical claims about reality that are equally religious.</p>
              <p>You don't lack belief in God, you REJECT God. Know the difference. To lack something is a deficiency, and hmmm.....perhaps that's true! To be without God is to be deficient. I think somewhere the Bible says that eternity is placed in our hearts. If God does not become part of our lives then we are not living as we ought to.</p>

              <p>2. Which part of "A federal court of appeals ruled yesterday Wisconsin prison officials violated an inmate's rights because they did not treat atheism as a religion. Atheism is [the inmate's] religion, and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said." do you not understand?</p>

              <p><br>3. Thanks for admitting that you are consciously REJECTING the idea of God/gods altogether. That's what atheism means, and that's what I am saying!</p>

              <p>That's true. </p>
              <p>Actually just for all of your information -</p>
              <p>1. Atheists do not have a set of laws or doctrine like religious people but what's common among us is we do not believe in the existence of any gods due to lack of evidence.</p>
              <p>2. Atheists do not hate any gods. Some atheists reject religion totally while some like me can appreciate the non-supernatural elements of religions.</p>
