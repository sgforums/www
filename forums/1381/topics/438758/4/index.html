              <p>If you have not heard of Anthony Flew or grappled with his reasons for rejecting atheism, then you are really ignorant. Please take the time to read up more about why atheism should be rejected. Yes, many Christians have left the faith, but do you know the reasons why?</p>
              <p>You admitted that you are not well versed in the Bible, so what makes you think that those inconsistencies and paradoxes were correctly seen as such? You presume too much and are only basing your rejection of Christianity on an ill-informed or ignorant basis. Is that your way of reasoning? That does not seem to put you in good stead.</p>

              <p>Many Christians leave the faith because they THOUGHT they saw errors and inconsistencies in the Bible. One thing sorely lacking in today's church is the need to equip believers with the ability to defend the faith. Were you taught to defend the faith with good reasons? Be honest about it.
