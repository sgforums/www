              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Love is the essence of Christianity.  Without love of God, it is as good as they are without the presence of God in their life.    Showing God's love is more important than trying so hard to win an argument.    If you find you cannot win the other party over what the church teaches is pray for the person.   </p>
