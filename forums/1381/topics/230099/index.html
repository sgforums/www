Is any man able perfectly to keep the commandments of God?<br>A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No mere man since the fall is able in this life perfectly to keep the commandments of God, but doth daily break them in thought, word and deed.</strong></span><br><br>I think this answer Brey's previous posts.<br></blockquote>When Jesus came to earth as a man, he gave up all his powers.  All the miracles he performed was not with his own power, but God's.  This is to show that it is possible for everyone to keep the commandments of God perfectly in heart and deed.  Actually due to Jesus' sacrifice it is now even easier to keep God's commandments perfectly as we can seek forgiveness directly from Jesus without having to go through the ritual of sacrificing burnt offerings.<br><br>Before Jesus, there was Enoch and Elijah.  They could do it, so can we.<br><br>To clarify what keeping God commandments perfectly means...<br><br>1.  Love God<br>2.  Love your neighbour<br><br>Everytime we sin we must seek God for forgiveness to absolve our sins.  Once our sins have been absolved we are 100% holy until we sin again.  However this does not mean we can sin with impunity.  To prove our sincerity we must try to sin less and less each time God forgives us until eventually we sin no more.  This is because God only forgives those who truly wish to repent.<br><br>The thing to note is that once a sin has been absolved by God it is forever forgiven.  You may remember it, but God will not bring it up anymore.<br></div>

It cannot be the same for everyone because we live under different circumstances.<br><br>For the Jews, the requirements are higher. It is the price to pay for being God's chosen people. However they are spiritually closer to God, that's why some gentiles want to convert to Judaism - to get closer to God. But conversion is not encouraged and rabbis will try to dissuade you.</div>
