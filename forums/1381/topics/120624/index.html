            <div class='col-md body'><br>http://www.letusreason.org/Wf22.htm<br>http://www.deceptioninthechurch.com/kcopeland.html<br><br>Dear all,<br><br>Some of you might have heard of an upcoming conference by Rev.<br>Benny Hinn. He's gonna be in town to give a Healing Conference.<br>I have big concerns about this man. I've not been feeling<br>peaceful about his coming to town since I heard he's coming and<br>many people are going to attend. I went online to research<br>about this guy. Please read the following and pray and ask God<br>to grant us a discernment and for God to reveal to us the truth<br>and discern lies! Please pray that Jesus be enthroned and His<br>truth be preserved and not distorted!<br><br>Love,Winnie Joy<br>PS: FOrgive me if I'm wrong, don't just listen to what I say.<br>Find out and research for the truth and expose lies.<br><br>Heresies Of The Word-Faith Movement<br>http://home.computer.net/~cya/cy00052.html<br>These examples and many, many others can be demonstrated from<br>the materials produced by the Word-Faith teachers.<br>The deification of man. In Faith theology man was created as an<br>exact duplicate of God, including size and shape.<br>Â• Kenneth Hagin asserts, "ManÂ…was created on terms of equality<br>with God, and he could stand in GodÂ’s presence without any<br>consciousness of inferiorityÂ…God has made us as much like<br>Himself as possibleÂ…He made us the same class of being that He<br>is HimselfÂ…Man lived in the realm of God. He lived on terms<br>equal with GodÂ…The believer is called ChristÂ…ThatÂ’s who we are;<br>weÂ’re Christ!" (Kenneth M. Hagin, Zoe: The God-Kind of Life<br>(Tulsa, OK: Kenneth Hagin Ministries, Inc., 1989), 35-36, 41.<br>Â• Kenneth Copeland declares that "GodÂ’s reason for creating<br>Adam was His desire to reproduce HimselfÂ…He was not a little<br>like God. He was not almost like God. He was not subordinate to<br>God even." (Kenneth Copeland, Following the Faith of Abraham I<br>(Fort Worth, TX: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, 1989), tape<br>#01-3001, side 1.<br><br>Faith teachers are polytheists.<br>Â• TBN president Paul Crouch put it, "I am a little god!<br>Critics, be gone!" (Paul Crouch, Praise the Lord program on TBN<br>(July 7, 1986).<br>Â• According to Benny Hinn, "Adam was a super being when God<br>created him. I donÂ’t know whether people know this, but he was<br>the first Superman that really ever lived. First of all, the<br>Scriptures declare clearly that he had dominion over the fowls<br>of the air, the fish of the seaÂ—which menas he used to fly. Of<br>course, how can he have dominion over the birds and not be able<br>to do what they do? The word "dominion" in the Hebrew clearly<br>declares that if you have dominion over a subject, that you do<br>everything that subject does. In other words, that subject, if<br>it does someting you cannot do, you donÂ’t have dominion over<br>it. IÂ’ll prove it further. Adam not only flew, he flew to<br>space. He wasÂ—with one thought he would be on the moon." (Benny<br>Hinn, Praise the Lord program on TBN (December 26, 1991).<br>The demotion of God. The Faith movement not only deifies man<br>but also demotes God to the beck and call of His creation.<br><br>Says Benny Hinn, "I could almost visibly see the Lord, and I<br>could tell you what He was wearing." Jan Crouch, giddy about<br>HinnÂ’s statement, asks, "Was that the Holy Spirit?"<br>Acknowledging that he may get in trouble, Hinn resolutely<br>answers "yes." (Benny Hinn and Jan Crouch, Praise the Lord<br>program on TBN (October 3, 1991).<br>Â• Hinn made the following statement, "Man, I feel revelation<br>knowledge already coming on me here. Life your hands. Something<br>new is going to happen here today. I felt it just as I waled<br>down here. Holy Spirit, take over in the name of JesusÂ…God the<br>Father, ladies and gentlemen, is a person; and He is a triune<br>being by Himself separate from the Son and the Holy Ghost. Say,<br>what did you say? Hear it, hear it, hear it. See, God the<br>Father is a person, God the Son is aperson, God the Holy Ghost<br>is a person. But each one of them is a triune being by Himself.<br>If I can shock youÂ—and maybe I shouldÂ—thereÂ’s nine of them.<br>Huh, what did you say? Let me explain: God the Father, ladies<br>and gentlemen, is a person with his own personal spirit, with<br>his own personal soul, and his own personal spirit-body. You<br>say, Huh, I never heard that. Well you think youÂ’re in this<br>church to hear things youÂ’ve heard for the last 50 years?"<br>(Benny Hinn, Benny Hinn program on TBN (October 3, 1991).<br>Â• Two years after his initial "revelation," Hinn once again<br>voiced virtually the same statement. As he puts it, "God the<br>Father, God the Son, and God the Holy GhostÂ—three separate<br>individuals, one in essence, one in workÂ—and, may I add, each<br>one of them possess His own spirit-body. You donÂ’t like it?"<br>(Benny Hinn, Praise the Lord program on TBN (October 23, 1992).<br>The deification of Satan. Satan is deified as the God this<br>world and is positioned with so much power that he could manage<br>to "turn the light off in God."<br>Â• Benny Hinn said, "God came from heaven, became a man, made<br>man into little gods, went back to heaven as a man. He faces<br>the Father as a man. I face devils as the son of God..Quit your<br>nonsense! What else are you? If you say, I am, youÂ’re saying<br>IÂ’m a part of Him, right? Is he God? Are you His offspring? Are<br>you His children? You canÂ’t be human! You canÂ’t! You canÂ’t! God<br>didnÂ’t give birth to fleshÂ…You said, "Well, thatÂ’s heresy." No,<br>thatÂ’s your crazy brain saying that." (Benny Hinn, Our Position<br>in Christ #2Â—The Word Made Flesh (Orlando: Orlando Christian<br>Center, 1991), videotape #255.<br>The demotion of Christ. The Faith movement compromises the<br>deity of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Â• Benny Hinn writes, "And let me add this: Had the Holy Spirit<br>not been with Jesus, He would have sinned. ThatÂ’s right, it was<br>the Holy Spirit that was the power that kept Him pure. He was<br>not only sent from heaven, but He was called the Son of ManÂ—and<br>as such He was capable of sinningÂ…Without the Holy Ghost, Jesus<br>would have never have made itÂ…Can you imagine Christ headed for<br>the grave, knowing He would remain there forever, if the Holy<br>Ghost would change His mind about raising Him from the dead?"<br>(Benny Hinn, Good Morning, Holy Spirit (Nashville: Thomas<br>Nelson, 1990), 135-36.<br><br>Atonement Atrocities:<br>Recreation on the cross. On the cross, Jesus was recreated from<br>divine to demonic, taking on the very nature of Satan.<br>Â• Benny Hinn claimed that the Holy Ghost personally told him:<br>"Ladies and gentlemen, the serpent is a symbol of Satan. Jesus<br>Christ knew the only way He would stop Satan is by becoming one<br>in nature with him. You say, Â‘What did you say? What blasphemy<br>is this?Â’ No, you hear this! He did not take my sin; He became<br>my sin. Sin is the nature of hell. Sin is what made SatanÂ…It<br>was sin that made Satan. Jesus said, "IÂ’ll be sin! IÂ’ll go to<br>the lowest place! IÂ’ll go to the origin of it! I wonÂ’t just<br>take part in it, IÂ’ll be the totality of it!" When Jesus became<br>sin, sir, He took it from A to Z and said, "No more!" Think<br>about this: He became flesh, that flesh might become like Him.<br>He became death, so dying man can live. He became sin, so<br>sinners can be righteous in Him. He became one with the nature<br>of Satan, so all those who had the nature of Satan can partake<br>of the nature of God." (Benny Hinn, Benny Hinn program on TBN<br>(December 15, 1990).<br>Let take a moment to retrace our steps. We began this section<br>with Jesus hanging on a cross, where, according to Faith<br>theology, He was recreated from a divine to a demonic being. At<br>this point the Trinity was destroyed and the deity of Christ<br>utterly demolished. According to the Faith teachers, the Lord<br>JesusÂ’ passion on the cross proved insufficient to redeem<br>humankind, an so He had to be trapped and hauled down to the<br>very pit of hell by Satan. It is there, while Jesus is tortured<br>and tormented by a smiling Satan and a host of cackling demons,<br>that we pick up the story.<br>JesusÂ’ Rebirth in hell.<br>Â• Benny Hinn, too, received some "revelation knowledge" on the<br>"rebirth" of Christ in hell: "My, you know, whoosh! The Holy<br>Ghost is just showing me some stuff. IÂ’m getting dizzy! IÂ’m<br>telling you the truthÂ—itÂ’s, itÂ’s just heavy right now on<br>meÂ…HeÂ’s [referring to Jesus] in the underworld now. God isnÂ’t<br>there, the Holy Ghost isnÂ’t there, and the Bible says He was<br>begotten. Do you know what the word begotten means? It means<br>reborn. Do you want another shocker? Have you been begotten? So<br>was He. DonÂ’t let anyone deceive you. Jesus was reborn. You<br>say, Â‘What are you talking about?Â’Â…He was reborn. He had to be<br>rebornÂ…If He was not reborn, I could not be reborn, I would<br>never be reborn. How can I face Jesus and say, "Jesus, You went<br>through everything IÂ’ve gone through, except the new birth?"<br>(Benny Hinn, Our Position Â‘In Christ,Â’ Part 1 (Orlando, FL:<br>Orlando Christian Center, 1991), videotape #TV-254.</div>
