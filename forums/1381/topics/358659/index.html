              <p>Hi kager82, Thanks very much for your invitation to study bible together with me, a non-christian.  In my faith, we study the bible (The 5 books of Moses), line by line, page by page, from the first page to the last page. This cycle is repeated every year.  We dun believe in blind faith, every word in the bible must be studied. </p>
              <p>I will give u an example:</p>
              <p><em>"I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; </em><em>because Abraham obeyed Me and kept <span style="color: #0000ff;">My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws.</span>" </em><em>So Isaac lived in Gerar</em>.  Genesis 26:4-6 NASB</p>
              <p>Do u know what are the charge, commandments, statues and laws which Hashem gave to Abraham?.  In this instance, G-d spoke to Issac that his father, Abraham kept Hashem charge, commandments, statues &amp; laws.  I will give u a clue.  The law of Moses was given by Hashem in the year 2448 after creation, while Issac was born in the year 2048 after creation. Issac died in the year 2228 after creation.  Perhaps u may also like to ask your pastor in your church if they know the answer.</p>

              <p>Hi kager82; the Laws of G-d, is a concept that Christian churches did not fully understood for 2000 years. U have been conditioned to believe that the Laws of G-d kills and that no one is justified by Law.  Let me give an example from the NT.</p>
              <p><em>For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world <span style="color: #0000ff;">was not through the Law</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">but through the righteousness of faith</span></em>. Romans 4:13 NASB</p>
              <p>Romans 4:13 in the NT was written by St. Paul.</p>
              <p>Now contrast what St Paul said in the NT with what G-d himself said in the Torah.</p>
              <p><em>"I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;</em> <em>because Abraham obeyed Me and kept <span style="color: #0000ff;">My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws.</span>"</em> <em>So Isaac lived in Gerar</em>.  Genesis 26:4-6 NASB</p>
              <p>Moreover, without the Oral Torah, the Written Torah (Written Bible) cannot be fully understood.  U will need the Oral Torah to explain the Written Torah.  Let me give an illustration to show the relationship between the Oral and Written Torah. </p>
              <p>Imagine a body; the Written Torah will be the skeletal framework and the Oral Torah the flesh and various organs of the same body.</p>

              <p>Hi kager82; If really want to study Bible/Torah; however there is caveat;  When u really understand Bible/Torah;  U will surely be faced with the same dilemma which the Children of Isreal faced during their first passover in Egypt in the year 2448 after creation.</p>

              <p>just a note: if the motive here is to have bible study, the motive is to build the believers up spiritually. not to compare different practices which turns into a debate rather than a study of God's word.</p>
              <p>also, if you include non believers, it will become a sharing, rather than a bible study. so i think it's better to be clear cut in this area, because debates won't help a believer to grow, it may instead be self defeating</p>
              <p>you should hv a facilitator who is well grounded in the word of God to help out</p>

              <p>just a note: if the motive here is to have bible study, the motive is to build the believers up spiritually. not to compare different practices which turns into a debate rather than a study of God's word.</p>
              <p>also, if you include non believers, it will become a sharing, rather than a bible study. so i think it's better to be clear cut in this area, because debates won't help a believer to grow, it may instead be self defeating</p>
              <p>you should hv a facilitator who is well grounded in the word of God to help out</p>

              <p>From experience, the people who are well grounded in the word of G-d are the Jewish Rabbis.</p>
              <p>btw dumbdumb, do u know what is the dilemma faced by the children of Isreal during the first passover in Egypt?.  U may wish to ask your pastor this question, if he is well grounded in the word of G-d he will know the answer. </p>
