              <p><br> Couple sentenced to 8 weeks jail for distributing seditious
              publications<br> By Teo Xuanwei, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 10 June 2009 1847
              hrs<br>      <br>        <br>       <img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20090610/front-cqchurch11.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="281"><br> <br> SINGAPORE : A couple, found guilty last month of distributing
              seditious or objectionable publications, has been sentenced to 8
              weeks jail each.<br> <br> 50-year-old SingTel technical officer Ong Kian Cheong and his
              46-year-old wife, UBS associate director Dorothy Chan Hien Leng,
              had been found guilty on four charges each of sedition.<br> <br> For two decades, the couple spread their faith by handing out
              religious pamphlets, and then by dropping tracts into random HDB
              letterboxes.<br> <br> From around 1998, however, the couple, both Protestant Christians,
              mailed them to addresses picked out from the telephone directory -
              those of Muslims included.<br> <br> They "clearly did so with the intent of convincing the Muslim
              reader to convert to Christianity", a district court found.<br> <br> For distributing and possessing seditious and objectionable
              publications, husband and wife were sentenced to eight weeks' jail
              each on Wednesday.<br> <br> Such "intolerance, insensitivity and ignorance of delicate issues
              concerning race and religion" in Singapore "clearly warranted" a
              custodial sentence, said District Judge Roy Neighbour.<br> <br> In the first full trial heard under the Sedition Act, the married
              couple of 24 years was found guilty on May 28 of the charges.<br> <br> In 2007, Mr Irwan Ariffin, 32, and Madam Farhati Ahmad, 36,
              received an evangelistic comic-style booklet titled The Little
              Bride through the mail while Mr Isa Raffee, 35, was sent Who Is
              Allah?.<br> <br> After a complaint to the police, an ambush was laid and the pair
              was arrested on Jan 30 last year.<br> <br> Found in their condominium in Bukit Timah were 439 copies of 11
              seditious tracts.<br> <br> During the 11-day trial, it emerged that the SingTel technical
              officer and his wife, sent out about 20,000 publications in seven
              years.<br> <br> Produced by an American firm called Chick Publications, the
              fundamentalist Protestant materials were "not only offensive for
              religious content but also have a tendency to promote feelings of
              ill-will or hostility between Muslims and Christians in Singapore",
              said Judge Neighbour.<br> <br> By distributing tracts with "callous, denigratory, offensive and
              insensitive statements on religion with aspersions on race", the
              pair had committed "serious" offences that "have the capacity to
              undermine and erode the delicate fabric of racial and religious
              harmony in Singapore".<br> <br> Common sense, he said, dictated that religious fervor to spread the
              faith, "in our society, must be constrained by sensitivity,
              tolerance and mutual respect for another's faith and religious
              beliefs".<br> <br> Ong and Chan were expressionless when sentenced.<br> <br> Their lawyer Selva K Naidu told the court that they had filed a
              notice of appeal against the conviction last Friday. He was
              awaiting instructions to proceed.<br> <br> The pair faced two charges of distributing seditious publications
              each, and one each of distributing an objectionable publication and
              possession of seditious tracts.<br> <br> They got four weeks' jail for each charge - two of them running
              consecutively and the remaining to run concurrently.<br> <br> They could have been fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed for up to
              three years for each of the two charges.<br> <br> The possession charge carries a maximum fine of $2,000 and/or jail
              for up to 18 months. Distributing objectionable publications is
              punishable with a fine not exceeding $5,000 and/or up to one year
              behind bars. - CNA /ls</p>

              <p><br>I prefer the public to have the right of expressing its indignation against being proselytize to without permission.<em> </em>Hanging, drawing and quartering seems to be a rather apt punishment for such street evangelists. As for further appeals, the street evangelists can take it straight up to their god instead of wasting the time of the earthly courts.</p>

              <p>I say it was done with the hard work of law, government and the
              public, as in the case of AWARE and this case</p>
              <p>As Singaporeans are no longer able to stand the abuses by
              certain religious group, they are more proactive in voicing their
              concerns or holding awareness events</p>
              <p>Even a church has to take down its anti homosexual banners
              hanging outside after pressure from the public</p>
              <p>I would say its a sign of maturing society</p>

              <p>the world has always been following the low standards society since thousands of years ago. and no it is not maturing, its standards are getting lowing and worse. news are showing more "bad news" than good ones.</p>
              <p>as i say in another topic, everybody always do things they like regardless of what others 'likes'. as shown in this couple evangelists. there are always the right way to do things and the wrong way.</p>
              <p>the world follows their stardards. christians, as in the good faithful ones, follow God's holy standards. which is really high. like committing adultery is not crime. but it is a sin. but the high stardard is whoever looks at a woman and lust after her has already commited adultery with her in his heart. this is an example. we do what God likes.</p>
              <p>well your destiny, your choice is all in your hands. i respect your choice and as said in another topic. debates like this including mine must end as it gets no where. do you know why two people argue? because both believe both are right. and finally this forum is not for debates and religious arguments. peace.</p>

              <p>Normally, there wouldn't be a problem with any religious reversion or conversion during the jail stint. It happens all the time, for whatever various personal reasons. Basic religious rights are retained in jail and religious groups provides materials or activities for prison mates to get voluntarily involved with.<br><br>What is probably implied here is how a pedo convict expectedly associates himself with Muhammad who had a 9 year old wife.</p>
