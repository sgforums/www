              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>once again you christians have not failed to amuse me with your
              ignorance again.all you can do is lie..</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">People used to
              have very short life-spans in Arabia.   They used to live
              between 40 to 60 years maximum.  So it was only normal and
              natural for girls to be married off at ages 9 or 10 or similar.if
              you study history you will also know that 1400 years ago people
              reached puberty and matured much faster.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Marriage for young girls was
              widely practiced among Arabs back then, and even today in many
              third-world non-Muslim and Muslim countries</span></p>
              <p>Aisha was already engaged to <span style="color: #0000ff;">a non
              Muslim man named Jober Ibn Al-Moteam Ibn Oday</span>.  Back
              then, the people of Mecca did not object to Aisha's engagement to
              Jober because she was physically big enough and tall enough to be
              considered for marriage.  Her parents saw that and they
              engaged her to Jober.The only reason why Aisha's father, Abu Baker
              Al Siddeek, broke her engagement with Jober is because he was a
              non-Muslim.</p>
              <p>Not even the Pagans of Mecca, nor the Jews and Christians of
              Medina ever objected to it or used it as a point against Islam as
              anti-Islamic do today.</p>
              <p>Firstly - if indeed the marriage of Lady Aisha was something
              which was despicable even at that time and in that culture, this
              fact would never have been recorded for posterity and all efforts
              to conceal or cloud it would have been undertaken.<br> <br> But the fact that this hadith had reached us after it was recorded
              centuries ago and to all the Muslim generations in between proved
              that the marriage was culturally and morally acceptable and the
              fact is also that the Muslim community at that time remained
              unshakened in its faith in his Prophethood and the message which he
              had brought bear testimony to this assertion.<br> <br> Secondly - we have to look at the life of Lady Aisha
              afterwards.  She was without doubt one of the foremost
              scholars of Islam. It is even said that she had attained in her
              lifetime the position of Mufti - someone capable of giving
              religious rulings - a position very few Muslims will ever
              occupy.<br> <br> She was seeked by many, both men and women, who hungered for
              knowledge and they came to her from all directions, Yemen, Bahrain,
              Syria. History does not know of any woman who was approached by so
              many for such a noble purpose.<br> <br> If indeed she had became a victim of sexual abuse she would in most
              probability be devastated emotionally, psychologically, mentally
              and perhaps even physically but the achievements she had made in
              her life after the death of the Prophet proved that she was a woman
              who was in complete control of her faculties, becoming one of the
              intellectual giants of Islam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">According to the Priest of Saint
              Mary's Catholic Church:</span> <span style="color: #008000;">"Mary
              was approximately 14 years old when she got pregnant with
              Jesus.  Joseph, Mary's Husband is believed to be around
              36.  Mary was only 13 when she married Joseph.  When she
              first was arranged with Joseph she was between 7 to 9 years
              old."</span></p>
              <p>According to the <strong>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oxford Dictionary
              Bible</span>"</strong> commentary, Mary (peace be upon her) was was
              12 years old when she became impregnated.</p>
              <p>And where did you get the thing that apostates must be killed in
              islam?the quran clearly states that   "Let there be no
              compulsion in religion"<span><span>[Sûrah
              al-Baqarah: 256]</span></span></p>
              <p>When you want to eat do you go to the pet store to buy food?no u
              dont you go the market or foodcourt.Christians keep lying about
              islam, creating fake websites fake videos of lies that are so
              easily exposed. why? because when people are feeling insecure about
              something they always spread lies to try to mislead people about
              it.</p>
              <p>Do they not consider (ponder over) the Quran (with care)? Had it
              been from other than God, they would surely have found therein
              discrepancies”. (4:82)</p>
              <p>Many people have tried to find "contradictions" or "errors" in
              the quran but their lies have been exposed and refuted so
              easily.</p>
              <p>God has also challenged humanity to produce a sura that can be
              confused for the real sura of the holy quran. But for 1400 years
              mankind has not been able to do so and they will never be able to
              do so.</p>
              <p>Hmmm..have you found any REAL PROOF that any Muslim leaders were
              paedophilles?NONE..There are no muslim leaders that are
              paedophillies.</p>
              <p>i suggest u learn about islam from REAL RELEVANT MUSLIM sources
              and see the 2 links below.</p>

              <p>Sahih Bukhari Vol 8:73"151 :</p>
              <p>Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the
              Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's
              Apostle used to enter they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet
              would call them to join and play with me. (<strong>The playing with the
              dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at
              that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty</strong>.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13)</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Now in regards to the various
              hadiths ([1][2][3][4]) that anti-Islamic apologists have employed in an
              attempt to prove that 'Aishah - <em>radi Allahu 'anha -</em> was still a young girl who was playing with dolls at the time of her marriage. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Well unfortunately for them, they've jumped to some hasty conclusions since none of these hadiths</span></strong> ([1][2][3][4]) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">explicitly indicate whether the marriage had been consummated at this time</span></strong>.
              Rather, one could just as easily conclude - that the incidents in which 'Aishah - <em>radi Allahu 'anha - </em>was
              playing with dolls along with her young friends occurred at a time when
              she was still living with her parents (i.e. after the betrothal and
              prior to the consummation). Actually, based on the fact that the
              Prophet - <em>salla Allahu 'alayhi wa salam - </em>was known to regularly visit 'Aishah's father Abu Bakr - <em>radi Allahu 'anhu</em>, these events could have taken place anytime during 'Aishah's childhood - <em>radi Allahu 'anha</em>.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Bukhari 52:260</strong> <em>-"...The Prophet said, 'If
                                      somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.' "</em></p>
              <p><strong>Bukhari 83:37 -</strong> <em>"Allah's Apostle never
                                      killed anyone except in one of the following three situations: (1)
                                      A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed (in Qisas,) (2) a
                                      married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a
                                      man who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and
                                      became an apostate."</em></p>
              <p><strong>Bukhari 89:271 -</strong> A man who embraces Islam, then
                                      reverts to Judaism is to be killed according to <em>"the verdict of
                                      Allah and his apostle</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="background-color: #ffff53;">First, this hadith 
              is considered a weak hadith</span></span></strong> with just a single isnad (this 
              means there is only one chain of transmission or narration) and thus according 
              to the rules of Islamic jurisprudence, it is not enough to validate the death 
              penalty.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="background-color: #ffff53;">Second, this hadith 
              is also considered a general</span></span> </strong>('amm) hadith in that it is in 
              need of specification (takhsis); for it would otherwise convey a meaning that is 
              not within its purpose. The obvious reading of the hadith would, for example, 
              make liable the death punishment on a Hindu or Christian who converts to Islam. 
              This is obviously not the intention of the hadith. According to the rules of 
              Islamic jurisprudence, when a text is interpreted once, it becomes open to 
              further interpretation and specification. Therefore, many scholars interpret 
              this hadith to apply only to cases of high treason (hirabah), which means 
              declaring war against Islam, the Prophet, or God or the legitimate leadership of 
              the ummah.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #ffff53;"> Third, and most importantly,</span></span> there is no evidence to show that 
              Prophet Muhammad saw or his Companions ever compelled anyone to embrace Islam, 
              nor did they sentence anyone to death solely for renunciation of the faith.</p>
              <p>Based on these three reasons and the Qur'anic principle of freedom of 
              religion, prominent ulama (scholars) from the seventh to the twentieth centuries 
              have come out with the position that there can be no death penalty for apostasy. 
              According to Professor Hashim Kamali in his award-winning book, Freedom of 
              Expression in Islam, two leading jurists of the generation succeeding the 
              Companions, Ibrahim al-Naka'I and Sufyan al-Thawri, both held that the apostate 
              should be re-invited to Islam, but should never be condemned to death. The 
              renowned Hanafi jurist, Shams al-Din al-Sarakhsi wrote that even though 
              renunciation of faith is the greatest of offences, it is a matter between man 
              and his Creator, and its punishment is postponed to the Day of Judgement. The 
              Maliki jurist Abul Walid al-Baji and the renowned Hanbali jurist Ibn Taymiyyah 
              have both held that apostasy is a sin which carries no hadd punishment.</p>
              <p>In modern times, the celebrated Sheikh of al-Azhar University, the late 
              Mahmud Shaltut who was esteemed for his vast knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence 
              and Qur'anic interpretation, wrote that many ulama are in agreement that hudud 
              cannot be established by a solitary hadith and that unbelief by itself does not 
              call for the death penalty. The current Sheikh of al-Azhar, who was Egypt's 
              former Grand Mufti, Dr Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, also declared that apostasy is 
              not a capital crime.</p>
              <p>Many scholars, including Ibn Taymiyyah, Shaltut and Tantawi, said that the 
              death penalty was not meant to apply to a simple change of faith, but to hirabah, 
              that is, when apostasy is accompanied by rebellion against the community and its 
              legitimate leadership.</p>

              you wont make yourself look stupid right?</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Now in regards to
              the various hadiths ([1][2][3][4]) that anti-Islamic apologists
              have employed in an attempt to prove that 'Aishah - <em>radi Allahu
              'anha -</em> was still a young girl who was playing with dolls
              at the time of her marriage. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Well unfortunately for them, they've
              jumped to some hasty conclusions since none of these
              hadiths</span></strong> ([1][2][3][4]) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">explicitly indicate whether the
              marriage had been consummated at this time</span></strong>. Rather,
              one could just as easily conclude - that the incidents in which
              'Aishah - <em>radi Allahu 'anha -</em> was playing with dolls along
              with her young friends occurred at a time when she was still living
              with her parents (i.e. after the betrothal and prior to the
              consummation). Actually, based on the fact that the Prophet -
              <em>salla Allahu 'alayhi wa salam -</em> was known to regularly
              visit 'Aishah's father Abu Bakr - <em>radi Allahu 'anhu</em>, these
              events could have taken place anytime during 'Aishah's childhood -
              <em>radi Allahu 'anha</em>.</span></p>

              meaning that is not within its purpose. The obvious reading of the
              hadith would, for example, make liable the death punishment on a
              Hindu or Christian who converts to Islam. This is obviously not the
              intention of the hadith. According to the rules of Islamic
              jurisprudence, when a text is interpreted once, it becomes open to
              further interpretation and specification. Therefore, many scholars
              interpret this hadith to apply only to cases of high treason
              (hirabah), which means declaring war against Islam, the Prophet, or
              God or the legitimate leadership of the ummah.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #ffff53;">Third, and most
              importantly,</span></span> there is no evidence to show that
              Prophet Muhammad saw or his Companions ever compelled anyone to
              embrace Islam, nor did they sentence anyone to death solely for
              renunciation of the faith.</p>
              <p>Based on these three reasons and the Qur'anic principle of
              freedom of religion, prominent ulama (scholars) from the seventh to
              the twentieth centuries have come out with the position that there
              can be no death penalty for apostasy. According to Professor Hashim
              Kamali in his award-winning book, Freedom of Expression in Islam,
              two leading jurists of the generation succeeding the Companions,
              Ibrahim al-Naka'I and Sufyan al-Thawri, both held that the apostate
              should be re-invited to Islam, but should never be condemned to
              death. The renowned Hanafi jurist, Shams al-Din al-Sarakhsi wrote
              that even though renunciation of faith is the greatest of offences,
              it is a matter between man and his Creator, and its punishment is
              postponed to the Day of Judgement. The Maliki jurist Abul Walid
              al-Baji and the renowned Hanbali jurist Ibn Taymiyyah have both
              held that apostasy is a sin which carries no hadd punishment.</p>
              <p>In modern times, the celebrated Sheikh of al-Azhar University,
              the late Mahmud Shaltut who was esteemed for his vast knowledge of
              Islamic jurisprudence and Qur'anic interpretation, wrote that many
              ulama are in agreement that hudud cannot be established by a
              solitary hadith and that unbelief by itself does not call for the
              death penalty. The current Sheikh of al-Azhar, who was Egypt's
              former Grand Mufti, Dr Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, also declared that
              apostasy is not a capital crime.</p>
              <p>Many scholars, including Ibn Taymiyyah, Shaltut and Tantawi,
              said that the death penalty was not meant to apply to a simple
              change of faith, but to hirabah, that is, when apostasy is
              accompanied by rebellion against the community and its legitimate
              leadership.</p>

                  with her young friends occurred at a time when she was still living
                  with her parents (i.e. after the betrothal and prior to the
                  consummation). Actually, based on the fact that the Prophet -
                  <em>salla Allahu 'alayhi wa salam -</em> was known to regularly
                  visit 'Aishah's father Abu Bakr - <em>radi Allahu 'anhu</em>, these

              urself over and over again when i have already explained the same
              things to u in my previous posts and in the links posted.</p>

              <p>What rubbish! Christians and Jews have never called their god Allah!</p>
              <p>What do you know about the word Abdullah?</p>
              <p>Let 's agree that  'La Ilaha Ila Allah' means 'no other
                                      God than God Allah'.</p>

              <p>In Arabic, god is ilah. I have to repeat so that it gets into
              your head.</p>
              <p>Christians never call their Christian god by the name of Allah.
              Perhaps the muslim arabs do.</p>
              <p>Don't try to convince people that muslims worship the same
              god.</p>
              <p>Christians do not worship the same god as the muslims since
              muslims don't believe in trinity.</p>
              <p>Allah the moon god already existed long before islam was
              invented. You know what the name Abdullah means, don't you?</p>
              <p>Abdullah means the servant of Allah!</p>

              <p>Muslims do not believe in the super 3-in-1 god.</p>
              <p>There is one basic similarity but many differences between Christian/Jewish God and Allah.</p>
              <p>The basic similarity is that all claim that there's only one god.</p>
