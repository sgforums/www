              <p>the world has always been following the low standards society
              since thousands of years ago. and no it is not maturing, its
              standards are getting lowing and worse. news are showing more "bad
              news" than good ones.</p>
              <p>as i say in another topic, everybody always do things they like
              regardless of what others 'likes'. as shown in this couple
              evangelists. there are always the right way to do things and the
              wrong way.</p>
              <p>the world follows their stardards. christians, as in the good
              faithful ones, follow God's holy standards. which is really high.
              like committing adultery is not crime. but it is a sin. but the
              high stardard is whoever looks at a woman and lust after her has
              already commited adultery with her in his heart. this is an
              example. we do what God likes.</p>
              <p>well your destiny, your choice is all in your hands. i respect
              your choice and as said in another topic. debates like this
              including mine must end as it gets no where. do you know why two
              people argue? because both believe both are right. and finally this
              forum is not for debates and religious arguments. peace.</p>

              <p>i would disagree, mainly, what are the low standards you are talking about, and against whose standards are you measuring? isnt the proactiveness against religious fanatism a good thing?</p>
              <p>i also disagree that a discussion never get ending because both believe both are right...you present me something, get the basic facts and logic right first</p>
              <p>i dont know why recently a lot of people present a lot of cock and bull stories even before we discuss whether the points are right</p>

              <p>Normally, there wouldn't be a problem with any religious

              <p>well these are the standards of the world, meaning "it is OK to do it as long as i like it and it's not against the country's law."</p>
              <p>homosexuality.. some countries already allow same-sex marriages. many celebrity declaring to the world that they are homosexual. people around the world including the youths are watching. "since they can do it, why can't we?"</p>
              <p>pornography, strip clubs, adult video rental store etc etc. thousands of new porn clips are being uploaded daily. well it is a billion dollar "business". "i can watch it if i am at the legal age". "it's OK. it's just  entertainment." secret sins like masturbation. " well the health experts says it's healthy to do so." " every guys i know are doing it, it's alright i don't hurt nobody." "nobody's gonna know anyway."</p>
              <p>drunkeness. "body is mine, i'll do whatever i like!"</p>
              <p>divorce. " what oath? i don't love you anymore!"</p>
              <p>blasphemy. well lots of hollywood movie uses it. it is an everyday word. so let us "OMG". every little thing "JESUS!" "OH FOR CHRIST SAKE"...</p>
              <p>i say these are low standards because i know of God's holy standards that im measuring to. faithful christians who are following Him daily knows of it, we live to please God. for we once were in the world too and knows the patterns of the world and worldly people.</p>
              <p>these are examples, i am just stating since you want to know. whether you agree anot, please let us not debate because it's obviously off topic lol.</p>

              <p>You want to defend your religion. That's understandable. So are the many people in this forum!</p>
              <p>So, it's that complex  that scholars can't have the same view? The number 9 in arabic can mean any number other than 9?</p>
              <p>If having sex with  a 9 year old child bride was acceptable to the prophet, how about  having sex with one -year old baby?</p>

              <p>The thing is, quite a few respected Islamic scholars (especially
              M.M. Ali) have questioned the veracity of that particular hadith,
              noting that the criteria used by Imam Bukhari to justify its
              strength was somewhat lacking. They also used used other sources
              (e.g. actual historical events and Aisha's purported age during
              those events) to conclude that she may have been around 19 when the
              marriage took place.</p>

              <p>Here's another proof that nine means 9, not 19:</p>
              <p><strong>Sunan Nasai Bk of Marriage, No 3256:</strong><br> <strong>A'ishah </strong>said: The Apostle of Allah peace be upon him married me 
                            when I was six and had sexual intercourse with me when I was nine 
                            and I was playing with dolls.</p>

              <p>Whatever he quoted isn't even in the Quran, and Sunan Al-Nasai's book of hadith is considered even less strong than Sahih Bukhari.</p>
              <p>And it's not lost on me that he chose to ignore the next part of what I said about taking things in context, and about the different methods other scholars used.</p>
