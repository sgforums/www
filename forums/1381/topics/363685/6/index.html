              <p>Besides in ancient times, if you identify a group as non believers you are then able to dehumanise them and feel they do not deserve the same rights and respect as you would to a fellow believer.</p>

              <p>once again you christians have not failed to amuse me with your ignorance again.all you can do is lie..</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">People
              used to have very short life-spans in Arabia.   They used to
              live between 40 to 60 years maximum.  So it was only normal
              and natural for girls to be married off at ages 9 or 10 or similar.if
              you study history you will also know that 1400 years ago people reached
              puberty and matured much faster.<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Marriage
              for young girls was widely practiced among Arabs back then, and even
              today in many third-world non-Muslim and Muslim countries</span></p>
              <p>Aisha was already engaged to <span style="color: #0000ff;">a non Muslim man
              named Jober Ibn Al-Moteam Ibn Oday</span>.  Back then,
              the people of Mecca did not
              object to Aisha's engagement to Jober because she was physically big
              enough and tall
              enough to be considered for marriage.  Her parents saw that
              and they engaged her to
              Jober.The only reason why Aisha's father, Abu Baker Al Siddeek,
              broke her engagement with
              Jober is because he was a non-Muslim.</p>
              <p>Not even the Pagans of Mecca, nor the Jews and Christians of
              Medina ever
              objected to it or used it as a point against Islam as anti-Islamic do
              today.</p>
              <p>Firstly - if indeed the marriage of Lady Aisha was something
              which was despicable
              even at that time and in that culture, this fact would never have been
              recorded for
              posterity and all efforts to conceal or cloud it would have been
              undertaken. <br> <br> But the fact that this hadith had reached us after it was recorded
              centuries ago and to
              all the Muslim generations in between proved that the marriage was
              culturally and morally
              acceptable and the fact is also that the Muslim community at that time
              remained unshakened
              in its faith in his Prophethood and the message which he had brought
              bear testimony to
              this assertion. <br> <br> Secondly - we have to look at the life of Lady Aisha
              afterwards.  She was without
              doubt one of the foremost scholars of Islam. It is even said that she
              had attained in her
              lifetime the position of Mufti - someone capable of giving religious
              rulings - a position
              very few Muslims will ever occupy. <br> <br> She was seeked by many, both men and women, who hungered for knowledge
              and they came to
              her from all directions, Yemen, Bahrain, Syria. History does not know
              of any woman who was
              approached by so many for such a noble purpose. <br> <br> If indeed she had became a victim of sexual abuse she would in most
              probability be
              devastated emotionally, psychologically, mentally and perhaps even
              physically but the
              achievements she had made in her life after the death of the Prophet
              proved that she was a
              woman who was in complete control of her faculties, becoming one of the
              intellectual
              giants of Islam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">According to the Priest of Saint
              Mary's Catholic Church:</span> <span style="color: #008000;">"Mary
              was approximately 14 years old when she got pregnant with
              Jesus.  Joseph, Mary's Husband is believed to be around
              36.  Mary was only 13
              when she married Joseph.  When she first was arranged with
              Joseph she was between 7
              to 9 years old."</span></p>
              <p>According to the <strong>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oxford Dictionary
              Bible</span>"</strong> commentary, Mary (peace be upon her) was was 12 years old when she
              became impregnated.</p>
              <p>And where did you get the thing that apostates must be killed in islam?the quran clearly states that   "Let there be no compulsion in religion"<span class="quran"><span class="quran">[Sûrah al-Baqarah: 256]</span></span></p>
              <p>When you want to eat do you go to the pet store to buy food?no u dont you go the market or foodcourt.Christians keep lying about islam, creating fake websites fake videos of lies that are so easily exposed. why? because when people are feeling insecure about something they always spread lies to try to mislead people about it.</p>
              <p>Do they not consider (ponder over) the Quran (with care)? Had it been
              from other than God, they would surely have found therein
              discrepancies”. (4:82)</p>
              <p>Many people have tried to find "contradictions" or "errors" in the quran but their lies have been exposed and refuted so easily.</p>
              <p>God has also challenged humanity to produce a sura that can be confused for the real sura of the holy quran. But for 1400 years mankind has not been able to do so and they will never be able to do so.</p>
              <p>Hmmm..have you found any REAL PROOF that any Muslim leaders were paedophilles?NONE..There are no muslim leaders that are paedophillies.</p>
              <p>i suggest u learn about islam from REAL RELEVANT MUSLIM sources and see the 2 links below.</p>

              <p>"Let there be no
              compulsion in religion" ???!!!</p>
              <p>Why quote a verse that's abrogated so long ago? I thought that this thread is dead until you brought it back to life and in the process embarrassed yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>Bukhari 52:260</strong><em> -"...The Prophet said, 'If somebody (a Muslim) discards 
              his religion, kill him.' " </em></p>
              <p><strong>Bukhari 83:37 - </strong><em>"Allah's Apostle never killed anyone except in one of 
              the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was 
              killed (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse 
              and (3) a man who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and 
              became an apostate."</em></p>
              <p><strong>Bukhari 89:271 - </strong>A man who embraces Islam, then reverts to Judaism is to 
              be killed according to <em>"the verdict of Allah and his apostle."</em></p>
