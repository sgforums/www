              <p>Hypocrisy at one of the church in singapore.People who go there
                      preach about seeking the righteousness of god before they god add
                      things to your lifes but people who go to church, preach one thing
                      but do another. There is one fren of mine kept telling me all this
                      things, at this time, he is still single, his ex gf left him, tell
                      me all kind of things of being good as singlehood. but when he
                      recently has a girlfriend, he started to ask what time i go to
                      church then he started to go other times other than the time when I
                      suspose to go church to avoid me seeing his gf. Thats why I said,

              <p>I agree with you regarding its all in the heart. Its all about sincerity too. We are not trying to degrade anybody here. But as i see nowadays, people are far more excited to go to church then anything else. And when they go to church, its not really learning more about the bible or religion although people claim that they love god and so on. They just want to hang around with their friends, chill out like normal sundays and so on. How do we really know if these people are really into religion? If we want to find out, we must get the church out of the picture. If these people are able to practice their love for god religiously WITHOUT going to church, then i guess they made it. Same goes for temples. Devotees only feel the prescene of their god/deities when they visit temple, which should not be the way. It should be in the heart, an internal thing rather than an external thing, you get what i mean?</p>
              <p>I consider true christians to live humble lives, have a gentle and compassionate nature and a forgiving attitude towards others. They can live without churches. And thats what i admire them most =)</p>

              <p>Yea I agree with wilsonhao though there's nothing wrong with enjoying being with friends at the Church.</p>
              <p>But Christians must realize that the Church is basically a congregation of people in faith. Not a building that could be destroyed. As long as there are people who truly believe in God the church still stands.</p>
              <p>One of the most obvious way is to see whether these people go to other source of perceived power<br> to ask for help I'm talking about shamans, paranormal, carrying idol and stuffs like that.</p>
              <p>Once I told a lady who sat next to me at the church that I had been helped with a prophecy from a pastor she said plainly to me: Do not be a fanatic.</p>
              <p>Err I think she was referring that there are other forces that we need to respect in this world, other supernatural forces. Wtf?</p>
              <p>I wasn't being fanatic I was being truthful....maybe I was being too frank.</p>
              <p>She looked like a witch if that was any indication <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">.</p>

              <p><br>Even if he asked about the time you attend church and eventually chose to attend a service at another timeslot, that does not mean he is avoiding you, right?  Perhaps he chose another timeslot because it suits both of them the best?</p>

              Hi thread-starter,
              
              to be honest there's not enough information for me to fully understand what's going on between you and your friend. Might be a misunderstanding somewhere.
              
              Besides, I don't think there's anything wrong in getting a gf in itself, somehow you give me the impression that you feel it was wrong of your friend or the pastor to get a gf within the church itself.
              
              Basically what I feel is I'm just getting bits and pieces of the full picture and is essentially just your raw emotion coming through. There's nothing wrong in being passionate, but being overly passionate is something else.
