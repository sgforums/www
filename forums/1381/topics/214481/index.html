            <div class='col-md body'>My heart goes out to the christians to write this... i must stress that this is Not a place for God vs no God, so basically this is for christian. If you are looking for that topic, there's another post somewhere, go there.I would like christians to tell and share about their testimonies here.<br><br>There's somethings we must establish. First, when a christian believe Jesus as the son of God and He died for us on the cross out of his love.. we will be made perect in love-- then we can love one another.(1 John 4:18 ) if you feel no love, look at Jesus and his finished work and remember his love.<br><br>Ask anything in his name, and he will do it(1 John 3:22). so will people in love ask things like, kill that brother for me ? no, you will ask for blessing so as to bless others.<br><br>1) why you ask God He must do? --- He honor his word.<br>2) How come I don't see it yet? --- He decide when to give you. He seems slow but on Time.<br><br>Let's go back to Genesis on story of Abram and sarai. name not change yet.<br>God promised abram be the father of nations and gave him a child. so sarai(her name means dominating) tried to help God(cannot wait), offer hagar - abram (probably scare of his wife) say ok. then later part, hagar got a son, sarai turned jealous. drove her away ,angry, fustrated and blame abram. God came to them again to confirm the promises(change their name) and she received and give birth to Issac. The whole family and those around are filled with laughter. ( i believe God Laught too.) happy family.Genesis 21:6<br><br>so this story, a picture of you and me, i believe we don't try to help God. He know the time and his ways are not our way(i don't care as long as it works). He will come back on the appointed time.<br><br>3) how about my suffering and during danger times?<br><br>many bible stories, people are delivered one way or another. but they are delivered when God was being called upon.<br><br>Bible says if your earthly father give good things to their children, How much more our Father in heaven...<br><br>Imagine your son got a nightmare, He call u "Father in next door, he who clothes me, feed me when i'm hungry, if it's by your will, do come to my room and helped thee. in father name." ( many a time the boat sink already before completing the prayer, those should be as thanks giving time)<br><br>No, he shout "Daddy help!", and you rushed to protect him! (Romans 8:15)<br><br>btw ever heard of a joke about a man in a sinking boat, prayed for help. then another boat, a helicopter, a speed boat came at different time asking to help. but he rejected them saying God will save me...so he died and asked God what happened. God replied, i send 3 people...<br><br>i believe in some truth about this joke...don't wait for God to zap from heaven.<br><br>there's many more but i really urge you all interested to find it in the bible. (When we got a new Mp3 player but don't understand the many functions , what we do? we read the manual)<br><br>So be filled with love as you will not be seeing me for very long time due to Work commitment. But God will never leave you nor forsake you. send in your testimonies and you may realise how good he was in your life.<br><br>p.s. david, you are talking about this forum being dead, keep it alife, i believe God will use you mightily like the david in the bible who started as a shepherd<br>boy (maybe this is the answer from God, i don't know). Icemoon, believe you can help him as i feel you have gift from God, ask Jesus to reveal to you. He will strengthern all of us. Glory to Jesus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, seems like there's no testimonies. probably i'll start 1. will be quite long and all glory goes to Jesus.<br><br>i was a christian since 1994. Introduced by friend to his church.First 4 years just play play and not serious. Join their youth adult class and family ministry in 1999. in yr 2000 My own family started having problem with my Dad and Mon breaking up. Many other things happened in my life. Seek for help but no result.<br><br>Ever heard of "it's God's will" answer to every question they cannot explain?<br>Bringing Job as a story that christian suffer in their life is acceptable? Ever heard of you must give up your "Issac" to show your faith? They say you must read the bible, how many chapter a day bla bla bla, do this do that... then God bless you? i tried and i was sick of it. I was troubled.<br><br>I finally given up at 2001. Enjoying a Godless life. Go disco and become drunk and join my army friends to do funny stuff outside.Play lan gaming all night long.  Life quite meaningless do it probably as a way to escape going home...Sometime think Is there a God, How come "innocent" people suffer here and there. Why God so cruel...<br><br>I despise my mdn who is a christian and she always host a christian cell gp in the office. i will always make fun of her with the other non-christian friends...behind her back. In 2002 i was cheated 5k by a army mate i trusted...i almost going depression at that time.<br><br>2004, i went back to church, purpose? to chase a girl that i like. she wanted a christian bf. so... .1 sunday, we both miss our morning church so we went into a new church which have later service. This church transformed me immedately? No cos the sermon is something i never heard before. i felt uncomfortable. Becos they say christian life is easy...( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> was it ?) i went for more services and became a happier person. thou my problem is still there. i redelicated my life to be come a christian again.<br><br>My pastor's preaching is Jesus centered, encourage us to ask anything from God as it was written in the bible. I tried and soon i break off from my disco habit ( i don't like to go anymore) and lan gaming. i soon found answers to my unanswered bible questions, some thu pastor's preaching some myself... and many thing fall into place? not really, i was slam with a 10k credit card debt and lawers letter is send by hand to my house... Diffcult to pay as my contract ended so have another job with lower income and have to support my mother and my house. i tried to ask my army mate to return me some money but no result ( he's driving a not bad car  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  ..). so i turned to Jesus..<br><br>2005 i'm down with sickness, and needed operation. i was afraid and ask Jesus to help me...when i went for pre operation check up, i was surprised the doctor said an operation won't be necessary anymore. i was overjoyed and couldn't believe it. He said 3 month of medication will solved the problem. until now i still have 2 month worth of medicine in my drawer.<br><br>Now, as i keep on in my pastor's teaching,i see more light to the bible, it make me just want to read the bible more. I believe my pastor have given me keys to unlock the confusing bible and many contriction seems to make sense.( still reading. just finished psalm.) ( My pastor always quote, faith comes thru hearing and hearing the word of God)<br><br>2006, My parents start to talk again. I'm happy and now i hope to share this joy, out of my overflow, to lift christians up and help people. I redelicated my life when i heard my pastor said, Jesus means saviour and he wants to save you. My 10k debt was paid off supernatually and i don't even know who. I believe God restore me double portion of loosing 5k.<br><br>I heard this elsewhere, if there's no God, when i die, i die, but if there's a God, when i die, i'm in trouble. And now i change, If you(unbeliever) are suffering and tried many method and no other way out , my suggestion to you is, call out Jesus as Lord and He will save you.<br><br>P.s If you want to Know more about Jesus feel free to PM me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>December.</strong> I was in Taiwan when i found that my basketball shoes, which i had worn for 2 months are getting somewhat heavy. Or was it that my legs were getting weak.<br>January. Start of school. Very happy. As i was in a moderate school, i acted like i was a gangster. Followed the crowd like i was blind, spiritually blind.<br><strong>February.</strong> i start to feel more weight on my running shoes(changed to running shoes as they were lighter) By mid February, i started to have falls on my way to school.. I prayed for this condition to disappear. No use.<br><strong>March.</strong> Very constant falls in school. It appears that all the muscles on my right leg was getting weaker. Now to demonstrate how scary it is to walk on the roads in fear of falling. Walk in your house right now, then try not to use any strength on your right leg. If it is done properly, you wld find that you r actually tilting towards the left while walking. Limping in other words. Now if the degrees of limp towards the left is too small, then i wld fall. cos the right leg was like useless to me. It can trip me. IF the right leg were to be 100% useless, I have to tilt 90o towards the left which will look rather funny. This condition really bothered me and I prayed everyday on my way to school that I wldnt fall. No use at all still.Ppl looked at me as if im a deformed guy.<br><strong>Late March.</strong> As the condition was getting worse, we consultated the doctor and scanned a MRI. There was a cyst on my extradural of the spine, compressing on the nerves causing weakness on my legs. An operation had to be done. We went to Mount Elizabeth, Doctor --- who specialized in neurosurgery. He said that the operation wld take ard 5 hrs and 6 hrs if some nails were to be put on my spine for support after the operation. Well, which simply means 6 hrs lah. That Sunday,a bone doctor for our church had a look at my MRI report knew about the cyst and recommended me to go to Taiwan ------ hospital as they have many cases on this. My father worried that I may not receive immediate medical attention if we are to go to Taiwan. Since the condition is getting more and more worse and the hospital was known for its disproval of surgery(need to queue for operation) That night my mother had a feeling from God that we shld go to Taiwan for treatment. We prayed. That day, we dashed to the hospital after we were out of the airport. The timing by God was so perfect, that the doctor demanded from the hospital for a emergency operation room to be scheduled early next morning., hearing the severity of the condition. The doctorÂ’s diagnosis was also that I donÂ’t need to put on nails after the operation for support as I had the ribs for the job. The operation went successfully. And, heres the important part: the operation was 10hrs!!! By GodÂ’s grace we didnÂ’t go for the SingaporeÂ’s doctor!! Also, to put on nails on my spine wld disrupt my body growth and have negative impacts. Thank God I didnÂ’t need to put on nails(imagine some heavy foreign objects in my body.)<br><br>Now the following days after the surgery were most painful, and it is also the MAIN point of the testimony. I know its long but pls bear with me. The opening on my body wass 15 cm and it really aches. And I mean really, the wound was so painful like a car on your head!! To add on to that, there was loss of neural or spinal liquid if you wld call it. This liquid is from the dural and covers the whole nervous system to the brain and also coats the brain. Now if this liquid were to be loss, due to the opening of the spine, there will not be enuf of those to coat the brain and a VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY big headache wld occur. Which did! I had to endure and endure. Painkillers everyday. Luckily, my parent were beside me to help me pass thru. You shld know when the headache comes(the painkiller had no use) my whole head was literally exploding. I could bang my head against the wall and feel nothing at all as the headache was more painful. I couldnÂ’t sit up too. So it is 24 hrs *7 days 180o on the bed. If I sat up my whole head wld spin and my eyes and neck had no strength to be straight.<br><br><strong>Testimony and personal opinions.:</strong>You may say this is suffering , well yes it is. BUT, thru this things and events, I learnt(ti3 hui4) a lot of things normal ppl wldnt know. I found out how fragile life is. And that suffering actually is existent for the purpose of good. I knew then how much my parents loved me.I found out that there is actually a purpose for all these. God taught me: To treasure life, as it is. To treasure even the ability to walk. To remember GodÂ’s grace. To be serious in religion. Not be act cool.<br>You know that my ward was in the neuron department. Where there are so many children having a worse condition then me. I have learnt also, to zhi1 zu2, be happy with wad I have, since there are other ppl who are living a worser life. My neighbouring ward was a children with heart problem. And another one who is only ard age 5 who has to endure as much pain as I have to.<br>It is also these events that had led me to come to this forum, and now posting this as a testimony to our fellow friends.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>David, Good to see that you have the courage to write about your testimony. God is with you.<br>Isaiah 53:5<br>But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>I believe this is a christian channel and Eternal hope is a place to bring hope to people if not should be called " Eternal hopelessness"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>of cos, some people find peace else where, no problem( bible never say we must force people to become christians.) i just share the gospel thru my life. 1 thing i must say about christian suffering, It's time to look to Jesus and his finished work. Feel his love, and receive Love, Peace and joy. Then you can worship him in spirit and in truth...The bless and healing will follow suit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>P.s. icemoon, you seems to know quite alot about the bible...would like to know how are you exposed to the word of God?<br><br></div>

Hmm .. I think it is not enough .. I must find out what God is really trying to tell us through the Bible. I have enough of the credo nonsense the Church gave us.<br><br>I think one reason why I am not a Christian is because I don't want to be obliged to defend the credo and the church. It is better to be labelled heretical (when your views diverged from others) when you are not a Christian than when you are.<br><br>When you embrace the credo, you tend not to question, because the credo is the Truth and any questioning is seen as shaking the foundation. I suspect many church leaders like your CGL don't like to be asked "funny questions". And I think the leaders we have today are pretty bad in their Scriptural understanding also. So when questions are not answered, they get swept under the carpet. This is bad for your spiritual health.<br><br>When you join a church, you are obliged to defend it. Many a times you defend your church without realizing why you are there for - you are there to worship the Lord and the church is only the facilitator. It is easy to let personal feelings cloud your judgement. If you have to leave the church, it will strain relationship also.<br><br>If the bible is for mankind, if the bible is inspired by the God who created mankind, then I feel every mortal should have the obligation to defend it. Defend not the credo or your denomination, but the 'sound of God' among the verses.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It may sound nonsense to you, but I think we should aim for a higher goal. When you aim high, you will ask yourself what God is trying to tell you through Christianity, instead of what Christianity can tell you about God.<br><br>PS: Apologize for the poor metaphor about the 'sound of God' .. I was reminded of how the sound of God was walking in the Garden of Eden. Well, if God is non corporeal .. how could He walk?  It must have meant something else ..</div>
