              <p>well, may be to you guys is a funny question but to me is a serious question. i have seen too many early deaths around me. i wish to have a longer life span and will choose a religion which tells me how to live longer.</p>
              <p>i believe between prosperity and longevity, many people will pray for longevity.</p>
              <p>anyway, one of my friend has just told me how to have a longer life span through religious mean. so moderator can close this thread as i have already got the answer.</p>

              <p>recently, one of my colleague passed away and left behind 2 kids who are 4 years and 2 years old. she converted to christian few years ago against her mother's wish. her mother was a taoist and uneducated. her reason was christianity does not teach longevity and leave everything to god's will.</p>

              <p>at her wake, her 2 young kids did not seem to know their mum had died, still playing catching happily and even went to their mum's coffin to say goodnight to her. this is really heart breaking. thus, i have been thinking of what the old lady said and wanted to find out whether religions teach about longevity. </p>

              <p>In old testament, longevity is promised to those who are obedient.</p>
              <p>In this age of grace, there is no such promise.</p>
              <p>But it is my unblibical opinion that true Christians do live longer.</p>
              <p>It is also my unblibical opinion that true Christian families have less tragic lives.</p>
              <p>Never convert just to live longer. If u do, u r a nominal chrisitan and are not saved. To truly convert means true repentence and believe in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ who makes a believer righteous before God.</p>
              <p>To convert for material reasons is a false conversion. Be careful. God is not mocked.</p>

              <p>Let me explain to you, it is simple really. The world we live, we have to get sick and get old. as a human being, there is every chance you will contract a serious deadly diseases like cancer and many others during your lifetime. this is unavoidable. this tells you how fragile our life is. besides being struck down by a diseases, there is every chance we might get involved in accidents or murdered by criminals. we may take for granted that we may live till old age, but who knows when the car your are travelling, or horrors of horrors, the plan you are taking crashed. what I can tell you is this, this is life.</p>

              bed. when we attended her wake, i heard from her siblings that her
              mother refused to attend her wake.</p>
              <p>her earlier remarks (before my colleague had cancer) strike
              me whether religion and life span is it co-related. afterall she is
              not educated (not that i look down on her), based on what she said
              that ( no statistics to show).</p>
              <p>at her wake, her 2 young kids did not seem to know their mum
              had died, still playing catching happily and
              even went to their mum's coffin to say goodnight to her.
              this is really heart breaking. thus, i have been thinking of
              what the old lady said and wanted to find out whether religions
              teach about longevity. </p>

              <p>I see. I believe a huge part comes from how you live. Your lifestyle. Anyway its really unpredictable. You might live to 100, and maybe gone tomorrow.</p>

              <p>i have a deeper thought for religion lately. i think religion should teach more about longevity and happiness in this life rather than concentrate too much on afterlife. if that religion can grant us to live happily and healthily, the followers will naturally believe what the religion says about the afterlife.</p>
              <p>if not, how to trust the religion can give me a good afterlife when it can't even give me a good life now. however, the religion can teach, it is still up to the person to practice.</p>
