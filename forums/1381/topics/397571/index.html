                  to Constantinople with the papal treasury. Church historian Gerbert called Benedict 'the most iniquitous
                  of all the monsters of ungodliness.' The pontiff was eventually slain by
                  a jealous husband. His corpse, bearing a hundred dagger wounds, was dragged
                  through the streets before being tossed into a cesspit.</span> </dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">According to Catholic historian

                  of age, were guilty of INCEST and sexual perversions of every sort, had
                  innumerable children, were murdered in the very act of adultery. In the old
                  Catholic phrase, why be holier than the Pope?"</span></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Alexander was followed by Julius II who purchased the
                  papacy with his own private fortune. He didn't even pretend to be a Christian.
                  A notorious womanizer who sired any number of bastards, Julius was so eaten
                  away with SYPHILIS that he couldn't even expose his foot to be kissed.</span> </dt><dt> </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> Pope Sixtus IV charged Roman brothels a Church tax.
                  According to historian Will Durant, in 1490 there were 6800 registered
                  prostitutes in Rome. Pius II declared that Rome was the only city run by
                  bastards (the sons of Popes and Cardinals).</span> </dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> Fr. Jay Mullin was accused of molesting a boy more than
                  20 years ago in Boston. Then Cardinal Bernard Law commanded Mullin to be
                  evaluated at St. Luke's Institute. The Institute is a Washington clinic
                  that was profiled in a Boston Globe article of February 24, 2002:</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"Mullin was flown south in 1992 to a clinic outside
                  Washington, D.C. The church-run clinic had a huge collection of child pornography
                  of varying degrees, which ranged from soft porn to hardcore S&amp;M images,
                  all featuring pre-teen boys and girls"</span> </dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> Devils in the Vatican would come as no surprise to Msgr.
                  Luigi Marinelli. His book Gone With the Wind at the Vatican fairly flew
                  off the shelves in Italy, revealing as it did stories of money-laundering
                  prelates, sex abuse and Satanic rituals performed within the walls of the
