For example, can Christians kill an enemy soldier to save his own life? Can you lie to a would-be murderer to save another's life?<br><br>The answer is pretty obvious. It <span style="font-style: italic;">seems</span> that we are allowed to commit a 'smaller' sin to achieve a 'greater good'. However, there is no such thing as a 'smaller' sin in Christianity. Deceit and murder both warrants the same punishment. Also, I said 'seems' because I am not too sure. The concept of 'Greater Good' may not even exist in the bible, or even the concept of choosing 'lesser of the two evils', though it certainly sounds reasonable to us.<br><br>I would like to know the biblical view of this (best is provide some verses) i.e. what is the main principle that can be used to answer such similar questions, when one is faced with two sinful acts and he has to choose one, and in the process break one of the commandments?</div></blockquote>it is wrong to lie, whether its for a good purpose or bad purpose. we should do wad god will do. so in a war, we shouldnt kill the enemy in gods view. but from the worldly view, we should kill them as a self defence. its up to u. i will kill the enemies.</div>
