            <div class='col-md body'>Well on killing...<br><br>If somebody, who you are unable to stop after trying everything thing, is about to cause grevious and prehaps fatal harm on an innocent... would you resort to killing or inaction?<br><br>I would kill that person to stop him, as it is my conviction that that would be the moral thing to do. Unless I recieve any strong supernatural conviction at that time to do otherwise I would not stay my hand and commit events to moral and common sense.<br><br>In many ways I suspect it can be often our moral duty to use to sword if we are policemen, soldiers or even people in the wrong place at the right time. I don't think or treat the killing as judgement, punishment or revenge, but as a very sad and unfortunate consquence of that person's behaviour.<br><br>Just as a person who chooses to drive a car into a wall might expect consquences, a person who threatens innocents deserves what is coming under moral law. In any case pacifism is often a justification for many evils to happen. We can say we choose not to rebel against a evil and murderous governent because we ought to listen to authority (as in the law), we can choose to do nothing and watch innocents getting harmed (because our law says we should not do any harm)<br><br>But I think we miss the entire point of what the law was there for in the first place. In the sense of killing and violence, I suspect it is not so much as a ban on the action, but on the intention of killing and wrath for selfish and egoistic purposes. The same goes for lying.<br><br>If the enemy wants to harm your nation, your loved ones, all that you hold right and true and dear. The obvious and right thing to do would be not to give him proper information and the means to do it!</div>
