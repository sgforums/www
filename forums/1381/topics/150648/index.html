            <div class='col-md body'>Yo, can you list down evidences of a cursed earth biblically? Let me start the ball-rolling:<br><br>1) So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, "Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.  (Genesis 3 :14)<br><br>=&gt; Today, snakes are the only creatures that crawl. No other creatures I can think of crawl (other than worms which is not a creature, right?). Some said that snake actually has legs but they are very small, not visible to the naked eyes. So I would think this is a reminder to us that snake used to have legs but God cursed it to crawl on its belly all its life.<br><br>From Marshcommentary:<br>God does not bother asking the serpent. He already knows that Satan is a liar. Instead, God pronounces judgment on the serpent. We do not know under exactly what circumstances Satan came to posses the serpent. Whatever it was, the serpent was responsible and suffered the consequence of losing its legs. Other than making the snake a visible oddity among land creatures, we do not know why losing the legs is related to the crime.<br>The modern snake uses its tongue to smell the air. Thus, we see it frequently sticking its tongue out. Undoubtedly, this causes the snake to ingest much dirt.<br><br>Notice that God mentions there is a curse on animals. People were to be stewards of the earth. Now that Adam and Eve had broken their relationship with God, their relationship with creation would also be broken. Later we see how the ground is cursed. Here, God does not detail the corruption of animals, but it seems pretty clear from today's modern animals that the symptoms include eating meat, violence, and poison.<br><br>2)  To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,' "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.  (Genesis 3:17-18 )<br><br>=&gt;  Work was intended to be enjoyable and fulfilling. Now it would include drudgery and difficulty.<br><br>Now we have to wrestle with noxious weeds. We would have to use special farming techniques to produce food to eat. Before the fall of man, there were no hurtful or poisonous plants, nor was there a scarcity of food. This curse is a dreadful prediction of what was to happen to him and his children. At this point God either created weeds or genetically manipulated His present creation to cause them to be harmful.<br><br>3)  ..... to be continued....<br><br>(Some commentaries taken from marshcommentary)</div>

So simple. after the end will be? Life after death? Recarnate? It is not just that we live our life without knowing why man exist, not to say earth and all the elements. They just don't pop up from air or whatever. Yes, chunyong, how good it is if life is just like that. We live and die and fullstop. Then we can don't have to worry what comes after next and can enjoy during the transition hor. We are born to anticipate death and what so meaningful about life is, since we die anyway, right? So people starts to find ways of making life meaningful hor. I get your point - an atheist point of view but is this the way? Maybe you will say live life without regret but.... aiya... I dunno what I'm writing. Just wake up. ha ha... I stop here. Anyone want to continue? Mayve next time I will continue lar. chunyong, to put it simply, there is no meaning in life if it is what you have described above. Is there any meaning for a newborn to anticipate death. Can you explain why? Atheist would simply just ignore and not think much about it, I guess.<br><br>Ok, gtg. bye.</div>
