You can see the slaining of spirit on video - no joke.[/b]</blockquote>Slaining is not new in the very strict sense of the word. It has been around since the 1980s in charismatic churches in Singapore. I myself have experienced this in one of these churches many years back. I went up like many others and as the Pastor laid his hand on me in the name of Jesus, I felt a tremendous force - not human effort - that overwhelmed me. Best part was - the Pastor's hand was not even touching me! His hand was just above my head and I fell backwards. But I knew tat was the work of the Holy Spirit, as I spoke in tongues in the name of Jesus (I was totally not in control) and I felt a deep sense of warmth and love from the Holy Spirit.....I claimed all these in the mighty name of Jesus, to make sure this was from God.<br><br>Slaining is the result of the Holy Spirit touching the individual, be it a situation of healing, counselling, blessing etc. It doesn't matter who is leading the church service - which pastor or whatever church - so long as the name of Jesus is glorified. Any slaining or tongues or any miracle that we see/experience, if it leads to the glory of God, then its from the Holy Spirit....not the pastor/leader/church.<br><br>Let's not limit God. He has His ways that can be beyond our human understanding. One example - which you will be surprised to find it in the bible:<br><br><strong>"God did extraordinary miracles thru Paul. Handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them</strong>" Acts 19:11,12<br><br>My point is - there are churches tat are charismatic, there are those who are not, there are churches tat appear to be more "modern and up to date"; there are those who prefer the conservative approach; there are churches tat prefer to stick to hymns, there are those have Hillsong worship or even rock worship; there are churches strong in the area of healing/tongues, there are churches who are better with the teaching of the Word or community service.......it doesn't matter.<br><br>So long as the Name of Jesus is glorified, so long as lives are changed for the better, so long as there are no deviation in our fundamental beliefs as stated in the bible, then its fine.<br><br>CHC and NCC are 2 of many good churches in Singapore.....and btw, i'm not from CHC.[/b]</div>
