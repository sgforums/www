              <p>Other religions quote that human are born kind. The Bible views it the other way round. Sinning is Human nature &amp; human are born to be sinners. But guilt causes human to sin even more when they give up on themselves to change for the better. This is no rocket science. Psychologically proven. You can ask the psychatrist.</p>
              <p>Guilt also causes the human body to stop self healing processes as well as a sub concious behavior to sabotage their own lives. That's why Christians preach that forgiveness of sins is the key to salvation. Salvation is not just only so called "a place in Heaven". It is much more. The inside out transformation of life.</p>

              <p>Is the forgiveness of sins the key to salvation according to the bible? Where is that found in the bible?</p>
              <p>You still have not answered my question, what is sin according to the bible? How does your creator, the G_d you worship define sin? There is no point talking about it unless you first have a clear understanding of what it is, and how Yahweh defines sin.</p>

              <p>Other religions quote that human are born kind. The Bible views
              it the other way round. Sinning is Human nature &amp; human are
              born to be sinners. But guilt causes human to sin even more when
              they give up on themselves to change for the better. This is no
              rocket science. Psychologically proven. You can ask the
              psychatrist.</p>
              <p>Guilt also causes the human body to stop self healing processes
              as well as a sub concious behavior to sabotage their own lives.
              That's why Christians preach that forgiveness of sins is the key to
              salvation. Salvation is not just only so called "a place in
              Heaven". It is much more. The inside out transformation of
              life.</p>

              <p>The psychiatrist won't say that humans are born sinners or anything, and there remains examples contrary to the point you raise. Guilt is only perceived when you feel that you've done something wrong, if a murderer feels that what he did was right, would he still feel guilty?</p>

              <p>I won't generalise but there is a tendency that if the murderer has the intention to change himself for the better, he will need that forgiveness &amp; acceptance to start all over again, to do even more good. Reminds me of the yellow ribbon project.</p>
              <p>Of course as for those who has no intention to change, we can forget about it. But what about those who wants to change themselves for the better but not given the chance? That is why ex convicts who are unaccepted in the society often goes back to their destructive lives &amp; certainly we don't need the Bible to explain the importance of Grace &amp; Forgiveness.</p>
              <p>An ex convict church member ever shared a testimony of a cellmate who accepted Christ upon his death sentence. At 1st he was scared of death. He could'nt sleep &amp; he kept having nightmares for the murder which he commited. But after his acceptance of the Lord he went to bed &amp; had a sound sleep on the eve of his execution.On the day of his execution, he smiled &amp; thanked this brother for taking care of him. He said that the Lord forgiven him of his murder &amp; he felt so good. His burden is gone. He also said that he is not afraid of death anymore &amp; he will soon go meet the Lord.</p>
              <p>This experience impacted this brother alot &amp; he also believed in Jesus. His attitude towards life changed. He managed to build a career despite of his criminal records &amp; he started a family as well. Although all these is normal for ordinary folks but for someone with criminal records, these are great achievements. This brother now often speaks at Christian seminars &amp; he often ministers to the inmates at the prisons, inspiring lives.</p>

              <p>Hence the instruction not to take of the tree of good and evil. It is not the same as your analogy of the gun and the baby.. the baby does not understand what is being said, Adam and Hava did understand that they were not to take of the tree of good and evil.. yet they disobeyed.</p>
