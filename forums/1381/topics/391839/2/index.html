              It is not the same as your analogy of the gun and the baby.. the
              baby does not understand what is being said, Adam and Hava did
              understand that they were not to take of the tree of good and

              <p>I won't generalise but there is a tendency that if the murderer
              has the intention to change himself for the better, he will need
              that forgiveness &amp; acceptance to start all over again, to do
              even more good. Reminds me of the yellow ribbon project.</p>
              <p>Of course as for those who has no intention to change, we can
              forget about it. But what about those who wants to change
              themselves for the better but not given the chance? That is why ex
              convicts who are unaccepted in the society often goes back to their
              destructive lives &amp; certainly we don't need the Bible to
              explain the importance of Grace &amp; Forgiveness.</p>
              <p>An ex convict church member ever shared a testimony of
              a cellmate who accepted Christ upon his death sentence. At 1st
              he was scared of death. He could'nt sleep &amp; he kept having
              nightmares for the murder which he commited. But after his
              acceptance of the Lord he went to bed &amp; had a sound sleep on
              the eve of his execution.On the day of his execution, he smiled
              &amp; thanked this brother for taking care of him. He
              said that the Lord forgiven him of his murder &amp; he felt so
              good. His burden is gone. He also said that he is not afraid
              of death anymore &amp; he will soon go meet the Lord.</p>
              <p>This experience impacted this brother alot &amp; he
              also believed in Jesus. His attitude towards life changed. He
              managed to build a career despite of his criminal records &amp; he
              started a family as well. Although all these is normal for
              ordinary folks but for someone with criminal records, these are
              great achievements. This brother now often speaks at Christian
              seminars &amp; he often ministers to the inmates at the prisons,
              inspiring lives.</p>
              <p>Amazing Grace How Great Thou Art That Saved A Wretch Like
              Me.</p>

              <p>I think that effect would be achieved with most religions, not restricted only to Christianity. It would not be a very strong example.</p>
