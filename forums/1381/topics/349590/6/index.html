              <p>There is still the freedom of individual to look into. The
              individual can choose to stand up against rape and slavery, just
              like some satanists can choose to sacrifice babies/animals against
              the laws today. The freedom of the individuals will be judged by
              the the freedom of the majority, though.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think rape and slavery is wrong. But that is only
              because I am brought up in present societies. I think if I am
              brought up in the past, I will side with the moral of the majority,
              thinking rape and slavery is not wrong.</p>
              <p>By the way, even the christians in the past do not think rape
              and slavery is wrong. There was an incident in the bible, where the
              Benjamites commited evil, and the other tribes went to war against
              the Benjamite tribe. They also wiped up the tribe of Benjamin.
              Lately, they relent their actions, and get the men in Benjamite to
              grab for themselves the girls in the tribe of Jabesh Gilead, and
              took them forcefully as wives. That is how the tribe of Benjamin
              survived, by taking themselves forcefully girls from Jabesh
              Gilead.(Judges 21 NIV)</p>
              <p>That is mass rape, condoned by the bible.</p>
              <p>In the old testament, slavery is actually condoned. Abraham had
              slaves, many slaves and yet God called him the father of faith.
              There are laws in the bible for slaves. (Exodus 21 NIV)</p>
              <p>That is slavery here, condoned by the bible.</p>
              <p>Yet, today, christians do not condone slavery nor mass rape.
              Therefore, there is no absolute right and wrong. Not even for the
              christians. The bible supports slavery in the past, but do not do
              so now. The bible condones mass rape in the past but do not do so
              now.</p>
              <p>Satanists definitely do not believe in absolute right and wrong.
              Right and wrong is the freedom of the individual to decide.</p>

              <p>There is still the freedom of individual to look into. The individual can choose to stand up against rape and slavery, just like some satanists can choose to sacrifice babies/animals against the laws today. The freedom of the individuals will be judged by the the freedom of the majority, though.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think rape and slavery is wrong. But that is only because I am brought up in present societies. I think if I am brought up in the past, I will side with the moral of the majority, thinking rape and slavery is not wrong.</p>
              <p>By the way, even the christians in the past do not think rape and slavery is wrong. There was an incident in the bible, where the Benjamites commited evil, and the other tribes went to war against the Benjamite tribe. They also wiped up the tribe of Benjamin. Lately, they relent their actions, and get the men in Benjamite to grab for themselves the girls in the tribe of Jabesh Gilead, and took them forcefully as wives. That is how the tribe of Benjamin survived, by taking themselves forcefully girls from Jabesh Gilead.(Judges 21 NIV)</p>
              <p>That is mass rape, condoned by the bible.</p>
              <p>In the old testament, slavery is actually condoned. Abraham had slaves, many slaves and yet God called him the father of faith. There are laws in the bible for slaves. (Exodus 21 NIV)</p>
              <p>That is slavery here, condoned by the bible.</p>
              <p>Yet, today, christians do not condone slavery nor mass rape. Therefore, there is no absolute right and wrong. Not even for the christians. The bible supports slavery in the past, but do not do so now. The bible condones mass rape in the past but do not do so now.</p>
              <p>Satanists definitely do not believe in absolute right and wrong. Right and wrong is the freedom of the individual to decide.</p>

              <p>Another take I have, imho, is this, when someone ask, is Jesus the Son of God, like.. as in.. how it is in the natural world, I'm the son of my dad etc. but for Jesus' case, it's abit more than that</p>
              <p>"son of", is also translated or interpreted to "in the order of", like.. part of the family of Israel, or Jacob for that matter. the order of priest, the order of prophets.. etc.</p>
              <p>meanwhile, this is the best answer i can come to understand and deliver. unless i have some divine revelation to understand. or when the event has come to past. =)</p>
