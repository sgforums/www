              <p>In the court of men there is something called a witness and his testimony is taken into account as a legitimate proof.</p>
              <p>I wasn't trying to prove God's existence I was merely testifying what I have witnessed and what I have experienced. And I claim no special holiness or ability than any normal person. I'm just a man.</p>
              <p>One doesn't even need to see God to be a witness of God but seeing the miracles that He performed can also be considered witnessing God or God's work.</p>

              <p>I didn't mean that testament about God be accepted as proof in the court of men but I was saying that when men testify about other man in the capacity of witness, their testament is accepted as a legitimate proof in the court of men.</p>
              <p>Testifying about God however requires on the part of the recipient to welcome it in faith until they themselves are the witness of God or God's awesome work. God has set it so that any relatonship with Him must be based first and foremost on faith. Of course when a Christian is true to themselves they will see a confirmation of their faith simply because God is the living God.</p>
              <p>God has hidden Himself from men and only with and in faith He would reveal anything to any given person. I've come to the conclusion that being a Christian is not an option and that rather being a Christian is a matter of being called and chosen. Many are called but few are chosen so it is said in the bible. Few are chosen because they do not heed their calling. A cosmetic Christian. So are you Christian in heart?</p>
              <p>Many things can go wrong in this world and they will at some time in time. Without God's confirming our faith most Christian will grow weak and die such that their faith become their mere physical obligations and mere rituals. How can you keep believing in God when things  around you going upside down? You can't but God can keep your faith by confirming it so that despite everything bad you can say I know God. He keep me intact. God is my shield against the arrow of the devil. That we smile when we think back what God has done to us.</p>
              <p>Don't emphasize that we do not need to see what we believe.</p>
              <p>We started by believing so that we might see.</p>
              <p>We end up by seeing what we believe.</p>
              <p>Because we believe not in myth or lies but in the living mighty God.</p>

              <p>Hi S.gal83, i am not a christian, so i would not be able to give u a christian explaination of scriptures.  i can only offer u a non-christian understanding of scriptures.  The book of Daniel consisted of many stories.  One of the story/incident is about Daniel's 3 friends and King Nebuchadnezzar.  Why did Hashem allows the 3 men be thrown into the furnace is explained at the end of the story about King Nebuchadnezzar.  These verses can clearly explain the reasons for the incident.</p>
              <p><em>Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and men of every language that live in all the earth: "May your peace abound! </em></p>
              <p><em>"<span style="color: #0000ff;">It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.</span> <br>        "How great are His signs<br>         And how mighty are His wonders!<br>         His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom<br>         And His dominion is from generation to generation. </em> Daniel 4:1-3 NASB</p>
              <p><em>"<span style="color: #0000ff;">Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven, for all His   works are true and His ways just</span>, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride."</em>  Daniel 4:37 NASB. </p>
              <p>The signs and wonders which Hashem uses the 3 men to perform is for the benefits of King Nebuchanezzar, that he acknowledge Hashem as G-d most high. It is not about the 3 men which Hashem uses to perform his signs and wonders.  Consider this verse:</p>
              <p><sup>        </sup><em>"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,<br>         <span style="color: #0000ff;">But He does according to His will in the host of heaven<br>         And among the inhabitants of earth;<br>         And no one can ward off His hand<br>         Or say to Him, 'What have You done?</span></em>'   Danie 4:35 NASB.</p>

              <p>God is great and if God were to put a challenge by calling out in the  kingdom of death to those who lived a life of insult to Him, His call to those who offended Him always goes unanswered. RISE YOURSELF UP!</p>
              <p>All remain in their slumber. Unable to do anyhting not knowing anything. They will not rise again. They have become nothing.</p>
              <p>And they thought they were going to live forever, they thought they were above all things. . .yet now they lie helpless unable to even lift a finger. Not knowing what has befallen them. Unable to overpower death that came to grip them for eternity. Until the end of time.</p>
              <p>They have forgotten their life and life has forgotten them. Even if the whole world worship them for eternity what good would that do to them now? Their proud accomplishment now is but a dust, useless and was all over too soon. Their life had been short and foolish they didn't realize that they were merely passing by in life. Merely passing by. They were only given one thing and that was time. Only a short amount of time.</p>
