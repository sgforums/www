              <p>I am sure you know the saying "freedom comes with
              responsibility". Often, man choice of freedom without the
              right measure of responsibility leads to disaster....</p>
              <p>I am not taking side here, seriously. But we have to
              see it as it is. Satan was out to tempt Eve - an ill intention was
              meant. Not a simple case of offerring of choices.</p>
              <p>I somehow see your point of views. But hey, but if their God is
              real, what better way for Him to test His believers, right?.</p>
              <p>Hmm I wonder how this feeds into your concept of
              Satanism....</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) Freedom does come with responsibility. And I think that we are all at an age that is capable of deciding how to use our freedom for ourselves. Satan gives freedom as a tool to all his believers. How we use freedom is out to ourselves. We cannot blame Satan for giving freedom to us when we choose to use our freedom to do the wrong things because it is our responsibilities as Satanist to use the freedom Satan give in a law-abiding way.</p>
              <p>2) Satan as a tempter of Eve is really the product of the christian bible. For the Satanist, at least for me(as there are many different versions of Satanism out there in the world), Satan does not tempt Eve, but offer Eve the ability to know good and evil. Satan advocates thinking for oneself, and thus, encourages Eve to think for herself. What is good and what is evil should be for Eve to decide and not God. Satan therefore gives the knowledge of good and evil to Eve, and therefore, also gives many other knowledge to Eve.</p>
              <p>3) I really think that if God is loving, he will not test his believers in the way he tests some of the early christians of the faith. In the case of Job, the poor man typically suffered so much as a result of his faith for God. No offense, but I find that Job's faith is rather blind. He trusted in God in spite of losing everything and being afficted with diease.</p>
              <p>Satan advocates that the life of oneself is greater than the life of any other people, as opposed to God, who adovocated that the belief of God is better than the holding on of one's life. While God encouraged believers to die for their faiths, Satan challenged His believers to treasure their lives over everything, including over their love for Satan. Therefore, in my worship of Satan, it is me that is central, and my life is more important than anything Satan had to give for me.</p>
              <p>4) Actually, I do believe God is real. I just do not believe he is good.</p>
              <p>P/S: Perhaps we need to start a new thread. Maybe a thread, titled, "Ask me about my satanic beliefs" as this thread is originally about whether you as a christian will die for your God or not, and not really about me, or about Satanism. I don't really want to go off-topic here.</p>

              <p>Not blaming a deity in that sense. But when man sins, ie do

              place similarly enforcing the same law-abiding
              criteria?</p>

              <p>Satan advocates freedom. He is not the judge and punisher of all who breaks the laws. Rather, he gives a person freedom and leaves the person to make use of the freedom in the way he or she deems fit. So, actually, there is no one to account for a man's wrongdoing, other than the man himself.</p>
              <p>However, since Satanism favors the self over others. In the interest of self, laws will be made to protect self. Killing is wrong because it can harm a person of his or her life. Therefore, in the interest of self, laws are set up to protect individuals. Satan does not judge or punish, he leaves the individuals to work up laws, rules etc for himself or herself in the name of self-interest and freedom.</p>
              <p>This is also why there are many sects of Satanism in the world. Satanists are free to believe what they want about Satan. They are also free to worship Satan in any way they want. For me, I believe in being law-abiding and since this is my belief, my worship of Satan also consists of being law-abiding. I believe that certain laws being set up will protect my self-interest and therefore, I am in support of the laws. That is my freedom-- freedom to use the laws to my advantage. Not all Satanists believe in the same manner. Some may choose in their freedom to be law-breakers. It makes no difference to Satan. He gives us the freedom. How we live using that freedom is our own responsibilities, not his.</p>
              <p>Hell, in my belief, is a place of freedom. It is similar to Earth. You are free to indulge in what you want, all you want, as you want, the way you want, unless you infringe on the rights of others. It is not that infringing on the rights of others is wrong, but rather, in the name of common self-interest, and for the sake of the freedom of the majority, laws are set up to govern the behaviours of an individual. Satan himself does not give laws, he gives freedom. He leaves the governing, the laws etc to the freedom of his worshippers.</p>
              <p>I agree with you in one thing. That is, the freedom that Satan gives to an individual, can be abused. This is seen in the case of Satanists that kill babies, animals etc in their worship of Satan. In Satanism, that is their freedom, and they are not doing wrong in any sense. Satanism does not have any sin, or wrong. However, when it comes to the interest of the majority, their freedom becomes wrong in the sense, that in having their freedom, they deprive others of their freedom. (Deprive the babies, animals of their lives). They are not wrong, but they are judged by the majority in the name of self-interest. Laws, then, is a tool of freedom, to protect the freedom of the majority over the freedom of one person. Therefore, Satan helps to keep the world in order through the freedom of the majority-- their freedom to impose laws on the minority to break the laws. (I hope you are not confused by what I am saying.)</p>
              <p>In conclusion, for an individual, there is no limit to the freedom he or she can impose. He or she can choose to be law-abiding like me, or he or she can choose to sacrifice animal or baby in his or her belief in Satanism. Satan gives freedom as a tool. It is up to the individual to use it in the way he or she wants. That is individual freedom.</p>
              <p>However, sometimes, in the name of self-interest for the majority, the freedom of the individual will be limited by the freedom of the majority. The majority people invents laws in their freedom to protect themselves and their rights. Since they are the majority, their freedom overcomes the freedom of the individuals. This is where those people who sacrifice animals, babies get judged by the laws. This is the freedom of the majority.</p>

              <p>Still, it will be interesting to hear from the christians themselves what they really believe in. I mean, surely not all christians will be willing to die for their God. Also, surely not all christians will be willing to break the laws for God if the situation requires it.</p>

              <p>3) I really think that if God is loving, he will not test his believers in the way he tests some of the early christians of the faith.

              <p>I wonder if you will be willing to die as a matyr for your God if the situation calls for it?</p>
              <p>Will you still be a christian if christianity is outlawed in Singapore?</p>
              <p>If you answered YES to both the questions above, why will you put your belief in Christ over the laws of Singapore? Why will you <strong>NOT</strong> put your own life over that of your religion?</p>
              <p>I thought that your own life should be more important than your religion. I thought that the laws of Singapore should be more important than your religion.</p>
              <p>Are you not being a little too zealous in your religion?</p>

              <p>If you believe in a God who is the creator of everything in the universe (including yourself) and who is the source of all goodness, it shouldn't be surprising that someone would place God above earthly laws and even his own life (which belongs to God anyway). He would be (and should be) zealous for God.</p>
              <p>The problem comes about when folks have wrong beliefs about who God is and what God requires of them, perhaps arising from ignorance or misguided teachings by those who have their own political or material agendas.</p>

              <p>hmm. here's a christian perspective.. you're either on God's side or you're not. you don't have to specifically pray to satan to be on his side. you can be an atheist, and you're also on his camp.</p>
              <p>it's a rather clear cut line.</p>
