              <p>The three men may not have died for their faiths. But the fact remains that they are WILLING to die for their faith rather than compromise their beliefs in God.</p>
              <p>Out of the 12 disciples of Jesus, 10 of them died for their faiths, eventually.</p>
              <p>Many early christians died for their faiths rather than denied Christ.</p>
              <p>The fact remains that Christianity is a religion that requires a believer to value God over his or her own life, or even his or her own country's laws. That devotion to God above one's own life or one's country laws is what I find troubling about Christianity. I think that no matter what, an individual ought to value his or her own life and even his or her country's laws over his or her religion.</p>

              You are a potent Lord why are you holding back? They persecute and kill your chosen ones. They despise and live a life of insult to you. Don't take pity on this generation anymore.

              <p><br> Unfortunately I saw God when I was little, 7th grade to be exact.<br><br> I saw a man that lived 2,000 years ago and walked with Jesus and now is alive and possessing power like no other. He was wearing a brown tunic one which is very similar to what the franciscan order monk would wear only that he was very well built<br><br> I had been given a very detailed prophecy of myself by priest in a highschool retreat. It happened 5 years later in your country. The prophecy made the oracle in the movie matrix a lame person<br><br> I rebuked an evil spirit sent my way by crying out to the Lord. It fled so fast I figured it tucked its tail between its legs lol<br><br> I once(and only that once)asked for an earthquake and was given...right there right then<br><br> God gave me knowledge of the true meaning of death<br><br> God allows me sometimes to feel what other people or a nation are feeling and to know things that are going to happen though not often or with a hiatus period.<br><br> My own mother had several Marian apparitions. They are of course genuine. I too had been saved by St Mary, my mind that is. She was the most charismatic person I've ever felt.

Yes I'm bragging but not about me. Even everything supernatural at the disposal of your corrupt leaders were never ever on par with what I've seen.<br><br> Who is like God? You are the living God! My own eyes have behold you in glory and have witnesed the greatness of your wonder and your compassion and though I'm a sinner you took pity on me and didn't allow me to be destroyed by wicked men. I know that Istand forever in your sight just like every other person. I know that you know because you let me know that you know. You answered me: you are my chosen elect.<br> And even if I have to die in the future because what I stand for I will die SMILING.</p>
