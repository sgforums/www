Antibiotics lead to the evolution of bacteria, if they are not killed. The evolved bacteria thus becomes immune to antibiotics. This is why i think that humans evolved from more primitive lifeforms to be more credible.<br><br>However i know this evolved form of bacteria is still bacteria. Probably will take millions of years to evolve.<br><br>However some people believe God enforced evolution, shaping apes into man. This sounds more possible to me than creation (take genesis allegorically).<br><br>I think you should read this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus since wikipedia is accesible to all, it has information for and against the existence and life of jesus.</p></div>

              <p>Hi Chin Eng, since u directed me to a muslim site with is critical to both the OT &amp; NT. Let me ask u this question. Do u believe that Hashem created the Earth in 6 days?.  fyi, i dun.  The OT is a Jewish book, it is not a Muslim book or a Gentile book.  Why not ask the rabbi, afterall it is their book, what is the meaning, that the earth is created in 6 days, which is not possible. Afterall the OT is a religious book, it is not a science textbook.</p>
              <p>After a second reading of the Muslim site, i notice that the criticism are mostly directed at schematics.  e.g.  To a chinese this phrase, got eye no see big mountain, its meaning will totally different if interpreted by a non chinese Muslim or European etc.</p>

              <p><br>the issue on whether one believes in the Old Earth or the New Earth theory is actually quite personal, and this topic has been argued many times over.</p>
              <p>since you are asking for my PERSONAL stand, my opinion is that the "six" day record is anecdotal....</p>
              <p>but it goes back to - why the need to agree one way or another? either way does not dilute the concept of the creation by God be, it instantenous or process.</p>

              <p><br> the issue on whether one believes in the Old Earth or the New Earth
                  theory is actually quite personal, and this topic has been argued
                  many times over.</p>
              <p>since you are asking for my PERSONAL stand, my opinion

              <p>Act 7:4 specifically states that Abraham moved to Canaan after his father died.</p>
              <p>Genesis 11:26 is not specific. There is speculation that Terah had triplets when he was 70 years old and Abram was first born. Then the numbers do not add up.</p>

              <p>like lack of missing links, support for the noah's flood, dna pool losing information, inaccurate carbon dating (all these i heard in a sermon at my church, but well, i wasn't really paying attention =P)</p>
