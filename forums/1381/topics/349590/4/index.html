              <p>93'guy is a friend of mine in this forum...any problem? shallow arguements? haha. im sure u are so dead serious even with friends.</p>
              <p><br>anti-christ is a strong word. i have to disagree with u. in 93'guy's case, i dun think he meant anti-christ, he dislikes christianity for some reason...etc maybe God hasn't answer his prayers or protected his loved ones &amp; probably the only word close enough to his thoughts is "anti-christ". he's probably a neutral in this aspect. anti-christ means directly opposing God. i.e one cannot obey his commandments &amp; prefer to do the opposite. and by doing the opposite, he has already fallen into the devil's trap by going against God's commandments. although one can say "i do not worship the devil" but indirectly he has already done so. ok..disregard the drinking blood portion as it was a cold joke.</p>
              <p>If being satanist isn't being a bad person, then he/she will be opposing the devil himself. contradicting...as one will be neither here nor there.</p>

              <p>I do not want or intend to be a princess in hell. I am happy with the current guidance I receive from him. I do think it is neccessary to break the ten commandments of the bible to be a Satanist. Some Satan followers do break the ten commandments in their desires to follow him. That is their freedom. For me, I see Satan more as a friend who guides me through life, rather than someone who requires me to sacrifice children or animals for him. Satan advocates freedom in the highest sense, so he will not expect all his followers to break the commandments. He knows that some of his followers will prefer to be law-abiding citizens with the knowledge of good and evil he had given them. I may yet... be a princess in hell. Princess over the domain of being law-abiding.</p>

              <p>well... to be fair.. it isn't their fault.</p>
              <p>i've left church because of hurts too. hurts can blind ppl. besides. the bible says that the god of this world has blinded us from the truth. so it's never a physical fault, but a spiritual one.</p>
              <p>but God loves them all the same, and we should too. Help to strengthen the weak, affirm the ashamed, bind the wounded, heal the sick, provide for the poor.</p>
              <p>When sinners saw Jesus, their reaction isn't to run from him, but instead, they ran towards him. They saw something in Him which stood out from other religious leaders. They didn't feel ashamed of themselves, but instead they were comforted, they were willing to step away from their lives of wrong and follow Him.</p>
              <p>Religion condemns those who do wrong, they point fingers, show them a black and white paper. Jesus compels, draws, and receives those who came to him.</p>
              <p>I think that's what we should do too. =)</p>

              neccessary to break the ten commandments of the bible to be a
              Satanist. Some Satan followers do break the ten commandments in
              their desires to follow him. That is their freedom. For me, I see
              Satan more as a friend who guides me through life, rather than
              someone who requires me to sacrifice children or animals for him.
              Satan advocates freedom in the highest sense, so he will not expect
              all his followers to break the commandments. He knows that some of
              his followers will prefer to be law-abiding citizens with the
              knowledge of good and evil he had given them. I may yet... be a

              <p>Those who are anti-christ or w/e, continue to do so.</p>
              <p>If she aint "recruiting" u to join her religion, i dun see a point of u doing so to keep telling her "hey u are dead, u ish princess of hell" .. If wat she is doing now is bad, karma will come after her. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>U quoting about old naggy father and the gang leader stuff? Isnt this the same as u praising your religion telling her "hey u join the wrong side" .. While she saying "hey i just got abit of problems with your god" ..</p>
              <p>Ok i am not a christian but hey i love listening to stories regarding this religion .. And i just attended a church wedding not long ago its wonderful.</p>
              <p>As for Satan i also do listen to "myths &amp; legends" of it .. In fact, i got a friend who is interested in Satan and he bought this book call the Black bible? Not sure bout the name tho.</p>
              <p>In this earth, u need to have balance of stuff.. Black and white .. Hot and cold .. Wet and dry and the list goes on and on.</p>
