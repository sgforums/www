              <p>I do not want or intend to be a princess in hell. I am happy with the current guidance I receive from him. I do think it is neccessary to break the ten commandments of the bible to be a Satanist. Some Satan followers do break the ten commandments in their desires to follow him. That is their freedom. For me, I see Satan more as a friend who guides me through life, rather than someone who requires me to sacrifice children or animals for him. Satan advocates freedom in the highest sense, so he will not expect all his followers to break the commandments. He knows that some of his followers will prefer to be law-abiding citizens with the knowledge of good and evil he had given them. I may yet... be a princess in hell. Princess over the domain of being law-abiding.</p>

              <p>I believe right and wrong is defined by the indiviudal himself/herself. There is no absolute right or wrong. Everything, including the value or right and wrong, is set up for the sake of self-interest.</p>
              <p>The law is there because it protects people. For the sake of the safety of the majority, the law is invented. Therefore, the law is the freedom of the majority.</p>
              <p>On the individual level, there is no absolute right or wrong. Some satanists may choose to sacrifice animals/babies to worship Satan. Others, like myself, prefer to be law-abiding citizens. The individual level of freedom knows no boundary. However, the freedom of majority will be there to judge the freedom of the individual. That is why Satanists that sacrifice babies/animals inventually have to go to jail/be hanged for their deeds. They may do what is right in their eyes on an individual level, but they do what is wrong on their eyes on the majority level of freedom.</p>
              <p>Satanists decide right or wrong, therefore by self- interest. Law is set up to protect the self-intererst of the majority.</p>

              <p>There is still the freedom of individual to look into. The individual can choose to stand up against rape and slavery, just like some satanists can choose to sacrifice babies/animals against the laws today. The freedom of the individuals will be judged by the the freedom of the majority, though.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think rape and slavery is wrong. But that is only because I am brought up in present societies. I think if I am brought up in the past, I will side with the moral of the majority, thinking rape and slavery is not wrong.</p>
              <p>By the way, even the christians in the past do not think rape and slavery is wrong. There was an incident in the bible, where the Benjamites commited evil, and the other tribes went to war against the Benjamite tribe. They also wiped up the tribe of Benjamin. Lately, they relent their actions, and get the men in Benjamite to grab for themselves the girls in the tribe of Jabesh Gilead, and took them forcefully as wives. That is how the tribe of Benjamin survived, by taking themselves forcefully girls from Jabesh Gilead.(Judges 21 NIV)</p>
              <p>That is mass rape, condoned by the bible.</p>
              <p>In the old testament, slavery is actually condoned. Abraham had slaves, many slaves and yet God called him the father of faith. There are laws in the bible for slaves. (Exodus 21 NIV)</p>
              <p>That is slavery here, condoned by the bible.</p>
              <p>Yet, today, christians do not condone slavery nor mass rape. Therefore, there is no absolute right and wrong. Not even for the christians. The bible supports slavery in the past, but do not do so now. The bible condones mass rape in the past but do not do so now.</p>
              <p>Satanists definitely do not believe in absolute right and wrong. Right and wrong is the freedom of the individual to decide.</p>

              <p>To be honest, many satanists do not believe in forgiveness of one's enemies. If a person chooses to be an idiot, he deserved to be treated badly. But you don't go and break the laws by murdering him.</p>
              <p>For me, I believe in forgiveness. It is just my personal value.</p>
