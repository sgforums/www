              <p>that's why i don't believe that a single person is spiritually infallable, and that every word he speaks is the truth from God.</p>
              <p>in the end, i'll go back to the word, thank you very much.</p>

              <p>Nobody is as "anointed" as others claimed them to be... Pastors, preachers, priests are just one of the instruments used by God to spread His Word...</p>
