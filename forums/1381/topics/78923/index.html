            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, just wanna check out with you guys whether is the band Eagles satanic? What does the implications of their famous song Hotel California actually mean? I am doing a study right now and trying to get to a conclusion. Give your inputs and ideas if you have any.<br><br>Here's a copy of the lyrics.<br><br>Hotel California<br><br>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air<br>Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light<br>My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>I had to stop for the night<br><br>There she stood in the doorway;<br>I heard the mission bell<br>And I was thinking to myself,<br>'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'<br>Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way<br>There were voices down the corridor,<br>I thought I heard them say...<br><br>Welcome to the Hotel California<br>Such a lovely place<br>Such a lovely face<br>Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>Any time of year, you can find it here<br><br>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes benz<br>She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends<br>How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.<br>Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br><br>So I called up the Captain,<br>'Please bring me my wine'<br>He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'<br>And still those voices are calling from far away,<br>Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>Just to hear them say...<br><br>Welcome to the Hotel California<br>Such a lovely place<br>Such a lovely face<br>They livin' it up at the Hotel California<br>What a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br><br>Mirrors on the ceiling,<br>The pink champagne on ice<br>And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'<br>And in the master's chambers,<br>They gathered for the feast<br>The stab it with their steely knives,<br>But they just can't kill the beast<br><br>Last thing I remember, I was<br>Running for the door<br>I had to find the passage back<br>To the place I was before<br>'Relax,'said the night man,<br>We are programmed to receive.<br>You can checkout any time you like,<br>but you can never leave!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Well, it all depends on who you believe.<br>Don Henley stated in write-up in their "The Complete Greatest Hits" CD: <span style="font-style: italic;">"....We were enamored with hotels. Hotels were a big part of our lives. The Beverly Hills Hotel had become something of a focal point....I though there were a certain mystery and romance about it....There are plays like Neil Simon's Plaza Suite and California Suite,  which Glenn and I went to see while writing the song.... bla bla bla"</span><br>Obviously this quotation does not prove either way whether the Eagles sang Satanic songs.<br><br>While, hopefully, trying not to sound too pro-Eagles, bear in mind that there are always nay-sayers, and witch-hunters.<br>One issue about backmasking that had bothered me is: If a song is sung by another singer, ie cover-version, does the backmasking still exist?<br>Or to put it simply,<br>(A) is backmasking merely a reverse sounding sentence, ie by saying a sentence, instead of singing the song, would the words have come across as backmasked....<br>(B) alternatively, is backmasking a technical insertion, ie, phrases inserted in a recording attempting to reach the subliminal level of consciousness.<br><br>If the answer is (A) - then we CANNOT even recite the phrases in Hotel California or for that matter work that combination of words in our conversation as it might cause someone to stumble.<br>If the answer is (B) - then go ahead and buy the cover version, backmasked words are not in it.<br><br>Or maybe it is (C) - the meaning of the words convey an ideology that is contrary to one's chosen lifestyle. Then there are plenty of this around, whether it's Eagles or Carlos Santana<br><br>At the end of it all, it is cause and effect! Does the song (or for that matter, any genre of entertainment) affect you? Never seen Hotel California affecting aunties and uncles.<br><br>I like Hotel California, but I am not affected by it in a say supernatural. I listen to it and enjoy it, but I will not listen to it all the time. I prefer cantopop - particularly the ah-pek type, as well as ah-beng mandarin pop,<br><br>To anyone interested, the three-piece stroller band at Mandarin Hotel plays a mean Hotel California. Have a meal at Triple Three (a pricey buffet restaurant) and if the band comes to your table, you may request for Hotel California. Filipino accented song, no backmasking, I assure you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've done some searching on the subject of backmasking before and personally i believe that sublimal messages are absorbed by the conscious mind even though we don't play the music backwards and listen to them but listening to them in obsession exerts a certain influence in the lives of a person. Talk to a Cradle of Filth , Black Sabbath or Marilyn Manson fanatic and you will know what i mean. But perhaps this topic is of a subjective nature.<br>I don't believe in coincidence in the backmasked messages but it definitely can be done technically, Since I love music, it would be the best if i can explore into every genre of music other than those in the christian category too. But I am aware that we must be careful in everything we do. That's why i've posted this topic and start a discussion of views on it.<br><br>2 Corinthians 11:14 -15<span style="font-style: italic;"> And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve</span>.<br><br>Satan's main tool is that of deception, its always good to have the correct spirit of discernment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Backmasking Information</span><a href="http://www.dubaibuzz.com/content.php?article.2" rel="nofollow">http://www.dubaibuzz.com/content.php?article.2</a>[/url]</div>

The entire mechanics of reasoning and understanding hinges on the point that the recipient of message (subliminal or not), is whether one's mind is tuned to the message or not. If a backmasked messages exist but sound gibberish, how then can the mind decode the message? It's like trying to backmask a Hokkien phrase and expect an African to act upon the message.<br><br>Another revealing piece of information from Snopes.com:<br>http://www.snopes.com/business/hidden/popcorn.asp<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Homework: gotta convert my unplugged Hotel California to MP3 so that I can download into my new mobile phone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hotel California is by no means a Satanic song. I am an active amatuer reasearcher on how music impacts our christian life.  Hotel California is actually about Satanic practices or to put it more mildly, wayward practices.  It is widely spoken that Hotel California is a DRUG HOLE for drug addicts during that period and it could be true because in the second line of the song, you would see the word '...smell of COLITAS, rising up thru the air."<br><br>Colitas is a spanish plural word for COLA...which happens to be the tip of the marijuna branch. And it is more potent accordingly.<br><br>Some other evidences in the lyrics i find personally are<br><br>"You can checkout any time you like,<br>but you can never leave! " - DRUGS, you can hardly stop an addiction. You cant leave it!<br><br>"'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device' " - true isnt it?<br><br>"'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell' " - Drugs can bring u to a high and bring u to a low.<br><br>"Some dance to remember, some dance to forget " - drugs enable a person to go into depression and delusion.<br><br>So there u go, some tots i found from my research and also some personal views on the songs.<br><br>I do not believe in these "ROCK IS EVIL" stuff. Rock is not evil, satan is. To put things into perspective, if SATAN REALLY wants to use music to influence the christians of this world, he would have use music that sounds like HILLSONGS which most christians are suckers for...why would he use rock which he knows most christians are against? Satan is angel of music, he can use HILLSONGS-style of music if he wants to. Remember that.<br><br>It is the musicians not the music. Satan uses the musicians not the music. Satan cannot influence the music but he can influence the musicians. So not all musicians who sing about destruction, murder are satanic, they are just like us christians when we adore GOD. They are just expressing how they are feeling inside. If we were to look at them with "Oh so satanic!" kind of eyes, who will reach out to them?<br><br>Trust me, Satan doesnt always come in when the music is loud, destructive or when the lyrics are obviously disturbing. Satan is a LION but he TOO can be a SLY SERPENT. So, do you still think its the music?<br></div>

I mean, really, anyone who has a common sense of God could write those lyrics.  Music wise, I find them too poppy and even their 'rock' is not really rock. So to a person like me who is into heavier stuff and more thoughtful lyrics, Hillsongs is not my cup of tea.<br><br>I am commenting this in a capacity of a musician not as a worshipper. My church sings Hillsongs stuff and I worship the same.  I do not question their sincerity, I am not in the position to do so.  So well, if you ask me whether I like Hillsongs? Well I DO NOT based on their music and technically. As for their hearts for worship, I really do not know so I cant say anything  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
