              Yes there is God I saw God once in my life. His name is Jesus Christ. His face shone a     white light much brighter than the sun which enveloped His whole figure.
                                                                                     <br><br>
              I know the dead [at least some of them] go to a place of rest. I had been allowed there before. I wasn't told when they are going to be allowed life again though yet the bible tells me they would be awaken in the end of time for judgment. I found out to my surprise later that the bible too wrote of the things I was allowed to know so I know it was not a devil's trick or my own fantasy. Anyway the dead which I was allowed to feel was no longer aware of herself, no longer remember God and was not able to register the passage of time at all. I'm not hallucinating and I'm not making this up from the bible. I'm a Catholic who did not understand the bible much.
                                                  
                                                                     <br><br>
              Well in 2002 an evil spirit came to my dorm room, it went past the door at incredible speed, it went inside me and I was helpless...until I cried out to the Lord from the bottom of my heart and it fled without delay. It even left faster than it came. So I can say if God took pity of me I fear no evil.
                                                  <br><br>
              But still you wouldn't believe me because you just wouldn't want to listen and find out the truth.
                                                   <br><br>
              I have much more well actually a few more to testify but what's the point if you just wouldn't want to listen at all. After all God is personal.

              <p>hi. how do we know where the dead goes after? let's talk about judgement and the existence of hell then. the existence of hell and judgement day are not claims by man. the source of these claims is the Bible.</p>
              <p>however let's imagine there's no judgement no hell. and remember the virginia tech massacre? that murderer would one lucky dude, just by ending his own life and proceeding to a "better place". no hell. no heaven. nothing.. well that's damn good news for many. i wished it was like this too. imagine what i can do then escape to "paradise".</p>
              <p>BUT, if the bible is right and there is eternal justice. 
                                        You will find yourself standing before the judgment 
                                        throne of a holy God, who has seen every sin you have 
                                        ever committed. Hell will be your just desert, and you will have no one to blame 
                                        but yourself. This is the claim of the Bible. If you 
                                        don’t believe it, it is still true. It will still 
                                        happen.</p>
              <p>here's the good news. whether you heard it a hundred million times..  all of us deserve judgement. but two thousand years ago, God sent His Son, Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our all our sins. He offers us mercy and grace through Jesus for our eternal salvation. To warn of hell is fearful, 
                                        but it is absolutely legitimate, because the Bible says 
                                        that it is a fearful thing for a sinner to fall into 
                                        the hands of the living God.</p>
              <p>let me ask you then. what if YOU are wrong about the claims of hell and judgment day? are you still gonna continue playing your game of russian roullette?</p>

              <p>I suppoert xalkyrie in this...although i dont believe Jesus died for our sins but i believed in Heaven and Hell. My answer is similar to xalkyrie's answer from para 1 to 3.</p>
              <p>If there is no Judgement in the afterlife, then there is no justice at all coz there are some men who died without being punished for their sins, eg Hitler.</p>

              <p>i know that muslims respect Moses as a prophet of God. Israel was instructed by Moses to shed the blood of a spotless 
                                            lamb to provide a temporary atonement for their sin. 2000 years ago, Jesus was the Lamb that God provided to make 
                                            atonement for the sins of the world. Through faith in 
                                            Jesus, we can have atonement with God. All our sin can 
                                            be washed away—once and for all. God can grant us the gift of everlasting life through faith in Jesus 
                                            Christ on the basis of His death and resurrection.</p>
              <p>Salvation is a gift, a grace. It cannot be earned as what muslims believed.</p>
              <p>Jesus claimed He had power on earth 
                                            to forgive sins (Matthew 9:2–6). No other religions made this claim. Only 
                                            Jesus can provide peace with God. This is why He said, 
                                            "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man 
                                            comes to the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). God commands sinners to 
                                            repent and trust in Jesus as Lord and Savior, or they 
                                            will perish.</p>

              I 100% believe there would be judgment and heaven and hell.
                                
              As much as I believe in the resurrection of the dead and eternal power given to those that God elects, this I know for a fact.
                               
              I also 100% believe that the world would come to an end at the end of time.

               I testify that God not only wants us to believe in Jesus but to love Jesus with all our heart. God never wanted anyone to love a prophet.
                                <br><br>
               God gave me a clear vision of glorious Jesus only after God gave me love of Jesus.
               Putting faith in Jesus and loving Jesus is what God wants.

              much.<br> <br> Well in 2002 an evil spirit came to my dorm room, it went past the
              door at incredible speed, it went inside me and I was
              helpless...until I cried out to the Lord from the bottom of my
              heart and it fled without delay. It even left faster than it came.
              So I can say if God took pity of me I fear no evil.<br> <br> But still you wouldn't believe me because you just wouldn't want to
              listen and find out the truth.<br> <br> I have much more well actually a few more to testify but what's the
              point if you just wouldn't want to listen at all. After all God is
              personal.</p>

              <p>hey do you even know what you are saying? Moses was born israelite in the tribe of levi. Moses grew up in egypt, that was God's plan. the egpytians made the hebrew people slaves because of their increasing numbers. it was God that commanded Moses to confront the pharaoh to let his people go but pharoah didn't want to. why was egypt in peril? because of the pharoah's hardened heart, God sent plagues onto egpyt untill the pharoah gave up and release the hebrew slaves reluctantly. this is from the book of exodus. i read it many times already.</p>
              <p>the thing here is everything i said in this forum, i KNOW what i am talking about. we christians are not idiots and are never saints to begin with. at least i know that if i were to know that God is real and true, i had to put all my pride down to seek him. and he was found.</p>
              <p>you know i believe that you made god and without you god can never exist. because you have become your own god. what do you want to hear us preach? all about peace, love, money and self? who doesn't like to hear all this things. if this is all you want to hear then you should throw and cut the bible because the bible teaches judgment, wrath and it talks about your sins and many others you feel uncomfortable to even read about.</p>
              <p>if you think we christians can be taken lightly, sorry to tell you, we at least i had come a long way of hardship.</p>

              <p>Miracle, get this straight. If u ask whether im big i would say i am big enough to know you are plain bullshit.</p>
              <p>When i respect your post, you flamed. So blame yourself when i trolled. I tried to prevent this guy from flaming christians. you christians come flame me back.</p>
              <p>Hey so give you one reality check ok?</p>
              <p>i am at the very least understandable to certain things in life and not blinded by God's faith. So to me myself im big. cause this is my life and its my story not yours. Whose eyes are you loooking out from today? yours? if it aint mine do not show pride and wrath.</p>
              <p>Learn you 6 sins before you come blabbering.</p>

              <p>First of all..</p>
              <p>Bible is mam made. Written by men who claim to hear God.</p>
              <p>The first Bible is called the 10 commandments given to moses by
              Jenovah AKA GOD AKA big guy up there.</p>
              <p>What many christians do not know is this.</p>
              <p>Rahmoses pronounces as Rare-Mer-Sees, is Moses's brother and
              Moses means Son of. In Ancient Egypt alllllllllll child have the
              name Son of something something like the arabians or muslims with
              their bin or bte yeah. But Moses just remain as SON OF. Without a
              father without a god. Because they have no blood relations.</p>
              <p>Moses took his people? Wrong BIG BOO BOO! Egypt was in peril at
              that time. RAHMOSES ASKED MOSES TO TAKE HIS PEOPLE AND GO~ TO SAVE
              HIS PEOPLE~</p>
              <p>get it get it?</p>
              <p>Constantine wrote a NKJV of the bible. Which is no Different
              from the original. Constantine was jew FYI. All christians are Jew.
              CAUSE JESUS IS A BLOODY JEW!</p>
              <p>WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!? come here kbkb saying
              god this god that. Aye seriously, God's number one excuse which is
              sadly a true form of life is that you dont help yourself how i help
