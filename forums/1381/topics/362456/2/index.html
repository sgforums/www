              You see care for other people's felling if you expect the same from other people.
              You can stop being upset now.

              <p>Ok i have proved my point.</p>
              <p>It was an enactment to what people would do to flame a thread
              like this.</p>
              <p>Christian or not you have to understand its public.</p>
              <p>Respect religion Respect Faith...</p>
              <p>Oh and btw Chin Eng and Xalkyrie.</p>
              <p>I have studied with a professor from isreal in the pass and so i
              and him researched on the history of christianity.</p>
              <p>Facts or lies i won't claim but evidence which are physical can
              never lie yea.</p>
              <p>Every human is equal irregardless of what religion you believe
              in. Hardships are not only faced by christians. You want hardships?
              Try india or africa. What is your hardship compared to those who
              lived in the slums and poverty?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try comparing your bible the words and context with real
              history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as i was saying. The name moses came out after "moses" Which
              when moses had that name he was a son of nothingness.</p>
              <p>Its hard to accept the truth. But accept it. Bible is made from
              man by the words of a god. And if we are made in God's image and
              likeness thus God should not be omnipotent but someone who makes
              mistakes too. Learn it, accept it. Live with it.</p>
              <p>Its your faith that i don't judge. Im just here to let some
              idiot understand what it is about to start a thread like this.</p>

              Hi man what's your ilness? Don't avoid the question please.
              Despite what men would have judged you their saying won't matter much whether you are saved or not. Only God has the final say. A curse which doesn't fit you is not a curse.
              
              We are all sinners too Kyutake.

              <p>i was a liar, thief, adulterer, blasphemer. i'm not even a saint to begin with. whoever says he/she doesn't sins is the greatest liar of all.</p>
              <p>if you think you are too sinful for God to accept you then you must understand how merciful God is. <em>"the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting 
                                        to ever-lasting upon them that fear him" (Psalm 
                                        103:17)</em>. God was merciful to King David and forgave 
                                        him when he committed adultery and murder. He forgave 
                                        Moses when he committed murder. He also forgave Saul 
                                        of Tarsus for murdering Christians (Acts 22:4).</p>
              <p><em><strong>Everyone</strong> who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. Romans 10:13</em> Jesus shed His blood on the cross to pay for our sins. It is a gift, a choice to be made from you is to accept it or don't. <span class="aawitnessinganswer">The forgiveness that 
                                        is in Jesus Christ is conditional upon repentance 
                                        toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </span><span class="aawitnessinganswer">It is a gift that God offers to everyone, 
                                        but you must receive it by repenting and trusting 
                                        in Christ, or you will remain dead in your sins.</span></p>
