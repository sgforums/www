So nobody told me to go to Church.<br>Then my own school teacher invited us to go to her church, which is a Presbyterian denomination one.<br><br>After that joined my good friend's church, also a Prebyterian one.<br><br>Like that lor.  Then along the way, I thought Catholic church too old fashion liao.  Didn't like.  So refused to go back.  Preferred churches with a lot of youngsters and more happening.  That time my best friend was a Catholic.  She kept telling me to join her for Mass and I refused (can't remember the reason).<br><br>But after O level, I made my way back to the Catholic Church (nobody told me to do that.  I did it out of my decision), after months of attending Mass on my own.<br><br>The ironical thing is : I was at the same time very involved in Campus Crusade for Christ...hahaha</div>
