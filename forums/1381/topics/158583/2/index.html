            <div class='col-md body'>Before certain people jump to conclusions, here are some points to take note of:<br><br>1. The traditional RC position is that the bible is one of the two <strong>infallible sources of divine revelation</strong>. In fact the Roman Catholic understanding of inspiration is far more mechanical than the traditional reformed understanding.<br><br>No one, of course, even the strictest inerrantist would (a view to which I subscribe) ,would claim that the bible teaches astronomy, but all would claim that the <strong>bible is inerrant in all that it intends to communicate. Nor would any claim that the bible contains mistakes in the autographa. </strong><br><br>2.  The Truth of the Bible is not always a literal Truth. Truth <strong>can be allegorical and symbolic as well.</strong> Not only that certain stories in the Bible can have both <strong>literal and allergorical Truths in them</strong>.<br><br>3. The article is a maladroit way to attack conservative and fundamentalist Protestants who take a literal view of Genesis 1-3 and Revelation.<br><br>The article contains a quite off-topic attack on Intelligent Design. A few years ago<strong> Ruth Gledhill was feted in conservative circles but she turned very negative towards evangelicals in the past couple of years over, branding them as Â‘judgmentalÂ’ (i.e., differing from *her judgments) over homosexuality and single motherhood. She made it clear she felt Â‘got atÂ’ by conservative Christians. </strong><br><br><strong>The Times has become very agnostic or even hostile toward Christianity (with gay writer Matthew Parris - EnglandÂ’s Andrew Sullivan- leading the charge), reflecting the upper-middle class English establishment in its post-Christian hissy. </strong><br><br>And finally some of the terms used in the article are meant to MISLEAD:<br><br>Take the terms TRUE and UNTRUE for example. I could give more misleading terms used.<br><br>As mentioned earlier the Pope hasn't commented. The Pope will do so after he consults his Cardinals and Bishops.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As an historian, my research has lead me to believe that most of the Old Testament is folklore that has been passed down through time or stories that have been "borrowed" from other people and different times. It was monks long ago that picked and chose what went into the Bible; who are they to decide what's right and wrong, what should be left in or out? I am a Christian and am finally glad that the Catholic Church has yielded way to common sense.

            <div class='col-md body'>As a former journalist now working as an Anglican minister, and with a robust evangelical theology, I am surprised that the latest Roman Catholic report is regarded as news. To believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, as I do, in no way requires a literalistic interpretation of every verse: it all depends, as the catholic bishops rightly say, what sort of literature it is - poetry, letter, history or whatever. When the Psalms speak of Lebanon "skipping like a calf" we recognise it as a figure of speech. Likewise, it seems to me that the early chapters of Genesis, taken in their own context, require a non-literalistic interpretation - how else can the Bible speak of evening and morning before it speaks of the creation of the sun? The ancient writers were not fools and we should not demand of the text what it does not even demand of itself. - Rev David Baker, Surbiton</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Finally, the Church admits that the Bible is God's word in "human language." I would say it is fair game to reinterpret the entire Bible and to take with a grain of salt those bigoted texts which espouse doctrines no longer relevant in our day and age. As the Church points out, this is human language, and with human language comes human myopia and bigotry of the human spirit. Thank you, Catholic Church, for admitting what many of us have known all along: the Bible is a piecemeal selection of texts and scriptures put together with political motivation. And, those texts and scriptures were written down in some cases centuries after the death of Christ and are akin to myths with grains of truth. Blasphemous be the man who writes his own words and ascribes them to God. That is pure arrogance. - Michael Marcil, Salem, Massachusetts<br><br></div>
