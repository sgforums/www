              <p>In my years of being a Christian, one thing I observed with absolute
              and unerring frequency, was how mass conversions could come about.<br> <br> Most of the time, these are held in what are typically called, 'Church
              Camps', where its participants are mostly already Christians who come
              on the presupposition of enjoying themselves, and some non-Christians
              who come like sheep for the slaughter.<br> <br> Over the next few days, innocent things are done, such as song-singing,
              games, religious discussions and the like. These sermons are held every
              few hours throughout those few days and most commonly enough, the
              sermons will always touch on some kind of "seed-sowing" agenda that
              will build up to the last, or second-last day, when the speaker will
              start speaking of depressing things, preparing the crowd to cry and it
              will culminate in the speaker and/or pastor to ask people to accept
              Christ.<br> <br> You will see many believers raise their hands to affirm their faith
              once more, and the non-believers, because of the surrounding
              psychological conditions over the past few days, and peer-pressure
              during the emotional moment, will most likely raise their hands to
              "join the family".<br> <br> This is not exclusively done in these 'Church Camps', but also more
              commonly so in hospices, when people are lying in their beds, waiting
              to die, and these Christians troll about looking for 'more souls to
              save', exploiting and taking advantage of the dying's emotional
              vulnerability.<br> <br> Christians will agree with me that you do not see people laughing with
              joy when they come to the moment of accepting Christ. Despite the sort
              of prize that Christians make it out to be when people accept Christ,
              one can observe that the motivation behind conversions, is due to the
              belief that for every person a Christian converts, he or she will earn
              a crown in heaven. Which is sadly mercenary of them.<br> <br> It is only when people's minds have been tremendously weakened by a
              series of clever marketing tricks by Christians, or because they have
              been so depressed that they feel that they need a supernatural presence
              to help them in their lives, that people will see the need to accept
              Christ.</p>

              <p>"Reason for exploiting these poor people"</p>
              <p>Church wants to make money to feed their obsession of building their Megachurch .</p>
              <p>Typical Singaporean mindset. They want to get as many people as possible so their " Church Will Grow" So more tidings and more income for the pastor.</p>
              <p>Its just like every church want to compete with one another and see who gets the better looking or can afford a better and bigger and more swanking looking church with all those high tech equipment and bullshit.</p>
              <p>Chrisitans throughout the world have lost the spirit that the Lord have once set upon them along time ago. Its everywhere not just our generation.</p>
              <p>What meant to be a message to save the world have turned out to be a reason for alot of these ass wipes to use it as a power building , fortune building tool.</p>
              <p>Suffice to say the " Christmas message of love and salvation " have turned out to be a mere money making tool.</p>
              <p>Not alot of old school christians who actually know what they are talking about and what they are doing survived nowadays.</p>
              <p>If you do realised this.,  when everytime someone talks about a church , they will never say " God's spirit is strong in this church" However they will say stuff like like , " who this church is huge !! " " The sound system is great" "Wow the church building very nice" or " The pastor here is an excellent speaker"  " Alot of famous people attend this church etc etc etc"</p>
              <p>How often have you ever heard,  " The people in this church really display the spirit of love like what Jesus wanted them to because God is in the House" ......Never....</p>

              <p>The Lord desires no more then taking away the broken hearts, broken lives and broken spirits that we hold so tightly.</p>
              <p>For He could have let humanity died out a long time ago due with the great flood, but he choose to let us live, for he love us and created us as a image of himself.</p>

              <p>Nevermind, I can take your story as an example, change a few words to match with the work I am doing and send to my business associates. I am sure my business associates will not bother me for quite some time. Then I have more time to do real work.</p>
