              <p>There is heaven and there is hell.</p>
              <p>Not only Christians believe in that. There are others of different faiths also believe in that.</p>
              <p>Before proving or disproving heaven or hell. Firstly you must know what they are. Without knowing what they are, how in the world are you going to prove any thing.</p>
              <p>Example. Prove sisuxkraz exist. Just what is sisuxkraz? You gotta know what it is first.</p>
              <p>What is heaven? What is hell? To you. Find out for yourself. Don't say people say this and people say that, you got brains, go find out.</p>
              <p>Proof, if proof you want, remember people got some stones that can prove you got cancer.</p>

              <p>thanks for sharing. </p>
              <p>Well, I may not be the most knowledgeable person, but hopefully, I can give you a rational answer.</p>
              <p>I know that be it heaven/hell, I have to die first before I go into the next stage. This is unavoidable.</p>
              <p>However, I am not a single entity that exists on this earth without any memories, interactions or relationships like perhaps a block of wood or a slab of cement.Just like now, we are interacting. For me, I strive to live longer even when I know I am going to heaven, cause I want to stay longer here with what I have now, my family, life, experiences and my world. I know where the exit is, but it doesn't mean I can't live responsibly.</p>
              <p>Even for you, U know you are dying as we speak, do you still make choices of what to eat/drink/wear, and go? Why do you do that? Why do you work/study?Why do you question whether there is heaven/hell? Will an answer sway where you are going? Why don't you go to one corner, and just wait for that final breath? And maybe, U will see light or maybe you will see flames..</p>
              <p>Now, for me, do I need someone to prove that heaven exist? or for that matter, hell? Not really. Cause I know when I breathe my last breath, it will come to me.  Anything else at that pt in time is really secondary. Don't you agree?</p>
              <p>No offense.</p>

              <p>i like these 3 stories best, maybe you might have read about them..........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A)  in a science journal article, a woman claimed that she was a rare reptile (i can't remember which one) in a previous life and she went on to describe the different parts of the reptile, she then mentioned a certain part of the animal that was previously unknown to science.</p>
              <p>the scientists then examined a specimen of the rare reptile and were shocked to discover the woman was right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>B)  this story was reported widely in US.............</p>
              <p>a boy repeatedly dreamt and drew pictures of a battle scene in the Philippines during World War 2..............he told his parents he was a pilot that was killed by the Japs.</p>
              <p>they then brought the boy to meet the surviving pilots of the squadron that took part in the battle and upon knowing the names of the pilots, the boy was able to call them by their nicknames ! the boy also described what took place at the air base prior to the war and the pilots all agree the boy was indeed the dead pilot becoz no one would have known the details.</p>
              <p>the boy later met the surviving sister of the dead pilot and he knew the woman's nickname. the boy also talked about 2 paintings that their mother painted before the war which only the sister and the dead pilot knew about ! the sister also said that the boy is her late brother.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C)  this story was made into a documentary................</p>
              <p>5 or 6 yr-old Scottish boy talked about his ''other'' family and house on an isle that he's never been to and the mother brought him there. they found the house and it was exactly as the boy described including all the nooks and crannies and the 3 toilets in it.</p>
              <p>they found relatives of the house owners and found family photos showing the big blue car and white and black dog which the boy had talked about !</p>
              <p>the boy also had PRE-BIRTH memories..............when his mom asked him how he came to be her son, he said he simply fell into her tummy.</p>

              <p>sound interesting but your description of heaven is different from those who claim that they went to heaven when they had near death experience. which religion you belong to? may be different religion have their own heaven. buddhism says there are 33 heavens, i think is true.</p>

              <p>I think the idea about not believing something unless there's proof can be summed up in this quote. But problem is, where is the proof and empirical evidence to back up this claim too? Even if there's proof / evidence, what can we conclusively state? Ultimately, proof and evidence are uninterpretable unless by the presuppositions of the one who makes the interpretations. </p>
