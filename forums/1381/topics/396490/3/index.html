              <p>If you think there isn't any heaven, hell. Why don't you keep it to yourself instead of talking so much random trash in this forum? Plz look at the forum's title, it is for Christians. You're an unbeliever. So get the hell out of here and go home and whine at yourself concerning your in-jokes. I guess you are some nerd that can't socialize so you must have some fun crying and whining in some online forum and get mad at other people's religion. Why don't you go out and make some friends? We are not amused by your in-jokes. Please post your photos of your cute melon head and sissy voice so we can all have a good laugh. If you don't believe in god, don't believe it. Nobody cares and nobody will mind. If there isn't any god, good for you. If there is, remember that you will go to hell rather than heaven. Better to believe so that you won't fear death then disbelieving and thinking "where on earth I will go after I die." Eitherway, gtfo from this forum kid. Kthxbai</p>

              <p>to those Christian here , i recommend all of us not to argue with those atheist there as these are exactly those people that had not been convicted by Holy Spirit of their sins to be aware of how wrong they are to post these. (John 16). In addition, we should try to preach to them, but be aware that salvation is by grace, if they do not believe, leave it. We should not keep on argue to them on and on as this thread will not have any conclusion and let them to be accountable to God on judgement day and be cast into the deeps of hell. We should also keep out of using vulgarities or etc when we are proposing our POV as god wants us to show compassion, be longsuffering, be forbearing to other. (Galatians 5).  </p>

              <p>Salvation is by grace, this is recorded lots of time in scriptures such as Ephesians 1-2. However, when we are saved by God, we should be aware and convicted of our sins (John 16) and put in our personal best to lead a godly life. In addition, if those Christians whom continue to sin or still stagnant in their walk with God should really reconsider that they are really saved or not. So, it is certainly not sitting there and do nothing and you will be to heaven, as the grace of god may not be truly on you then. </p>
              <p>Anyway, the statements you make are baseless, see how i constructed my arguments, all are backed by scriptures. Thus, it make my arguments credible unlike yours which could be classified as "False teachers" as recorded in John 16 also </p>

              <p>Search Wikipedia on Near death experience(NDE) and it can prove
              that the tunnel of bright white light exist. On the otherhand ,
              there is an increase number of people reporting of hell vision
              during NDE. Does that mean more people have sin?</p>

               wronged or
                                      bullied, when your words and questions are more 
              aimed to provoke
                                      more than anything. It's even worse when you 
              know you can phrase
                                      things differently, yet you phrase it 
              deliberately to provoke, to
                                      anger, to incite ill-feeling. Yet you go about 
              accussing others of

                                      non-belief. In any case, so often the debate

              <p>As much as I understand the comment about salesmen and where that person is coming from, it actually isn't very valid, not here at least anyway.</p>
              <p>For one thing, to assume that Christians by default hard-sell their faith is wrong.</p>
              <p>It's not like the Christian in question receives any monetary benefit and if you talk about divine benefits, well, if you don't believe in God then obviously the person is not getting benefits either.</p>
              <p>Besides, the person has only been trying to answer questions in response and provide points for consideration. Moreover has done so in as much good faith as possible, but even that person's patience and goodwill has been worn thin.</p>
              <p>It is in contrast (with respect to this topic) a few of the non-Christians (notifbly not all), who are trying to push their agenda upon others, by being mean, rude in response. That is the irony of it.</p>
              <p>I am quite sure in general here none of the Christians here expect any of you to 'buy' into anything or to really believe. But since questions have been asked, some have tried to answer politely.</p>
              <p>Yet there are those who are rude, made snide insinuating remarks and intentionally phrase things with every intention to provoke the same people who have tried to be patient in their replies.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Likewise, those who are posting just to make insults to the other, be it Christian or non-Christian are not doing right by anyone or anything either. At least to me they aren't. Likewise for those responding in only anger and wrath or in retaliation, it doesn't mean they are in the right either.</p>
              <p>You talk about being objectice, about not being blind, yet your blind hatred and the way you respond is exactly like those you are complaining about.</p>
