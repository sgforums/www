"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" Matt 18:20<br><br>otherwise, if the cell group is made for the purpose of expanding the church population through activities other than bible study (games, movie going, picnic, night safari, zoo tour, etc), ofcourse the leader will be pressured to get more people into the cell group.<br><br></div></blockquote>You got me right.<br>Cell CHURCH's main purpose is Growth and multiply.<br><br>L.Khong did state and used Peter Wagner's call growth theory to explain. As far as i can remember.<br><br>'If a Cell Group stays stagnant for 6 months, it is considered a dead cell, it should collapse and send the members to different Cell groups which are growing.' (someone care to correct on the exact period of time)<br><br>I think it is a honest approach since the cell is not moving, might as well eat humble pie and disperse them to a healthy cell.<br>Then again, it reaps pressure and stress.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chin Eng:</div><div class="quote_body">My church started the CG ministry basing on FCBC's philosophies and books  of Laurence Khong and Ralph Neighbour. In itself it is not wrong to base one's programme on a successful model. The problem happens when the model is seen to be God-ordained - ie cast-in-stone, unchangeable. I have major issues with the writers insisted on a 100% copy of the structure.<br><br>Success rates? MY OPINION ONLY: Well depending on how your look at it, you will get different interpretation. As with any given programme, there will be a level of success till a stagnation point. The stagnation point can be a physical one (ie church building cannot sustain the growth), or spiritual one (ie need a change in the "spiritual diet"). Either way, the buck stops there: ie the church stops growing. I see my the population of both the congregation remaining relatively the same over the years. People do come and go, but the potential is limited. The only way to do a physical growth is to embark on a different approach (ie megachurch style).<br>Back to my church's CG - the fact that there are CGs does not translate to a more caring church. I am actually see more b-itching (between pastor, some church members, leadership, etc) in the charismatic service than the traditional service. Here's not to say the traditional service is extremely holy - just a little more laid back. It is strange too, that I see some movement from charismatic to traditional recently, plus the trad svc has a fairly strong number of young people.<br><br>Tool of the devil??? A little too strong for me, ha ha.</div></blockquote>Yes, tool of the devil is a bit too strong, sorry, I retract.<br><br>CG emphasizes on leadership, nothing wrong. then those who are supposed to be leaders went through training sessions and on completion, they are like "all can do and know all" . Problem no. 1.<br><br>CG is often implemented as a completely new system, so old system taken off immediately, those holding on to the old system got hurt, no properly link, or hand over, misunderstanding and other problem follows. Problem no. 2.<br><br>CG emphasizes on result, competitions among leaders follows. Difficult members are asked to join other groups, all ways and means are taken to increase no. Caring only to those who come once a while, those who come regularly neglected (cause they are there so no need to care). Problem no. 3.<br><br>Members tend to depend solely on CG and neglected Sundays Schools, corporate prayers, ....other forms of "spiritual diets". Problem no. 4.<br><br>Now I see some churches using "purpose driven life" as The must do course for spiritual and church growth. Problem coming again.<br><br>I really don't want to appear whining, but it does seem that that too much emphasis is on the way to growth and these ways do not include love and caring as a must. At the end of the days, all these become part of church "activities" only. Am I too negative?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

You also get to feel the service of the waiters or waitresses, their smile, their attention to the minute details of your needs; and you get to enjoy the ambient of the restaurant, the music, the lighting, the noise (only in Chinese restaurant <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ), the table settings, the fine china ware, even the table cloth.<br><br>Some of the evangelical techniques are like having a Â“fast food ChristianityÂ”, a very interesting term from laoda99. you queue, you order, you pay, you get your burger, open you mouth big big, with a few bites you swallow, and you are on your way. You fill your stomach, how does it taste? all hamburgers are the same anywhere in the world.<br><br>Worship includes evangelism, and involves a lot more than evangelism; evangelism is not worship. Christians who attend worship will know what is evangelism but those who only know evangelism will miss out on the full extent of the beauty, the love and blessings in the presence of God.<br><br>my view.<br></div>
