            <div class='col-md body'>Religion and Sociology is closely related, esp the studies of Church system.<br><br>Cell Group was started because of the needs in individual.<br>There was this study by Max Weber and later studies by sociologist, to briefly put across.<br><br>The smaller the church, the more emotional, kinship, unity, expressions, openness and warmth.<br>The bigger the church, the opposites from above - Less expressive, less warmth, cliches formed for unity.<br>Though bigger churches also do have those listed above, but because there are too many people. each person can only minister or cater to what his/her capability.<br><br>When a church gets big, there are bound to have many 'strangers' or people you are not close to or don't know. That is when everyone will search for their 'group' for security/secure their social circle.<br><br>Cell group is a way is a social security to many.<br>Of cos, it have it's benefits.<br>But ultimately, CG is about security - concern party, sharing, social interaction.<br><br>All social groups have it's benefits.<br><br></div>

"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" Matt 18:20<br><br>otherwise, if the cell group is made for the purpose of expanding the church population through activities other than bible study (games, movie going, picnic, night safari, zoo tour, etc), ofcourse the leader will be pressured to get more people into the cell group.<br><br></div>
