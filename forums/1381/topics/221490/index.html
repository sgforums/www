            <div class='col-md body'>If its purely on some miracle healings and whatnot, i guess that would be good reading for Christians<br><br>But the content is inflammatory for some of its anti-religious content<br><br>especially this part<br><br>"The terrible, terrible lake of fire<br>The king of hell told me to look into the lake of fire. I looked and I saw the saffron colored robes that Buddhist monks wear in Myanmar. I looked closer and saw the shaven head of a man. When I looked at the man's face I saw it was U Zadila Kyar Ni Kan Sayadaw [the famous monk who had died in a car accident in 1983]. I asked the king of hell why my former leader was confined to this lake of torment. I said, "Why is he in this lake of fire? He was a very good teacher. He even had a teaching tape called 'Are You a Man or a Dog?' which had helped thousands of people understand that their worth as humans is far greater than the animals." The king of hell replied, "Yes, he was a good teacher but he did not believe in Jesus Christ. That's why he is in hell."<br><br>I was told to look at another person who was in the fire. I saw a man with very long hair wrapped on the left hand side of his head. He was also wearing a robe. I asked the king of hell, "Who is this man?" He replied, "This is the one you worship: Gautama [Buddha]." I was very disturbed to see Gautama in hell. I protested, "Gautama had good ethnics and good moral character, why is he suffering in this lake of fire?" The king of hell answered me, "It doesn't matter how good he was. He is in this place because he did not believe in the Eternal God."</div>

After<br>speaking to and exchanging Emails with Myanmar (Burmese) monks as<br>well as fellow Myanmar Buddhism experts in many countries, I am 100%<br>confident that this NDE story is completely fictitious. The reasons<br>are given below.<br><br>(1) All Burmese experts said they had never heard of the story<br>about this Myanmar Buddhist monk before.<br><br>(2) There is also no reports either in Burma or outside Burma of<br>mass defection of Myanmar Buddhist Monks to join the Christian<br>Church.<br><br>(3) The monk in the story said he became a novice at the age of<br>18. It is rather unusual as most boys Burmese boys join the monastic<br>life at younger age than 18.<br><br>(4) At the age of 19, he became a monk. This is also unusual as<br>the entry age for becoming a fully ordained monk is 20. (There is one<br>exception when one considers the foetal life while in the mother's<br>womb)<br><br>(5) U Zadila, also known as 'Kyar Ni Kan Sayadaw' was described as<br>probably the most famous Buddhist Teacher of the time. That is<br>disputable. Venerable Kyar Ni Kan Sayadaw was indeed well known and<br>very popular as public speaker and preacher. But he was not regarded<br>as the most distinguished monk academically and intellectually.<br><br>(6) The monk said 'Kyar Ni Kan Sayadaw' died in a car crash in<br>1983 . In fact Sayadaw died in Myanmar Era 1339 = about 1977. There<br>was a 6 years discrepancy which is unacceptable as the monk said he<br>studied under him. He should know the exact year when his teacher<br>died. And that 1977 was also the year when he became a monk. This<br>fact alone is enough to brand the story as a fake or invention.<br><br>(7) He said he was given a new name of 'U Nata Pannita<br>Ashinthuriya' when he entered the monastery. In Burma, the<br>title 'shin' was used for the novice. 'U' was never used for a<br>novice.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> The monk's new name itself was unusual nor unheard of,<br>according to the monks I consulted.<br><br>(9) Doctors diagnosed Malaria and Yellow fever. Actually the<br>Yellow Fever was not known to exist in Burma.<br><br>(10) To recover completely after very severe malaria is most<br>unusual especially after being discharged to die.<br><br>(11) To regain Life after the body started to decay (decompose) is<br>impossible according to conventional medical thinking.<br><br>There are other discrepancies regarding his actual NDE. But there<br>is no need to dig deeper. It is a complete FICTION.<br>It is very regrettable that a Christian Church was reported to be<br>involved in creating this dishonest practice.<br><br>We expect 'James' to say something about our findings. He is the<br>one who reported the story to the world media. After reading his<br>various postings to this forum, I believe that he is either a priest<br>or a serious Christian. We welcome his reply as well as the<br>communication from the Church authorities who wrote the Introduction<br>to this fictitious story and published in their regular bulletin.<br><br>Best wishes to all,<br><br>Melvin,<br><br>MyanmarBuddhist@n...</div>

Its Director, Paul Hatthaway,<br>has written several books, including Â‘The Heavenly ManÂ’.<br><br>For quite some time the Â‘resurrected Buddhist monkÂ’ story appeared on<br>the front page of the organisationÂ’s website. Then the actual story<br>was removed from their website, but a remaining reference to it<br>encouraged people to request a copy of the story by email. The<br>following explanation for the change, was given by the group at the<br>time:<br><br>Â‘A Quick Note: We have been asked by many people why this testimony<br>is no longer available on our website. We were ordered to remove the<br>story by the government of Singapore, who had apparently received<br>complaints from Buddhists. As our website is housed in Singapore at<br>the moment, we didnÂ’t have much choice.Â’<br><br>AMO/Asia Harvest introduced the story with the following<br>introduction:<br><br>Â‘The story that follows is simply a translation of a taped testimony<br>from a man with a life-changing story. It is not an interview or a<br>biography, but simply the words from the man himself. Different<br>people react in different ways when they hear this story. Some are<br>inspired, some skeptical, a few will mock and ridicule, while some<br>others have even been filled with rage and anger, convinced these<br>words are the ravings of a mad man or an elaborate deception. Some<br>Christians have opposed the story simply because the radical and<br>miraculous events described herein do not fit their feeble image of an<br>Almighty God.Â’<br><br>We were concerned with the above wording and commented in our 2001<br>report that it was interesting to note the approach they took in the<br>introduction. Anyone who questioned the story would immediately be<br>labelled as a sceptic, a mocker or ridiculer, someone filled with rage<br>and anger, or worse a Christian whose concept of God is feeble and who<br>does not believe that an Almighty God can be radical and perform<br>miracles.<br><br>This could be seen by some as a form of bullying and intimidation to<br>dismiss any form of thought and questioning of the story. It is not a<br>healthy or biblical approach to dealing with questions about such a<br>dramatic story, nor does it encourage people to use their minds.<br><br>The resurrected monkÂ’s story was quite a dramatic tale and it has<br>impressed many people. It was even reported in the well-known<br>Christian Singaporean magazine: IMPACT (June/July 2000, p.45). It<br>continued to be circulated and passed on through emails for some time.<br><br>But was it true? If it was, it SHOULD be circulated - whatever the<br>consequences. But what if it was NOT true? Should it then continue to<br>be circulated never-the-less? We believe not!<br><br>It should be noted that there have been several versions of the story<br>circulating. One version, which was circulating in March and April of<br>2000, began with an Â‘ExtractÂ’:<br><br>Â‘Myanmar: Buddhist monk raised from the dead - 300 monks turn to<br>Jesus. Â“In 1998, a Buddhist monk died. A few days later, his funeral<br>was held, at which he was to be cremated. From the smell, it was<br>obvious that his body had started to decompose - he was very clearly<br>dead!Â” according to the report from missions agency Asian Minorities<br>Outreach. Â“We have attempted to verify this report which reached us<br>from a number of sources, and are now convinced that it is accurate,Â”<br>they write.<br><br>Hundreds of monks and relatives of the dead man attended the funeral.<br>Just as the body was about to be burned, the dead monk suddenly sat<br>up, shouting Â‘ItÂ’s a lie! I saw our ancestors burning and being<br>tortured in some sort of fire. I also saw Buddha and many other<br>Buddhist holy men. They were all in a sea of fire!Â’ Â‘We must listen to<br>the Christians,Â’ he continued emphatically, Â‘theyÂ’re the only ones who<br>know the truth!Â’<br><br>The events shocked the whole region. Over 300 monks became Christians<br>and started to study the Bible. The resurrected man continued to warn<br>everyone to believe in Jesus, because he is the only true God. Tapes<br>of the monkÂ’s report were distributed throughout Myanmar. The Buddhist<br>hierarchy and the government were soon alarmed, and they arrested the<br>monk. He has not been seen since and it is feared that he was killed<br>to keep him silent. It is now a serious crime to listen to the tapes,<br>because the government wants to dampen the sensation.Â’<br><br>On Sunday 19th November 2000, CCG MinistriesÂ’ Director, Adrian van<br>Leen, interviewed and spoke with a man who claimed to be the<br>Â‘resurrectedÂ’ Paul in a hotel function room in Yangon in the company<br>of four Myanmar Christian leaders.<br><br>That interview raised serious questions as to the authenticity of the<br>story under consideration.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our detailed review of the interview with the man claiming to be Paul,<br>the Â‘resurrectedÂ’ monk, was published as a report, sent to Asia<br>Harvest, and placed on our website. After emailing a copy of the<br>report, we also sent a Â‘hardÂ’ copy of the TACL containing the printed<br>article, to Asia Harvest. In the latter part of 2003 we received the<br>following email from Asia Harvest:<br><br><strong>Greetings!</strong><br><br>IÂ’m sure you will remember our communications a year or two back<br>regarding the story of the Buddhist monk in Myanmar who came back to<br>life. We were the ones who first had his testimony translated and<br>published on our website.<br><br>Then you travelled to Myanmar and met with a man regarding this story.<br>Your graphic report of that interview, his seemingly unstable mind and<br>completely inconsistent testimony left us with no option but to<br>withdraw the story from our website and offer our deep apologies. The<br>last thing we want to do is discredit the name of our Lord Jesus by<br>publishing any story that is untrue. I wrote to you of our intentions<br>and you accurately reported,<br><br>[After Asia Harvest received a copy of this report they removed all<br>references to the story from their website and stopped sending out<br>email transcripts of the claimed resurrection account. They will be<br>making some statement regarding their initial endorsement of the<br>story. When this is available we will gladly append it to this<br>report.]<br><br>However, when we received your magazine article which carried a<br>picture of the man you interviewed, we showed it to two Burmese<br>pastors who met the original Â“PaulÂ” in Myanmar and they immediately<br>said this was the wrong man! Later a missionary who lives here in<br>Thailand but who works in Myanmar also said the man you interviewed<br>looks nothing like the monk, being much younger.<br><br>More information since has revealed that there are actually three or<br>four different people in Myanmar who claim they were monks who rose<br>from the dead! Our contacts in Yangon (Rangoon) say that two of these<br>are completely untrustworthy men, with little evidence of a genuine<br>conversion to Christ. One of these is the young man you interviewed.<br>No wonder his birth-date and other key facts were different from the<br>testimony we published - it was not the same person! It almost seems<br>that Satan sent along these counterfeits with false testimonies and a<br>poor witness in order to discredit the original testimony.<br><br>Can we absolutely guarantee the story we published is true - of<br>course not. Only God and the person involved can know what happened in<br>such a story. We stated this when we first released the transcript of<br>his testimony. But as far as can be verified, we have yet to be<br>convinced that this testimony is false. We have been told it now seems<br>likely that the monk Paul was killed. He was in hiding for more than<br>12 months and has not been heard of since. Another ex-monk who lives<br>in Shan State, who also converted to Christ through miraculous<br>circumstances is also being hunted by the authorities in a bid to<br>silence him.<br><br>In the interests of fairness, would you be willing to publish our<br>comments in this email with the story that is on your website?<br><br>God bless you,<br><br>Asia Harvest</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, this update from Asia Harvest still fails to answer<br>many of the questions and issues CCG Ministries raised in our report<br>initially.<br><br>Our report had already acknowledged that there were several people in<br>Myanmar (Burma) claiming to be the Â‘resurrectedÂ’ monk: Further<br>complications have arisen with this whole saga. According to the<br>beliefs of some people in Myanmar (or some with friends and/or<br>relatives in Myanmar), several different people supposedly, or<br>apparently, are claiming to be the resurrected Buddhist monk - at<br>least an older man and a not-so-balanced young man.<br><br>Even if we completely remove the questionable Â‘PaulÂ’ interviewed by<br>CCG MinistriesÂ’ Director and several Myanmar Pastors, we are still<br>left with serious questions about the whole story anyway. These were<br>made clear in our 2001 report and remain unanswered by the recent<br>comments from Asia harvest.<br><br>Apart from the contradictions made by [the suspect] Paul in front of<br>witnesses, there are still serious questions about the content of his<br>[the Â‘original Â‘PaulÂ’] supposed visions or visit to hell and heaven,<br>as well as questions about editorial comments made by Asian Minorities<br>Outreach/Asia Harvest.<br><br>AMO/Asia Harvest has made statements about Paul being radically<br>transformed and having a 180-degree shift in his life, and him<br>continuing to be a fearless witness for Christ, of him being<br>persecuted, scorned by family, friends and colleagues, and facing<br>death for his unwillingness to compromise. But some Myanmar Christian<br>leaders have asked (as we do also) on what do they base this, apart<br>from his say so [or the say-so of unnamed pastors whose comments seem<br>in clear conflict with that of the majority of pastors Â– especially<br>from known established churches and denominations]? What evidence do<br>they have?<br><br>Statements that [the Â‘originalÂ’] Paul had been arrested and<br>imprisoned - probably several times, not seen since, and that it was<br>feared that he had been killed to keep him silent - are all highly<br>emotive. While claims of imprisonment in such a situation are<br>plausible and even probable, they remain unsubstantiated.<br><br>AMO/Asia Harvest has stated that the story was first told them by<br>several Burmese church leaders, and that since being initially told<br>they Â‘have attempted to verify this report which reached us from a<br>number of sources, and are now convinced that it is accurate.Â’ IMPACT<br>Magazine reported that a spokesman for AMO/Asia Harvest stated: Â‘We<br>believe it to be true as there are many witnesses to these events.Â’<br><br>CCG MinistriesÂ’ Director, Adrian van Leen, before, especially during,<br>and after his visit to Myanmar in November 2000, [and subsequent<br>visits in 2001 and 2002] has spoken to a number of [numerous] Myanmar<br>Christian leaders - including a number who are involved in<br>inter-church/inter-denominational work, as well as leaders of several<br>denominations. He spoke with leaders from Yangon and across Myanmar<br>who attended a conference in Bago, and also Christian leaders in<br>Mandalay and a regional township. Many of these leaders from across<br>varying denominations had contact with other Christian leaders across<br>the country.<br><br>No one was able to give ANY form of authentication to the story. A<br>number of leaders, including those who had been in Christian<br>leadership in Mandalay, knew of no evidence to confirm any part of the<br>story. Some of the Myanmar Christian leaders would very much like to<br>know who the Â‘several Burmese church leadersÂ’ are that AMO/Asia<br>Harvest refers to as their sources for this story.<br><br>In fact, it was pointed out very clearly that, had the story been<br>true, especially had there been a number of Buddhist monks converted<br>to Christianity - especially as many as 300 and very much so if there<br>were as many as 7,000 - the news would have spread rapidly. While the<br>government-controlled media might have tried to suppress such news -<br>the Christians and churches (particularly in the Mandalay area) would<br>not have been able - nor have wanted to - suppress such news. It would<br>have spread rapidly and widely through the churches. The Buddhist<br>community would also have spread the story - though for different<br>reasons.<br><br>The claim that Â’there are many witnesses to these eventsÂ’ is also<br>disputed by Myanmar Christian leaders, who have stated that they had<br>never met anyone who had been a direct primary witness - nor anyone<br>who had personally met a direct witness to these eventsÂ… The reality<br>is that in Myanmar itself no one has been able to find any witnesses<br>or any evidence whatever, to support the story of the resurrected<br>Paul.<br><br>It was also pointed out that [the Â‘originalÂ’] PaulÂ’s claim to have<br>seen Aung San, the revolutionary leader of Myanmar (father of current<br>opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi) in hell Â‘because he persecuted<br>and killed Christians, but mostly because he didnÂ’t believe in Jesus<br>ChristÂ’ was completely without foundation. He is a well known figure<br>in Burmese/Myanmar thinking and history - and there is no evidence at<br>all that he persecuted any Christians, let alone killed any.<br><br>AMO/Asia Harvest has invited Â‘Christian believers to judge it [PaulÂ’s<br>resurrection story] according to Scripture.Â’<br><br>As one senior Myanmar pastor pointed out, the story and description<br>of hell given by Paul, is itself contrary to Scripture. PaulÂ’s story<br>is also in conflict with the story Jesus told in the account of the<br>rich man and the beggar, Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). When carefully<br>examined it is also in conflict with the comments of the Apostle Paul<br>in 1 Corinthians 15 - in particular where that Paul was able to name<br>eye witnesses to the resurrection of Christ - and acknowledged at the<br>time that some were still living - in other words, he was able to<br>produce witnesses who could testify to the authenticity of his claims.<br><br>Pastors in Myanmar are still asking for real evidence and living<br>witnesses to the claimed miracle with whom they can discuss and verify<br>the story. So far, the storyÂ’s authenticity remains with the claims<br>made by Asia Harvest.<br><br>The story of the Â‘resurrected PaulÂ’ is known throughout much of<br>Myanmar - and his tape has circulated (in several versions). Hardly<br>anyone in Myanmar - especially amongst Christian leaders - has<br>accepted or believed the story. There is just nothing to back it up.<br><br>Far from the Â‘resurrected monkÂ’ story providing a Â‘fearless and<br>faithful witness to Jesus Christ, whose testimony is converting<br>Buddhists, strengthening the church or bringing glory to GodÂ’s nameÂ’,<br>Myanmar pastor have told our Director that it has brought fear and<br>suspicion to many Christians in the country. We concluded our 2001<br>report with the comment: Whatever the truth behind this sad saga,<br>most Christians, and most pastors and church leaders in Myanmar, are<br>not taking this story seriously and see little value in it for the<br>growth of the Christian community in that country.<br><br>From the evidence we have been able to examine, including the claims<br>and content of the story itself, and all the discussions with Pastors<br>and others in Myanmar, we believe it would have been wiser for the<br>story not to have been published and circulated.<br><br>We believe that Â‘miracle storiesÂ’ which cannot be adequately<br>substantiated ought to be treated with caution Â– especially if those<br>stories, or significant parts of those stories, do not conform to<br>Scripture. Lives continue to be changed by the resurrected and living<br>Jesus Christ Â– sometimes dramatically, sometimes quietly Â– the<br>substance of those changed lives are quiet miracles that are often<br>clear and undisputed. They continue to honour Christ and encourage<br>others.</div>

I looked and I saw the saffron colored robes that Buddhist monks wear in Myanmar. I looked closer and saw the shaven head of a man. When I looked at the man's face I saw it was U Zadila Kyar Ni Kan Sayadaw [the famous monk who had died in a car accident in 1983]. I asked the king of hell why my former leader was confined to this lake of torment. I said, "Why is he in this lake of fire? He was a very good teacher. He even had a teaching tape called 'Are You a Man or a Dog?' which had helped thousands of people understand that their worth as humans is far greater than the animals." The king of hell replied, "Yes, he was a good teacher but he did not believe in Jesus Christ. That's why he is in hell."<br><br>I was told to look at another person who was in the fire. I saw a man with very long hair wrapped on the left hand side of his head. He was also wearing a robe. I asked the king of hell, "Who is this man?" He replied, "This is the one you worship: Gautama [Buddha]." I was very disturbed to see Gautama in hell. I protested, "Gautama had good ethnics and good moral character, why is he suffering in this lake of fire?" The king of hell answered me, "It doesn't matter how good he was. He is in this place because he did not believe in the Eternal God."</div></blockquote>Well that's ok <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Thanks Diehard for posting this too.. at least gave me an opportunity to debunk this article (anyway I have long knew about this article)<br><br>LOTS of forwarded emails I receive especially those that ask you to forward to others (99%) are really just loads of crap.. don't you agree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
