              <p>There are many young men in Singapore who are homosexuals or bisexuals. Some of them are also either curious or confused about their sexual orientation. A minority of these young men are actually struggling with unwanted homosexual feelings and desires --- they want to change but do not know <em>how</em> to.</p>
              <p>There is a blog meant for these young men to offer them hope in Christ and to help them battle with homosexuality.</p>
              <p>Please visit The Truth Sets You Free at <a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/</strong></a></p>
              <p>The target audience of this blog is not just meant for Christians --- any person who wishes to overcome homosexuality will find it very useful as it essentially encourages and motivates him to persevere in his desire to change.</p>
              <p>There are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Christian pastoral</span> articles but there are also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">secular scientific</span> ones, so there is a good balance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">religion</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">psychology</span>.</p>
              <p>Why this blog was set up is because many young men find disclosing their struggles with homosexuality a threat. Perhaps due to societal and cultural stigma, most prefer to be discreet and choose to fight alone and therefore if these young men are unable to speak to their pastors or find a counsellor/therapist, they can visit this blog to find help and hope that <em>change is possible</em>.</p>
              <p>The Truth Sets You Free (<a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/</strong></a>) also seeks to reach out to homosexuals who do not see the need to change. The blog provides valuable insights and arguments why homosexuality is not normal and not natural and thus against God's design and purpose.</p>
              <p>If you know any person who is struggling with homosexuality and wishes to change, please spread the word about this blog. Thank you very much and may our God be glorified and His will be done.</p>

I think no Christian will have any issues or difficulties accepting that --- what is controversial are really the various interpretations of the Scriptures. The problem now is that there is a revisionist theological understanding of the Bible which supports homosexuality rather than damning it as a sin.</span></p>

They struggle with these unwanted homosexual feelings and desires but have no idea how they come about. They wrestle with guilt and depression and now it is time they know help is available.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Finally, I am very certain there are many homosexuals out there who WANT to change but do not know HOW to.

              <p> Why should a homosexual change just to please or pander to your religious views? You are just being selfish and unaccepting to the minorities of society.</p>

              <p>i duno, but i think sometimes its genetics, but most of the time
              its culture. There wasnt alot of homosexuals in the past (or maybe
              were not publicised enough)</p>

              <p>It is genetic.</p>
              <p>There are.... actually. If I'm not wrong, there were 3 chinese homosexual emperors in the past. Qian Long, Han Wudi and Han Aidi. Of course there are more, I'm just stating the chinese emperors.</p>
              <p>The reason why you think there are 'more' homosexuals now is because, people are much more open these days and are willing to come out the closet.</p>

              <p>Dear all</p>
              <p>From the limited knowledge I have about homosexuality, I gather that it is a form of gender identity disorder. The American Psychological Association (APA) used to consider homosexuality as a disorder until 1973 when the gay lobby and activists pressured the APA to remove homosexuality from its diagnostic manual (it is like a directory of diseases) and ever since no counsellor or therapist would consider homosexuality as a disorder.</p>
              <p>But there are psychoanalysts and psychiatrists (not necessarily Christian!) who still believe and recognise that homosexuality is a gender identity disorder and therefore venture into research to explore how homosexuality is developed and experiment with what can be done to change a homosexual's orientation.</p>
              <p>If you visit my website <a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/</strong></a><strong> </strong>you will find many interesting articles, reports, essays and excerpts from both the Christian pastoral and secular scientific perspectives about homosexuality. Hopefully any visitor to my website will see that there is intellectual integrity. Most of what I put up contributes significantly to scholarly discussion about homosexuality.</p>
              <p>As for "love the sinner and hate the sin", what it essentially means that we separate the homosexual person from his homosexual orientation. Jesus Christ is --- quoting the gospels --- "a friend of sinners." Jesus Christ does not condemn the homosexual any more than He does to a rapist, liar, murderer or thief. But homosexuality is a sin and God does not tolerate homosexuality at all. In other words, by reaching out to unwilling homosexuals who are struggling and helping them to change, this is a gesture of Christian love.</p>
              <p>I do not and cannot, so to speak, force a homosexual to change --- the homosexual himself ought to have the desire to change in the first place.</p>

              <p>For any homosexuals struggling with unwanted feelings and desires, please be encouraged in persevering to fight a good fight of faith. Our God will grant you the strength you need.</p>
              <p>Here are two insightful articles that are highly recommended:</p>
              <p>1. <strong>I'm Not Gay<br></strong><a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/im-not-gay/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/im-not-gay/</strong></a><br>This is a real life account of a Christian who has changed from his homosexual past</p>
              <p>2. <strong>The Limitations of Homosexual Love<br></strong><a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/the-limitations-of-homosexual-love/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/the-limitations-of-homosexual-love/</strong></a><br>This explains why homosexual love will never be complete, psychologically and sexually.</p>
              <p>Please do not give up! May our Holy Spirit sustain you...</p>
              <p>As for those who do not yet know Jesus Christ, I pray that you will be saved from your sins and find true meaning and happiness in life!</p>
