              <p>Dear all</p>
              <p>From the limited knowledge I have about homosexuality, I gather that it is a form of gender identity disorder. The American Psychological Association (APA) used to consider homosexuality as a disorder until 1973 when the gay lobby and activists pressured the APA to remove homosexuality from its diagnostic manual (it is like a directory of diseases) and ever since no counsellor or therapist would consider homosexuality as a disorder.</p>
              <p>But there are psychoanalysts and psychiatrists (not necessarily Christian!) who still believe and recognise that homosexuality is a gender identity disorder and therefore venture into research to explore how homosexuality is developed and experiment with what can be done to change a homosexual's orientation.</p>
              <p>If you visit my website <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/</strong></a><strong> </strong>you will find many interesting articles, reports, essays and excerpts from both the Christian pastoral and secular scientific perspectives about homosexuality. Hopefully any visitor to my website will see that there is intellectual integrity. Most of what I put up contributes significantly to scholarly discussion about homosexuality.</p>
              <p>As for "love the sinner and hate the sin", what it essentially means that we separate the homosexual person from his homosexual orientation. Jesus Christ is --- quoting the gospels --- "a friend of sinners." Jesus Christ does not condemn the homosexual any more than He does to a rapist, liar, murderer or thief. But homosexuality is a sin and God does not tolerate homosexuality at all. In other words, by reaching out to unwilling homosexuals who are struggling and helping them to change, this is a gesture of Christian love.</p>
              <p>I do not and cannot, so to speak, force a homosexual to change --- the homosexual himself ought to have the desire to change in the first place.</p>

              <p>Indeed, homosexuality is a very controversial topic matter. This is why open and free dialogue from both sides ought to be encouraged.</p>
              <p>Technically speaking, in a sense, you are right when you said that being a homosexual is not "wrong." But do also note that I am not referring to the "wrongness" of homosexuality in the societal or cultural sense. As a Christian, and because this is a Christian forum, I believe that homosexuality is a sin against God.</p>
              <p>Finally, just to clarify --- I abide by the Biblical principle of loving the sinner and hating the sin. That is, I have nothing against homosexuals but everything against homosexuality.</p>

              <p>All Christians recognise that crimes such as stealing, lying and killing are sins against God. All Christians acknowledge such sins to be morally bad and wrong.</p>
              <p>Yet Jesus Christ never condemns thieves, liars and murderers. This is not a contradiction. Although stealing, lying and killing are sins against God, Jesus Christ does not condemn thieves, liars and murderers.</p>
              <p>Why is this so?</p>
              <p>Essentially, the Biblical principle is "love the sinner, hate the sin." In other words, the soul is of infinite value and worth in God's eyes and thus God loves sinners. However, God will not tolerate their sins.</p>
              <p>In Christianity, God's justice and love are two sides of the same coin. As we are sinners who have fallen from grace, we deserve eternal punishment, we deserve hell. This is God's justice. On the other hand, God loves us despite we are sinners. Therefore God sent His only begotten Son that He may die on the cross and rise on the third day so that whoever believes in Jesus Christ in faith will be saved. This is God's love.</p>
              <p>So we must look at Christianity from this perspective --- how God's justice and love is found in Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>There are many passages in God's Word that tell us why homosexuality is a sin and God damns it. The Biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah, the epistle of Jude, the first epistle to the Corinthians, and of course the Old Testamental laws found in Leviticus etc.</p>
              <p>Actually it is not only the Christians who are against homosexuality --- the Muslims are too. The Buddhists are more accepting of homosexuality but most would see it that the homosexual must have committed certain crimes in his past life and thus reaping what he sowed in this life as a punishment (?)</p>
              <p>Finally, why certain psychoanalysts and psychiatrists say that homosexuality is a gender identity disorder is because they believe that all of us are born heterosexual but certain psychological, physiological, social-interactionist, and environmental factors during our childhood and formative years changed us in how we relate ourselves to members of the same gender.</p>
              <p><strong>When our self-esteem and self-identification is not affirmed by members of the same gender, we become "lost" and "incomplete" and thus become gays or lesbians because we are constantly finding love in other gays or lesbians to fill the void inside us.</strong></p>
              <p>Note that people <strong>become</strong> homosexuals, and not born homosexuals. Emphasis on "becoming" because it is a <strong>process</strong> and this process usually takes place since very young and if our sexual orientation does not develop the way it ought to (due to psychological, physiological, social-interactionist, environmental factors etc), we will have what scientists call gender identity disorder.</p>

              <p><br>The Old Testament was written in the Hebrew tongue. In other words, before we can say whether homosexuality was condemned as a sin or not, we ought to examine the original language.</p>
              <p>For instance, <em>qades</em> translated as "cult prostitute" in Deuteronomy in our English Bibles, points particularly to sodomites (homosexuals).</p>
              <p>Homosexuality was a sin, universally and not circumstantially --- Leviticus 18 and 20 tell us that homosexuality was condemned not only because it violated a purity code which was meant to distinguish the Jews from the gentiles but because, above all, it was against God's design for human sexuality. Homosexuality is a sin against God, it displeases God because it goes against a person's nature.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Leviticus 18: 22 and 20: 13 clearly describe homosexual behaviour, with the second passage calling for the death penalty. The words <em>abomination</em> or <em>detestable</em> occur in both passages. Among the vices listed in the two chapters, this is the only one singled out as an “abomination,” and this use occurs twice. It speaks to severity and provides a link to Ezekiel 16: 50, where the prophet identifies Sodom’s sin as an “abomination.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">As a whole, Leviticus 18 - 20 forms a special section within Leviticus that transcends Israel’s cult or ritual. In significance the text approaches Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, where the Ten Commandments occur. These texts are universal in scope. No mention is made of sacrifice, ritual, or ceremony, as in the rest of Leviticus. The sins of this section, commonly referred to as the “Code of Holiness,” are child sacrifice, religious prostitution, spiritism and consulting mediums, cursing parents, adultery, incest, bigamy, homosexuality and bestiality.

Frequently they cite the “second commandment”: “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” (19: 18). Surely they saw this section as embodying universal standards of morality.

              <p>Your statement "repentance is not Biblical" is suspicious. I am not quite sure what you mean by that --- it will be good if you can clarify.</p>
              <p>Indeed, when we first come before God, God will accept us no matter what we shape or size we are in. God accepts us unconditionally despite our sins. Regardless of our past, when we have faith in Jesus Christ, we are saved by God's grace.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, once saved, God is NOT contented to leave us remain the way we are. God will send the Holy Spirit into our hearts and change us. Once we have been washed by Jesus Christ's sacred blood, we are "new creatures" born again unto God, and we will have to lead holy lives as children of God.</p>
              <p>If we are to lead godly lives that are pleasing in the sight of God, our corruption will have to be purged. This lifelong spiritual process is sanctification. And REPENTANCE characterises what sanctification is about --- to change, and to change for the better in order to be holy as God is holy.</p>
              <p>We have no power to do so but God will grant us the strength to fight a good fight of faith.</p>
              <p>In the Gospels, we have ample instances where Jesus Christ commands us to repent. Here are a few:</p>
              <p><strong>Matthew 4: 17 --- "From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Luke 5: 32 --- "I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Luke 13: 3 --- "No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And finally, Luke 15: 10 --- "Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</strong></p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>Homosexuality is a sin but Jesus Christ died and rose on the third day to save sinners, not the righteous. In other words, there is HELP and HOPE for struggling homosexuals in overcoming their unwanted feelings and desires.</p>

              <p>Here are the Old Testament references to repentance, as requested:</p>
              <p>After God confronts Job, Job says in<br>Job 42: 5-6<br>"I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you; therefore I despise myself, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">repent</span></strong><sup> </sup>in dust and ashes."</p>
              <p>In the Psalms, the wrath and punishment of God is described in<br>Psalm 7: 11-13<br>"God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day. If a man does not <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">repent</span></strong>, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow; he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts."</p>
              <p>Jeremiah describes how God is disappointed with the stubborness of His people in<br>Jeremiah 5: 3<br>"O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You have struck them down, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction.They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">repent</span></strong>."</p>
              <p>Ezekiel 14: 6<br>"Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Repent</span></strong> and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations."</p>
              <p>Ezekiel 18: 30<br>"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Repent</span></strong> and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin."</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>As we can see, repentance is Biblical. Both the Old and New Testaments require and expect the Jews and Christians to repent. Repent essentially means to change one's mind and heart. In other words, when a person repents, he is actually changing his mind and heart about sinning --- he hates sin and is determined to not sin.</p>
              <p>Yet, only the Holy Spirit can help us in our battle with sin. May God sustain and strengthen those who struggle with unwanted homosexual feelings and desires and see that there is help, and there is hope.....</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by thetruthsetsyoufree:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br>The Old Testament was written in the Hebrew tongue. In other words, before we can say whether homosexuality was condemned as a sin or not, we ought to examine the original language.</p>
              <p>For instance, <em>qades</em> translated as "cult prostitute" in Deuteronomy in our English Bibles, points particularly to sodomites (homosexuals).</p>
              <p>Homosexuality was a sin, universally and not circumstantially --- Leviticus 18 and 20 tell us that homosexuality was condemned not only because it violated a purity code which was meant to distinguish the Jews from the gentiles but because, above all, it was against God's design for human sexuality. Homosexuality is a sin against God, it displeases God because it goes against a person's nature.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Leviticus 18: 22 and 20: 13 clearly describe homosexual behaviour, with the second passage calling for the death penalty. The words <em>abomination</em> or <em>detestable</em> occur in both passages. Among the vices listed in the two chapters, this is the only one singled out as an “abomination,” and this use occurs twice. It speaks to severity and provides a link to Ezekiel 16: 50, where the prophet identifies Sodom’s sin as an “abomination.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">As a whole, Leviticus 18 - 20 forms a special section within Leviticus that transcends Israel’s cult or ritual. In significance the text approaches Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, where the Ten Commandments occur. These texts are universal in scope. No mention is made of sacrifice, ritual, or ceremony, as in the rest of Leviticus. The sins of this section, commonly referred to as the “Code of Holiness,” are child sacrifice, religious prostitution, spiritism and consulting mediums, cursing parents, adultery, incest, bigamy, homosexuality and bestiality. None of these are limited to Israel’s own purity code.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Other considerations support their universal significance. The New Testament cites Leviticus 19 as a universal code. Jesus cites Leviticus 19 as universal (Matthew 5: 33, 43; 19: 19; 22: 37-40), as do Paul (Romans 10: 5; 13: 8-10; 2 Corinthians 6: 14ff.; Galatians 3: 12; 5: 14), Peter (1 Peter 1: 14-16), and James (2: 8). Frequently they cite the “second commandment”: “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” (19: 18). Surely they saw this section as embodying universal standards of morality. The prohibitions of Leviticus 19 repeat or reflect on the Ten Commandments, including prohibitions of stealing, lying, deceiving, swearing falsely, and cursing (19: 11-12).</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Although some instructions and prohibitions of chapters 18 and 20 are limited to Israel (distinguishing clean and unclean animals and having sexual relations with one’s wife during her menstrual period), most are not. The context itself distinguishes limited, cultic prostitutions from universal prohibitions. The reader is able to discern which laws are universal. In addition, the similarity of these chapters to the Ten Commandments and the New Testament’s application of this section warrant consideration of most of these rules as valid. Prohibitions of homosexuality elsewhere in the Old Testament, ancient Judaism, the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, and in the New Testament also justify the interpretation that the prohibtion is universal.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Application of the death penalty in 20: 13 must be a factor in our consideration. It raises homosexuality from the level of a simple social or civil concern to the category of a crime against society.</p>

              <p>Indeed, all of us are sinners in the eyes of God.</p>

              <p>However, it is also good that we see this in the perspective that after the Fall, sin has entered Creation. In other words, all things created by God is fallen and corrupted, including us.</p>
              <p>What matters is that we recognise that God loves SINNERS and hates sins. Being a Christian means that the Holy Spirit will slowly but surely change us --- in time to come, by God's grace, we will sin "less" and be "more" holy.</p>
              <p>But we MUST know <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span></strong> to change.

              <p>I can farking bet you are a first-timer in this forum. God is a delusion.</p>
              <p>You are wrong in understanding that man is capable of developing homosexuality. The correct term is that man is only capable of developing sexuality by nature, whether it's hetro or homo is beyond anyone's guess.</p>
              <p>In fact, in nature, bonobos have homosexual traits or rather are bisexual. If man is similar physiologically to bonobos, homosexuality is naturally developed.</p>

              <p>The following is an excerpt from  <a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/gay-birds-and-bees-is-homosexuality-really-unnatural/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/gay-birds-and-bees-is-homosexuality-really-unnatural/</strong></a></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Oslo Natural History Museum recently opened the world’s first exhibit documenting cases of “homosexual” behavior in nature. The exhibit suggests that because animals such as penguins, parrots, beetles, whales, giraffes, and others display certain behaviors that could be construed as homosexual, then homosexuality among humans cannot be viewed as “unnatural.” One of the statements on the exhibit reads: “We may have opinions on a lot of things, but one thing is clear-homosexuality is found throughout the animal kingdom, it is not against nature” (Doyle, 2006).</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In response to such thinking, several points need to be considered. <strong>Humans are not animals.</strong> There is <em>no</em> documented evidence verifying the false idea that humans evolved from lower organisms (see Harrub and Thompson, 2002). In fact, all observable evidence verifies that humans maintain a completely unique status in regard to their mental, emotional, and cognitive components (see “In the Image…,” 2001; Lyons and Thompson, 2002). <strong>To justify human behavior based on behavior observed in the animal world exhibits a grotesque ignorance of everything humans understand about morality.</strong> Ten percent of the diet of an adult Komodo dragon often consists of its cannibalizing young Komodo dragons. Would anyone be so irrationally disturbed as to suggest that because we see infant cannibalism in Komodo dragons it is a natural practice for humans that cannot be classified as “unnatural”? The ploy to justify homosexuality by suggesting that it is “natural” is little more than an attempt to cast aside all <strong><em>moral constraints</em></strong> and debase society to the point of mindless bestiality.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span lang="EN">In truth, homosexuality is against nature, that is, the natural way that God </span></strong><em><strong><span lang="EN">designed</span></strong></em><strong><span lang="EN"> humans to function.</span></strong><span lang="EN"> The inspired apostle Paul condemned homosexuality as a sin:</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the <strong>natural</strong> <strong>use</strong> for what is <strong>against nature</strong>. Likewise also the men, leaving the <strong>natural use</strong> of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due (Romans 1:26-27).</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Homosexuality goes against <em>human nature</em> in at least two fundamental ways. <strong>First, on a basic physical, anatomical level, homosexuality disregards the natural use of the sexual organs of men and women. Humans were </strong><em><strong>designed</strong></em><strong> to be sexually compatible in order to reproduce and bear offspring</strong> (see Genesis 1:28). If homosexuality were a natural, genetic occurrence (which it is not — see Harrub and Miller, 2004), the genes responsible for it would quickly disappear due to the inability of same sex couples to reproduce. Second, God designed men and women to be capable of a relationship in marriage unlike any other human relationship. When a man and a woman are joined together, they become “one-flesh,” a biblical phrase that describes the epitome of intimacy and compatibility (Genesis 2:23). God specifically designed Eve, and all future women, to be perfect helpers suitable for Adam, and subsequent men. And, while it is true that sinful humans often fail to achieve the intimacy and oneness designed by God, it is not because of faulty design, but of people’s sinful decisions. <strong>God designed men and women to be naturally compatible both physically and emotionally.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If human behavior can be justified based on the idea that it mimics animal behavior, then why not abolish all laws, allow stronger humans to kill the weaker ones, allow mothers to eat their babies, allow men to murder sexual rivals, allow women to murder and cannibalize their lovers after intercourse, and simply chalk such a deplorable situation up to “nature”? The logical consequences of such a philosophical justification are as obvious as they are ridiculous. <strong>God created humans, so He knows what is in accordance with human nature, and He has clearly stated that homosexuality is aberrant, unnatural, sinful behavior.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>1. All of us are born with a soul. We are made for eternity --- though our body corrupts, our soul lives.</p>
              <p>2. As we are made in the image of God, our lives "breathed" by God, we are capable of being spiritual. In other words, we are spiritual creatures.</p>
              <p>3. The fact that we ask abstract questions such as "what is the meaning of life?" and "what lies beyond the grave?" means that we have desires that cannot be met in this world.</p>
              <p>4. As C.S. Lewis once said, if we have desires and they can't be met in this world, it means that we are made for another.</p>
              <p>5. We seek to fill the void inside us by seeking purpose and meaning in life, however this void can only be filled by God.</p>
              <p>6. God made the animals but He made Adam and Eve separately --- that is, in the Genesis account, we see that mankind was created separately from the animals which is an illustration that we are not animals, or at least we are different from the animals.</p>
              <p>7. God created everything --- the air, the mountains, the trees, the sheep, and mankind. But only human beings are capable of spirituality.</p>
