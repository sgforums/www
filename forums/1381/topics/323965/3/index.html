              <p>1. All of us are born with a soul. We are made for eternity --- though our body corrupts, our soul lives.</p>
              <p>2. As we are made in the image of God, our lives "breathed" by God, we are capable of being spiritual. In other words, we are spiritual creatures.</p>
              <p>3. The fact that we ask abstract questions such as "what is the meaning of life?" and "what lies beyond the grave?" means that we have desires that cannot be met in this world.</p>
              <p>4. As C.S. Lewis once said, if we have desires and they can't be met in this world, it means that we are made for another.</p>
              <p>5. We seek to fill the void inside us by seeking purpose and meaning in life, however this void can only be filled by God.</p>
              <p>6. God made the animals but He made Adam and Eve separately --- that is, in the Genesis account, we see that mankind was created separately from the animals which is an illustration that we are not animals, or at least we are different from the animals.</p>
              <p>7. God created everything --- the air, the mountains, the trees, the sheep, and mankind. But only human beings are capable of spirituality.</p>

              <p>I am not very sure what you mean when you say "that law is a relic from the past." Perhaps you would like to explain and elaborate further?</p>
              <p>From what I understand about God's Law in the Old Testament, it is like a primary school teacher who helps young kids to understand what faith is about and with Jesus Christ's death and resurrection in the New Testament, the Gospel is like an university professor enlightening adults to live out their faith based on what the primary school teachers have established during their childhood.</p>
              <p><strong>Galatians 3: 23-25 (KJV)<br>"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."</strong></p>
              <p>Therefore, when you say "that law is a relic from the past", I hope you are not implying that it is obsolete and hence irrelevant to what we believe of God's Word.</p>
              <p>Our Christian faith and religion is still very much built on God's Law in the Old Testament. Jesus Christ Himself says this in</p>
              <p><strong>Matthew 5: 17 (ESV)<br>"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."</strong></p>
              <p>Essentially, God's Law can be summed up by the following:</p>
              <p><strong>Galatians 5: 14 (ESV)<br>"For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"</strong></p>
              <p>The Law is split into three aspects: the moral, the ceremonial and the civil. The moral Law is universal and timeless, such as the Ten Commandments.</p>
              <p>As homosexuality is condemned in both the Old and New Testaments, we must not ignore the Law but see it as a consistent manifestation of God's character.</p>

              <p><br>Herzog_Zwei</p>
              <p>Why do you say that Christianity is living in the past?</p>
              <p>Apostle Paul declares in Hebrews 13: 8 that <strong>"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever."</strong></p>
              <p>Apostle John has a vision in Revelations 22: 13 in which God says, <strong>"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."</strong></p>
              <p>Christianity is a religion but, above all, it is a faith --- a Christian is defined by his relationship with God. And eternity begins the moment a person has faith in Jesus Christ and is baptised in the Holy Spirit.</p>
              <p>I am not sure when you say that Christianity dwells in the past, if you mean that Christianity is backward looking. The Scriptures may be centuries old, written by men of a different "paradigm" as shade343 has put it, but nonetheless the doctrines of the religion are very much universal and timeless, as God Himself is.</p>
              <p>And then when you comment about Christianity living in the past, do you mean that the faith is obsolete and thus irrelevant to today's reality? If so, <em>HOW </em>so?</p>
              <p>The Bible is not an exhaustive life manual which dictates to a Christian what or what not to do --- or at least, it is not necessarily what it seeks to be. God's Word is essentially and ultimately God's revelation of HIMSELF. In relation to a Christian, how he can lead a holy and godly life which is pleasing unto Him.</p>
              <p><strong>The principles remain but the manifestation will vary from era to era, culture to culture.</strong> In other words, how the Church puts these principles into practice and how Christians apply these principles in their day-to-day lives will be guided by God's wisdom.</p>
              <p>If you believe that God is a living God, and He is real and the Holy Spirit dwells inside our hearts, then Christianity will never be obsolete or irrelevant. How can the religion live in the past when God is with us here, now and forever more?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, our faith is a supernatural one. Our lives as Christians are not defined by how we wield the Bible, but by our LIVING relationship with God. Christianity is very much active and alive. It does not remain in the past because it <em>CAN'T</em>.</p>
              <p>Because our God is a living God, let homosexuals who struggle with their unwanted homosexual thoughts, feelings and desires not lose hope.

              <p>Dear all homosexuals struggling with unwanted homosexual thoughts, feelings and desires:</p>
              <p>It is certainly helpful to know how homosexuality may come about. In order to overcome your homosexual tendencies, you need to understand and know what are the contributing factors. Often, psychologists would refer to the homosexuals' childhood days to explore and examine what the family background was like, and how the environment may shape the pre-homosexual's perceptions and responses to certain people and events.</p>
              <p>Here are two interesting articles which any person interested in homosexuality must read:</p>

              <p>My website The Truth Sets You Free  <a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/</strong></a>  attempts to describe and explain how homosexuality may come about.</p>
              <p>I think it is reasonable and fair to know and understand what homosexuality is about, before "accepting" it.</p>
              <p>Indeed, if there are many ignorant members of mainstream society who discriminate against homosexuals or stereotype homosexuality due to prejudice, then they need to be educated.</p>
              <p>In my personal opinion, a good education has two components:<br>(1) knowledge and<br>(2) moral values</p>
              <p>In order to rid mainstream society of ignorance, there must be knowledge of how and why homosexuals become who they are, as well as an ethical treatment of homosexuality.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, this is why my website focusses so much on the Truth. Because lies chain a person, while the truth sets him free.</p>
              <p>Homosexuals must not "accept" things as they are unless they know and understand and are convicted of the Truth.</p>
              <p>My website invites all, whether heterosexuals, bisexuals or homosexuals, to examine and scrutinise the Truth for themselves.</p>
              <p>You can be perfectly happy in self-deception; you can be perfectly happy in delusion. But you can be perfectly happy being released by the Truth.</p>

              <p>From  <strong>Homosexuality: An Overview  </strong><a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/homosexuality-an-overview/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/homosexuality-an-overview/</strong></a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It is obvious that the vast majority of people still think homosexuality — being sexually attracted to members of one's own sex, along with an at least substantial reduction of heterosexual interests — is abnormal. I use the word "still", for this is in fact in spite of a prolonged bombardment of normality propaganda by the ignorant and slavishly trendy social and political ideologists who rule the media, politics and a great part of the academic world. If the social elite of this time have their common sesnse, not so the great mass of people, who perhaps can be forced to accept social measures coming from the "equal rights" ideology of homosexuality emancipators, but not to change the simple observation that something must be wrong with people who, although physiologically men and women, do not feel attracted to the obviously natural objects of the propagation-directed sex instinct. To the bewildered question of many on why it is possible that "educated people" could believe that homosexuality is normal, perhaps the best answer is George Orwell's saying that there are things "so foolish that only intellectuals could believe them." The phenomenon is not new: many a noted scientist began "believing" the "correct" racist ideology in the Germany of the thirties. For many the herd-instinct, a weakness of character, and an anxiety "to belong" make them sacrifice their independent judgment.</p>
              <p>If someone is starving while his feelings fearfully reject the object of the hunger drive, food, we know the person suffers from a disturbance (anoerxia nervosa). If someone cannot feel compassion at the sight of those sufferring, or worse, even enjoys their suffering, yet becomes sentimental at the sight of an abandoned kitten, we recognize an emotional disturbance (psychopathy). And so on. However, if an adult lacks the capacity for erotic arousal by the opposite sex, while he obsessively chases same-sex partners, this failure of the sexual instinct is considered "healthy." Would then pedophilia likewise be normal (as pedophilia advocates already say)? Exhibitionism? Gerontophilia (being attracted to elderly people in the absence of normal heterosexuality)? Fetishism (a woman's shoe causes sexual excitement, the body of the woman indifference)? Voyeurism? I will skip over other, more bizarre, and fortunately, more rare deviations.</p>
              <p>Militant homosexuals try to force on the public the idea that they are normal by playing the role of victim of discrimination, thus appealing to the sentiments of compassion and justice and to the instinct of protection of the weak, instead of convincing by way of argument and rational proof. This in itself shows that they are aware of the logical weakness of their position. Their vehement emotionality is an attempt to overcompensate for their want of rational grounds. With people of this mind-set, matter-of-fact discussion is nearly impossible, for they refuse to consider any view that does not fully endorse their normality dogma. But do they, deep down, really believe it themselves?</p>
              <p>Such militants may succeed well in transferring their view of themselves as martyrs to others — their mothers, for instance. In a German town I met a group of parents of avowed homosexuals, who had united to fight for their sons' "rights". They were not less indignant and overemotional in their irrational argumentation than their sons themselves. Some mothers behaved as if their favourite baby's life was endangered if one merely contended that homosexuality is a neurotic condition.<br> <br>This brings us to the psychologically dangerous decision to identify oneself as a different species of man: "I am a homosexual." As if the essence of that existence were different from that of heterosexuals. It may give a sense of relief after a period of struggle and worry, but at the same time it is defeatist. The self-identified homosexual takes on the role of a definitive outsider. It is, in fact, a tragic role. Quite different from a sober and realistic self-appraisal: I have these fantasies and feelings, still I resist taking on the role and identity of "homosexual."</p>
              <p>That role brings certain rewards, to be sure. It makes one feel at home among fellow homosexuals. It temporarily takes away the tension of having to fight homosexual impulses, and yields the emotional gratifications of feeling unique and tragic — however unconscious that may be — and, of course, of having sexual adventures. Recalling her discovery of the lesbian subculture, an ex-lesbian writes about the "sense of belonging" it gave her: "As though I had come home. I had found my true peer group [recall the homosexual's childhood drama of feeling the outsider]. Looking back now, I see how needy we all were — a group of misfits who had finally found a niche in life."</p>
              <p>The coin has another side, however. Real happiness, let alone inner peace, is never found that way. Restlessness will increase, as will the feeling of an inner void. Conscience will send out its disqueiting and persistent signals. For it is a false "self" the unhappy person has identified with. The door to the homosexual "way of life" has opened. Initially, it is a seducing dream; in time it turns out to be a terrible illusion. "Being a homosexual" means leading an unreal life, even farther away from one's real person.</p>
              <p>"Self-labelling" is greatly stimulated by the propaganda that repeats that many people simply "are" homosexual. But homosexual interests are often, perhaps usually, not constant. There are highs and lows; periods when the person has more or less heterosexual feelings may alternate with fits of homosexuality. Certainly, many youngsters and young adults who did not cultivate the self-image of "being homosexual" have thereby prevented themselves from developing a full-fledged homosexual orientation. Self-labelling, on the other hand, reinforces the homosexual side, especially when it is only in its beginnings, and starves the heterosexual component. It is important to recognize that about half of homosexual men can be regarded as bisexuals and the proportion among women is even larger.<br> </p>

              <p>-------<br> <br>From  <strong>Can You Change Your Sexual Orientation?  </strong><a href="http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/can-you-change-your-sexual-orientation/"><strong>http://thetruthsetsyoufree.wordpress.com/can-you-change-your-sexual-orientation/</strong></a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>We estimate gay activists comprise 1 to 10 percent of all sexually active homosexuals.They have succeeded in defining themselves as a minority group unjustly suffering discrimination and are seeking equality with heterosexuals in all possible respects. Gay activism attempts to discredit any research that shows change is possible or anyone who claims to have changed. Why?</p>
              <p>Here is our theory. People who came to adulthood in the last several decades of the 20th century lived for a long time with the growing awareness of their homosexual orientation, well-aware of prevailing attitudes towards homosexuality, fearful of disclosure, and not knowing what to do about it all. Many tried alone for years to change but failed. Some genuinely sought help from counsellors, ministers of religion, psychologists, or psychiatrists - often at considerable expense - but got nowhere. It's not too surprising that many believe it's impossible to change. "If it were possible, I would be heterosexual today," some of them say. If they turned to religion, as many of them did, and found only censure, rejection, and no power to change, they will be cynical about the church unless it accepts them unconditionally. (Nearly 40 percent of gays say that, because of their homosexuality, they have become less religious than they were.)</p>
              <p>Gays who find no way to change their orientation have few options, but one of them is to summon the considerable personal courage required to accept the label "homosexual" and "come out" to themselves, families, and others. But an identity in which there is such an enormous personal investment then has to become acceptable to society at large and gay activism has worked hard to this end on many fronts. Naturally, when governments begin granting political protections, and homosexuality begins getting backing from the church, the judiciary, education, the medical and caring professions and the media,and apparent "scientific" backing, change is not something a self-identified gay person needs to give much thought to - especially if there are rewarding patterns of sexual gratification and intense emotional attachment to give up. As one ex-gay, Frank Worthen, put it, after about thirty years out of homosexuality, "Sex (for males) has met their needs for closeness for so long that the prospect of giving it up is very threatening." He goes on to say, "There is no one in the lifestyle who cannot make the change - but many will be too fearful to seek it."</p>
              <p>Now, of course, the 'right' to be gay and sexually active is so enshrined that any suggestion that change might be a better option is barely heard.</p>

              <p>I agree with shade343. Christianity is a "relic from the past". And thetruthsetsyoufree, I don't see how quoting verses is going to convince us that the laws in the Bible are applicable this day and age. You said it yourself, the Scriptures were centuries old and written by MEN. Not God. Many Christians argue that they were men "guided" by God, so it makes the Scriptures somehow holy. I think it's really mental to take the words of centuries old men claiming to be "guided" and take it to be the ultimate law.</p>
              <p>If you believe the words are Law thetruthsetsyoufree, then your not only forsaking evolutionary science (which has been proven over and over again; and don't even bother arguing that evolution is God's "tool" because it would have been the biggest contradiction if I ever will see one), but you are also supporting Rape, Human Sacrifice, Mass Murder and most of all Slavery.</p>

              <p>  Made an account just to enter this topic because I do think we might be getting somewhere here <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>  First of all, I am not pro-gay, but neither am I anti-gay. I think, in terms of sexuality, it should be a personal choice and no one should have the right to force them to change, just like I believe religion is a personal choice and parents should not force their religion onto their children. And yes, I am a Dawkins fan <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>  On the subtopic of is the bible, for the lack of a better word, obsolete in it's laws, I completely agree with lucasstriker. It is obsolete and christians can not win an arguement of this magnitude simply because they themselves don't practice every law. Although lucasstriker was quite blunt in his delivery (funny but still blunt), he makes an excellent point on relying more on our morals than the book itself, thus proving that we do not need God to have morals (a hotly debated issue). For example, you don't stone people just because the bible tells you to do it, your morals wouldn't agree with that. This should be proof that our morals are independent of a belief in God.</p>
              <p>  Although, I am not saying the bible is empty of beauty. I believe it is a great piece of literature filled with poetic grace and elegance. The golden rule of "not doing unto others which you would not like done to yourself" is a very beautiful rule indeed. That's why I am happy when pastors preach them to children. I think it's great that the less desirable parts of the bible are as lucasstriker put it, "substantially ignored" or "taken as metaphors". This selectivity is what differentiates us from the barbarians of the past, we are selective in what we wish to incorporate into our lives.</p>
              <p>  That is why homosexuality shouldn't be condemned. I ask you, why is it so hard to ignore that law?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Seriously, speaking, do you guys
              even believe that homosexuality is not a choice and it is actually integrated
              in them since they were born? If one is born with a prick, and feel like they
              have a wet and moist oyster instead, is that really a genetic defect that they
              can't control or <strong>is it just pure
              influence? </strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I strongly believe that we, humans,
              as freckle# minded as <strong>we are, are easily
              influenced</strong>, both in our actions and our thoughts. Take Derren Brown and
              Stanley Milgram's experiments for example. Yes! Google it. From their videos,
              we can see that even with the slightest amount of distraction, these artists
              are able to lead on a person with their techniques to do according to what they
              please. (ps. don't even start the topic on whether those videos are genuine or
              not, because its so spectacular that it seems like magic, there is some truth
              to it, if not no one will study psychology/NLP)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Let’s take Singapore only
              as our context since we live here and we're more familiar with the culture. I'm
              sure that you guys have friends around you who are "Homosexuals" (</span>a
              gay man or a lesbian<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> ) and you
              will realise a trend in them. They are all so comfortable in their own "costume"
              (homosexual-ness) that they don't care about what others think about them. They
              will ignore with your insults and continue on with their lives as if it doesn't
              really matter. And if you insult them, the people around them condemn you which
              make you feel even guiltier. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I'm going to use gays for example,
              not touching on lesbian’s because personally, I find them hot. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">As we can see, gays are usually*
              trendy, and have a lot of social influence. Many girls will surround them and
              treat them as their own. Many guys will agree that a gay is a nice person and
              someone you can rely on (unless you insult him or make him angry then your life
              will be worst than hell) ps. They are even more scarier then woman. If you
              think you can’t understand women, wait till you try to understand gays. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">These <strong>trends create a high social esteem for them</strong> as they experience
              "sisterhood" and "attention" from every side. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Keep in mind, what I am trying to
              say is that gays* and gangs* both <strong>provide
              a person with a sense of strong belonging</strong>. Just in a different situation,
              depending on what he is being influence in. In this case we are talking about
              homosexually and not gangs. In fact both extend a similar influence that will
              affect our kids in future. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Similarly, Christianity and Buddhist-ism,
              If you’re born in Israel,
              Most likely you’ll be a Christian and perhaps, if you prefer the use of chopsticks,
              China,
              most likely you’ll be influence by your family and be a Buddhist. No one knows
              for sure if the God they claim to worship is the true one but it all just depends
              on the influence one religion has against the other. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">It’s the influence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Because of this strong sense of belonging, he will remain in his own comfortable
              world and refuse to change despite the insults that are bought upon him</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">. You got to study these confuse
              boys in order to understand what is so attractive about this "sense of belonging".
              For me, what I’ve observed is that, these boys gain a lot of social attention
              in the outside word, which leads them to satisfy their ‘self-esteem’ needs. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">They have this popularity-o-meter
              that is integrated in everyone of them and it seems to control <strong>their mentality of being popular</strong>. “Nothing
              is more important then being popular.” They change boyfriends so frequently and
              kept comparing who have a more popular boyfriend in front of me. What’s worst
              is that in Singapore,
              the community is so big that now both gays and lesbians actually start merging
              together and <strong>forming their own social
              groups</strong> apart from the normal, sexually pleased humans. When I went out with
              my gay friends, I’am shocked to see how they take care of each other and there
              is actually a strong bonding going on, despite those minor backstab stories
              about "I’m more popular than you". </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">How they are spreading is even more astonishing.
              The government is not doing anything to stop this tend*. I use the word trend
              as I believe that these boys are not homosexuals but they are influenced to be
              one. Gay pubs and clubs are emerging everywhere. Even 'ladies night' turned into
              'guys night'. <strong>They even have activities
              in the pubs</strong> where transsexuals/gays come up to the stage and perform a
              cooking show in a club. And those confuse guys (gays) usually those popular
              ones are given the minor roles of dancing on stage before the main event and
              yet they are satisfied and proud of it because it increases their popularity
              level! Refer to “drag show Singapore”
              YouTube for real hardcore live performance. Because of these activities, <strong>which causes more bonding to go on</strong>, their
              groups is growing in numbers, ranging from as young as primary 5.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">From online chats, we’re able to
              monitor their activities if you guys are skeptical about what I am saying. Go
              visit Trevvy.com, and <strong>the truth will set

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Most of <strong>these</strong> <strong>guys classify
              themselves/ feel themselves as gays to enter the popularity circle</strong> but if you
              lock them in the room together with Fiona Xie, I’ll guarantee you that they, as
              a horny male being, will definite make her pregnant. </span></p>

              activities or even using the bible to condemn them. Seriously speaking, the
              bible ask us to burn them/ stone them. And a human being ask you to save them
              by counseling them and talking to them. Which one will you follow? Killing them
              to secure a place in heaven or counseling them as it is the morality right
              thing to do. Which leads to </span>lucasstriker’s morality point.</p>

              is being condemned. And none of those homosexual guys in the bible have a good ending.
              But yet at this point of time, in our country, because homosexuality becomes an
              increasing trend, churches reinterpreting the bible to be favorable to the homosexuals

              <p>I agree with shade343. Christianity is a "relic from the past". And thetruthsetsyoufree, I don't see how quoting verses is going to convince us that the laws in the Bible are applicable this day and age. You said it yourself, the Scriptures were centuries old and written by MEN. Not God. Many Christians argue that they were men "guided" by God, so it makes the Scriptures somehow holy. I think it's really mental to take the words of centuries old men claiming to be "guided" and take it to be the ultimate law.</p>
              <p>If you believe the words are Law thetruthsetsyoufree, then your not only forsaking evolutionary science (which has been proven over and over again; and don't even bother arguing that evolution is God's "tool" because it would have been the biggest contradiction if I ever will see one), but you are also supporting Rape, Human Sacrifice, Mass Murder and most of all Slavery.</p>
              <p>Don't believe me? Well your not the only one who can quote fancy verses:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">    <strong><em>They must be dividing the spoils they took: there must be a damsel or two for each man, Spoils of dyed cloth as Sisera's spoil, an ornate shawl or two for me in the spoil.</em>  </strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">(Judges 5:30 NAB)</span></strong></p>
              <p>So a woman is considered "spoils of war" to take?</p>
              <p><em>  <strong>  If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.</strong> <strong>(Deuteronomy 22:23-24 NAB)</strong></em></p>
              <p>I see why God would want to punish the man, but the rape victim too?</p>
              <p><em><strong>  However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.  (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)</strong></em></p>
              <p>    <em><strong>When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.  (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)</strong></em></p>
              <p>   <em><strong>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)</strong></em></p>
              <p>God loves slavery doesn't he? Seriously I could go on forever about his deep fixation with slaves. Hell, Jesus calls us the "lambs" of God didn't he? Guess that means we're glorified slaves. Oh well. Praise the Lord!</p>
              <p><strong> <em>Consecrate to me every first-born that opens the womb among Israelites, both man and beast, for it belongs to me.</em>  (<em>Exodus 13:2)</em></strong></p>
              <p>I actually flipped open the bible the first time and came to this very verse! It must be a sign from God! Oh wait... scratch that... human sacrifices disgust me. Sorry God, but I have morals.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death.  Such evil must be purged from Israel. </em> (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>    <em>A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death.</em>  (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="color: #000000;">If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, "You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord."  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through. </span> <span style="color: #000000;">(Zechariah 13:3 NAB)</span></strong></em></p>
              <p>Wow... guess I'm guilty of the first. But didn't a certain famous pastors daughter recently commit fornication (sexual intercourse between unmarried persons)? We should dispense judgement immediately! Who's got the torch!</p>
              <p>So, did I get everything? Not by a mile folks. The bible isn't as warm and fuzzy as you thought. In fact, everything not warm and fuzzy has been substantially ignored or deemed to be "metaphors" that doesn't actually mean what it says. I don't know about you thetruthsetsyoufree, but the laws seem pretty archaic to me. But go ahead and support them, God does! =D</p>

              <p>I am a Protestant Christian and I take the Bible, God's Word, seriously. The Bible is my authority for my faith and religion. What I need and want to know about God and what Christianity is about comes from the Bible. In other words, God's Word reveals about God Himself.</p>
              <p>When I quote Bible verses, they are meant to explain and elaborate on why homosexuality is a sin against God. Hopefully these Bible verses can justify my position. Having said that, I do not simply "quote fancy verses" just to substantiate my points. I hope to argue and convince by showing all of us here what God's Word says about homosexuality.</p>
              <p>But I do not quote Bible verses out of context. What this means is that I have taken the background into consideration and hopefully make the meaning of the verses I have quoted clearly. In other words, I do not quote Bible verses without an attempt to clarify their significance in connection with its context or background. Context or background may refer to doctrinal, moral, historical or otherwise.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, some of the Bible verses you have quoted seem to me to be very much out of context --- or at least, you make comments about them which do not take their background into consideration.</p>
              <p>You must understand that the Bible is not merely a document written by over 40 men within a span of 1,500 years. The Bible is not just a collection of 66 books in three different languages. What makes the Bible God's Word is that theologians and scholars have examined all 66 books and found that there is remarkable doctrinal consistency. (I know you will disagree with me at this point but I shall speak more of this on another occasion and explain to you what I mean by this.)</p>
              <p>Theologians and scholars have studied and scrutinised the Bible and found out that all knowledge and wisdom have been coherent and cohesive. Because a religion is supernatural, and not natural, we can say that an element of unscientificity (pardon me for coining such a word) is present in it. Perhaps secular academics will conclude that the compilation of the Bible may just well be coincidental, based on archaelogical, historical and linguistic grounds. However, for Christians, we have faith and this faith tells us that it is the Holy Spirit which guides and leads these men to write the Word of God. It is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit which allows the Bible to be written.</p>
              <p>This is where we differ and we come from two irreconciliable premises so it will be challenging for me to go on, but I do not mind making more comments if you would like me to.</p>
              <p>I shall try my best to briefly address the Bible verses that you have quoted:</p>
              <p>For <strong>Judges 5: 30</strong>, this is part of The Song of Deborah and Barak after a battle against the Canaanite king. This verse you quoted is praising God for helping them in triumphing in the national war. It is part of the Jewish culture and poetic expression so it is difficult to comment on how this will translate to today's context. Besides, you quoted from a different English translation from mine. I personally use the English Standard Version (ESV). So with these two translational problems, it is hard for you or I to determine or define what this verse means.</p>
              <p>For <strong>Deuteronomy 22: 23-24</strong>, God is not condemning the rape victim. God is condemning the WILLING rape victim, in this case perhaps not rape after all since the girl herself was consentual to the act of sexual intercourse. If you read carefully, your version NAB actually says "because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city." This is an instance where you have quoted the Bible verse out of context. Why? If you look further down to <strong>Deuteronomy 22: 25-27</strong>, God provides an alternative scenario where if a girl is raped by a man in the open countryside, the girl will not be punished because "though the bethrothed young woman cried for help there was no one to rescue her." (ESV) So, you see, God is merely juxtaposing two different scenarios and illustrating why the girl is to be punished in one example and not in the other. Do not quote Bible verses out of context. The background provides meaning and significance.</p>
              <p>For <strong>the verses you quoted pertaining to slavery</strong>, I must admit I myself need to do much more study on this topic, particularly for the Old Testament times. However, one comment I would like to make is that slavery is not approved by God or the Apostles in the New Testament times. Slavery was a way of life since ages ago, and it had became their culture, so to speak. Slavery was normal to the Jews. So when the Apostles wrote about slaves submitting and obeying their masters, they were basically telling the Christians what they could do within the status quo. That is, in their situation, no matter what it was, how the Christians could still glorify and honour God whether they were slaves or free men.</p>
              <p>Why I say that the New Testament does not give a nod to slavery is because in <strong>1 Corinthians 7: 21</strong>, Apostle Paul encourages slaves to try to get out of slavery and enjoy freedom if they can --- "Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.)"</p>
              <p>The Apostle Paul tells the New Testament church not to be so concerned about freedom or slavery because all Christians are slaves of Christ in <strong>1 Corinthians 7: 22</strong> --- "For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave."</p>
              <p>In <strong>1 Corinthians 9: 19</strong>, Apostle Paul explains that though he himself is free, he is selfless and willing to sacrifice his freedom to serve God --- "Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible."</p>
              <p>Finally, Apostle Paul tells us that at the end of the day, none of the Christians are slaves even though some of them may work as slaves because in <strong>Galatians 4: 7</strong> --- "So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir."</p>
              <p>NOW, DO ALL OF THESE VERSES ABOUT SLAVERY CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER? No. Of course not.</p>
              <p>The idea behind slavery as a job or vocation is that it is wrong and bad. So Apostle Paul encourages all slaves to fight to be free if they are given the opportunity to do so. Then he uses the metaphorical / figurative / spiritual sense of the word "slavery" to describe Christians. That we Christians are slaves of God because we serve Him. But it is good and right to be slaves in this sense. Yet, we are not slaves but also sons of God.</p>
              <p>Essentially, I never perceive the Bible as "warm and fuzzy." Hopefully no Christians would see God's Word as "warm and fuzzy." The Old Testament testifies to God's wrath and the New Testament witnesses of the precious gift of God --- Jesus Christ --- to save us and take away God's wrath. No, the Bible is not "warm and fuzzy" at all. It cannot be.</p>
              <p>All I wish to say is that let us not be too quick and gleeful to contradict the Bible. Yes, indeed the Scriptures are old, but not that old. Even for its age, God's Word has many qualities and characteristics that speak of its extraordinary status as a document of truth and faith that are unmatched in other literature. The problem I see is that people who criticise the Bible so often looks at the surface meaning and ignore or neglect the deeper significance. If the Bible is more than just a collection of writings, I am sure there is much more depth to it than all these amateurish contradictions. If you really wish to critique the Bible, you will need to study and understand the original languages Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek. You will also have to examine the Jewish way of thought and culture, as well as the God's revelations in terms of His redemptive plan for humanity.</p>
              <p>You look, but you don't see.</p>
              <p>May struggling homosexuals continue to persevere for our God is mighty and He will help you! There is hope.</p>
