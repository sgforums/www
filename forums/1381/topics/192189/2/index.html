Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay stubble: Every man's work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is. If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire."(Note, some translations have this line as purged by fire the last part)<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In Origen the doctrine of purgatory is very clear. If a man depart this life with lighter faults, he is condemned to fire which burns away the lighter materials, and prepares the soul for the kingdom of God, where nothing defiled may enter. "For if on the foundation of Christ you have built not only gold and silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3); but also wood and hay and stubble, what do you expect when the soul shall be separated from the body? Would you enter into heaven with your wood and hay and stubble and thus defile the kingdom of God; or on account of these hindrances would you remain without and receive no reward for your gold and silver and precious stones? Neither is this just. It remains then that you be committed to the fire which will burn the light materials; for our God to those who can comprehend heavenly things is called a cleansing fire. But this fire consumes not the creature, but what the creature has himself built, wood, and hay and stubble. It is manifest that the fire destroys the wood of our transgressions and then returns to us the reward of our great works."<br><br>taken from:http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br></div></blockquote>You see that person IS ALREADY SAVED!

            <div class='col-md body'>Have not come into direct contact with the term "Purgatory". After reading the article, seems to be similar to what Jesus said:<br><br>"But i tell you that men will have to give an account on the day of judgement for every careless word they have spoken. For by your words, you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned." - Matthew 12: 36-27<br><br>this is a direct reminder to me that i am ultimately answerable to God for every word, action, thinking done.  So it serves its purpose for me to try to follow God's heart in what i do, within the majesty of His Love, Grace and Mercy.<br><br>hrmm...isnt that enough?<br><br>Whether or not in the day of judgement, we are going to be "cleansed" or what will happen - somehow, it is unimaginable for me despite trying to imagine.  And ....is it that important ?<br><br>If we know we are going to be cleansed - does it beg more questions ? How ? by fire ? painful or not ? jia lat...past sins...how many strokes will i get ? Well,  perhaps the knowledge of Purgatory is not for me...as i can only be impressed upon that it could lead to stumble.<br><br>i dunno know. for me, living in this world is already a struggle. i can only focus on serving the Lord, knowing that it is the right Way.<br><br></div>

They were "not so good as to be entitled to eternal happiness". Still, for them "death is the termination not of nature but of sin" (Ambrose, "De obitu Theodos."); and this inability to sin makes them secure of final happiness.<br><br></blockquote>Again someone who does not understand the work of Yeshua on the cross.<br><br>The point of contention here is the RC definition of sins, namely venial and temporal and that sins are not all equal to YHWH. Accroding to the article, it says that the RC doctrine of purgatory supposes that fact that some die with smaller faults for which there is no true repentance, and that some of our temporal sins are not wholly paid for. This is contradictory on a few points.<br><br>1. YHWH being righteous cannot stand sin, therefore it makes no difference whether you have a venial or temporal sin, you are still a sinner.<br><br>2. The work of Yeshua on the cross is that we have our sins forgiven once and for all and that we put on Yeshua's righteousness so that when YHWH sees us, He does not see sin but righteousness. Yeshua came to pay for our sins once and for all. There cannot be any sin that is not wholly paid for as Yeshua has already paid for it.<br><br>3. The whole doctrine rests on a supposition and is not a certainty, therefore, how can you be sure that it is correct? To find out the truth about our situation in relation to salvation and the forgiveness of sins, please read your bible and what YHWH and Yeshua have to say about it. The one supporting quote taken from 1 Corinthians for the support of this doctrine is not even support for this at all and I believe that it has been twisted and misconstrued by the RC church and her scholars. The OT proof for purgatory given by the RC church is in the book of macabees which is not recognised by mainstream protestant churches.<br><br>4. By saying that you need purgatory, you are saying that Yeshua's work on the cross is not enough to give you full access into your salvation and that you must "work" some more. This then makes YHWH and Yeshua liars which we know that they are not, so therefore the conclusion here is that purgatory is heresy, it undermines the whole message of Yeshua.<br><br>5. The doctrine is in itself flawed because it supposes that we though our own works on earth can earn "brownie points" for our salvation and entry into eternal happiness, and that should someone not earn enough points here on earth, he can continue to undertake this task in purgatory. This again is contradictory to Yeshua's teaching and it makes Yeshua's sacrifice on the cross of no effect because it does not have the fullness of the forgiveness of sins that is promised by YHWH and Yeshua.<br><br>6. The doctrine here namely relates to temporal sins which are not paid for, then I ask the question, why then when Yeshua was hanging on the cross with a robber to his right and left did He say to one of them truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise? if this is taken in its proper context, the robber who supposed still had some sin left and not paid for would be with Yeshua in paradise, that very day, it does not speak about today you will go to purgatory and then after a while you will be with me in paradise, it says TODAY you WILL be with me in paradise.<br><br>Luke 23:43<br>And Jesus said to him, Â“Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.Â”<br></div>

The OT proof for purgatory given by the RC church is in the book of macabees which is not recognised by mainstream protestant churches.<br></blockquote>Mainstream churchs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> What gives them the right to decide what is in the Bible and what is it not?<br><br>There is also Scriputre reference to the Gospel of Matthew.And you forget something, its not only the RC when you talk about the Catholic Church. The Eastern Rite Catholics also believe in purgatory so it cannot be an invention of the RC as you imply. Furthermore you say we are the ones who misconstrue, is it possible your interprentation is misconstrued? And its not only the Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church also believes in purgatory.<br><br><blockquote><br>4. By saying that you need purgatory, you are saying that Yeshua's work on the cross is not enough to give you full access into your salvation and that you must "work" some more. This then makes YHWH and Yeshua liars which we know that they are not, so therefore the conclusion here is that purgatory is heresy, it undermines the whole message of Yeshua.<br></blockquote>This why I said, some people still don't know what purgatory is. In purgatory you cannot do <strong>anything</strong>.Its God who purges the soul until it has repneted of all sins and is fit to enter into His holy presence.<br><br><blockquote><br>5. The doctrine is in itself flawed because it supposes that we though our own works on earth can earn "brownie points" for our salvation and entry into eternal happiness, and that should someone not earn enough points here on earth, he can continue to undertake this task in purgatory. This again is contradictory to Yeshua's teaching and it makes Yeshua's sacrifice on the cross of no effect because it does not have the fullness of the forgiveness of sins that is promised by YHWH and Yeshua.<br></blockquote>Your repeating yourself,<strong>without Christ's sacrifice on the Cross, no one would even be able to enter purgatory.</strong><br><br><blockquote><br>6. The doctrine here namely relates to temporal sins which are not paid for, then I ask the question, why then when Yeshua was hanging on the cross with a robber to his right and left did He say to one of them truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise? if this is taken in its proper context, the robber who supposed still had some sin left and not paid for would be with Yeshua in paradise, that very day, it does not speak about today you will go to purgatory and then after a while you will be with me in paradise, it says TODAY you WILL be with me in paradise.<br><br>Luke 23:43<br>And Jesus said to him, Â“Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.Â” :<br></blockquote>The reason being the robber recognised Christ as the  his saviour and recoginized he <strong>still was a sinner with sins unrepented for</strong> By doing so he repeneted for all his sins the moment he said "Lord remember me when..."<br><br>Souls who have repented fully of all sins will go to hevean straight. There are some souls(few) who have managed to be truly sorry for <strong>every single sin and repented</strong>  because of that they do not need to enter purgatory.</div>
