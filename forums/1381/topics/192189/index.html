Thanks. Just my humble opinion.<br></blockquote>Purgatory is for souls who are bound for heaven but may not have repented of all their sins.This is a very crude explaination, I think Sgmacross can give a better one.<br><br>1 Corinthians 3:11-15:<br><br>"For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus. Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay stubble: Every man's work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is. If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work burn, he shall suffer loss: <strong>but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire."</strong>(Note, some translations have this line as purged by fire the last part)<br><br><blockquote><br>In Origen the doctrine of purgatory is very clear. If a man depart this life with lighter faults, he is condemned to fire which burns away the lighter materials, and prepares the soul for the kingdom of God, where nothing defiled may enter. "For if on the foundation of Christ you have built not only gold and silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3); but also wood and hay and stubble, what do you expect when the soul shall be separated from the body? Would you enter into heaven with your wood and hay and stubble and thus defile the kingdom of God; or on account of these hindrances would you remain without and receive no reward for your gold and silver and precious stones? Neither is this just. It remains then that you be committed to the fire which will burn the light materials; for our God to those who can comprehend heavenly things is called a cleansing fire. But this fire consumes not the creature, but what the creature has himself built, wood, and hay and stubble. It is manifest that the fire destroys the wood of our transgressions and then returns to us the reward of our great works."<br><br>taken from:<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm</a><br></blockquote></div>

I'm not saying this to offend, but I expected this view from non-Catholic Christians. What they <strong>think</strong> is the teachings of the Catholic Church.<br><br>As i've mentioned somewhere before the relationship between Tradition and Scripture for Catholics is interlinked. What do I mean? For example Tradition must never contradict Scripture.  Tradition is derived from Scripture.<br><br>The Bible as we know it today is a product of Tradition.

            <div class='col-md body'>this article may be useful for more information that the above do not state.<br><br><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm</a><br><br>this part is interesting.<br><br>"Modern Protestants, while they avoid the name purgatory, frequently teach the doctrine of "the middle state," and Martensen ("Christian Dogmatics," Edinburgh, 1890, p. 457) writes: "As no soul leaves this present existence in a fully complete and prepared state, we must suppose that there is an intermediate state, a realm of progressive development, (?) in which souls are prepared for the final judgment" (Farrar, "Mercy and Judgment," London, 1881, cap. iii)."<br><br>of cuz u can argue this is a catholic lie, or these "modern protestants" are in fact in the previous era..<br><br>anyways, i don't see why a christian should ignore the understanding of other denominations and even other religions.<br><br>is ignorance a sin?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue is not whether there is a Purgatory. We can argue till the cows come home and still we have two sides of the story. My thinking is simple. God's salvation is free (although not cheap) and complete when HE died on the cross. And to me, if there is any kind of suggestion that tells me that I NEED TO DO SOMETHING or WORKS at any point of time before I receive my salvation, then I know it is wrong cos the BIBLE does not teach that. Salvation and the rewards we received in heaven are two issues. To imply we have to suffer to receive salavtion is wrong. if you say that our unconfessed sins would affect the rewards and judgement we receievd in heaven, I may be able to accept that.</div>

To imply we have to suffer to receive salavtion is wrong.<br></blockquote>Purgatory has nothing do with salvation, as I've stated its meant for souls who are bound for heaven but have not repented of all sins.Again this is a very crude explaination, sgmarcross will be better able to explain<br><br><blockquote><br>if you say that our unconfessed sins would affect the rewards and judgement we receievd in heaven, I may be able to accept that.</blockquote>Well, you sort of grasped the concept, but not entirely. Let's see, Scripture says God is is holy and therefore nothing defiled by sin can be in God's presence. Since, there are many people who may have trusted in the Lord for salvation and repented all but their minor sins(they may even feel that they are justified for these sins and no need to repent for them), they need to be purged even of these.(Again, I think there's a better way of explaining can be provided)<br><br>I read somewhere, that reformed Christians do away with purgatory, by stating that at the moment of death, God cleanses them of even the minor sins(even if they not repent of them, repentence being one of the condition upon which the sacrifice on the cross was given), hence they go to heaven straight. Reformed Christians is this true?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So people who are bound for heaven are people who confessed that Jesus Christ is their Lord and Saviour and prayed to receive the gift of salvation rite? Ok if they did so, they have salvation and will not lose it becos that salvation is complete. They will go to heaven based on God's works not what we can do.<br><br>So tell me, what is the purpose of this PURGATORY?</div>
