It so does seems to me that Jesus Blood is Eternal.<br>i raised this because some Christians that i come across, seems to be quite keen on the idea that Salvation has no "aftermath".<br><br>How to repent ? The first key is to acknowledge the wrong. 2nd, a willingness to change from what is wrong to what is Godly.  3rd, to seek God's help to do the change.<br><br></div>

In itself it is a proclamation that judgement is passed upon those that follows this teaching.<br><br>I am also one of those that accept the "once-save-always-save" teaching, although I do believe that after salvation, sins are still being commited and one always need to be actively consciously be aware of this and that forgiveness needed to be seeked.

Nothing we do or did not do can add or minus from what Christ had already done and accomplished.<br><br>What is the different then? Before being saved, sin is naturally a part of him, so committing sin is natural, After being saved, he is a 'new' person (the old had passed away, we are now a new creation), committing sin is now not a natural thing.<br><br>After being saved, will this he still sin? yes. the flesh is still very much alive.<br>This is where the grace of God and perfection of Christ comes in, when a believer commited sin, knowing that there is now no comdemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, have the assurance of acceptance from God the Father, he can now find strength to turn back to God, repent and receive forgiveness, instead of running away from God because of fear and ended up deeper in sin. (reversing this, If this person when he had sin (fallen), feels that God condemned him or God had rejected him, do anyone think thinks he will be able to find courage to stand before God and repent and ask for forgiveness?)<br><br>Is this a ticket to sin? absolutely not, rather its this assurance of acceptance by the grace of God that we can find the strength and ability to resist temptation and flee from sin. Its because we know that we had been forgiven much, that we are able to love much.<br><br>since we are at this topic, let me add afew more<br><br>what is repentance? Its a change in mindset, to stop seeing things/situation/acts as how we see it, and start seeing them as how God sees them.<br><br>The life of a believer is not about doing what is legal and not doing what is illegal as according to the Law, but rather by the grace of God, doing the right things as how God sees them, guided by the Holy Spirit within us.<br><br>Thank you.<br>God bless.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(susgest reading from the book of Romans, I think the Apostle Paul explain this quite clearly here)</div>
