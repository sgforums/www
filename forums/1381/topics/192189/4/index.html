Live out your position in Christ. Don't listen to your feelings. If you have trusted in Christ alone for salvation, then you  are free my friend.

Ok if they did so, they have salvation and will not lose it becos that salvation is complete. They will go to heaven based on God's works not what we can do.<br><br>So tell me, what is the purpose of this PURGATORY?</div></blockquote>Purgatory is from the Latin word meaning 'purification'.<br><br>This doctrine does not deny that salvation is completely the word of God and based on His Mercy through Christ.<br><br>Take a look at yourself and the many sincere, devout Christians that you know.  How many of us can honestly say that we have already attain the same nature as God?  After accepting Christ, do we not still have our faults and shortcomings?  Do we not fall into sin from time to time?<br><br>Catholics believe that salvation means eternal life in communion with the Holy Trinity.  Since the Trinity is perfection, it is not possible that there be communion with that which is imperfect.<br><br>If one believes that many people who are saved are still imperfect when they die, then this doctrine makes sense as it means that there is a process of purification to build up the soul's capacity to handle eternal life.  To use an analogy, if a person has been locked up in a completely dark room for years, exposing him to light suddenly make harm his eyes.  Similarly, the soul that has not already been perfected in this life will not have the capacity to handle the communion with the Holy Trinity.<br><br>Whether purgatory makes sense or not depends on your belief in what salvation consists.  Some accept Luther's 'snow-covered dung hill' position of inputed righteousness, that Christ's grace covers up our sins without actually changing the state of our souls.  In this schema, there is indeed no need for purgatory.<br><br>The Catholic position is that the grace of Christ is an actual infusion of supernatural life into a soul that has accepted His mercy.  And since the soul continues to live in this world, it can diminish or even use the grace through its own sins, thus requiring constant forgiveness and repentence.  In this schema, purgatory makes sense.<br><br>regards,<br>siginah</div>

But each one should be careful how he builds. 11For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 13his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. 14If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. 15If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames. 1 Corinthians 3 (NIV)<br><br>this is from KJV:<br>14If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.<br><br>15If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.<br><br>particularly verse 14-15<br><br></div>

But each one should be careful how he builds. 11For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 13his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. 14If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. 15If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames. 1 Corinthians 3 (NIV)<br><br>this is from KJV:<br>14If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.<br><br>15If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.<br><br>particularly verse 14-15<br><br></div></blockquote>Ben, can share a bit on the verses/message means to you or what you think Professor Scott Hahn is saying? thanks</div>
