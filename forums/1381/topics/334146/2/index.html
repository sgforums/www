              <p>That's the whole point. To Christians Jesus is Christ the Savior, the Messiah the only son of God who died but not counted among the dead and who are now exalted in heaven.</p>
              <p>The same with Islam. Islam acknowlege Jesus as the prophet Isa. But just that. To Moslems Jesus is not God.</p>
              <p>I know this point that Jesus is not a mere man or even a mere holy man is controversial. But this is the vital point of Christianity.</p>
              <p>But I testify that God the father wants us to put our faith in Jesus. In fact God, the father wants us to love Jesus whole heartedly. In fact God gives love of Jesus to anyone He is willing. God never want us to put our faith in any prophets no matter how great they were nor God ever wants us to love any prophets wholeheartedly. But Loving Jesus is actually pleasing God the Lord of spirits, the creator, the holy almighty. By putting our faith in Jesus and loving Jesus we mend our broken relationship with God the father because that pleases Him. We gain God's favor by believing in Christ. And we became God's children by believing in Christ. And with that came God's favor in all kind of form. A child knows what his father is like because he is his father.</p>
              <p>And</p>
              <p>Yes the interpretation of the scriptures about the Messiah made the
                              Jews rejects Jesus as the Messiah. But look at Jesus with a clear mind
                              without any prejudice. Has there been any man that came before Jesus or
                              after Jesus that could do all the thing that He did? <strong>NO</strong>. If
                              Jesus hadn't performed the miracles that He did, the Israelis would not
                              be judged guilty but they did see the miracles that Jesus performed yet
                              they still rejected Him. The blind came to see, the dead came to life,
                              evil spirits casted out, The crippled walked and so on and on. Even
                              today miracles are still happening among believers in Christ.</p>

              <p>Many religious teachers have offered their opinions on the identity of the "Son of God", why dun they seek God's opinion on the identity of his own son? Why believe in the opinion of men and not God.</p>
              <p>God has openly proclaims in the book of Exodus.  <em>"<span style="color: #0000ff;">Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, "Israel is My son, My firstborn</span>.</em>  Exodus 4:22 (NASB).  God has proclaimed with his own mouth and with his own words that his first born son is 'Isreal',  Why can't u believe God himself?  Why believe in the teachings of man?</p>

              <p>Do u want to know, with an open mind, what is God's warning on the issue of blind faith in signs and wonder?</p>
              <p>Let me hightlight these verse for u.</p>
              <p><em>"If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, </em></p>
              <p><em> and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, 'Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,' </em></p>
              <p><em> <span style="color: #0000ff;">you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you to find out if you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;"> "You shall follow the LORD your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him.</span></em>  Deuteronomy 14:1-4 (NASB).</p>
              <p>Why can't u believe in Hashem and only Hashem?.  Hashem already made it very clear that we should listen to Him and Him alone.  The teachings in the NT is very compelling, it is either believe with the reward spending eternality in Heaven or disbelieve with eternal damnation in Hell. The NT promise of Heavenly rewards is very tempting, believers of Hashem must resist this temptation cos Hashem has commanded that we are to listen only to His voice and cling on to Him and Him only.</p>

              <p>hmm. raising someone from the dead, and rising from the dead himself, pretty much pwns actually.. satan don't have the power over life and death.</p>
              <p>Books of Acts:</p>
              <p>A teacher of the law said this:</p>
              <p>"But a Pharisee named
              Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people,
              stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a
              little while. Then he addressed them: "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. Some
              time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four
              hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were
              dispersed, and it all came to nothing. After
              him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a
              band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were
              scattered. Therefore, in
              the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! <strong>For
              if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God."</strong></p>
