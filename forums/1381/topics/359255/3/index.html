              <p>I'm glad that you are keen on the topic on jihad.</p>
              <p>You are using the technique of stripping away the context of a situation to talk about something the west( or Christians) had done without discussing the reasonings behind it.</p>
              <p>You don't  bother to mention how many fellow muslims had been killed by the Muslim insurgents. No mention of the reasons behind the war on terror with the Taliban and Al Qaida or the action that provoked the West (you rope in the Christians) to retaliate.</p>
              <p>The Infidels(Jews and Christians inclusive) are not going to sit back and do nothing.</p>
              <h4>Ecclesiastes 3</h4>
              <h5>A Time for Everything</h5>
              <p><sup id="en-NIV-17368" class="versenum">8</sup>  a time to love and a time to hate, <br>       a time for war and a time for peace.</p>
              <p>Today's Christians and other infidels will not wait for 163 years to launch a crusade  to repel the enemy  like what the crusaders did from 1095 onwards. Too much damage would have been done already. There's no guarantee of swift victory.</p>

              <p>That has always been my main beef with Religion. For a deliberate creation of God, we're incredibly flawed with the way we gather information and shape our perception of the world around us. Time and time again, religious texts and Science have reminded us of this yet we continue to commit the same mistakes.</p>
              <p>Perfection is always subjective, just the same as some men would like plump women over supermodels and how some supermodels look replusive with their anorexic figures.</p>
              <p>So a perfect God simply does not exist, because through difference of wants and needs we would all have a different acceptance level to the ideal of "perfection". An extremely intelligent God perhaps, but what is perfect for you would not be for me.</p>
              <p>Humans fail to understand that the Bible, the Quran, the Buddhist and Hindu Scriptures, Science itself is only but the first steps towards understanding Creation/Creator/God. It is NOT the end goal.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately in the current world, there are just too much people that wield power based on the groundless assumption that the logic is flawless and stand to lose everything if the flaw is understood by the masses.</p>
              <p>Individuals such as googoomuck live their entire existence around such assumptions and would never be able to accept the possibility that their logic was flawed from the getgo, akin to a house built with only a supporting pillar, if it is built poorly it would collapse the moment it face the undeniable fury of Nature.</p>
              <p>I am though, hardly anywhere near the Truth anymore than he is. But my pillars can be removed and repositioned accordingly to my observation of Nature.</p>
              <p>The problem is not purely religion, it is Faith itself. That ability that served us so well as we moved from being a simple animal to understanding music and the arts. Reason and logic can only serve us as effectively as the amount of information we have, resorting to faith in decision making is an unescapable path.</p>
              <p>But like all medicine, it is a poison when taken in large dosages.</p>
