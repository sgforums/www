              inferior and thus valid for complete exploitation ?</p>
              <p>Christianity is the richest religion here, yet i see them
              contributing less proportion wise to the poor compared to religions
              like Buddhism and Islam. The free food center at Chinatown has to
              close down because of shrinking donations and New Creation is
              actually building Church cum Shopping Center.</p>

              <p><br>Like i said, Christianity likes to promote the they're the only ones capable of giving salvation mentality to spread their religion. To the objective outsider, that is threatening others to submit or you would in many ways go to hell.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty sure the people who needs financial help won't have Christians as a majority, most likely not intelligent enough to seek refuge with a larger group for protection and assistance. Though of course i'm hardly a statistician, so i don't really have the numbers to back me up.  </p>
              <p>I can certainly understand why Christianity is so popular. As a CHC cellgroup member once explained to me, it doesn't matter how much evil i've done as long as i pray to God i immediately obtain a "Get out of Hell for Eternity" card free.</p>

              <p>There is the gospel in the new testament. That's  God's promise to the gentile Christians. The other gentiles who do not believe, it's their loss.</p>
              <p>As for the war of attrition, it's the enemy that suffer many times more than the Jews. The much bigger hostile nations cannot destroy Israel. What does it indicate? You may call it luck for the tiny state of Israel. I believe it's God's promise to Abraham and Jacob's descendants.</p>

              <p>I can certainly understand why Christianity is so popular. As a

              <p>It has also made no attempts to establish itself as the One religion. And the way i see it , there's far less accounts of Islamic countries plundering and exploiting cultures beyond the Middle East/Africa compared to Christian ones.</p>
              <p>Granted, there are radicals who chose to cherry pick what they want from the Quran. But the same has been done for Christians (Look at the different sects and the Crusades). Idiots are bountiful everywhere, and are the ambassadors that links all races, religion and cultures.    </p>
              <p>If you wish to continue your prejudice of Islam, kindly start another thread here or in Speaker's Corner and i (I think quite a few others) would gladly debate with you.</p>
              <p>This thread, however deals with whether Christianity has anything to do with the West's success. </p>

              <p>There is the gospel in the new testament. That's  God's promise to the gentile Christians. The other gentiles who do not believe, it's their loss.</p>
              <p>As for the war of attrition, it's the enemy that suffer many times more than the Jews. The much bigger hostile nations cannot destroy Israel. What does it indicate? You may call it luck for the tiny state of Israel. I believe it's God's promise to Abraham and Jacob's descendants.</p>

              <p>Like i said, the Bible was created as a political tool of the Roman Empire. Christianity was Rome's creation, not of Jesus or God.</p>
              <p>Fine, it is my loss. If Heaven truly exists, and non believers such as I would go to Hell, so be it. At least i can meet more kindred there.  </p>
              <p>However, the point of this thread was that Christian nations (The West) was not satisfied with leaving non Christian gentiles alone and attempted to force Christianity on them through military endavours and using it as an excuse for slavery and exploitation.</p>
              <p>This is the main reason for their strength, both economically and militarily in the Modern Age. Yes Christianity is the main reason for the success of the West, but only because it fostered a "you're either with us or against us" mentality, not that it somehow gave a spiritual, physical or mental advantage.  </p>
              <p>Bodycounts is hardly a good indication of whether victory can be declared. The Communists should have lost on all fronts if you chose to see it that way. The Arab World, even the Gaza Strip has plenty of young men to spare. History would decide who is the winner.  </p>
              <p>If you like the Jews so much, that is your choice. I see them as normal human beings, capable of creating great wonders and committing heinous sins at the same time. They are of equal value to any Christians or Muslim to me.</p>

                  religion. And the way i see it , there's far less accounts of
                  Islamic countries plundering and exploiting cultures beyond
                  the Middle East/Africa compared to Christian ones.</p>
              <p>Granted, there are radicals who chose to cherry pick what
                  they want from the Quran. But the same has been done
                  for Christians (Look at the different sects and the Crusades).
                  Idiots are bountiful everywhere, and are
                  the ambassadors that links all races, religion and
                  cultures.    </p>
              <p>If you wish to continue your prejudice
                  of Islam, kindly start another thread here or in
                  Speaker's Corner and i (I think quite a few others) would gladly
                  debate with you.</p>
              <p>This thread, however deals with whether Christianity has
                  anything to do with the West's success. </p>

              <p>Heh, you claim Christianity focuses on the love of God but yet its bodycount seems to pale besides anything Islam has been able to dish out yet.</p>
              <p>Present day Jihad? What Jihad? Where are the armies of Islam? Where are their bombers, tanks and artillery?</p>
              <p>How much have the Islamic terrorists killed? How many more were killed in the "Liberation" of Afghanistan and Iraq, in the name of God, Freedom and Democracy?</p>
              <p>Who should i judge the biggest evil? The one with the highest actual bodycount or the one most mentioned on the television?</p>

              <p>That is why it could be so easily abused, after all they ARE trying to save you. So anything they do is justified and good in the name of the Lord.</p>
