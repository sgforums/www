            <div class='col-md body'>I attended my friend's church last week and heard some strange theology from the pastor. The pastor says that we do not need to have the sin conscious in our chrisitan life because we are already saved by grace. Before the visit, i already heard from some of my christian friends abt this church, which talks abt grace all the time. finally, i have the opportunity to check out whether their comments were biased or not by attending the services. The best thing was that the pastor was quite outright with his strange theology as he attended the Hillsong Europe Conference as one of the guest speaker. I believe this church will continue to grow because the pastor is preaching something that the people like and strongly agreed. I guess every sinner will want to attend a church like this which tolerate and accomodates sins.</div>

Youre right in certain extend. Sunday teachings might have weakened and diluted to fit the ears of audience.<br><br>I believe the Word of God is there to illuminate the teachings towards individuals before the church. So if people were to rely on church teachings. Then it is again a inbalance in Christian living again.<br>A daily Christian life is driven to partake the word and learn the Lord's way. This is how we are taught to live and walk with God. Are there anyways apart from taking the Word of God seriously and take it and cling on it like your very breath?<br><br>Unfortunately, it's two sided issue. What makes the ultimate knowledge in men?<br>Church teachings? Or Personal walk with the Word and Holy Spirit(Teacher)<br>We either question the state of a church or ourselves where our strength and belief in God is pivotal on.<br><br>But the fact i have to agree is, you have pointed out something very grieving which will hurt the body in the end.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the impression that the modern church is giving to people, regardless believers or non-belivevers. In our local content, the modern churches are pushing for figures and for more territories. the modern churches are praying against each other for more members and the message of salvation is misintepreted by the non-believers. That's the reason why i suggest that we lead an imbalance christian life becos the modern churches taught an imbalance chrisitan life.</div>
