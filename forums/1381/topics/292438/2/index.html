            <div class='col-md body'>I never stated that traditonal and unmodern= holy and I also never mentioned abt the traditional churches. Holiness and teaching definetly have to do with how modern a church is. The modern churches emphasis on the number of members, how many church buildings and land they have, the number of superstar ministers they know, the number of millionaires they have and how fashionable their members are. The modern churches have become activities-oriented and many have suffered because of that. Holiness can never be found in the church, it can only be in the life of the individual christians who have live<br><br>Not all of creation is good, because the devil is also part of creation. We push all the blame to the devil, forgetting the part that bad things and good things does happen the the believers. The Modern churches are talking abt common grace, which put us on the same platform as others in the world. God loves people, but this love has translate into a self-righteous form of love, which the modern churches are forcing the rest to accept.<br><br>There is no holy people in the church, not included the pastor, because santification is a process throughout of life. The modern church thinks that they have the answer to the problems of the world, because of advanced technology or we are the only group of people that have passport to heaven. The sermons of the modern church can never go beyond the church walls, simply because the church is make up of falliable people and leaders.<br><br>Coming back to the theme of the thread, the disussion is that the knowledge of sin and repentance is the last topic preach in the modern churches now. Biblical sounded christians knows that, but what are we doing with it?<br></div>

There are many believers and ministers who are theologically trained, but yet no consicous of sin at all.

Can we now believe that, when a faithful and believing  (maybe naive) christian believe in his heart that he will strike 1st prize TOTO, he will surely strike 1st prize? If don't strike 1st prize, then how? Blame that he has not enough faith?</div>
