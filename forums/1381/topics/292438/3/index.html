            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="color: blue;">Romans 4:5<br>5But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness</span>.<br><br>Boldness is what God wants you to have when you come to Him. He does not want you to be afraid to come to Him, feeling unworthy because of your sins. He wants you to come boldly to Him, knowing that the death, burial and resurrection of His Son Jesus Christ has justified you and qualified you to boldly receive from Him.<br><br>This was the kind of boldness that the woman with the issue of blood had when she touched Jesus. (Mark 5:25Â–34) Now, this woman knew that she was breaking a Levitical law which states that anyone with a bodily discharge is unclean, and should not appear in public or touch anybody. (Leviticus 15)<br><br>But she refused to feel condemned by the law. She believed what she had heard about Jesus, and was confident that there would only be love and compassion, not condemnation, from Him. She believed that Jesus would justify her and qualify her to receive the miracle she needed. That was why she boldly pressed her way into the crowd to touch Jesus, who indeed said to her, Â“Daughter, your faith has made you well.Â” (Mark 5:34)<br><br>What was it about her faith that made her well? Romans 4:5 tells us that it is the faith that believes that God justifies the ungodly. When you believe that God justifies the ungodly, it will give you boldness to come to God, even when you feel unclean because you have just sinned.<br><br>When you fall, donÂ’t run away from God. Run boldly to Him, knowing that you are justified by the blood of Christ, and not by your good behaviour.<br><br>The devil may say to you, Â“How can you do that? Who do you think you are?Â” DonÂ’t listen to him. Pick yourself up and thank God for the blood and the gift of no condemnation. (Romans 8:1) If God justifies the ungodly, how much more you, His beloved child! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Flow With Righteousness, Peace And Joy<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Romans 14:17<br>17For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. </span><br><br>If we are supposed to seek first the kingdom of God every day (Matthew 6:33), then we should know what the kingdom of God is in the first place. I used to think that the kingdom of God was the mission fields and that to seek it meant doing missionary work.<br><br>Then, I realised that the kingdom of God was not something outside you flowing in Â— Â“the kingdom of God is not eating and drinkingÂ”, but something inside you flowing out Â— Â“righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy SpiritÂ”.<br><br>So to seek first GodÂ’s kingdom means to make it a priority every day to have your inner man flowing with righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Righteousness is not your own righteousness based on what you do. It is not good works. It is a gift from Jesus who is your righteousness. (Romans 5:17, 1 Corinthians 1:30) God wants you to be established in the truth that you are the righteousness of God in Christ. (2 Corinthians 5:21)<br><br>Â“Peace be with youÂ” were the words that Jesus spoke to His disciples when He appeared before them after His resurrection. He also showed them His pierced hands and side. (John 20:19Â–20) God wants you to know that His SonÂ’s finished work has given you peace. Your conscience can be at rest because your sin debt has been settled. You have peace with God, and the peace of God.<br><br>Joy will come into your heart when you see Jesus in the scriptures, worship songs or anointed preaching. It is the same joy from the Holy Spirit which filled the disciplesÂ’ hearts when they saw Jesus, His hands and His side. (John 20:20)<br><br>So every day, make it a priority to see yourself righteous in Christ. DonÂ’t be conscious of your sins, but instead be conscious of your righteousness. And whether you are reading your Bible or listening to anointed preaching, see Jesus with His pierced hands and side, which speak of His finished work. See that your sins are forgiven, and you will flow with peace and joy. When you do this, you are seeking the kingdom of God! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

He does not want you to be afraid to come to Him, feeling unworthy because of your sins. He wants you to come boldly to Him, knowing that the death, burial and resurrection of His Son Jesus Christ has justified you and qualified you to boldly receive from Him.<br><br>This was the kind of boldness that the woman with the issue of blood had when she touched Jesus. (Mark 5:25Â–34) Now, this woman knew that she was breaking a Levitical law which states that anyone with a bodily discharge is unclean, and should not appear in public or touch anybody. (Leviticus 15)<br><br>But she refused to feel condemned by the law. She believed what she had heard about Jesus, and was confident that there would only be love and compassion, not condemnation, from Him. She believed that Jesus would justify her and qualify her to receive the miracle she needed. That was why she boldly pressed her way into the crowd to touch Jesus, who indeed said to her, Â“Daughter, your faith has made you well.Â” (Mark 5:34)<br><br>What was it about her faith that made her well? Romans 4:5 tells us that it is the faith that believes that God justifies the ungodly. When you believe that God justifies the ungodly, it will give you boldness to come to God, even when you feel unclean because you have just sinned.<br><br>When you fall, donÂ’t run away from God. Run boldly to Him, knowing that you are justified by the blood of Christ, and not by your good behaviour.<br><br>The devil may say to you, Â“How can you do that? Who do you think you are?Â” DonÂ’t listen to him. Pick yourself up and thank God for the blood and the gift of no condemnation. (Romans 8:1) If God justifies the ungodly, how much more you, His beloved child! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div></blockquote>Yet in all your boldness... you forget to reverence Yahweh. Do you go boldly into the throne room of a King? or do you come in humble supplication?</div>
