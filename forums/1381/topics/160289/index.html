When a Christian speaks in tongues, it is by the ability of the Holy Spirit, when a Christian speaks in tongues, he is fully aware of all that is going on around him and he can choose to start or stop at anytime. The Holy Spirit is a gentleman and will not force a Chrisitan to speak in tongues, the Christian has the choice to either do it or not. The Christian is always in control. A Christian can speak in tongues and still be doing other things like the dishwashing, writing a letter, watching TV... etc. It is a gift from God.<br><br>Hope this gives you a better picture of what it is to speak in tongues.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by James1:</div><div class="quote_body">2) What is the different between a Catholic &amp; a Christian?</div></blockquote>Wrong question. You ought to ask what is the difference between Catholics and Protestants. Either way, both are considered as Christians.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by James1:</div><div class="quote_body">3) Why must we give thanks to the Lord first before we have our meals when we work like hell for money?</div></blockquote>It is dangerous to rely on one's own powers. Better to be thankful for what you have.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by James1:</div><div class="quote_body">4) Satan has been Jesus rival since the beginning of mankind, he oppose Jesus every moment, second he had the opportunity but why did Jesus doesn't want to defeat him a very long time ago?</div></blockquote>Oh, you'll have to wait till the end of the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>3) Why must we give thanks to the Lord first before we have our meals when we work like hell for money?<br></blockquote>IMHO, we own nothing, everything ultimately comes from God. So it is only fair to give thanks to Him.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>4) Satan has been Jesus rival since the beginning of mankind, he oppose Jesus every moment, second he had the opportunity but why did Jesus doesn't want to defeat him a very long time ago?<br></blockquote>On, the Cross and His subsequent rising from  the dead, our Lord and Master defeated Satan once and for all. So, now as Christians we proclaim that victory(Good News).<br><br>But, if your asking why Jesus still allows Satan to exsist, well that would be diffcult to answer except in the form that God's divine plan will unfold over His time.</div>

If the Jews had believed, it would be game over end of story. Jesus did not "defeat" satan because He saw the Fathers bigger plan which was to save all mankind...</div>
