If you have question about them (be it the DVC or the Christian teachings), can post them here, and we will try our best to help you find the answer.<br><br>Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not so much how it affects my faith, just imagine your father being a well known character, like Lee Kwong Chien or Tan Luck Sai, somebody wrote a fiction, a thriller about a young pretty girl from China, claimed she had a map leading to the location of the wealth left by your grandfather, and the girl's mother turned out be your grandfather's mistress in China...... you might not be justify to make noise if your grandfather is already known to have a few wives here and there, but what if he is very well respected by the family as a faithful hushand to your grandmother?<br><br>say all we can about knowing our faith, but I cannot support anybody who make money by fictionalizing my faith. There is no respect for the faith.<br><br>try writing a thriller portraying the founder of Falungong as the descendent of Buddha and one of his female follower in China. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
