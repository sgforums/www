Church because they  built many churches and great buildings in Rome, including the Sistine Chapel and painted many horrific frescoes.. depicting religious scenes which the naive public never really know any better... Many of the frescoes were done against their wills , thereby likely the artists had hidden the anatomy designs within so well that nobody really could notice the secrets unless the viewer had studied and pursued anatomy like Michelangelo himself! goto read my article....The Lord Spper was one of those done to show the evil tendency of Leonardo Da Vinci's whose unbelief<br>and philiosphy was hidden because if the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">truth</span> was known, they won't live long..there were many who were already to die, and others really to kill and burn witches on stakes..!<br><br><a href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Conclave" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Conclave</a><br><br>Reminder: Sgwiki is <strong>full of craps </strong>including this artworks that show the flayed skin of a corpse! those below 18 please abstained from fainting when you look!<br></div>

The book is fiction despite it is true that there are indeed alot of mysteries around it.<br><br>The Christian Community, some uses a soft approach, 'counter' this movie thru education, talks and giving brochures.<br><br>While some is more aggressive, calling for a ban for this show.<br><br>Recent at Orchard MRT, picture of the Last Supper(The movie's ad) was pasted on the floor. This also made some folks unhappy. IMO, it is really abit overboard to have it on the ground. Even though the MRT guys barricaded Christ's face portion to prevent people from stepping.<br><br>No matter what, i see a sense of belonging on the Christians on their faith. I see Christians fighting for their belief and i see Christians proud of their belief.<br><br>Its make me wonder, if Taoists will protect their own faith?<br><br>Our 5000 yrs old Taoism, is often related to superstitious and our deities are often make out of a 'mockery' in TV shows and movies.<br><br>How many actually voiced out? We are in a democratic world and maybe i am a 'mountain tortoise'....so far i heard none.<br><br>Are we proud to be a Taoist? Are we afraid to pray or hold incense in the presence of other people?<br><br>Are we brave enough to tell people how devoted we are, and which belief we are in and what divine we pray to?<br><br>Well, no one can judge our faith. No one is fit make a mockery of our belief.<br>but if we, the follower do not cherish our belief and traditions, then no one will give respect to our religion.</div></blockquote></div>
