Dan Brown went on record to say that he had done research on the book, thus giving the impression that serious work had been done with regard to the 'facts' of the book.  He even lied about having contacted a Catholic news agency in the course of his research.<br><br>regards,<br>siginah</div>

Neither do I really think there was a real attempt by the author to bring down the Christian faith. He's in it for money anyway.<br><br>I'm just surprised to the reactions caused by the movie, as to how some people use it as a basis to debuff our christian faith. And how it fuels some people to be even more anti-christian.<br><br>I've read books written by authors who talk about the British fighting the chinese in the jungles of Malaya and other historically inacurate fiction books, yet I don't see people becoming anti-chinese because of books like that. But it's a different thing with Da Vinci code altogether. It's like these people were just looking for an excuse to be even more anti-christian than ever.</div>
