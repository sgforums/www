              <p>No understand ? Let me cut n paste for you. Maybe that will have more substance.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #222222;"> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Who Wrote the Bible - A Letter from God</strong><br>“Who wrote the Bible” is a question that is undoubtedly asked by many who are familiar with the impact this book has made on people around the world. The Bible gives guidance in our journey through life to eternity, as well as leads us to a relationship with the God of the universe. It is a historical book that is backed by archeology, and a prophetic book that has lived up to all of its claims thus far. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In light of all these facts, asking, “who wrote the bible,” is a vital question that deserves serious investigation and a serious response. The Bible is God’s letter to humanity collected into 66 books written by 40 divinely inspired writers. These writers come from all walks of life (i.e., kings to fishermen) and spans over a period of 1,500 years or more. These claims may seem dramatic (or unrealistic to some), but a careful and honest study of the biblical scriptures will show them to be true.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Who Wrote the Bible - Evidence of Divine Inspiration</strong><br>“Who wrote the Bible” is a question that can be definitively answered by examining the biblical texts in light of the external evidences that supports its claims. 2 Timothy 3:16 states that “All scripture is inspired by God….” In 2 Peter 1:20-21, Peter reminds the reader to “know this first of all, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, … but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” The Bible itself tells us that it is God who is the author of His book. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">God does not leave us with just claims of His divine handiwork in the Bible, but also supports it with compelling evidence</span>. The design of the Bible itself is a miracle. Written over more than 1,500 years by vastly different writers, yet every book in the Bible is consistent in its message. These 66 books talk about history, prophecy, poetry, and theology. Despite their complexity, differences in writing styles and vast time periods, the books of the Bible agree miraculously well in theme, facts and cross-referencing. No human beings could have planned such an intricate combination of books over a 1,500-year time span. Bible manuscripts (remember, there were no printing presses until 1455) have survived despite weather, persecution and time. Most ancient writings written on weak materials like papyrus have vanished all together. Yet many copies of the Old Testament scriptures survived. For instance, the Dead Sea Scrolls contain all books of the Old Testament, except Esther, and have been dated to before the time of Christ. Consider Julius Caesar’s Gallic Wars. Only ten copies written about 1,000 years after the event are in existence. In comparison, there are over 24,000+ New Testament manuscripts, the earliest one dating to within 24 years after Christ. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Bible also validates its divine authorship through fulfilled prophecies. An astonishing 668 prophecies have been fulfilled and none have ever been proven false (three are unconfirmed).</span> An honest study of biblical prophecy will compellingly show the divine authorship of the Bible. Further, archeology confirms (or in some cases supports) accounts in the biblical record. No other holy book comes close to the Bible in the amount of evidence supporting its divine authorship.</p>
              <p><strong>Who Wrote the Bible - A Question of Eternal Significance</strong><br>“Who Wrote the Bible” is indeed a question that everyone must ask. If indeed it is the Word of the living God, then no other book gives us more insight into our lives, more hope for our future, and a true path to a relationship with God. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search the Bible with openness and honesty and see for yourself what the Creator of the universe wants to tell you! </span></p>
              <p>Maybe someone has pasted this already, but i lack the patience to go on and on over the same question over n over again, like i said, if u dont believe, u dont. No point asking questions again, because by doing so, its no different then specifically targetting christians for your own ego. Ego in bashing christians ? Maybe its your thing.. its your fetish. Dont see u asking the Muslims why they dont eat pork and continuing in your onslaught. Or the hindus with thier rites. I have responded accordingly, but u dont seem to look at the senteneces supporting my statement, instead.. go on and on with the same old question. So hope this super long wall of text will answer your same question.</p>

              <p>It depends, If he asks that, then he never really read the entire post. Because if he really were to challenge or point out inconsistencies, he should finish reading the bible, and then come and poke holes at it. To challenge the authenticity of the book, one must first read the book.</p>
              <p>Likewise, I didnt take philosophy and jurisprudence for two years to not try to discover the mysteries, the arguments, and facts and the unknown surrounding to the simplest philosophy of life. Most arguments so far in EH are like Philosophy 134 Logic and Computability . There is no point in me going for the 'If God exists, then there is no evil. Because there is still evil, hence God dont exist.. etc Because, i can equally make a logical Existence of God theory. And trust me, at philosophical retreats, the arguments put forth are 10 times more interesting then what i see in here. More substance and more challenging. This is like babies level compared to the retreat.</p>
              <p>So i will just let it be. Because any more questions, can be answered by other people, that are maybe less learned, or more knowledgable in the interpretations of the bible and its existence; and when a less learned person comes along, he will most likely be the new target subject to the same attack.</p>

              books written by 40 divinely inspired writers. These writers come
              from all walks of life (i.e., kings to fishermen) and spans over a
              period of 1,500 years or more. These claims may seem dramatic (or
              unrealistic to some), but a careful and honest study of the
              biblical scriptures will show them to be true.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Who Wrote the Bible - Evidence of Divine
              Inspiration</strong><br> “Who wrote the Bible” is a question that can be definitively
              answered by examining the biblical texts in light of the external
              evidences that supports its claims. 2 Timothy 3:16 states that “All
              scripture is inspired by God….” In 2 Peter 1:20-21, Peter reminds
              the reader to “know this first of all, that no prophecy of
              scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, … but men moved
              by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” The Bible itself tells us that
              it is God who is the author of His book.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">God does not leave us
              with just claims of His divine handiwork in the Bible, but also
              supports it with compelling evidence</span>. The design of the
              Bible itself is a miracle. Written over more than 1,500 years by
              vastly different writers, yet every book in the Bible is consistent
              in its message. These 66 books talk about history, prophecy,
              poetry, and theology. Despite their complexity, differences in
              writing styles and vast time periods, the books of the Bible agree
              miraculously well in theme, facts and cross-referencing. No human
              beings could have planned such an intricate combination of books
              over a 1,500-year time span. Bible manuscripts (remember, there
              were no printing presses until 1455) have survived despite weather,
              persecution and time. Most ancient writings written on weak
              materials like papyrus have vanished all together. Yet many copies
              of the Old Testament scriptures survived. For instance, the Dead
              Sea Scrolls contain all books of the Old Testament, except Esther,
              and have been dated to before the time of Christ. Consider Julius
              Caesar’s Gallic Wars. Only ten copies written about 1,000 years
              after the event are in existence. In comparison, there are over
              24,000+ New Testament manuscripts, the earliest one dating to
              within 24 years after Christ.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Bible also validates
              its divine authorship through fulfilled prophecies. An astonishing
              668 prophecies have been fulfilled and none have ever been proven
              false (three are unconfirmed).</span> An honest study of biblical
              prophecy will compellingly show the divine authorship of the Bible.
              Further, archeology confirms (or in some cases supports) accounts
              in the biblical record. No other holy book comes close to the Bible
              in the amount of evidence supporting its divine authorship.</p>
              <p><strong>Who Wrote the Bible - A Question of Eternal
              Significance</strong><br> “Who Wrote the Bible” is indeed a question that everyone must ask.
              If indeed it is the Word of the living God, then no other book
              gives us more insight into our lives, more hope for our future, and
              a true path to a relationship with God. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search the Bible with openness and
              honesty and see for yourself what the Creator of the universe wants
              to tell you!</span></p>
              <p>Maybe someone has pasted this already, but i lack the patience
              to go on and on over the same question over n over again, like i
              said, if u dont believe, u dont. No point asking questions again,
              because by doing so, its no different then specifically targetting
              christians for your own ego. Ego in bashing christians ? Maybe its
              your thing.. its your fetish. Dont see u asking the Muslims why
              they dont eat pork and continuing in your onslaught. Or the hindus
              with thier rites. I have responded accordingly, but u dont seem to
              look at the senteneces supporting my statement, instead.. go on and
              on with the same old question. So hope this super long wall of text
              will answer your same question.</p>

              <p>How does the bible compare with Sun Tze's Art of War written in 6th century BC? Also re-written and re-interpreted by vastly different authors (from cave men to ang mohs) in subsequent generations to apply in many areas (including business management), but still consistent
              in its message that detailed planning and preparation precedes action. No big deal, rite?</p>
              <p>And so what if we have the very first edition of the bible? It's interpretation varies from reader to reader. The various denomination (Roman-Catholics, Christians, Orthodox Christians, Jehovah's Witness to satanic groups like Heaven's Gate...etc) is far stronger proof that the bible is not well-written enough to be spared from mis-interpretation and abuse. If you are creating a set of laws to govern the people, will you write the law in an ambiguous way that is subject to abuse?</p>

              <p>I wonder do you guys believe in people having the "3rd eye"(able to see ghosts). Last year, there was a book selling in bookshop (one of the bestseller). It is about a local 10 or 11 year old boy who claimed that he has 3rd eye. If I am not wrong, the title of the book is "The Boy Who Talks to Ghosts". It claimed to be a true story with his picture on the cover of the book. His mother is a christian but because of his son's 3rd eye, she brought his son to see a monk to cover his 3rd eye.</p>
              <p>In the book, he described where the souls go to. He said his younger sister's soul (who passed away at young age) was always with his family. He was able to communicate with her. I heard there are a few guys with 3rd eyes around. I think these guys will know better where do souls go after death.</p>

              <p>christian only believe in god, they dun believe in karma, just like buddhists dun believe in a creator. since this is their forum, suggest you dun use your buddhist perspectives when commenting, but you can challenge the concept of flawed and paradoxes of god.</p>

              <p>Yeah you are right. I will not do it next time unless they ask for Buddhist's views. Christian guys, sorry ! But I see no results in challenging them. Karma ends all the questions ask so ok I do it for the very last time.</p>

              <p>How does the bible compare with Sun Tze's Art of War written in
                  6th century BC? Also re-written and re-interpreted by vastly
                  different authors (from cave men to ang mohs) in subsequent
                  generations to apply in many areas (including business management),
                  but still consistent in its message that detailed planning and
                  preparation precedes action. No big deal, rite?</p>
              <p>And so what if we have the very first edition of the bible? It's
                  interpretation varies from reader to reader. The various
                  denomination (Roman-Catholics, Christians, Orthodox Christians,
                  Jehovah's Witness to satanic groups like Heaven's Gate...etc) is
                  far stronger proof that the bible is not well-written enough to be
                  spared from mis-interpretation and abuse. If you are creating a set
                  of laws to govern the people, will you write the law in an
                  ambiguous way that is subject to abuse?</p>

              <p>Well, the interpretations themselves are always subject to misconceptions and misinterpretations over time as people begin to have thier own set of ideas and meaning. No doubt about that, what is more important is the originality of the text itself and the teachings of the original text re-interpreted to the times now.The interpretations evolve over time. Thats why its a living bible. Sun Tzu's art of war is a military , its chapters all dedicated to aspects of war. But it can hardly be compared to the bible in terms of the area's it covers. Applying Sun Tzu to business, i does not talk anything about compassion love fear. It is easier to apply Sun Tzu's method because the wars now fought, are economic wars.</p>
              <p>When u talk about laws to govern people, u must ask urself where did these laws come from? The jurisprudence behind it ? Should we have laws that list down exactly what we should do and what we should not do ? Will it be too arbitrary ? Will it restrict our autonomy ? How will it fair against the state and the people ? Should we be told what the law IS.. or what the law Ought to be ? Do we even know what the law is? How do u know it ? Sure, there are always ambiquous terms subject to interpretation when the person drafted it. But like all laws they can be reformed, they can be amended. It has always been and will continue to do so. But for the bible, it cant be amended, its text cant be changed, hence its natural that the ambiguity of its meaning can be subject to questioning over time. So this wont be the end of the debate. It will continue on for a long long time.</p>
              <p> And trust me... God has given a simple 10 commandents on what IS the
              law. And it takes someone of great faith and principle to
              follow the simple 10 rules. Now imagine u got 1001 of them. We will all
              be hanged. Every one of us.</p>
