              <p>i dun agree</p>
              <p>firstly its not straightforward, sorry to say, even using your posts as examples, i dont think they carry any truth and have been disputed many times..so using words like 'straightforward' are not justified for lies, deceits and misinformation</p>
              <p>secondly, its not a fair play/good game...who was the first to cast the stone in the pool of water? naturally atheists, or for this matter non believers react to unwanted propagation and provocation from christians</p>
              <p>i think this is sort of action-reaction sort of thing, hence blames to be shared equally by both parties is nnot justified</p>

              <p>sounds to me thats human behaviour. being angry, being petty and being stupid and so forth are not synonomous with any religions but human thinking and behaviours. humans get entangled with these belief systems, thats why religious animosity and extremism lives in the head of these extreme believers, who are hell bent on converting the world into their belief system, either rightly or wrongly.</p>
