              <p><br>I don't think all christians go heaven.    Like buddhists, not all will be reborn after death.    Think those who said all christians go heaven don't know their faith well and some of these use this to sell their religion.    They don't know by doing so this cause more harm than anything.</p>

              <p>Because that is a very general perception. And they are either only very shallow about the understanding, or just using the fear of death to try to pull u in. If this is the case, its the failure of thier group leaders in teaching them properly. Because to properly explain to u, it takes time, it takes great patience. Thats why when churches grow to big too fast, not all the flock understands the bible properly, hence, thier shallow interpretations reflects thier level of understanding and faith of the bible.</p>

              <p>we can experience it while on this very earth. example, when we

              marks in an exam, or when your baby was born, arent you

              <p>lol.. i might as well pop ecstacy every single day right ?</p>
              <p>But no. I dont even know what it feels like. Imagine a place where u feel no sorrow, pain and all the negative. All u feel is..24/7 of pure happiness.  If that is ur interpretation of heaven, then... thats ur heaven.</p>
              <p>I did wonder to myself.. will the be KFC in heaven ? Damn i really like KFC.. n eating it gives me great pleasure. But no.. i dont think so too. sigh.. maybe ? i dont know.</p>
