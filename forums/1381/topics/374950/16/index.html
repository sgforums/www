              <p>I know this is a late response but it is my observation that in all human soul or human nature that there is a need to continue to evolve by means of other transformation and that is reflected thru all religion.</p>

              <p>My aunt pass away. Their children convert my aunt to a christian. At the wake, it is christian affair.</p>
              <p>My uncle came, he's buddhist. My uncle, of course, sadden by the lost of his sister. Went to buy coffee and food and jossstick to offer his late sister. Nothing wrong right?</p>

              <p>My uncle was heart broken when heard that. Then out of sudden, a very strong gust of wind topple the table (in fornt of her table)! My uncle quickly offer food and joss stick at one corner and the wind suddenly stop.</p>
              <p>Until now, I still remember the incident.</p>

              <p>This is probably a tough pill for christian to swallow....modern christian works like business organization that take only the superficial coverts and pray and soul will be saved. (not saying where)  </p>
              <p>here is the write up from Jung...</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-small;">People have the idea of dead know far more than we, for Christian doctrine teaches that in the hereafter we shall see “face to face” Apparently, <strong>however, the souls of the dead “know” only what they knew at the moment of death and nothing beyond that</strong>. Hence their endeavor to penetrate into life in order to share in the knowledge of men</span></p>
              <p>The continuity relationship between death and the living seemed to continue. As such in what purposes does the relationship needs to continue.</p>
              <p>PS: I believe Jesus did not asked for Convert. Jesus asked for Discipleship.  So your relatives were all acting according to premises or doctorine.</p>
