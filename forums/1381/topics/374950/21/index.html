              <p>I am wondering if you are knowledgeable to comment on this.</p>
              <p>Let me clear your doubts. There are rebirths in Buddhism. The reason why we continue to exists are due to ignorance and craving. The Buddha has said to know the beginning of how beings and universes came into existence is impossible to know, as universes are continually born, existed and destructed. This is in summary to your query. To know in depth, pls go and ask at the forum there.</p>
              <p>You may want to ask how human beings came about in this world if you think there are no concept of evolution in Buddhism. It is certainly different from adam and eve story.</p>

              <p>Here is a parable from a  sermon like to share....</p>
              <p>One day Augustine walked on the beach pondering about God and His kingdom...than he came across a boy on the beach. The Boy was pouring seawater from the shell and pour it into a Hole on the sand.</p>
              <p>Augustine was puzzle and ask the boy what he was doing. The Boy turnaround and replied I am trying to empty the sea by pouring it into this hole.</p>
              <p>Augustine laughed and say that is impossible. The boy turn around and said something like do you think all God and His Kindgom knowledge can fit into your brain?</p>
              <p>I am not sure the totality of Gods can be comprehend by Man especially not with this division of knoweledge of Gods and Religion.....I think most of us got restricted.....by  institution and organization doctrine .</p>
              <p>That is why i had rise this topic in view that alot of questions to address the common observation rather than read and insisting a certain Text to conceptualized the thereafter.</p>
              <p>Most of the reply lack depth because there is this "Fear" and Fear itself is superstitious.....but again if you can't sleep at night after posting certain topics than ask yourself what is there to be afraid of?</p>
