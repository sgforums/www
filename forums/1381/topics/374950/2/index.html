              <p>According to your wholesome and unwholesome karma you can be reborn into any of the following six realms:</p>
              <p>3 lower realms: hell, ghost, animal</p>
              <p>3 higher realms: human, asura, heaven</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or if you are enlightened and liberated, you attain nirvana and is free from the cycle of rebirth. Which is our goal. Our goal is not to be reborn in heaven because life in heaven is still temporary even though long lived. Eventually one still suffers.</p>
              <p>When you are liberated and enlightened (realised your true nature/the nature of reality), you are freed from all mental sufferings even as you live. Countless people have attained this state from the past and even today. Or you can come back into samsara (the world of suffering, the six realms) as a Bodhisattva by your own willingness and compassion, take birth, and lead other beings to enlightenment. A bodhisattva eventually attains full Buddhahood and leads countless beings to enlightenment/liberation.</p>

              No contrary to mainstream beliefs these three faiths have the same view on death and resurrection of the dead. Exactly the same belief as written in their own holy text.

              Judaism, Christianity and Islam all believe in the end judgment where all the dead be judged according to what they had done in life. This judgment will come at the end of time and not immediately after one's death. All three faiths also believe that until the day of judgment comes, all the dead are gathered in a place where they are no longer be living.<br><br>
              Specifically the Koran describes that when the dead are raised to be judged all of them would think they had only been sleeping for a day. Judaism and the old testament teaches that the dead have no memory, incapable of thinking and not able to remember God.<br><br>
              The new testament especially those written by Paul specifically wrote exactly the same thing that there will be a time to wait for believer resurrection. That the first resurrection will only come on Christ second coming.
                                                  <br><br><br>
              One of the more interesting quote of Koran that's worthy to be shared:<br><br>
              <u><b>Qur'an 2:62</b> (Asad) VERILY, those who have attained to faith [in this divine writ], as well as those who follow the Jewish faith, and the Christians, and the Sabians -all who believe in God and the Last Day and do righteous deeds-shall have their reward with their Sustainer; and no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve.</u>
                                                  <br><br>
              Of course in time the Catholics came up with purgatory which is never written in the bible while the eastern Orthodox and Judaism came up with the bossom of Abraham. The spices that result from the lack of knowledge of God and of the scriptures imo and the desires to comfort ourselves and to rebel with more than what is promised. I just want to end this post by saying that it's not our religion that saves us. It's our faith in God and our action that speak of our faith that save us in the coming day of the Lord. To the end of death!

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course adding up to the Christian confusion is that the apostles were seemed so sure of their immediate life after death which becomes the basis of  today's Christian to believe in immediate hell or heaven though by believing so they nullify many things that are written opposing such views both from the old testament and from the new testament written by the apostles themselves. Today's Christians seem want to forget the Jewish heritage of Jesus and ALL of His apostles. I'm not saying that Christians should be Jews or embrace all things Jewish but for God sake RTFM-Read The Fuckin* Manual.</div>
