              <p>this shows that there are not just heaven and hell, there is a spirit world which only buddhism has the answer, you need not search the answer elsewhere, buddhism explains in detail regarding the spirit world. i am reading both christianity and buddhism now.</p>

              The bible actually teaches that the soul of the dead would descend to the world of the dead. There the dead would cease living. The dead would no longer be aware of anything, not able to remember God and can't register the passage of time.
              It's also called a place of rest and a temporal place to wait before judgment.
              
              Judgment day is the day when all the dead are raised from the world of the dead to be judged according what they did. It will happen at the end of days.
              
              I wouldn't say there's sooo many ghost out there and you need to differentiate between dead person ghost and demons. According to the old testament when a person died he could still live as long as his spirit hasn't gone to the world of the dead...so implying that dead people spirit may not descend to the world of the dead immediately. How many people have dead since say 2000 years ago? Immeasurable numbers but how many ghosts there are? Not even close to that staggering numbers of people who have died. Obviously the majority don't spend the time wondering on earth as ghosts.
              
              As for fake Christians as any other religion there are always people who are abusing it for their own advantage. Christianity is about having a personal relationship with Christ. It began that way and it stays that way.

              <p><br>The bible actually teaches that the soul of the dead would descend to the world of the dead. There the dead would cease living. The dead would no longer be aware of anything, not able to remember God and can't register the passage of time. It's also called a place of rest and a temporal place to wait before judgment. Judgment day is the day when all the dead are raised from the world of the dead to be judged according what they did. It will happen at the end of days. I wouldn't say there's sooo many ghost out there and you need to differentiate between dead person ghost and demons. According to the old testament when a person died he could still live as long as his spirit hasn't gone to the world of the dead...so implying that dead people spirit may not descend to the world of the dead immediately. How many people have dead since say 2000 years ago? Immeasurable numbers but how many ghosts there are? Not even close to that staggering numbers of people who have died. Obviously the majority don't spend the time wondering on earth as ghosts. As for fake Christians as any other religion there are always people who are abusing it for their own advantage. Christianity is about having a personal relationship with Christ. It began that way and it stays that way.</p>

              <p>why must we wait so long for the judgement day. why can't the judgement day happened during the 1st or 2nd generation of adam and eve and must wait until now when there are billions of people in this world?</p>
              <p>I understand that other religion said there are not so many ghosts because some were reborn in other paths, make sense to me.</p>
