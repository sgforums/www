              I don't know what would happen immediately but once a soul descended to the world of the dead. Its condition would be(until being resurrected):

              100% positive<br><br>
              Don't be afraid while the dead no longer remember Him, God still remembers everyone of them. God is still with everyone of them just that the dead won't know anything any longer.<br><br>
              
              Unless the soul is resurrected but that will only come at the end of time where every soul will be waken up to be judged or the earliest at Christ second coming. Unless for some reason the person is quite special in the eyes of God such as Christ, Moses, Virgin Mary and the 12 disciples imo. I believe they all missed the sleep of death.<br><br>
              
              I don't know how many that God raise early than His second coming but as I read the bible I found from the bible that the vast majority including His chosen ones and the prophets must all wait until Christ second coming.

              I must agree with you after reading through the bible pertaining to resurrection and Christ second coming and the end time and the final judgment.

              <p>The general 3 views of christians position.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah’s <span> </span>Witnesses, and some evangelical Christians hold to the</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span> </span>soul sleep view. Lutherans, Catholics, and most Protestants hold to the soul leaving the body</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span> </span>view.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The proponents of the soul sleep position have two premises. First, they hold that at death the </span><span style="font-size: small;">soul does not leave the body; both soul and body sleep until the Day of Christ’s return. Second, they teach that the soul has no consciousness as it sleeps; it is aware of nothing. What is the basis for these two premises? They base their argument primarily on passages that speak of death as sleep (or unconsciousness) and passages that speak of bodies awakening on the Last Day</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p>

The souls of the unrighteous (unbelievers) go to a place of punishment until the Last Day. The souls of the righteous (believers) go to be with the Lord in Paradise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Roman Catholics position….In their view purgatory is the place where the souls of those who did not fully satisfy all temporal punishment due them on earth, must be purged and refined by fire (by their definition all Christians, except the great saints, will spend time in purgatory). This agonizing fire may last for thousands of years until they are finally purified and worthy of heaven.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p>

And If you are Protestant/Lutherans you are happy as u will be judge. While Catholics will be in purgatory to be “refined” by fire. </span></p>

              It was not a personal experience that led to my knowledge on the world of the death. It was a revelation of sort I don't know what else to call it. I'm suggesting everyone who professed himself or herself as a Christian to read the bible and to look for its meaning without predefined ideas and without fear of having to conform to any doctrine. Just read the bible itself. The word of God in itself is telling us every believer that resurrection will only come and promised at the end of time. Jesus made us a promise to raise all of us: AT the end of time. Just be honest, be curious go and read the bible.
              
              <br><br>
              If you found some parts are a bit unclear DO NOT assume that you know its meaning. Leave it to that. If you assume a verse too much or take it without its context you are abusing God's words. DO NOT ASSUME that you know anything when reading the bible. Be like a child who has never known anything.

              <p>If you look at christian perspective they couldn't agreed on the detail but only to conclude that Christ 2nd coming.  Other than Keeping the "Words" and stayed "Faithful"   Than will know what happen....well there is a long way to go before the 2nd coming.  </p>
              <p>What about in Sg where bodies are cremated. The sleep theory is not relevant. So one is force to conclude that you must be swiped up to kingdom of heaven after life ended.  </p>

              There's a lot misses in saying that the dead are asleep in their grave with regard to the Jehovah witness or the 7th day adventist doctrine. Tjhere are a lot of mistakes in saying that the soul of the dead is in the body sleeping. The body decay and it will be no more.
              When Jesus said that Lazarus was now asleep he didn't mean Lazarus body was now asleep. Jesus meant Lazarus was asleep.

               I used to want that my body be buried when I died but not anymore. Now I would rather to have my body cremated. Won't be needing this body once I died.
                                <br><br>
              My advise is to read the bible without preconceived ideas. Read it like a child read it. Do not assume anything.

              <p>Larry, we often do many things without being fully conscious or aware too. Is your fear a fear of loss of control? Actually how much control do we have in our lives? Pretty much limited to our body and minds and physical interactions with the world. Even then we are again further limited by natural forces and sicknesses that always challenge even our control over our bodies and minds.</p>
              <p>Is it not better to let go and focus on the most worthy goals in life? Of course figuring out those goals are also an important step. It is worthwhile to think about such questions to help on our spiritual paths. Find that faith and discover the gentle wisdom that is hidden from our eyes by our very own folllies. I look forward to hearing more about the hidden treasures you unearth in time to come. Good journey!</p>
