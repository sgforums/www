              <p>Well, the interpretations themselves are always subject to
              misconceptions and misinterpretations over time as people begin to
              have thier own set of ideas and meaning. No doubt about that, what
              is more important is the originality of the text itself and the
              teachings of the original text re-interpreted to the times now.The
              interpretations evolve over time. Thats why its a living bible. Sun
              Tzu's art of war is a military , its chapters all dedicated to
              aspects of war. But it can hardly be compared to the bible in terms
              of the area's it covers. Applying Sun Tzu to business, i does not
              talk anything about compassion love fear. It is easier to apply Sun
              Tzu's method because the wars now fought, are economic wars.</p>
              <p>When u talk about laws to govern people, u must ask urself where
              did these laws come from? The jurisprudence behind it ? Should we
              have laws that list down exactly what we should do and what we
              should not do ? Will it be too arbitrary ? Will it restrict our
              autonomy ? How will it fair against the state and the people ?
              Should we be told what the law IS.. or what the law Ought to be ?
              Do we even know what the law is? How do u know it ? Sure, there are
              always ambiquous terms subject to interpretation when the person
              drafted it. But like all laws they can be reformed, they can be
              amended. It has always been and will continue to do so. But for the
              bible, it cant be amended, its text cant be changed, hence its
              natural that the ambiguity of its meaning can be subject to
              questioning over time. So this wont be the end of the debate. It
              will continue on for a long long time.</p>
              <p> And trust me... God has given a simple 10 commandents on
              what IS the law. And it takes someone of great faith and principle
              to follow the simple 10 rules. Now imagine u got 1001 of them. We
              will all be hanged. Every one of us.</p>

              <p>My understanding of your reply is that both of us agree that the bible can be interpreted in different ways (for both good and bad purposes).</p>
              <p>I do not agree that "The
              interpretations evolve over time. Thats why its a living bible." Science/Law books are more alive than the bible, coz they're constantly updated to suit the times in both text and interpretations, but Science/Law books also do not pretend to be always timeless and always correct.</p>
              <p>I mentioned Sun
              Tzu's Art of War to show that your statement "The design of the
                                      Bible itself is a miracle. Written over more than 1,500 years by
                                      vastly different writers, yet every book in the Bible is consistent
                                      in its message." is no big deal. Good marketing slogan, but it's actually "meaningless marketing material" to put it nicely :)</p>
              <p>As for law to govern the people, my understanding is that God is the author of the bible, but it was written by the hands of men.If God is prescient, then He would have worded it in simple terms which everyone can understand and not be mis-interpreted/abused. For example, Singapore's Law is simple enough to be understandable, comprehensive enough to cover a  lot of areas, but far more resistant to mis-interpretation/abuse. Does Singapore Law restrict your autonomy (except where it impinges on another person's rights or safety)?</p>
              <p>As for the Ten Commandments, Joshua lived in the time of Moses. After Moses died, he sent the Israelites on a blood bath, exterminating entire tribes. So was Joshua following the Ten Commandments (esp "You shall not murder")?</p>

              <p>yes, animals commit incest too on a higher probability than humans, but it is not that widespread, otherwise the entire animal tribe will die out due to genetic problems. That is learning, and it is part of evolution. Humans learnt through the same mechanisms too.<br><br>You are right that humans have other mechanisms to learn too (like recorded material). That is because our learning capability is far more advanced than animals. Do you know what is right and what is wrong from learnt behavior, or do you know it the moment that you were born? In other words, are you are you amoral at birth, or are you morally aware?<br><br>As for adultery, it is difficult to apply it to animals, as they have a different social hierarchy. There are bird species that pairs up for life --- one mate for an entire life time, and from what is observed so far, they are easily more faithful than humans.
