              <p>"DESP :  can tell u y but u r not going to like the reason...true, once become christian may as well die straightaway rite? the reason y we dun go straight to heaven after we die is cos we are needed to remain on earth to reach out to those who are still unbelievers...so the aim is to bring as many ppl wif u to heaven...this is the part in christianity when we accumulate merits although accumulating merits dun bring us to heaven."</p>

              <p>if god is all merciful and is not discriminatory and
              compassionate, why not all go to heaven? here lies the paradox.
              since you claimed that god is the creator of all things, we are
              considered his offsprings isnt it, why some are born rich and poor
              some disabled, some intelligent, some stupid etc. the list goes
              on.</p>
              <p>by the word, your reply to my question is it god's reply or
              your reply? if its your reply, then whats god reply on this issue?
              surely you cannot speak for god can you?</p>

              <p>Thats why once u are willing to know enough u will understand. Its
              how i understand the buddhist tradition and other religion and
              cultures. But bare in mind that there are always liberal and
              conservative views.</p>
              <p>Like Islam for instance, Jihad for a liberal
              muslim doesnt mean blowing urself up, together with innocent muslims
              and non-believers but for the conservatists... yes.</p>
              <p>The Bible has
              written about the evolution of God and the way he treats his people,
              And same, for us, we must evolve with our ways. Sticking the the main
              principle but allowing it adapt accordingly and continue to interpret
              accordinly. Thats why u notice the Bible never says stuff like.. DONT
              PLAY COMPUTERS. But it did have interpretations of addiction to
              pleasure and idoltry, given that its written before the time of
              computers.</p>
              <p>Because the ways of Evil.. evolves too.. as seen in
              the bible. So its natural that we must be aware of these evolution.
              Because we are all living beings. We dont stay stagnant. And being the
              Almighty knowing all.. he knows.. how its going to end, but gives us
              the free will. If he compels you, his gift of free will to us is
              pointless. We might as well be drones to do his biddings. Automatons.</p>

              <p>No. God did not write it by His own hand, God is the author of the Bible, but he used men to write the bible.</p>
              <p>So is the next question going to be.. if men wrote it.. it must subject to falsity ?</p>
