              <p>The answer was given to you .. and this is about the fourth time. Its simple. Christian point of view. All goes to hell. BUT awaiting final judgement where ALL will be judged. Believers and Non-believers alike.. how many more times do i have to repeat it.</p>
              <p>Doesnt this show compassion that the Almighty is not as cold as you guys think. Sure, u suffer a while because of ur lack of faith, or when given the opportunity u did not accept him. He knows men are weak. He knows us too well. But he loves all of us.</p>
              <p>Does that answer ur question ? Or u got more questions. This time, with different variations and denominations.</p>

              <p>It seems that different christians have different understanding. Some say will go to heaven immediately. Anway, if everybody goes to hell waiting for judgement day regardless of believers or non-believers, don't you think those who were dead more than 2000 years ago have been waiting for too long? I hope judgement day comes fast or they will be staying in hell far too long like eternity. Are they conscious and do they suffer while waiting for judgement day ?</p>
              <p>So, can I say that those who came back from death (from website)and claimed that they saw heaven were fake ?</p>

              <p>May I know whether do all the Christians have the same understanding as you ? If you don't mind, can reveal whether you are Catholic or Christians (which denomination?) One last question, may be you answered before but I did not read them. Do you believe all Christians go to heaven or only good Christians go to heaven ? What about non Christians ?Just curious because your understanding is quite different from other Christians.</p>

              <p>May I know whether do all the Christians have the same
              understanding as you ? If you don't mind, can reveal whether you
              are Catholic or Christians (which denomination?) One last question,
              may be you answered before but I did not read them. Do you believe
              all Christians go to heaven or only good Christians go to heaven ?
              What about non Christians ?Just curious because your understanding
              is quite different from other Christians.</p>

              <p>Well, i cant say whether all the Christians have the same understanding as me. I am Methodist btw. Because i studied electrotechnology and its logic and science, and doing law, so maybe that influenced the way i digest the interpretation of the Bible and also the way Methodist Christians preaches and understands Jesus. But there is a core belief in all Christianity and that is, we must spread the word of Jesus to those that dont have the opportunity to, spread the word to everyone no matter how far the place, how deep the jungle is, how unpassable the terrain is.</p>
              <p>The Bible has stated, that as long as u truly believe in Jesus, you will go into heaven. But to believe in Jesus, you must live his way, Because its only logical that once u believe and understand Jesus and the Bible, you will naturally live out the  Love , Compassion and all that he preaches. </p>
              <p>He did also warn that those that believe him and continuely knowing what u are doing is wrong and against the teachings of the bible, are worse then non-believers, and the fate.. is eternal damnation. Hence u must ask for forgiveness. But asking for forgiveness doesnt mean, u pray for forgiveness, n bwam.. u go and repeat the offence. Even in the court of law, repeated offenders are normall dealt with harshly. And as always, the intention like the court of law on this earth, ur Mens Rea and Actus Reus have to be proved to be found guilty. But imagine the court of heavens, with God as the judge, n u aint got no lawyers to represent you, you represent yourself, and he has a book about all your past transgressions, try arguing ur way or justifying ur actions. He is after all. going to be Judge, Jury and Executioner.</p>
              <p>And in answering about non-believers, if they non-believers were given the opportunity to believe, and they did not, they will go to hell. Because they refused to believe, and doesnt even give it a go to try to believe, so its only logical, that you will go to hell. Because the opportunity was presented to you and u refused to take it. And as for those that have no chance whatsoever in knowing about His words, u will go to hell too. But, as God is compassionate, you will be judged, like the other christians and non-believers alike, who have yet to go to heaven the final judgement to determine thier ultimate fate.</p>
              <p>Hope that answers your question.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Atheists always say christians are fools, idiots, superstitious and narrow-minded. However, given the way those atheists always attack christianity like an enemy even when nothing has anything to do with them, it is actually very ironic. Atheists always have this gay fetish of interrupting and hijacking a christian-themed threat and then start a flamewar. More than that, they will then start kicking people who has the faith and then go back to the beginning and arguing with believers over the existence of the creator. This thread is a very good example. From the discussion of where people go after they die to suddenly the existence of God.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p></div>

              <p>Regarding the bible contradictions, most of them are in this example:</p>
              <p>Adam says jacob is his son, but then in another page he says jacob is not his son. However, as people find out, jacob is actually adam's adopted son. The skeptic then says there is a huge contradiction even when there is none.</p>
