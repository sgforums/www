               Yes God gives His love for everyone He even loves people that don't know Him and don't worship Him and even involved in occultism. We are nothing yet He because of His pity and perfect knowing love every people even when that person doesn't know Him.
                                <br><br>
              God's love is for everyone but not everyone would respond to that and get blessed.
                                <br><br>
              And it's true that there is a very wide division between those that God's chose and those that choose to live outside His love.
              <br><br>
              If you think God gain anything for each believer that believe in Him well He doesn't. You can't give God anything but your love to Him. But he pays infinitely more to those who truly love Him so there's actually nothing that a man could give God in comparison. You can't pay to live forever that is just too great. A million lifetime doing good cannot buy an eternal life and freedom from death.
              <br><br>
              But then again there's not much point talking about God to unbelievers that would be like trying to articulate how a rose smell.

                                The question is not if God can but why would you ask that and why would God give you a million bucks. And that's just so cheap/ He gave Joseph the whole Egypt ,then the most powerful nation on the planet<br><br>
              But more importantly God can give you things that you can never even imagine:
              ETERNAL power, freedom from death, knowledge, peace, but then again we cannot ask for things that we do not know even exist.<br><br>
              If you think Alexander the great...great think again....! I believe every kings would weep had they known what eternal power taste like.

              <p><br> It was not a personal experience that led to my knowledge on the
              world of the death. It was a revelation of sort I don't know what
              else to call it. I'm suggesting everyone who professed himself or
              herself as a Christian to read the bible and to look for its
              meaning without predefined ideas and without fear of having to
              conform to any doctrine. Just read the bible itself. The word of
              God in itself is telling us every believer that resurrection will
              only come and promised at the end of time. Jesus made us a promise
              to raise all of us: AT the end of time. Just be honest, be curious
              go and read the bible.<br> <br> If you found some parts are a bit unclear DO NOT assume that you
              know its meaning. Leave it to that. If you assume a verse too much
              or take it without its context you are abusing God's words. DO NOT
              ASSUME that you know anything when reading the bible. Be like a

              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
              <p>First of all this is a Thread about Where does the soul goes after Death...not to fall into debate between circular religion argument on who held the Words.</p>
              <p>The ultimate Divine does not care about your earthly faith representative.</p>
              <p>But to go back to the Thread....</p>
              <p>If you review the various religions. Each presented different view on transition towards the passing of Life. There really isn't a consensious on these perspective. Or the various perspectives are basically based on religion teaching...</p>
              <p>Our biggerest hurddle is that our mind are wrapped up in our own experiences and viewed of the way we studies and comprehend religion plus the divisive environment mixing of cultured superstition.  </p>
              <p>This topics is to call to break from the Fear and unwrapped our Mind, and knowledged to explore.</p>

              <p>I feel it unbelievable when they say god loves you statement. does god loves christians only, or does god loves christians more than others?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if god loves us, how come he can condemn non believers to hell when they die? to me, this is an incredibly unbelievable paradox here. love is unconditional isnt it, whether you are yellow, white, black, rich, poor, christians or non christians alike, without any discrimination and biases.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if god loves all, then everyone should go to heaven isnt it. so what is stopping god for not allowing everyone to go to heaven? even if anyone were to condemn or disrespect to god, even so, god should be all merciful and compassionate. as mentioned earlier, whatever and however they explain, there will never be a truly satisfactory answer, cos its not god's reply.</p>

              <p>Okay there are 2 seperate topics here one is the notion of Love the other is being Saved.</p>
              <p>I will talked about the notion of "Love"</p>
              <p>the Christian churches/Catholics churches did a terrible lousy job in expressing how  the notion of Gods love comes about although the Word "Love" came as Jesus last Comand.</p>
              <p>Many Christian/catholics likes to use the word Love. but how many people actually realized that "Love" is a human emotional respond.  perharps its been 2000 yrs since Jesus walk the walked. They used it too many times it sound like --- "Merry Christmas"</p>
              <p> Any person who experience singular Divinity GOD. The first response is Fear not Love..... </p>
              <p>The fact that experiencing God is so new that the awareness of God bring a new insight that you are nothing but an insignificant self in the eyes of God.</p>
              <p>The experience of Divine God open a new awareness and perspective. Thus writen in the 4th century Creed....<em>God from god, Light from Light, True God from True God</em>.</p>
              <p>to highlight the transformation awareness of the present of One GOD from circular knowledge of gods.</p>
              <p>With the awareness of God and the fact that you are still breathing at this moment, and experience the joy of life and the 5 senses. or else you basically drop dead this minutes but by the gift of God's Grace.</p>
              <p><em>"...by grace are ye saved through faith; and that <br>not of yourselves: it is the gift of God</em> </p>
              <p>With the experience and acknowledgement of His Grace and awareness of His present. You over flow your emotion with "Love"</p>
              <p>Many speak of Love but how many experience true God. To be able to say God's Love.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yeah. Who does not want to believe one will go to heaven when one dies. I also hope that it is true so I don't have to think deeply and think so much. But the fact is not like that. I converted to a Buddhist also because of my experience when my late uncle and late mother passed away. I did not see their souls but I heard them (not just me) very very clearly (too lazy to describe in details). I think I wrote this somewhere in this forum.</p>
              <p>After that experience, I noticed only Buddhism gives details of what happens after death and the descriptions tally with my experience. I have a friend from other religion who had the same experience with me when his loved one passed away, he too turned to Buddhism for explanation.</p>

              <p>Just to add. Rightfully, those who are not christians are supposed to go to hell but they did not. So, it is not just heaven and hell, there is more to it.</p>

              <p>I may sound antagonistic to many here, but I will say it anyway.</p>
              <p>if you study all the religions in the world, esp the major ones, all if not most has either a single god or polytheism, ie many gods in their tenet of their teachings. all have a supreme divine being as the creator of the world and universes. all teaches that salvation is thru that divine being. all have a soul concept, as well as heaven and hell. also there is an evil being that is the arch rival of god.</p>
              <p>to me they are the same, whether is single or many god beliefs even if they exists under many different names. I am disillusioned with these kind of belief system, as its too simplistic and superstitious and frankly speaking out of date and tune to the world we are living now. these religions are at least a few millenniums. up to the 19 century these belief systems are still prosperous and prevalent in societies as science and technology were still not on par as today. when the first man went up to the moon, the myth of chang er was dispelled once and for all. today we do not need to rely on holy water and amulets to cure sicknesses and diseases as compared to the ancient past. today we have medications, vaccines , CT scans, mammography etc to treat it. more discoveries will be made by science and new frontiers established as society will continue to move forward. humans have come a long way without relying on god's help, the existence of god is still debatable to date.</p>

              <p>how to be judged by something that does not even exists or its presence is still debatable.</p>
              <p>anyway thats your paradigm and your worldview that apply to you and your brethren, not me and non believers. I always believe that perception is reality to that person. if i dun believe, it doesnt exists in my world, period. if you believe, then it exists in your world. whether it exists in reality or not, is altogether debatable and open for discussions.</p>
