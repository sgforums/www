              <p>Too many loopholes ? Maybe u should give the book a good read first. U are only piecing pieces of random information together without seeing the whole picture. And then coming to your own conclusion. -_-"</p>
              <p>U have to understand that during the old testament, to have ur sins forgiven, you have to have a priest do offerings n pray FOR you. You cant do much. And Jesus wanted to bridge this gap. So instead of going through a 3rd human party. The gap between them is bridged on his cruxification. I am now just using the simplest of language and terms, it may not be extremely correct, but the gist of it, is that YES he erased all ur sins, BUT man will continue to sin.. so u now able to seek genuine forgiveness urself instead of the old testament process.</p>

              <p>Atheists always say the religious like to push their viewpoints on them and force them to believe it. However, going as to how most flamewars start with what the atheist said in a christian themed-thread, they are the ones who force their viewpoints on others. They then blindy cast out random sayings and keep repeating that ''God does not exist'' as though not saying it for one day will cause them to loose something. And then, when you present evidence and explanations about God's existence nicely to them, hoping they would understand, they would go to the theory of evolution and start ranting here and there again. After that, when you show them the murky incident of how the theory of evolution came about, they get stumped and then they will ask questions like : ''Then why is it that we look like monkeys?'' or ''Then why is it that we share 98% of our genes with chimps? Isn't it because we were from them?'' But then they do not know their concept is much more flawed then the concept of the creator. Humans share 50% of their genes with bananas. So humans are half-banana? A snake also looks like an earthworm, except with a head. So snakes came from Earthworms? And with common sense, isn't the human brain a little too complex to be made by godless nature?</p>
              <p>After that, they will then start to say :'' then why is it that those scientists didn't study more into creationism if evolution were a lie?'' But the thing is, scienctists are not innocent by nature. They have life-long careers to pursue, degrees to get, and money to earn. And also, there were many scientists in MODERN DAYS who actually DO NOT support the theory of evolution, what you see on TV is just an illusion. There were attempts made by many scientists to publish books and also shows about creationism, but then those books were banned because of what the evolutionists have been doing. Recently, a female scientist who used to be an evolutionist was disenchanted with the theory and went into creationism. She them wrote a book in comparison between the 2, and just before the book was published, Richard Dawkins made an attempt behind her back into the publishing company and she was inadverntly kicked out. This world is crazy.I do not remember her name, just an article i read weeks ago. Many evolutionists who spoke about problems with the theory were actually silenced by other evolutionists. There is a huge cover up in the media.</p>

              <p><br>Jesus wasnt an ang mor he never had blue eyes or looked like Barry Gibb (Bee Gees) like many christians were led to believe.Tell me what race were and still lving in the part where he was born? Today you find many ang mor in Israel because they are the descendants of Europeans and Russians Jews,from the tribes who went there during the Exodus.Nobody wants to know the fact that he was very likely around a 1.64m and had a dark skin.Yes, he was very much  little bangla looking man.</p>

              <p>The quake happened on Boxing Day, one day after Christmas Day but the casualties from the tsunami were mainly Buddhist dominated countries. Now that's perculiar, since you are a buddhist. Not cause and effect?</p>
