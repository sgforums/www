              <p>The thread call for discussion on what happen to the soul after death rather than try to explain the cause and effect of Human relationship that transpired the path of the soul....after passing on.</p>
              <p>Although cause and effect cannot be seperated to where or how the soul journey, but as all religions and believes on this earthly events. All incidents are ties to Human Relationship with one another and Human Relationship with Divinity. (whichever Name you call)</p>
              <p>So rather than focus on a particular individual or what action trigger what path....I would prefer the dicussion to remain focus.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">A man should be able to say he has done his best form a conception of life after death, or to create some image of it – even if he must confess his failure. Not to have done so is a vital loss. (Jung)</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">the entired point is to share perspective from various religions </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">So to no discuss because of different belief is a faiure to communicate and shared knowledge. While continue believing incompleted knowledge thru generation of superstition.  </span></span></p>

The ancient people of Israel knew, king David knew, Solomon knew, Martha knew, Jesus then knew, the Koran even knows and it's all over the bible. The knowledge is there but it was only available to certain people and even with the mass published bibles only a few realized what is written in there about death.

              Yes I saw a soul more like the body in which the saved are given after they are raised from death. It's not flesh and bone. It was a long time ago about a year after I was given a vision of the glorious Christ when I was in my 7th grade. I also saw others....but no point telling if people just wouldn't listen. It's best for people to find out themselves. They have the bible as a reference of sort let them live to see what's inside it becoming alive in their life.

               Absolutely without God's intervention it's game over no more life.
                <br><br>I'll tell you now and here what it's like.<br><br>
                 1. When you're dead you are no longer aware of anything of yourself<br>
                 2. Not able to remember God<br>
                 3. Not able to register the passage of time<br>
                                
              No more life <br>
              It's like being a dead thing like being nothing no mind no heart no sensation, no memory of anything no consciousness, and not able to register time at all. LIFE STOPPED ENDED. Only death remains. The soul doesn't perish it's held in a place where all the dead are gathered. The prophets are saying they will be awaken in the time of judgment. It's a good thing they can't register time at all.

              <p>It sudden dawn to me wat u're suggesting is something I've seen somewhere in the forum...

              Because I know and because they are real. Of everything that's real they sooner or later get substantiated. And to ask me again is useless because you will have to experience what I experience. God is always and will always be personal. So it's totally useless for atheist and anti theist and God hater and spiritual anarchist to give any damn opinion or argument because experience transcends understanding and opinion and thoughts.
              To believe in God is to experience that He is God.
