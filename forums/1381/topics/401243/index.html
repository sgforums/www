              <p>After i read all the threads regarding city harvest, i found out that most christians complain, not because of their style of preaching, sins they committed etc but all the discussions centred on one thing: wealth, money etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i assume that</p>
              <p>-christians cannot be rich.</p>
              <p>-christians love and PROUD of poverty.</p>
              <p>-christian men are the most disgusting scums to women because most christian men LOVED to be poor</p>
              <p>-christians cannot work hard to earn alot of money because earning lots of money = sins</p>
              <p>-<strong>its ok for christians to masturbate/commit other types of crimes as long as he/she is poor physically (means lazy, no money etc.)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is it? i dont know, im not a christian. im just asking</p>

              <p>Being rich in itself is not a sin - maybe God wants you to prosper, what is sinful is when God allows you to prosper, yet you know no love, keeping wealth for yourself when you have every chance to share this wealth with those who needs it more than you.</p>
              <p>The rich have often try to pass off being charitable by giving off sizeable donations; yet a closer look reveals that they often keep most of the wealth for themselves, only giving what is excess to them. Much of the wealth they retain is splurged on luxury and extravagance.</p>
              <p>In Mark 12:41-44, Jesus comments on this behaviour:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.</p>
              <p>But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, (worth only a fraction of a penny.)</p>
              <p>Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, 'I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.</p>
              <p>They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.'"</p>

              <p>that is why not many people can be ruthless to being rich....and thus not many can be rich via really honest means....it is then sinful to be rich when one capitalize on love and fears...but this is very difficult to prove...</p>

              <p>no it's not. but it's easy to get distracted trying to "maintain" your riches. money and things should have no value in your life other than to sustain. also how you obtain your money and whether you put money above God or God above money. True Christians know that money is not their possession. Also if you, being rich, causes a stumbling block to others, then it is better to be poor..though it's not a sin per se. It's not money, but greed that is the sin.</p>
              <p>Christians don't love to be poor, we love God. and by loving God, we should love men. though not all the same way.</p>
              <p>it is never ok to sin. True Christians know that poverty is meaningless to the flesh and that God will provide. God will not tempt us beyond what we can take. it's God that keep us going, not food, water and even air. It's because we do not have faith, that's why we cannot "walk on water". but it is not that we deliberately deny ourselves of these things, we accept everything as God's provision and when we do not have these things, we also thank God.</p>

              <p>Likewise, I don't think it's a sin to be rich, but IF you start to value the material above spiritual, then the problem comes in.</p>
              <p>I"m not sure if what I've read is true-churchgoers being 'encouraged' to give &amp; give $, buy Sun Ho's CDs &amp; having special seats for the bigger donaters &amp; all...It all smacks of materialism to me.</p>
              <p>Being spiritual doesn't mean we need to be poor; realistically we DO need $ to survive. IMO, the balance has tilted in favour of $ for CHC(if the accounts are true).</p>
              <p>I'm also starting to feel uncomfortable about more &amp; more Christians(some only) who keep trying to convert you or push you to go to their church.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's right.</p>

              <p>To perhaps emphasize what some have already said, being rich is not the problem in itself. It is if you place material objectives above spiritual aims that it becomes a problem.</p>
              <p>Another issue would be with how do you become rich in the first place? Obviously I can agree with those drug lords in south america who kill and do all sorts of things for their money, yet go to church as if they did nothing wrong.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is not a sin to be rich. However, having more wealth means having greater responsibilities, one has the added burden of being a good steward of the wealth God has entrusted him/her with. Sadly, we live in a fallen world, Christians who once loved God with all their hearts have strayed and stumbled when they amassed great wealth. One has to be extra careful and really walk closely with God, seeking His grace and guidance on handling those wealth entrusted to him/her, that's why I said it's an added burden to be wealthy. I know of many Christians who rather not be wealthy, fearing that they might be tempted to stray from God. Having said that, I also know of many Christians who want to be wealthy. I don't think there's anything wrong with either choice, as long as their intentions are pure and right in the eyes of God.</p></div>

              <p>It is true also that there are people who make use of the church to get rich or for other personal material gains. That is wrong. Just to point out, that it doesn't happen with just one religion but also with charities or other associations started with good will.</p>
              <p>It is as wrong in any case and these people should have their own answering to. Be it to authorities, to the people or to a higher being.</p>

              <p>There is a parable of the three brothers, who were given some money to keep.</p>
              <p>One invested the money entrusted to him and he returned more. He was praised and more added to his pile.</p>
              <p>One invested the money and lost all of it. He was consoled.</p>
              <p>One hid the money, and has exactly the same amount all the time. He was ticked off, and his money was given to the second brother.</p>
              <p>All religions extort their followers to better themselves, or at least try. Succeed or fail doesn't matter. But don't play it safe by not trying, thereby guaranteeing not failing or succeeding. That is the bigger sin.</p>
