And they began to make merry.<br>(Read Luke 15:11-32 for full story)<br></blockquote>Not convinced? here is one more, there is now no condemnation, so there is no need to 'condemn' yourself. God loves you.<br><br><blockquote><br>Roman 8:1-4<br>1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.<br>2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.<br>3 For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,<br>4 in order that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.<br></blockquote>and He still loves you, yes, even now, once you had received Christ into your life, there is nothing that can separate you from God's love for you.<br><br><blockquote><br>Roman 8: 31-39<br>31 What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who is against us?<br>32 He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, will he not also give us all things with him?<br>33 Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies;<br>34 who is to condemn? Is it Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us?<br>35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?<br>36 As it is written, "For thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."<br>37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.<br>38 For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,<br>39 nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br></blockquote></div>
