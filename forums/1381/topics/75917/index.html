            <div class='col-md body'>just wanna say some of my own thoughts regarding this Father Kang case... many many ppl in singapore condemn him for wat he has done, saying tt he's a priest and shouldn't be doing this and he should be severly punished, but why aren't we looking at ourselves b4 we condemn others... i mean aren't we all sinners too? i rem a particular story in the bible, where some ppl brought a woman who has commited adultery to Jesus and wanted to stone her to death. but Jesus said tt if unless you are sinless, what rite do we have to stone her? in the same context, what right do we have to condemn Father Kang? Whatever he does, he'll be answerable to God what Judgement day comes. So i guess we all shouldn't condemn him.

The Catholic clergy is Christ's representative on Earth. Which protestant pastor has this power?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Most importantly, Father Kang does not appear penitent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah i agree with you that he doesn't appear remorseful. Maybe he felt tt wat he has done is right, only he knows. anyways this discussion would go on forever and ever because there are so many ways to look at it but i must admit, this incident is a stain on the Catholic community in Singapore. Hopefully we'll all still remain strong in our faith. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
