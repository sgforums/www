            <div class='col-md body'>I think it should have been settled within the church and not in court. Other then that, I cant really comment because I think alot of the case rests on his motives. And we dont know his true motives do we? If he really meant for the money to be used for good, that is allow the homeless to stay in the apartments he bought or give it to a missionary group then it would be a good thing. But if that was what he intended, he would have told the truth. Its possible for christians to fall into sin even and especially for good christians. Those who does the most work for God are often the ones being tempted.</div>

Matters of the church should be settled by the church and not by the state. The issue was really concering Father Kang, the church and the people whos money was taken.  The Matthew 18 prinicple, settle the issue with the brother who sins against you, therefore the matter should have been settled within the groups of people I mentioned above.</div>

First settle it within yourselves, then with witnesses, then bring it to the church. In my opinion If that does not settle it, then go to court. No, the church should not be allowed to commit crimes. It is my opinion that church matters should be settled in church. Killing someone or raping someone is not a church matter. But the money is. It was a church member's donation to the church which was taken and by te church priest and used for his own benefit. He has commited a sin and even a crime, I am not saying he did not. But I do think that the group has made a mistake in handling the situation. A bad example would be if I gave my friend money because he said it is for charity organization, but he takes the money and uses it to buy a car for himself. The matter is really between me, him and the organization, not the government.  By the way, all of the above is just my opinion.</div>

No because if he returns my money I can just forgive him and not go to court at all. Yes because, if I want my money back and he doesnt return my money after everything I've tried then it would be a civil court case. It is hard to say b/c it involves many "ifs" and "if nots". What i was trying to say was just that the church should have tried to handle the case instead of going to court and making such a big matter out of it.

Your example is simplifying the situation. There r probably hundred over people being cheated of the money, thousands of people tat cannot make use of this funds due to tis matter. He is guilty which there is no argument against it. There may be some individual who had also commited the same offense as this father as well. If we just cover it up and settle the problem within itself, and no punishment is meted out to this father, wat messages r u sending to the masses ? Try and cheat as much money as possible lah !

I really dun give a fcuk, anyway, he's in jail now for his crimes, maybe his god will save him if he's really done nothing wrong. Else, jus accept the fact.</div>

Maybe the raper bribes the family so much tat she cannot pursue justice ? Tat is why it is called compoundable offence isn't it ? IMO, the second objective of law is to deter or prevent offender from committing the crime again. If the raper is successfuly charged and lock up, he is prevented from raping again. It also serves as a deterent to the rest of the public on the offense of raping. The victim cannot have a say whether she want to carry on the charge or not. She can be protected like covering her face during hearing and her name be censored from the press. If she refuse to cooperate she will be sue herself with obstruction to justice.

R u sure the church can serve justice more efficiently or fairly than the legislative court ?

Is he trying to act like robin hood at all ? The court of law do look into the motives behind a crime before meting judgement. Tat is call mitigation. The punishment is different if u steal money because u want to support a dying mother than going to casino to spend the money.<br><br></div>
