            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.... Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.<br>(Romans 13:1-5)<br><br>We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious...<br>(1 Timothy 1:8 )<br><br>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent - not to put it too severely. The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him. Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him...... If you forgive anyone, I also gorgive him. And what I have forgiven-If there was anything to forgive-I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.<br>(2 Corinthians 2:5-11)<br><br>But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.<br>(1Timothy 6 :6-10)<br><br>I take the whole situation as a lesson from God to us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

If the raper is successfuly charged and lock up, he is prevented from raping again. It also serves as a deterent to the rest of the public on the offense of raping. The victim cannot have a say whether she want to carry on the charge or not. She can be protected like covering her face during hearing and her name be censored from the press.

Journalism is like tis. They do not make up stories and they come up with updates on popular issues. Even CNN or BBC do these thigs. There r other issues tat became sensational such as one admin officer in SIA tat manage to embezzled many millions or the unknown husband who employs a kid to murder his wife. They too get sensational isn't it ? People r interested to know more about such cases, because they r special in their own right. Why blame the newspaper who entertain their request ?<br><br><blockquote>You still dont get that I am trying to say that reporting an incident and blowing it up is different.

Just because he a father he will be treated differently from a normal person ?<br><br>Why don't u answer me tis question. <strong>Just because he is  father, just because he embezzled the money from a church and tat is why he shouldn't be sue, bring to court and punish but instead the whole matter is being covered up and settled within the church ?</strong><br><br>Lets say he return every single penny. So wat ? He don't need to serve any punishment ? He return the money because he was caught. If he wasn't he probably hold on to it forever and he has lost nothing. He deserve punishment none the less.<br><br>If he is confronted by church he can probably take a flight and escape to some other countries the next day while in a police case his passport will be taken.

People just want t know more things about famous people than people they do nto know. Tat is a fact of life. U don't like the way newspaper publish news but it is the fact about newspaper and journalism. I can safely say 99% of all newspaper publish news its targeted audience want to read. Since there is no way to change tat fact, wat do u suggest to prevent the blowing up of news yet allow reporting of it ? How ?? </strong><br><br>I already said how. The thing is that news is no longer called news but entertainment. News is meant to bring updates of events, inform people of things that can help or educate them. Maybe news has changed over the years to print only what people want to read but that does not mean it is right.<br><br><strong>The newspaper doesn't write he is guilty before he is proven one either. If the people interprete it as he is guilty, then wat to do ? Don't report on it at all ? </strong><br><br>Have you read the repotrs. Most of them says Priest take millions or priest something. And most of them read in a way that leads to his being guilty. The way things are worded makes a whole lot of difference. Report it once things are final or report it as an update not as a feature story. And yes its the people that interprete, but how can people intreprete if the news is written straight and simple.<br><br><strong>They also do write up on issues tat r difficult or not popular. Journalism is like tis. They do not make up stories and they come up with updates on popular issues. Even CNN or BBC do these thigs. There r other issues tat became sensational such as one admin officer in SIA tat manage to embezzled many millions or the unknown husband who employs a kid to murder his wife. They too get sensational isn't it ? People r interested to know more about such cases, because they r special in their own right. Why blame the newspaper who entertain their request ? </strong><br><br>Because it is not fair coz the media affects things whether you believe it or not. Why is it that this murdered wife gets more coverage then others, what about other murder cases? I dont think they are any less significant. They should get fair and equal coverage.<br><br><strong>As a chinese saying goes "If u do not want people to be aware of tis situation, the only way is not to commit it in the first place". He commit the offence and u blame the press for blowing it up ? We r not against tis fellow but if any father, priest or religious leaders tat commit the same act it will still appear on the headline.<br><br>U r fully aware of wat the media will do. Since reporting on the incident inevitably blows it up, how do u propose to prevent it ? Again I say by covering up lah ! Wat other method do u propose ? </strong><br><br>Yes, i blame the media for blowing up cases and not giving fair reports on other cases. Why is it that the person must be religious so that it will be in the headlines. So if a person is just a normal citizen he gets just small coverage. Where is the fairness in that.<br><br><strong>So u r trying to say if a normal person embezzled 5 million and he got charged and sentence to 5 years jail he deserve it while if a father embezzled 5 million and he didn't get charge since it has been covered up and he escape scot free is okie ? Just because he a father he will be treated differently from a normal person ? </strong><br><br>Because it is a church matter therefore the church should deal with it. I gave my example which you said was simplified but that is still the reason. I dont think he should escape scot free but different punishment should apply to different people. And anyway, settling in within church does not mean not going to jail. They can settle it in a way that he has to serve time too in prison.<br><br><strong>Why don't u answer me tis question. Just because he is father, just because he embezzled the money from a church and tat is why he shouldn't be sue, bring to court and punish but instead the whole matter is being covered up and settled within the church ?</strong><br><br>It shouldnt be covered up but it should be settled within the church first before going to the law.<br><br><strong>Lets say he return every single penny. So wat ? He don't need to serve any punishment ? He return the money because he was caught. If he wasn't he probably hold on to it forever and he has lost nothing. He deserve punishment none the less. </strong><br><br>Read above.<br><br><strong>If he is confronted by church he can probably take a flight and escape to some other countries the next day while in a police case his passport will be taken. How r u going to say to tat ? </strong><br><br>Then if he runs go to the police. I never said that the police should not be involved, only that they should have tried to settle it within the church first.<br><br><strong>For your swiss bank thingy, surely the church can not do anything to it either. At least the law is better off than the church since it covers more aspects isn't it ? </strong><br><br>That is true. The swiss bank part is just an example that the police can not be 100% sure that he has returned all the money.</div>

CNN is more known for being liberal, if someone wanted to read more conservative news they can watch FOX or something else.  But there is no such thing in singapore.

They can trace where he fly to, then who he come into contact with, what place he took, then what taxi he took. The police is much more resourceful then just sitting at tables and calling up for bank infomation.<br><br><strong>The US or the West do not have such thing either. They support the notion of justice and equality as well. </strong><br><br>The US does. Please check that. They certainly have such a thing as a legal private deal out of court but allowed by the court. And yes, they support equality much more then other countries does.<br><br><strong>He can have doctor the accounts or the record of the money. How about some members who had died, moved or untracable ? Can u remember them ? Wat u have calculated is just an approximate. The true figure may varies greatly. </strong><br><br>Can he doctor every single accout? The police also cannot be 100% sure how much money he has taken, the church cannot be 100% sure, but they can do it to the closest they can. I doubt you go to church and donate money. The records are pretty good and all you know. Religion isnt as dumb as you think it is.<br><br><strong>The West do not have such contract either. </strong><br><br>They certainly do. I have read about it when I was in the US.<br><br><strong>as said it is not biase as they can do it towards any religion. Why is it fair and equal ? U have not explain yourself well at all ! Even if the West emphasizes human rights they still respect equality. If anyone admits to their mistake, they get a lesser sentence in court under mitigation. Where do u get justice and equality ? Do u know wat is fairness, equality or justice ? </strong><br><br>It is bias against religion in general. It is justice because a person who repents gets a lesser sentence. It is justice. I dont know your version of fairness, equality or justice as you keep stating. But it seems very fair to people. Someone makes a mistakes, admits to it and gets punished but less then a person who still refuses to admit to the end.<br><br><strong>Someone who had commit the same offence get to be judged in court while someone from church don't ? Is tat EQUALITY ? If the church person get a lesser punishment compare to someone not from it, is tat FAIRNESS ? They can easily escape or not get a punishment tat is nto befitting, is tat JUSTICE ? Is tat a solution ?? </strong><br><br>Come on, I said it before. Why singaproe court? Why is singapore court superior to the other justice systems in the world? He will get lesser punishment because he admits to his crime and not because he belongs to the church. What punishment do you see as the more benifiting? Must all be caned? What? Escape? Escape wat? How is going to jail in vatican city a form of escape?<br><br><strong>Why don't u go around and ask other people wat do they think about tis illegal deal ? U have not stated clearly how do the church do justice at all, tat is why I said they cannot handle justice. I tell u the church cannot mete out justice is true to almost everyone except people who r fanatics in your religion. </strong><br><br>Well, I will say the people I asked actually agrees with it. I have stated very clearly yet you refuse to accept my pov while I have accepted yours. Not saying you have to agree with it though. The last statement is so extremely bias, but I know you are bias against religion in general so I should expect that from you. IYO the church cannot  do justice because your idea of justice differs so much from what justice actually is. And your statement has no backing at all, coz you have not surveyed even a 1000 people have you? So yeah. This is the end. I made my mistake in about 2 assumptions. But the end results in debating with you will be religion vs. hate religion.<br><br>By the way, i cannot be considered a fanatics. Religious people consider me an outcast and i guess I can take you to represent all non-religious people and i also seem like an idiot and irrational person. So both ways, I am just an outcast therefore my eccentricity may not be suited for anyone outside people of similar percuilar traits. i.e plaine weird outcast.  haha..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The risk is not knowing whether there is a threat or not. Just forcing people to testify is not the best thing to do. </blockquote>U fail to acknowledge the case where it is just pure bribery. There is no threat and the witness r bribed into not giving their statement.<br>How do u prevent tat ?<br><br><blockquote>No, evidence is necessary, but witness is not. If you need simple examples, I will provide them. </blockquote>Both evidence and witness r necessary. If u insist tat witness is not important at all for judgement then u really know nuts about law.<br><br><blockquote>POlice can protect themselves. And the judges are protected too. Most of them live in houses with gates and all. The law is to do justice which is to better the lives of people. But you know, many judges get killed too. And they get threats almost everyday. So yes, they are protected. </blockquote>Wat is the diff between normal policeman, judges and witness ? All r human isn't it ? If a group of people r determined to kill one individual, the difficulty is relatively the same. Do policemen live in houses with gates ? Is there a law saying tat judges should have a house with tall gates ?<br><br>Your version of "better" is to make a few individual happy at the expense of the rest. HAve u better the lives of all the people ?<br><br><blockquote>No, everyday news are pretty fair. None are blown up. </blockquote>Then why do u discredit the judgement of the editors and talk about editors make up only of a minority thus unable to make judgement ?<br><br><blockquote>You are wayy exaggerating. The fact is you agree that this piece of news is "interesting" because of the involvement of religion. </blockquote>U r wayy exaggerating yourself. U do agree to the fact tat this piece of news is interesting and u do agree tat if other religion commit the same offence the media will report to the same extent as yours. Wat is your case against the press ?<br><br><blockquote>I am saying that court and law is differnt. If a person confesses to his/her crime does he/she still need to go to court? No, but the law is still done isnt it. </blockquote>Why not ? He still need to receive judgement isn't it ? Wat do u mean by No ?? He has commit a crime, the harm has already been done so he need to receive sentence. Tis is not christainity which "Just ask to be forgiven and it will be done". I can killed hundreds men and then confess to police after tat. Just because I confess does tat means I am a free man ? NO !<br><br><blockquote>Hm.. emotional/mental punishment is much worse then physical. And anywayz, you were saying that if it was settled the the private legal deal that i assumed sg had, he wouldnt feel remorse and i was replying that he can still feel remorse. </blockquote>How can u assume he will feel remorse forever about it ? U r trying to say instead of giving him physical punishment like jailing, they should NOT have given him any sentence and let him feel remorseful. Tis tactics is dumb and cannot work. Letting him live with Remorse is not a punishment at all.<br><br><blockquote>They are smarter, more experience but not a better person. They are normal human beings who make mistakes. Embezzling is illegal. I was saying the detention of Jesus was wrong because he(jesus) had not done anything illegal. Remember you were talking about Jesus??.. I'm sorry I cannot quote from the beginning of our discussion, but I will try to clear up things like this whenever possible</blockquote>They r more qualified than u or me, thus better at making judgement. Everyone made mistakes, does the church priest not make them too ? Going by your case, doesn't tat make nobody in the world capable of giving judgement, and all criminals can walk freely ?<br><br><blockquote>Actually everyone is equal in singapore till something like this comes along. Then religion is thrown into the limelight for doing something bad, and then the general public who does not really know what faith is about has a bad impression of faith. But I dont blame others for this, coz everyone does it. They take the bad of something and overwrite the good so the whole thing looks bad. </blockquote>Tat is human nature. If u want to blame, blame the maker.<br><br><blockquote>Actually, we are talking about him not getting caught or released on bail. Just the church discovering his acts and asking him about it. I dont think people are stupid, if his starts buying air tickets or something then go to the police or something. Dont just stand there and watch him enter the plane or boat and run away. </blockquote>No I am talking about him already getting caught and release on bail. U say tat the church make their own investigation isn't it ? Doesn't tat surely alert him he was being investigated ? He can run away when he realise tat isn't it ? Isn't tat the same as "getting caught and release on bail" ?<br><br>How do u know he is buying the ticket for air travel or boat travel ? U send someone to follow him around 24 hours a day, thus committing harassment to tat fellow ? For the police they can confiscate his passport or place his name into wanted list who cannot exit the country. Can the church do tat ?<br><br><blockquote>I have answered you many times. I think it is fair that he is handled by vatican city. The church belongs to them. I dont know if you heard about the molestation by priest in the US, vatican city handled some of those too. If tomorrow, I go to malaysia and do something illegal, it does concern singapore because I am a singaporean right. Maybe not. Maybe they dont care because it didnt happen on singapore soil. I dont know specific Singapore rules about such things. </blockquote>It is not fair as he is handled differently from other people. In case u do not know, those who handle the molestation case in US has to do double and have to go for civilian trials too. Only when the victim decided to compound the offence, tat is stop charging the priest then does he have to face trials in Vatican. Please take not e of the word, compoundable.<br><br>For your example of law, u r dead wrong. No matter which country u r from, if u commit a crime in other country u face their sentence. Remember Mcheal Faye ? He is American yet have to face singapore trial if he commit crime in singapore. U really don't know anything about law do u ?<br><br><blockquote>Not really, like I said something/someone cannot just dissappear into thin air. They can trace where he fly to, then who he come into contact with, what place he took, then what taxi he took. The police is much more resourceful then just sitting at tables and calling up for bank infomation. </blockquote>U have greatly overestimate police capability. They can trace to where he fly to but how to trace which taxi, which place he went to ? Do u give your personal particulars when u board a taxi, MRT or bus ? How does police know where he went to ?<br><br><blockquote>The US does. Please check that. They certainly have such a thing as a legal private deal out of court but allowed by the court. And yes, they support equality much more then other countries does. </blockquote>Tat is called "compoundable" offence which singapore have too. Very little offence is compoundable by nature. Molest though is compoundable whilc embezzling of money is not. If u talk about private deals u probably talk about molestation case. Father Kang case is not a molest case but a breach of public trust. Please read up basic law...<br><br><blockquote>Can he doctor every single accout? The police also cannot be 100% sure how much money he has taken, the church cannot be 100% sure, but they can do it to the closest they can. I doubt you go to church and donate money. The records are pretty good and all you know. Religion isnt as dumb as you think it is. </blockquote>The police certainly can know more closer than the church since they can find out the amount he has stash in banks. Can u tell me the church can approximate better than the police ? If not then I think u do not have an argument about it.<br><br><blockquote>They certainly do. I have read about it when I was in the US</blockquote>Please read more. U probably touch on molest or compoundable cases only.<br><br><blockquote>It is bias against religion in general. It is justice because a person who repents gets a lesser sentence. It is justice. I dont know your version of fairness, equality or justice as you keep stating. But it seems very fair to people. Someone makes a mistakes, admits to it and gets punished but less then a person who still refuses to admit to the end. </blockquote>I have stated many times in the court here they do look at people who admits to mistake and lower their sentence. THEY DO. Tat can be an area for mitigation ! I have been trying to tell u tat for many replies yet u do not realise it. The sentence is only lowered, NOT ELIMINATED. If it is ELIMINATED then I will go around, committing crimes and then confess to it later. Does tat means I do not have to face any sentence at all ?<br><br><blockquote>Come on, I said it before. Why singaproe court? Why is singapore court superior to the other justice systems in the world? He will get lesser punishment because he admits to his crime and not because he belongs to the church. What punishment do you see as the more benifiting? Must all be caned? What? Escape? Escape wat? How is going to jail in vatican city a form of escape? </blockquote>I am not comparing singapore court with the world, I am comparing the court system to church system. U r trying to say The church can mete out justice better than the court here ? Tat is ridiculous !<br><br>Please read the above passage again.<br><br><blockquote>Well, I will say the people I asked actually agrees with it. I have stated very clearly yet you refuse to accept my pov while I have accepted yours. Not saying you have to agree with it though.

But the end results in debating with you will be religion vs. hate religion. </blockquote>U ask who ? Member of your church ? They support your notion church can give trials, perform investigation and sentence people ? The end result is religion system vs legal system in performing justice, which I clearly see u r not being rational or provide any justification about it. Tis is not "religion vs hate religion"<br><br><blockquote>By the way, i cannot be considered a fanatics. Religious people consider me an outcast and i guess I can take you to represent all non-religious people and i also seem like an idiot and irrational person. So both ways, I am just an outcast therefore my eccentricity may not be suited for anyone outside people of similar percuilar traits. i.e plaine weird outcast. haha.. </blockquote>If I am u, I should probably should ponder why am i an outcast.</div>
