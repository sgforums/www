I make a big deal about it not being in the bible because we are asked to obey God. Read 2 Peter for his exposition on destructive heresies and the like. The bible is our guide and not man. Christmas was created by the RC chuch.<br>4. if you don't get it, you don't get it. what is wrong with celebrating christmas? you celebrate a pagan festival and get caught up with all the little other things that go along with christmas, like the mistletoe, the streamers round the tree, etc... these are all parts of the pagan ritual which was normalised and in this the devil has the church deceived... and it is not celebrated on the correct day. How would you feel if someone celebrated your birthday 3 months later?</div>

How do we get to know God, through spending time in prayer and in HIS WORD.<br><br>Jesus was a rebel who undestood the heart of the Father, but do we?<br><br>Jesus would not have celebrated Christmas because He would have recognised the correct spirit behind it. We are asked to discern the spirits or to test the spirits behind things. Also, chistmas is the mass of Christ, which was only instituted way after His death. Jesus himself would not have celebrated christmas because it is not within the Jewish custom to celebrate birthdays.<br><br>Mixing with tax collectors and prostitutes etc... how does that relate to Jesus celebrating christmas? Yes He associated with people that the pharisees or "holy" people would not, but it was only because He was looking to restore them to God.<br><br>shalom to you.</div>
