I think he mentioned this while discussing the joss stick and other touchy issues ..</div></blockquote>Just came back from a business trip.... still kinda of zonked out....<br><br>Yup, Icey's got me spot on here....<br><br>.... but with regards to the various the various postulation on whether Christmas or Easter is Biblical or not, I have this to say:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Culture is alive in that in any society, we immerse the various elements of a culture into our lifelihood. In rural Shanghai, I have seen a Catholic church that looks like a Buddhist temple, right in the middle of the sanctuary there is a huge painting that looks like the Buddhist heaven, but if one is to look closely into it, one will find Jesus, the twelve apostles plus heaps of Christian imagery. So should we b-itch about the politically incorrect style? or rejoice because poor folks have a way to honor God (might not be a way that I like?)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If there are supposedly paganistic imagery in our festivities, there is very little one can do right now to correct it, as if there is really a correct take on such festivities. Look at it this way: churches cannot even agree on the correct way to perform baptism, a totally Christian event. All the folks here can quote various passages from the Bible to invalidate immersion, or sprinkling, or whatever ways a church is to use.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To go beyond the supposedly paganistic imagery, "Christian" festivities serves a larger purpose of a rallying point for churches to open their doors to a more receptive crowd during such festivities.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> At a personal level, I generally have no issues with the chronologically inaccurate dates for the festivities, I do have issues with the image of Santa Claus. My reason is simply: Santa Claus is should NOT be the reason for Christmas, Christ is.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the bottom line is: to those who think that Christian festivities are overladen with pagan symbols and it affects their walk with God - don't be part of the celebration, but such folks need to understand that there is good reason to continue to do so, eg NCC's yearly collaboration with Mediacorp on their Christmas eve performance, where even Joe Prince gets up an sings a ditty or two.<br></div>

I make a big deal about it not being in the bible because we are asked to obey God. Read 2 Peter for his exposition on destructive heresies and the like. The bible is our guide and not man. Christmas was created by the RC chuch.<br>4. if you don't get it, you don't get it. what is wrong with celebrating christmas? you celebrate a pagan festival and get caught up with all the little other things that go along with christmas, like the mistletoe, the streamers round the tree, etc... these are all parts of the pagan ritual which was normalised and in this the devil has the church deceived... and it is not celebrated on the correct day.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok my personal view. Christmas Day 25 Dec is Pagan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>but i do celebrate Christmas the same way i attend christian wakes and funeral.<br><br>Does singing some hymns and read scriptures at the wake enhance the reality of eternal life? NO. the bible never says we should do such things for the dead then why do it still?<br><br>i do these because these are oppournity for people to come to know Christ and His gospel proclaimed.<br><br>Christmas - a Saviour was given<br>Good Friday - the Saviour died<br>Easter (pagan name) - the Saviour rose from the grave<br><br>Funerals and wake - There is life eternal for those in Jesus Christ.<br><br>With these benchmarks i have chosen to celebrate all the above...pagan or biblical the origin. Dun let dates and day rule you because of that you are still under law. Be under grace...live under grace.<br><br>like i said before...if everything want to debate whether or not pagan...i suggest you soak urself in a chamber of anointing oil so as to keep yourself unstained by the world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Christmas Day 25 Dec is Pagan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>but i do celebrate Christmas the same way i attend christian wakes and funeral.<br><br>Does singing some hymns and read scriptures at the wake enhance the reality of eternal life? NO. the bible never says we should do such things for the dead then why do it still?<br><br>i do these because these are oppournity for people to come to know Christ and His gospel proclaimed.<br><br>Christmas - a Saviour was given<br>Good Friday - the Saviour died<br>Easter (pagan name) - the Saviour rose from the grave<br><br>Funerals and wake - There is life eternal for those in Jesus Christ.<br><br>With these benchmarks i have chosen to celebrate all the above...pagan or biblical the origin. Dun let dates and day rule you because of that you are still under law.

            <div class='col-md body'>We should not think of this thread as imposing the practise of one church to the others.  But rather, a good opportunity for Christians from all denominations to learn from one another other each denomination reinforce what they learn from the bible.<br><br>As for observing Sabbath on Saturday, the Seventh Day Adventists do practise that and have their services on Saturdays only.  If you look at the church history, the early Christians did that too.<br><br>But most Christians today go to church on Sunday instead of Saturday because Jesus rose from the death on a Sunday.  The RC call it The Lord's Day, while the Prost regard Sunday as synonymous terms for the Christian day of worship.<br><br>So it's neither right or wrong for Christians to go to church on Sat or Sun.</div>

In rural Shanghai, I have seen a Catholic church that looks like a Buddhist temple, right in the middle of the sanctuary there is a huge painting that looks like the Buddhist heaven, but if one is to look closely into it, one will find Jesus, the twelve apostles plus heaps of Christian imagery. So should we b-itch about the politically incorrect style? or rejoice because poor folks have a way to honor God (might not be a way that I like?)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If there are supposedly paganistic imagery in our festivities, there is very little one can do right now to correct it, as if there is really a correct take on such festivities. Look at it this way: churches cannot even agree on the correct way to perform baptism, a totally Christian event. All the folks here can quote various passages from the Bible to invalidate immersion, or sprinkling, or whatever ways a church is to use.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To go beyond the supposedly paganistic imagery, "Christian" festivities serves a larger purpose of a rallying point for churches to open their doors to a more receptive crowd during such festivities.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the bottom line is: to those who think that Christian festivities are overladen with pagan symbols and it affects their walk with God - don't be part of the celebration, but such folks need to understand that there is good reason to continue to do so, eg NCC's yearly collaboration with Mediacorp on their Christmas eve performance, where even Joe Prince gets up an sings a ditty or two.<br></div></blockquote>Totally agree with you.<br><br>We might want to consider the factors on why the Christians in the early days failed in China (Christianity was first introduced to China during the Tang Dynasty but it didn't survive for long).</div>
