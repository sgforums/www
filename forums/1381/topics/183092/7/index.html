To be able to grow one must always have a teachable heart/spirit and be humble before the Lord.<br><br>It does not mean that just because you had one revelation from God about something, that, that is it. God can and more often times will reveal more to you if you are willing to hear. But we get so comfortable just doing the same old, same old that we often times miss out on what God is saying or trying to say to us.<br><br>The thing with revelation is that you can and will hear from God if you are willng and want to. God can speak very accurately into your situation if you want to hear from Him. The key in my opinion is to be silent before the Lord and wait upon Him. So often I find that if I am quiet before the Lord, He will speak to me and often times, it will be confirmed by my Christian friends who receive the same word from the Lord for me.<br><br>I think in reality, many people do the asking part, but very few wait upon the Lord long enough for the answer!<br><br>Divine revelation is for all of God's children. We just have to ask.<br><br>Jeremiah 33:3<br>3 'Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.'<br><br>God Bless</div>

I totally agree with you. One time, we had a messianic Jew conducting a sermon on the various jewish festivals which included the apparatus used. It was awesome!
