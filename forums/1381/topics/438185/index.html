              <p>Christians believe that we should all follow God's will and that all things whether good or bad that happen is for a good purpose and that only God knows the grand picture and that everything that happen whether good or bad is under God's control and its ok that we don't understand why this bad thing is happening but we should believe and trust God that even if bad things happen, it is for the sake of fulfiling God's grand purpose.</p>
              <p>Ok. Let us assume that christanity is a real religion and their God is real too. Let us now debate on how cruel this practise is.</p>
              <p>Christanity is like playing a game of chinese chess except that now, all the dices that we use in the game of chinese chess are real and alive human beings.</p>
              <p>Chinese chess works in such a way that its ok to sacrifice even all your pieces as the ultimate aim is to eat the enemy's general and than you will win the game. Alot of people will sacrifce their horses, canons, cavalary, solider etc just to eat the opponent's general.</p>
              <p>What the christians belives works in the same way as the game of chinese chess.</p>
              <p>We are all but just pieces in the game of chinese chess irregardless of whether we can be the most powerful general or the weakest solider and the player of the game is like God.</p>
              <p>The player(God) controls the entire game and orders his own general, soliders, cavalary, horse, canon etc to move in such a way that he will be able to eat the opponent's general.</p>
              <p>We as the horses, canon, cavalry etc need not know why we are being ordered to move in such a way. We just take orders from the player(God) and assume that all moves being done even if the player(God) give us to the opponent to eat/kill us are in such a way for the grand and noble purpose of the player(God) to kill the opponent's general.</p>
              <p>All moves by the player(God) is the wisest and we should not question the player(God) on why such a move is being done but simply just trust the player(God) and obey his will.</p>
              <p>Of course, in a game of chinese chess, all the horses, soliders etc are all fake.</p>
              <p>But in the game of chinese chess that God is playing, all the horses, soliders etc are real and alive human beings like all of us and we are all but pawns that God(the player) uses to sacrifice in order to catpure and eat the opponent's general to win the game.</p>
              <p>The God that christians belive is a cruel God that will resort to all sorts of cruel methods and sacrifices in order to achieve his goal of winning the games. He does not care whether how many soliders, canon, horses that he loses as long as he can win the game is ok already.</p>
              <p>Now, do you all believe in such a cruel and evil God who is willing to sacrifice you just to achieve his aim?</p>
              <p>Do you all think christantity who belives in such a God is such a good and loving religion as proclaimed by them?</p>

              <p>Secondly, chess has 2 players. Who is the other?</p>

Ultimately, the Christian God is all-powerful, and can control both humans as well as even Satan. He dictates ultimately the decisions we make, either by giving us our genetic lineage or our cultural background.<br><br>So yes, if God exists, then he is playing a game with himself.

              <p>TS says Christian God is playing Chinese Chess with Christians as the horses, cannons, soldiers, etc. Didn't say play with who. So the Christian God must be a cruel one because he sacrifice the horse, cannons, and soldiers (that means  Christians) so as to eat the general and win.</p>
