              <p>there are many weird tracts from strange religious organisations lah.. especially in the good US of A. many of such organisation are quite narrow in their view of the world.</p>
              <p>the news of the couple who got charged.... their defence is that they did not read all of the tracts.... they are either stupid or lying out right to get out of jail.</p>
              <p>i'd always said, even here in sgforums, regardless of how we feel about another religious organisation, try to refrain from commenting too much, or else sure kenna.</p>

              <p>I haven't read these comic tracts in full but I'm not surprised that folks would find them offensive.</p>
              <p>Based on excerpts from these tracts that I've seen on the net, Jack Chick had previously made <em>bizarre</em> accusations against the Catholic Church which gives him <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>zero</em></span> credibility in my view (eg: that the name of every protestant church member in the world is being recorded in a big computer in the Vatican to make future persecutions easier ??!? - From "My name ? ... In the Vatican ?"; that the pope manipulated Mohammed into starting Islam to conquer Jerusalem for him and that Mohammed's wife Khadijah was a Vatican operative on a secret mission ?!?? - From 'The Deceived').</p>
              <p>I don't know whether to laugh or to cry when I see such trash.</p>
              <p>Separately, when trying to evangelise, I feel that it is highly irresponsbile to distribute material that one has not seen or read, as claimed by the accused in the recent case. </p>

              <p>I only believe in spreading the Gospel with act of love.  Not by prosecuting the non believers or insulting their beliefs.  I was first exposed to Chick's literature when I was told to preach by distributing the literature.  I can't remember the tite of the tract but it was something about whether you have Christ in the centre of your life.  That one was quite harmless as compared to those anti-Islam and anti-Catholic literature that I came across years later.  Nonetheless, though I was very involved in Protestantism, I truly believed and understood that the way to spread the Gospel is to show your love for others.  It is the last commandment that Jesus has given us: Love one another as I have loved you.  I was against the idea of just merely "catch" people on the street, talk to them and expect them to convert. </p>
              <p>Years later as I returned to Catholic Church, I received an anti-Catholic literature in my letter box.  The title was: Why did Mary cry?</p>
              <p>I wanted to laugh.  On one hand, Chick accused the Catholics for "worshipping" Mary and rejected all Marian stuff, on the other hand, in this tract, he talked about Mother Mary's statue tearing.</p>
              <p>After that, I went into Chick's official website (now it is completely blocked by MDA) and read his anti-Islam and anti-Buddhism tracts.  Every one of them was a joke.</p>

              <p>IMO, the right way to spread the gospel is through love and charity.  We should display God's love in our action to let people see how good is our God. </p>
              <p>I only sense evilness in Chick's objectionable publication which will raise prejudice and hatred towards other religion and cause social disharmony.  The authority is going to take action against the local distributor of Chick's literature Tecman at Bras Basah.</p>

              <p>personally, i think Chick is a whackjob and requires a lot of psychiatric help and lots of heavy sedatives..</p>
              <p>the scary thing is that in the US, where the dumbing down of the population and the rising of religious idiocy is at fever pitch, Chick's tracts come in and are most effective...</p>
              <p>they're:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>short</li>
              <li>"religious"</li>

              </ul>
              <p>at the moment, the average US citizen has the attention span of about 30 seconds, they revel in their own ignorance, deride knowledge and wisdom, will look at these for something or someone to hate, something to feel self-righteous about and is a rallying cry for the "religious right" conservatives...</p>
