The purposes to build these monuments is completely different from construcing the tower of babel, which was clearly men wanted to control their own destiny to challenge GOD's sovereignty. </blockquote>Why no link ? In fact I see no link with u saying tat the tower of bable is to defy god. Where in the bible did they say tat ? Building the tower of babel is a sign tat men wanted to control their own destiny while building the twin tower is not ?<br><br><blockquote>U are deeply mistaken. The 'us' uttered by men never included GOD into the relationship. "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.

All this 'us' are referring to men only. They want to "make a name" for themselves for who to see? It's for GOD. </blockquote>"Us" never include god... and.... so ? R u telling me tat because men want to build a tower by themselves, god didn't get their attention because they r busy and he is pissed because of tat ? U r really making god sound more petty and attention seeking than ever ! They never defy god, they never break any of his rules and they get punished for working together ? Frankly the malaysian or the other peopel who built their monument probably do not link god into the picture as well. SO they r sinful and deserve a great punishment ?<br><br>Make a name for themselves... Don't u wanna make a name for yourself ? U want to be an unknown person who never contribute anything to society and noone remember u when u r gone ? They can make it for their decendents to see as stated before. They wanted to be remembered by their decendents. Is tat wrong ?<br><br><blockquote>It was Men who thought they would be scattered, even though they had unity in the first place. But they used it for evil and was thus scattered as a consequence/punishment. </blockquote>Evil ? building a mere tower is evil ? Wow man, then malaysian, chinese, italian and perhaps your hdb builder r all evil when they build these structures. God never promise them tat they would not be scatter. They just build a tower to gatherd together and tat is evil and wrong ? Why do u visit the doctor ? Maybe u just thought u had sickness even though u might be healthy all along. Why do u save money in the bank ? U should donate all of them because u may never need money urgently ? As said before, why do u think god had to spoonfeed us by protecting us from everything ? Why shouldn't u do the protection yourself ? Why depend on god to keep yourself from scattering when u should really work and try to find ways to be united. Why depend on god to heal your sickness when u should really be helping yourself by seeing a doctor. WHy should u depend on god to keep finding means to find money for u when u should really be started good habbits of saving money. U really stated a very weak argument here.<br><br><blockquote>Where does it says the tower is a symbol of defiance ? </blockquote>I see the passage and there is NOTHING in there tat says they r building the tower for defying god. But u interprete it as such and I am extremely puzled by tis</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let us detract.<br><br>The idea of a forum is for the healthy excercise of the mind. It is a platform for various exchange of ideas. It is an avenue to make sharing of opinions faster, more widespread, and with more clarity.<br><br>As with every new thing that is introduced, it gets misused. It has become another classroom for little opposing groups to form, so that they can claim to be the most happening group to be in. "The other group is never as cool".<br><br>Once you are in that group, you will never want out. Favourite pastimes include undermining the opinions of others, dismissing their questions and answers as irrelevant, not because they are, but because they are too hard to understand, and the dinner you just took is not enough to fuel your brain cells to get to work.<br><br>The addicted stay and prosper in there, looking for the next "fix". The "fix" goes in, gets pushed around, and wonder why there are addicts. The enlightened walk in, pass through, and walks out like it is a marketplace where addicts peddle their fix and beckons passersby to join in the foray.<br><br>The addicts appear to see it as some kind of higher calling. Why? Because if it makes them feel good, it cannot be wrong.<br><br>Or can it?</div>

Why? Because if it makes them feel good, it cannot be wrong.<br><br>Or can it?</div></blockquote>Hi Crosshair,<br><br>(If) the addicts u are refering to Christians, I disagree with u. I do not think all become Christians becoz of a feel good factor. Though Christians evangelise, it is the individual that benefit from it <strong>should he want to listen.</strong> It is our duty to preach, but we do not gain any merits or favours with GOD even if we convert thousands.<br><br>Each has his own views. But as this is a Christian forum, it is necessary for Christians to state clearly what he believes. There can be no 'can it be' 'can it be not' in Christian faith. If one doubt the inerrancy of the word, there is no basis for his faith. For yourself, is your view that nothing is right and wrong in this world? Is it really true that nothing is certain? U would probably have to reflect on what ur beliefs are for sure.<br><br>Many Christians, esp born-again (sorry for this word i know it may appear to some as arrogant) christians went thru a lot of tribulations/persecutions in life before we were converted. Like you, we also went thru a long period of 'can it be', 'can it be not', becoz i myself is by nature a skeptic. Like you, I also doubted the inerrancy of the word last time. I even seen Jesus as a fraud b4 I really believed in the word.<br><br>We may share with pple our testimonies, knowing that skeptics may dismiss them as nonsense, but it really is what we went thru. I just hope that u can have ur own experience and, if u decided u can listen, build on faith on ur own.<br><br>It is easy to be skeptic, but difficult to build on one's faith. For me it is definitely not a feel-good factor or 'fren-fren' that's why I was converted.<br><br>I was humbled. That's why I believe.<br><br>I believe, not becoz i can go to a concert-like worship service and feel good with the others. I have tried that, but after I left I forgot about GOD and went shopping and makaning happily...<br></div>

My intention was never to argue for the sake of arguing, but show to them GOD loves them, so that if they can listen they too can be saved.<br><br>Sometimes i wonder whether this is a futile attempt. As much as u think we are here to help ourselves, I wonder why men simply refuse to believe by remaining skeptical always, even though the goodness of GOD/the positive sides of the faith have been shown to them. Is this really men's rebellious nature that leads them to separation from GOD?<br><br>I still choose to believe SIS and many others here are good persons, and one day their misconceptions of the faith will too be cleared. I can see that SIS is a good person as he did not want Christians to be misled by false teachings.<br><br>If u are not seeking GOD earnestly, I believe u will not be here too. I dun think u are just looking for any 'fun' here do u?<br><br>I too, am very tired. But I tell myself life goes on. For many Christians here, we can only show u GOD's message. But it is only up to individuals who want to listen or not.<br><br>I was a non-believer too and I too did not like the idea of pple preaching to me in a "i am more holier than u" attitude.<br><br>If I have given pple the impression that I myself have done that, I apologise and I will reflect on my own mistakes.<br><br>It works both ways. i believe believers also do not like their faith to be put down.<br><br>It is always easier to condemn than to say 'sorry'......<br><br>For EH to be active again, we need all the forumers to continue posting. This means that there must be good discussions that attract pple to post more, not ones that put pple off and make them tired.<br><br>I am sorry i sound like the MOD, but i really do hope EH can make it back to the top forums again. More can be attracted to come here and hear the word when EH is in the tops.<br><br>One should always make more frens here, not enemies. It is simply not worth it to get one's blood level raise by 20 degrees when we take offend at the slightest comments and start throwing accusations at each other. If u dun agree with me, it is ok, we still can be friends and have a cup of tea.<br><br></div>
