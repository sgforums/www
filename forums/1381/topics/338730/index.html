              <p>And that's how many pro-gay 'churches' tries to justify their alternative doctrines. I'll refrain from quoting scripture since I assume all here has read the bible in its entirety and are aware of the teachings of God on sins of the flesh, and sins against the order of nature as God has intended.</p>
              <p>Indeed, some people are born with tendencies, while others get them during the course of their lives. But when we place emphasis on that, we tend to lose focus that all Man (meaning humans, and not just the male varient) are born with another tendency - the tendency to sin. Does that mean since we are born with it, we should thus accept it as something natural and good? Of course not.</p>
              <p>Another point, the tendency for those who are gay (whether born as such or by choice) is to have romantic, even sexual relations with those of the same gender. Are straight people at an advantage because they do not have the same problem? Hardly. Not one straight person can say that they are perfectly immune to sinful lusts against members of the opposite gender; how many straight persons, whether male or female, can say that they do not steal a glance, or have impure thoughts at another good-looking person of the alternate sex, even when they are attached or married, and know that in the presense of God he would not be able to justify the act?</p>
              <p>Every person, whether male or female, gay or straight are born with the tendency to sin. Each person's temptations are different, varied, and to different degrees depending on how God had made him/her but He had promised that any temptations given to us, he will also make sure that we are able to find a way out of it (read 1 Corinthians 10:13). In fact, we are told that for those who will be in the kingdom of God, chances are, will be those who has suffered and overcome with the LORD. (read Acts 14:22)</p>
              <p>So gays have their temptations (the unnatural attraction to their own gender) to overcome, as do the straight (the lust towards members of the opposite gender when they should be faithful to one). Just like how different people will encounter different problems in life, but all will have to learn to overcome them.</p>
              <p>As for cross-dressing, it is similar. Arkansaw makes a good point, if one does it due to a job, or some other reasons, and not because he/she are trying to be like the opposite gender, its probably okay. But if it is because he/she wants to be what he/she cannot be, that my words above applies. There are unnatural forces at work, and we should learn to overcome them, not accept them.</p>

              <p><em>Used</em> to pray for them? Why <em>used</em>, as in past tense? Shouldn't we pray continually for those with such afflictions? There's a limit to what we can achieve as human beings, but when we surface our wishes to God, He can do wonders. Hope it's just a typo there... :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, noticed something in your original posting, you asked how the 'church' and how 'christians' should treat them. Actually, the 'christians' ARE the 'church'. It was never meant to be just the name of a building or an organisation. The true church is made up of all believers that conform or at least try their best to conform to the word of God, whether seen or unseen in public eye, regardless of any formal membership.</p>
