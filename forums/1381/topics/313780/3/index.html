              <p>To reply to you, I choose not to go into detail what
              Christianity is about. For one thing, even among Christians the
              Christian experience is different. Not just with Christians, but
              with people in general. You can have different experiences and even
              different levels depending on who you meet, where you meet and even
              when you meet.</p>
              <p>I believe God has more than one side to him as well, as like how
              our own fathers on earth have more than just one side to them. God
              is not a tool that you summon or some hack you turn on in a game
              just so that everything goes the way exactly how you want it.</p>
              <p>God didn't promise that there won't be rainy days or hard times.
              God didn't promise everything will be smooth sailing. In fact,
              sometimes for his sake it gets harder. God didn't promise he'll do
              exactly what you want, but if you let him he will want the best and
              allow the best for you.</p>
              <p>Believing in Christ doesn't have to be just about going to hell,
              but also knowing and accepting someone was willing to sacrifice
              himself for you and you are acknowledging his love and care for
              you. I'm not asking you to become a believer, but personally, it
              doesn't have to be all about fear of hell.</p>
              <p>Also, the thing about doing good while on earth, I believe we
              will get rewards based on our deeds. But our deeds can also be
              about what we want for the other person, or that we know we do will
              bring a smile to God's face. Like a child who sometimes does
              something just so that the mother will smile, not in return for
              something like a cookie or a sweet, but just a simple smile knowing
              someone you love is pleased with you.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, sometimes not doing wrong is because you
              don't want to see the other person hurt, and not so much about
              worry how the person will take action against you.</p>
              <p>One thing I can tell you is that Christianity is more than just
              about heaven and hell. And miracles don't always have to be
              physical in nature.</p>
