              <p>since the ancient past, there were many religions preaching on their god, be it one god, two god or many god? some religions said so and so were an incarnate of their god or goddesses.</p>
              <p>so what is so special about a religion preaching on god? like a dime a dozen to me. basically all saying the same thing. the so and so god created the world and universe, mankind and everything. salvation is only thru the god. if not say so and so was an incarnate or a prophet or god's son sent to earth to wash away/forgive our mortal sins?</p>

              <p>dare I say religions made believers more superstitious and irrational, as they tend to believe and live their lives according to their religion. karl marx said, religions are like an opiate. I couldnt agree more with his statement.</p>
              <p>if all these religions since the ancient pasts have been preaching, then most must have been false since there cannot be so many truths. there can only be one truth. the truth of the matter is these religions were created by ancient men and their holy book were also written by ancient men, period. why am I so adamant on this? reason is simple. their so called god behaviour is just so human like behaviour. only humans exhibit human behaviours like selfishness, callousness, hatred, anger, biases etc etc.</p>

              <p>Guys, i understand the topic in question. I am proud to admit that i am a moderate muslim. Yoou see, there have been misconceptions of the theory of god. Some take it seriously and submit his whole life to god and some might want to neglect it. The problem is, does submitting all his commitment (when i meant all, i meant that he never cares about other factors) to god really put him near him? Not neccesarily true. Different people have different beliefs and some of these beliefs contradict each other and can be a cause of conflict in a state or country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The biggest religious conflict in the world at this mordern age is the fighting between Palestinians and Israel Jews. I know that this conflcit has been going on for decades or even centuries but i believe we shall live in harmony regardless of race or religion, whether you believe in the god of forunte or you beleive that there is only one god. Discrimination isn't a good thing. It'll ruin someone's life. As my father says, you should have a balance between mordern life and tradition (religion in this case).I've been in the shoes of an extremist before and i can tell you, the feeling isn't good. Those who have my facebook should know my random cries to god.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All in all, you beileve in your religion, and  I believe in mine. This is mentioned in Surah Al-Kafirrun in the Quran.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Blessings and peace be upon you.</p>

              christianity is the only one true religion. ask hindu and they say
              the same thing as well. ask other religion and they say the same

              <p>truth, by definition, is exclusive. Most systems of belief claim exclusivity, including atheism. If one posits there's no god, one has effectively excluded from the truth criterion other beliefs that posit the existence of god. </p>
              <p>question one would have to ask is then what constitutes the truth criterion? </p>
