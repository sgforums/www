              <p>But sometimes, a lil faith... can go a long way. Thats why the
                  difference between me and  u will most probably be that u will
                  die in a desert scenario, while i may survive a couple hundred
                  yards more, or even miraclelously survive with my faith and

              <p>I don't like the idea of miracles nor supporting the thought that a dice roll is unpredictable. I like to believe that with practice the dice roll can always result in the same number I desire.</p>
              <p>And I doubt that in the desert scenario that surviving a hundred yards more is due to faith. If a person with faith believed in death that there is deliverance from suffering, I think he will succumb to that thought more.</p>
              <p>You are conjecturing. We cannot calculate faith nor can we find similar test subjects identifically and coincidentally similar in matter in similar controlled situations to figure out whether a person who believed in Christ can survive longer.</p>
              <p>Speculation is biased.</p>

              <p>Sorry AndrewPKYap my friend, but</p>
              <p>1)You are very stupid to post this here as you are unreasonable in your claims. Just because you believe in evolution which is only a theory does not mean we have to be the same as you. If we were to follow you that means we need to jump off a building and just die if you do.</p>
              <p>2)It has been proven that mutations are always bad</p>
              <p>3)There is no proof that evolution happened. It is not observable. And those figures you see in the museums are actually made up by man's imagination. They merely find a backbone simillar to man's and claim it is man's ancestor.</p>
              <p>4)There is no difference in believing that a cat will give birth to a dog if you believe in evolution. Evolutionists use the concept of time to justify that a monkey will give birth to a human.</p>
              <p>5)Since you think you are a monkey, I suggest you go live in the wilderness naked, apart from humanity.</p>
              <p>6)If you want to destroy religion like Richard Dawkins, go to the atheist forums.</p>
              <p>7)The way you speak makes christians despise you more than you despise them.</p>
              <p>8)If you want to carry on we shall continue to entertain you, probably with name-calling, cursing, and branding.</p>
              <p>9) You are created through a bio-logical process but the way you talk makes no logic. Thus, you are illogical.</p>
              <p>10) you should Go kiss a monkey's arse.</p>

              <p>But the thing is, the TS here just likes to call non-believers
              of evolution stupid. As though he is so smart? He with his limited
              mortal human mind trying to replicate his own stupidity.</p>

              <p>yar, i read abt his posts..... i understand where is he coming from lah.... he juz want to make sure we've a sober mind and do we noe wat we are doing or not..... as sometimes in the context of religion, there is a lot manipulation going around, and there are victims blur blur and sotong sotong being used and enslaved by leaders and etc lor.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>aiya, juz dont take offense lor and no point convincing or justify lah as religion is something very personal.... a very personal choice..... juz take it as i respect his point of view lor..... actually i find some of his comments quite enlightening........</p>

              <p>nah....~</p>
              <p>i dun preach lah.... as i said is a very personal choice. be it u believe in God, Mary, Guan Yin, Da Bo Gong or etc..... when one believes, although he or she may not be able to articulate or justify the reasons behind his or her decisions, its his/her life mah, as long as he/she feels ok can liao..... then mayb down the road due to certain incidents or experiences or at the rite timing, he/she may or may not convert frm one religion to another, well in the end, its reli up to individual..... there is no point forcing doctrine down other people's throat lah, issues will backfired....</p>
