              <p>Agree with you partially but not totally. Some of the things said in the scriptures are scientifically proven and some are yet to be proven. Just 3 examples below :</p>
              <p>1) Buddha once held up a cup of water and remarked that there were 84,000 (a number to denote "many" or "countless") beings in it. No one understand what He meant. Today, we use a microscope and see that He referred to invisible microorganisms.</p>
              <p>2) Buddha described worlds beyond ours in the vastness of outer space and other dimensions which are inhabited by many other intelligent sentiment life forms, many of which are unlike ours. Aliens existence are yet to be proven.</p>
              <p>3) Buddhism believes in indestructibility or preservation of energy. This is in line with the law of conservation  of energy, which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be transformed from one form to another. The teaching of rebirth, is an example of  transfer of imperishable Mind or mental energy from  one body into another. It is yet to be proven but some scientists are looking into this issue.</p>

              <p>In response to laurence82, I have nothing regarding missionary schools, I believe this happens in all schools (I used the word: I believe. you may not believe me).</p>

              <p>And I apologise for generalising Rooney9's response, he may not be representative, and he is entitled to his opinions.</p>
              <p>But I need to make people aware that people have different experiences in life, it is easy to generalise the population and this must be taken in account.</p>

              <p>in the past, people usually the believers believed that drinking holy water can cure all ills and sicknesses. what you need to do is to believe in it and god will do the rest. to me its the same as the chinese amulets. whenever you have tummyache, just drink it and you will no longer have tummyache.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so are these people methods proven right in this day and age? if thats the case, there is no need to see doctors and no need to continue to experiement with medicine and science isnt it, cos holy water and amulets cured all sicknesses and diseases.</p>

              <p>But when you lost your iron ricebowl and your family left you, what are you left with?</p>
              <p>There are many routes to take, some may actually grow desperate and carve out a living by themselves, others require help (i.e. though groups and institutions)...</p>
              <p>If I take a real world example of my uncle, whom I thought lost some of his sanity in the past cos he always say the world is unfair this and such..., further interactions tells me that his experiences in life wasn't smooth, he needed an outlet for frustration but wasn't provided (lost his love, lost his job, most crap thing you can ever envisioned).. ended up like a 'living zombie', but when he joined a semi-religious organization (mind you this one is kinda 'progressive' :P if we compared against dogmatic ones) he received more social support than he expected... eventually pulled himself up together.</p>
              <p>And to this day he still tells me, "God provided the strength for me to face the world again."</p>
              <p>You may use science to prove this and that, but its only "PROVING", science naturally has the empirical advantage, but science do not attempt explain or analyse what is life 'really all about'.</p>

              <p>what has bible or god does? use god to explain everything, I think is too a simpleton explanations.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Not all christians reached the epitome of the understanding of the bible and its interpretations relating to the current logical possible scientific explainations. You dont see them discussing because they know, those that dont believe will never believe, even when it is right in their face. And not all christians are stupid.<br><br>Arrogance ? Believers and non-believers alike, their arrogance can be clearly seen in recent threads in Eternal Hope. Science and technology will continue to discover, continue to be debunked and keep moving forward to rediscover just to look back again to TRY to explain and there will always be that X-factor. Like the mapping of the genome of 99.99%, Its either unexplainable and so mysterious, or technology has yet to have advanced to the stage to explain it. Its just like discovering small n smaller n smaller things.<br><br>Yes i agree that alot of things are proven , but nobody seems to ask why given the intelligence, technology and readily available materials at that time able to do the feats only now science using physics , science able to prove that... its actually how it is. Just like the concept of quantum mechanics and seismology, going back in time 1000BC , try explaining it to them. U dont.. u TELL them to do it. e.g Walls of Jericho, Red Sea.. etc  u dont see them suddenly developing siege machines based on the new found intelligence and technology to create machines able to create seismic waves using the materials available at that time. No. Their mental capacity is not yet sophisticated and learned enough to grasp these concepts. The question then is, how did they know by just praying, being in solitude and quiet of the mind. Who told them? Did they become Einstein in just a day? If so.. why not use the new found intelligence to develop and create far more superior technology based on that knowledge. Fast forward now, that we have the intelligence to rely on science, like all things and the interpretations of the bible, the happenings are evolving, the bible has stopped just at the point where mankind has moved forward, miracles do no happen in such a large scale anymore. Miracles in a large scale has happened, and yet the people who witnessed it turned away. Its human nature. We forget. That is just a thought to ponder on. <br>            <br>            We are all still at an infancy to the discovery of the secrets of life and the creation of all things on this planet and the universe. So, lets just let the scientists continue in their quest of discovery and if those that dont believe, dont believe, Those that do.. will rely on their faith to believe. <br>            <br>            It is inevitable that our civilisation will end, knowing for certain with that dreaded feeling that it will eventually come. But at least, those that have the faith will have comfort to know that it is all God's plan and it is inevitable and we all will be judged in the final judgement. So we all live our lives accordingly , love compassion , repentence according to Jesus, Budhaa or whatever that is others of faith. The goodness of their teachings. Knowing that, we will be answerable to our sins, and that fear  will make us all a better person living a more meaningful life.</p></div>

              <p>Well, science never try to explain why your parents want to bear you despite of financial difficulties.</p>

              <p>Religion provides alternative view to such questions. There are many religion around the world, and they attempt to explain phenomena in different ways. Think of them as different software packages catered for generic population.</p>
              <p>To Rooney9,</p>
              <p>There are many scientific theories in the world that can be easily proven and disprove, but they are still strong cos they have strong underlying assumption. Please do not forget that hypothesis comes from ideas which may not have scientific basis, and proven theories in the past can also be easily proven wrong. Scientific claims without constant prove/disprove is totally scam.</p>

              <p><strong>Science of course is simply a method to discover the

              <p><strong>The computer is a product of Science.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>When science "invented" the computer, no religion was

                          cripples science. It puts limits on scientific discoveries when

              <p><strong>Religion is thousand of years old, long before science.
                          Blind or not, people simply carry on believing in the religious
                          teachings. They did not need science then, they do not need science
                          now.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>They will tell you "I choose to be stupid, why do you
                          care?" "I choose to believe, why do you care?" "I am stupid, I
                          cannot work things out for myself and therefore I believe, why do
                          you care?" </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As long as they do not try to impose their beliefs on
                          others, right, we won't care.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>There is no need to mix science and religion. Religion
                          deals with beliefs based on the imagination rather than tests,
                          observations and proofs. Science deals with findings based on
                          experiments, observations and proofs.</strong></p>

                                              away. He has understood what the mental

                                              they arise, and pass away. He has understood

              <p>I wonder do you see doctor when you are sick or just depend on your prayers to cure you. If you see doctor when you are sick , meaning you need science to cure you or you would have just pray for recovery. God will only help you to recover when you take medicine. Get it?</p>
