              <p>Sorry but just because it is compliant with physical laws of the universe does not mean it is totally correct. And with the physical laws of the universe, I presume you are saying the actual age of the universe.And for your info, evolution does not come with evidence but also imagination like how you stated creationism is. Those evolutionists only find a small bone in the sand resembling that of a human's and claim it is human's ancestor bones, while in the musuem, they make up the whole body of the animal with their imagination.</p>

              <p class="pBody">In the early 1800s, some observers in Western Europe noticed that
              certain fossils are usually preserved in sedimentary rock layers that,
              when traced laterally, typically lie above somewhat similar fossils.
              Decades later, after the theory of evolution was proposed, many
              concluded that the lower organism must have evolved before the upper
              organism. These early geologists did not realize that a hydrodynamic
              mechanism, <span class="cItalic">liquefaction</span>, helped sort organisms in that order during the flood.  [For an explanation, see pages <a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/Liquefaction2.html#wp1100074">172</a>–<a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/Liquefaction9.html#wp1092180">183</a>.]</p>

              <p class="pBody">Geologic ages were then associated with each of these “index fossils.”
              Those ages were extended to other animals and plants buried in the same
              layer as the index fossil. For example, a coelacanth fossil, an index
              fossil, dates its layer at 70,000,000 to 400,000,000 years old. [See <a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/AstroPhysicalSciences26.html#wp1438323">Figure 29</a>.] Today, geologic formations are almost always dated by their fossil content<a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1066491"><sup class="cSuperscript">a</sup></a>—which,
              as stated above, assumes evolution. Yet, evolution is supposedly shown
              by the sequence of fossils.

              70,000,000 years, the coelacanth (SEE-la-kanth) was first caught in
              1938, deep in the Indian Ocean, northwest of Madagascar. Rewards were
              then offered for coelacanths, so hundreds were caught and sold. In
              1998, they were also found off the coast of Indonesia.<a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1065434"><sup class="cSuperscript">c</sup></a> How could two groups of coelacanths, separated by 6,000 miles, survive for 70,000,000 years but leave no fossils?</p>

              <p class="pFigureCaption">Before coelacanths were caught, evolutionists incorrectly believed that
              the coelacanth had lungs, a large brain, and four bottom fins <span class="cItalic">about to evolve into legs</span>.<a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1177953"><sup class="cSuperscript">d</sup></a> Evolutionists reasoned that the coelacanth, or a similar fish, crawled
              out of a shallow sea and filled its lungs with air, becoming the first
              four-legged land animal. Millions of students have been incorrectly
              taught that this fish was the ancestor of all amphibians, reptiles,
              dinosaurs, birds, and mammals, including people. (Was your ancestor a
              fish?)</p>

              well-known fish expert from South Africa, studied the first two
              captured coelacanths, nicknamed the coelacanth “Old Fourlegs” and wrote
              a book by that title in 1956. When dissected, did they have lungs and a
              large brain? Not at all.<a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp2272865"><sup class="cSuperscript">e</sup></a> Furthermore, in 1987, a German team filmed six coelacanths in their natural habitat.

              <a name="wp1438348"> </a>
              <p class="pFigureCaption">Before living coelacanths were found in 1938, evolutionists dated any
              rock containing a coelacanth fossil as at least 70,000,000 years old.
              It was an index fossil. Today, evolutionists frequently express
              amazement that coelacanth fossils look so much like captured
              coelacanths—despite more than 70,000,000 years of evolution.<a href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1024358"><sup class="cSuperscript">g</sup></a> If that age is correct, billions of coelacanths would have lived and
              died. Some should have been fossilized in younger rock and should be
              displayed in museums. Their absence implies that coelacanths have not
              lived for 70,000,000 years.</p>
              <p class="pFigureCaption">And I guess AndrewPKYap is too stupid to even google arguments against the theory of evolution. As I said, go lick a monkey's arse if you like them so much as to think they are your ancestors.</p>

              <p>yes quite true when you imagine the society then, 2000 years ago, where science were basic and rudimentary. there were also religions that worshipped the god of sun, moon, wind etc. cos people then were not able to understand the natural phenomenon unlike now, where we are given the benefit of the doubt.</p>

              <p><strong>Read the bible as trying to describe something that
                  is indescribable and mysterious.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Don't ever read the bible as a science text book and
                  what is written in there as scientific truth. It need not be
                  conflicting. It can be complementary.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The present scientists are doing religious people a big
                  favor by pointing out the inaccuracies (scientifically speaking) of
                  the religious texts. If religious people take that as offensive,
                  they are just stupid.</strong></p>

              <p>I agree totally. Religious teachings and science can complement each other, but to explain perfectly; as in merely using each other's terminologies and concepts, would only lead to more doubts, confusion and prolonged frustration for some. Religious teachings cannot totally replace the role of science and vice versa.</p>
              <p>Science is continuous human learning in inconceivable time and space - direct human observation, experimentation and experience with nature and sensually-perceivable or describable phenomena. But religious teachings can have concepts which transcend beyond what is humanly possible to experience, at least on a mass scale (at least more than say 80% of the world population) with one's limited lifespan.</p>
              <p>For example, how many people can see infra-red light with their eyes, without the use of any special visual aid or equipment?</p>
              <p>A female gynaecologist may be the expert on female birth methods and so on, but if she has not been pregnant or given birth before, what she knows, feels or has observed through many deliveries is still indirect experience at the core.</p>
