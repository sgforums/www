              <p>Actually I suggest Dadeadman to contact some ex-atheists who are now believers and let them share their experiences. Atheists are somehow stubborn, and get pissed off when you talk to them about believing, so they must have done some research before becoming a believer. Hence they are more experienced and you should ask them. LOL.</p>

              <p><br>Well said, I share the same sentiments.    It is extreme.     Something we all must know about Christianity.   When the gospel is presented to non believers to make decision to accept it, they talk about sins will be forgiven, Jesus had paid the wages for sins when he died on the cross.    Believe then go heaven.  What they never tell people is that not every Christian will go heaven.    IN the new testament, it is stated that Jesus said not all who called him Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven, only those who repent and  do the will of God.</p>
              <p>They are so tricky, they trick people by leaving out that part that not all christians will go heaven.   They are like dishonest salesmen.</p>
              <p>Any way, God and the bible are overstated.  God giving empty promises.   </p>

              <p>So u do think there is a flaw in the bible. Then why still believe in a divine book which contains error ? Maybe John is prejudiced and like to go to heaven without doing good deeds. Just because of his biaseness, the whole bible direction could go completely different. All the things about grace etc r all rubbish then. If u read the bible carefully, u notice tat it emphasis so heavily on very short segments while ignoring other sections completely. R u really following jesus ? Or r u following paul trying to interprete john ?</p>
              <p>God don't have to show us. Sure... then don't demand us to blindly believe him. We don't believe not because we r disobedient. We don't believe because it doesn't make sense. If he show us evidence with no doubts, I will be the first to kneel and kiss his toes. I am not purposely disobedient or rebellous. I just sincerely do not believe he exist. And for a good reason too. Then he send me to hell for tat ?</p>
              <p>And lastly u talk about love. Wat love ? I love my son, I will never send him ever to hell for watever reason. Especially not because of vague silly reason like not believing a fantasy book. Now I got to ask... u say he love u because the bible says so or because u interprete his actions ?</p>

              <p>What u talking about ? God gave us a brain. We are not here to coddle .</p>
              <p>Of course He gave us choice. The choice u make like the actions u choose, will have its consequences. Simple. Every action, has an opposite reaction. The manual is there, u dont want it, u operate the machinery without knowledge, u  get crushed, who is to blame. Ur choice.</p>

              <p>Ahem, no offense to you BadzMaro, but I'm okay with some
              Christian and their acceptance that I am not accepting their faith.
              The only exception will be against some rather obtuse fellows who
              seemed all out against people who does not accept their faith.</p>
              <p>If they can provoke other people's thoughts in religious faith
              or lack of faith, then they should be opened to similar provoking
              speeches.</p>
              <p>Lastly, if God isn't cruel, then there is no reason to wipe out
              life leaving only 2 per species when the offender is Man.</p>

              <p>I am prefectly fine with those not accepting the faith. I never said u have to accept the faith did i ?</p>
              <p>Of course. Arent i willing to be provoked as equally ? If you are under the impression that i am going all out against all those that dont believe , they why do they come in here lamblasting everyone here ? This forum is actually for Christians in regards to sharing and understanding of the different denominations or seeking answers to questions.  So , if yous all dont bellieve , what are u guys doing here ?</p>
              <p>If u ask thought provoking questions, i give thought provoking answers. Is it not how it is ? All i am saying is having an open mind. Am i wrong in that  by having an open mind. I accept what u guys say, i accept your reasonings. I am not the kind that jsut stands at the side walk while watching some helping person being slapped around like a dog.</p>
              <p>Last question.. maby they are only person God sees fit to be chosen to live and i never said God was not cruel.</p>

              <p>So u do think there is a flaw in the bible. Then why still
              believe in a divine book which contains error ? Maybe John is
              prejudiced and like to go to heaven without doing good deeds. Just
              because of his biaseness, the whole bible direction could go
              completely different. All the things about grace etc r all rubbish
              then. If u read the bible carefully, u notice tat it emphasis so
              heavily on very short segments while ignoring other sections
              completely. R u really following jesus ? Or r u following paul
              trying to interprete john ?</p>
              <p>God don't have to show us. Sure... then don't demand us to
              blindly believe him. We don't believe not because we r disobedient.
              We don't believe because it doesn't make sense. If he show us
              evidence with no doubts, I will be the first to kneel and kiss his
              toes. I am not purposely disobedient or rebellous. I just sincerely
              do not believe he exist. And for a good reason too. Then he send me
              to hell for tat ?</p>
              <p>And lastly u talk about love. Wat love ? I love my son, I will
              never send him ever to hell for watever reason. Especially not
              because of vague silly reason like not believing a fantasy book.
              Now I got to ask... u say he love u because the bible says so or
              because u interprete his actions ?</p>

              <p>Why not ? It is a constant quest to find the truth. I am here to find the truth. Is it too hard for you to understand ? I would not say it is flawed, it may just be ommitted by some books that is lost. BUT the message is there. What is wrong with the message ? I do not totally follow blind faith.</p>
              <p>I am merely following the message that is set out and believe that the message can bring goodness to me and  to those around me like loving your neighbour.Is it not that hard for you to understand  too ?</p>
              <p>Love ?The ultimate sacrifice of Jesus's love, is it not right ? Is that love not the epitome of what sacfice can be?  Is it not with adoration of Christ as
              God, obedience to Christ as Lord, dependence on Christ as Savior,
              humble confession of sin and a serious effort to l<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ive Christ's
              life of self-sacrifice, detachment from the world, righteousness,

              <p>Because i am making statements using logic, reasoning, science on top of the bible, and not just quoting the bible. Am i not understanding enough to know that there are those that never read the bible, hence it is totally understandable from thier point in thier arguments, and  therefore i bring for logical explainations with form and substance , and relevance to them?</p>
              <p>U see, the difference now is that i read 2 different books while most only read 1 book. So how can i fully bring my point across to someone who has only read 1 book when i have read 2. Do u get it ? I am not here to force upon anyone anything. I am just making a point. Trying i must say, since they have never been on this side of the country. Again you assume .</p>
