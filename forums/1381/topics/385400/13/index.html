              <p>for a start, I never believed in the concept of a creator, so whats bad for me. If you think and analyse deeply, you will find even the concept of god was invented by man in the ancient past, cos they could not find answers to the natural phenomenon like sun, moon, wind, earthquakes, tsunamis etc. so they invented god for sun, moon, wind, thunder etc. in chinese folklore, there is a god of earth even.</p>

              <p>Sorry but just because it is compliant with physical laws of the
                      universe does not mean it is totally correct. And with the physical
                      laws of the universe, I presume you are saying the actual age of
                      the universe.And for your info, evolution does not come with
                      evidence but also imagination like how you stated creationism is.
                      Those evolutionists only find a small bone in the sand resembling
                      that of a human's and claim it is human's ancestor bones, while in
                      the musuem, they make up the whole body of the animal with their
                      imagination.</p>
              <p>And please read this before you even start calling others
                      stupid, which is quite ironic since you yourself is stupid.</p>
              <p>In the early 1800s, some observers in Western Europe
                      noticed that certain fossils are usually preserved in sedimentary
                      rock layers that, when traced laterally, typically lie above
                      somewhat similar fossils. Decades later, after the theory of
                      evolution was proposed, many concluded that the lower organism must
                      have evolved before the upper organism. These early geologists did
                      not realize that a hydrodynamic mechanism, <span>liquefaction</span>, helped sort organisms in that order during
                      the flood.  [For an explanation, see pages <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/Liquefaction2.html#wp1100074">172</a>–<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/Liquefaction9.html#wp1092180">183</a>.]</p>
              <p><a id="wp1261902" rel="nofollow" name="wp1261902"></a></p>
              <p>Geologic ages were then associated with each of these
                      “index fossils.” Those ages were extended to other animals and
                      plants buried in the same layer as the index fossil. For example, a
                      coelacanth fossil, an index fossil, dates its layer at 70,000,000
                      to 400,000,000 years old. [See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/AstroPhysicalSciences26.html#wp1438323">Figure 29</a>.] Today, geologic formations are
                      almost always dated by their fossil content<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1066491"><sup>a</sup></a>—which, as stated above,
                      assumes evolution. Yet, evolution is supposedly shown by the
                      sequence of fossils. Because this reasoning is <span>circular,</span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1066486"><sup>b</sup></a> many discoveries, such as

                      have been extinct for 70,000,000 years, the coelacanth
                      (SEE-la-kanth) was first caught in 1938, deep in the Indian Ocean,
                      northwest of Madagascar. Rewards were then offered for coelacanths,
                      so hundreds were caught and sold. In 1998, they were also found off
                      the coast of Indonesia.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1065434"><sup>c</sup></a> How could two groups of
                      coelacanths, separated by 6,000 miles, survive for 70,000,000 years
                      but leave no fossils?</p>
              <a id="wp1438333" rel="nofollow" name="wp1438333"></a>
              <p>Before coelacanths were caught, evolutionists
                      incorrectly believed that the coelacanth had lungs, a large brain,
                      and four bottom fins <span>about to evolve into
                      legs</span>.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1177953"><sup>d</sup></a> Evolutionists reasoned
                      that the coelacanth, or a similar fish, crawled out of a shallow
                      sea and filled its lungs with air, becoming the first four-legged
                      land animal. Millions of students have been incorrectly taught that
                      this fish was the ancestor of all amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs,
                      birds, and mammals, including people. (Was your ancestor a
                      fish?)</p>
              <a id="wp2840894" rel="nofollow" name="wp2840894"></a>
              <p>J. L. B. Smith, a well-known fish expert from
                      South Africa, studied the first two captured coelacanths, nicknamed
                      the coelacanth “Old Fourlegs” and wrote a book by that title in
                      1956. When dissected, did they have lungs and a large brain? Not at
                      all.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp2272865"><sup>e</sup></a> Furthermore, in 1987, a
                      German team filmed six coelacanths in their natural habitat. They
                      were <span>not</span> crawling on all fours.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1397871"><sup>f</sup></a></p>
              <a id="wp1438348" rel="nofollow" name="wp1438348"></a>
              <p>Before living coelacanths were found in 1938,
                      evolutionists dated any rock containing a coelacanth fossil as at
                      least 70,000,000 years old. It was an index fossil. Today,
                      evolutionists frequently express amazement that coelacanth fossils
                      look so much like captured coelacanths—despite more than 70,000,000
                      years of evolution.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1024358"><sup>g</sup></a> If that age is correct,
                      billions of coelacanths would have lived and died. Some should have
                      been fossilized in younger rock and should be displayed in museums.
                      Their absence implies that coelacanths have not lived for
                      70,000,000 years.</p>
              <p>And I guess AndrewPKYap is too stupid to even google
                      arguments against the theory of evolution. As I said, go lick a
                      monkey's arse if you like them so much as to think they are your
                      ancestors.</p>

              <p>I think you have a mistaken idea about evolution.</p>
              <p>For one,
                      evolution by itself is no longer a theory it is a scientific fact.It
                      has been an observable phenomenon based on experiments conducted on
                      fruit flies and bacteria (since they're pretty much the only ones with
                      a short enough lifespan for us to actually observe)</p>
              <p>You may say
                      that bacteria and fruitflies can hardly be used to explain the
                      complexity of the human body. But cancer is also an example of a cell
                      mutating beyond its original intent, that is why as one grows older the
                      chances of getting cancer increases because as a cell divides the
                      percentage chance of a cancer cell forming increases. </p>
              <p>In case you're wondering, there are also several types of cancer on one organ. There are for example, several types of blood cancer based on different behaviours.</p>
              <ul>
              <li> <a href="http://cancer.about.com/od/leukemia/a/leukemia_hub.htm">Leukemia</a><br></li>
              <li> <a href="http://cancer.about.com/od/lymphoma/a/lymphoma_over.htm">Lymphoma</a><br></li>
              <li> Multiple Myeloma<br></li>
              <li> Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The human
                      body also, is not as complex as most would like to think. The wheat for
                      example has 50,000 genes compared to the human's 26,000 (quotes from pg
                      239, <em>The End of Food</em>) because unlike animals, the wheat cannot <em>think</em> about how to adapt to its environment, it must evolve to have a
                      hardwired response for every possible eventuality", a specific
                      programmed response to cope with the thousand of conditions that
                      determines a plant's sucess.</p>
              <p>Now, there are different
                      theories on the exact progression on the steps on how an organism
                      evolve (there is a view that our ancestors may be a little like whales
                      and hippos than chimps because of our relative hairlessness and another
                      that the older the genome, the less hair we have accounting for the
                      body hair difference between the Caucasian, Mongolian and African )</p>
              <p>But
                      there are no major disagreements on that evolution works in all living
                      organisms. Creationism on the other hands only point out the holes in
                      evolution and do not present any contrary evidence to support their
                      view. There may be imagination involved with re-constructing our
                      ancestors but on the whole it is based off observations of current
                      existing apes.</p>
              <p>Most important of all, these re constructions
                      have to be peer reviewed by experts in related fields in order to be
                      established as fact.</p>
              <p>Your coelacancths example for one
                      simply means that they made a conclusion based on one piece of evidence
                      but they are more than willing to adjust or completely overturn the
                      idea if a new piece of evidence shows itself later. That is why no one
                      now insist that coelacanths are extinct(that i know of!), though they
                      may be with climate change. </p>
              <p>The idea of Evolution also presents in religion i would say that is why
                      Judeo based religions such as Islam/Christian/Jewish are different from
                      Hindu and pagan based religions like those in China and the Native
                      Americans.</p>
              <p>If there can only be one Creator, then all the different cultures would have shared the similarities of worshipping only one god with almost similar teachings and customs but that is not the case.</p>
              <p>If
                      i draw an analogy, Evolution is like a book which contents are
                      constantly being updated and adjusted as new evidence shows itself. It
                      seems to me healthier than following a book written slightly more than
                      a thousand years old with completely no room for updating and adjusting
                      as new facts present itself. </p>
              <p>I do not see why there must be
                      shame and indignity on being associated with apes, our direct ancestors
                      were pretty ignorant too considering the exaggerations they put in
                      their holy books, why do we seemed so proud to be attached to something
                      written so long ago?</p>

              space - direct human observation, experimentation and experience
              with nature and sensually-perceivable or describable phenomena. But
              religious teachings can have concepts which transcend beyond what
              is humanly possible to experience, at least on a mass scale (at
              least more than say 80% of the world population) with one's limited
              lifespan.</p>
              <p>For example, how many people can see infra-red light with their
              eyes, without the use of any special visual aid or equipment?</p>
              <p>A female gynaecologist may be the expert on female birth methods
              and so on, but if she has not been pregnant or given birth before,
              what she knows, feels or has observed through many deliveries is
              still indirect experience at the core.</p>

              <p>Personally i'm a Deist, i'm not against the idea of the possibility of a God existing because the world would be pretty bland and boring without such romantic ideas to bring life into it. Without religion, there would also be none of the art and literature that fansinates our imagination. </p>
              <p>Responding to your gynaecologist example of course personal experience is very handy to have, that is why midwives are still quite popular these days with pregnant women.</p>
              <p>But experience can be a double edged sword when complications occurs outside of one's experience (massive internal bleeding, baby in the wrong position...etc). At that point, the midwife knows as much as the novice.</p>
              <p>That's why gynaecologist fills up that gap with knowledge of the human anatomy and is recommanded for high risk pregancies (diabetes, heart diseases...etc).</p>
              <p>Even a midwife must start somewhere, while a gynaecologist is trained very extensively in order to qualify as one.</p>
              <p>Of course there is a gap where experience would made a midwife perform better than a gynaecologist but if you're faced with the choice of chosing an inexperienced midwife or an inexperienced gyanecologist which one would you prefer especially if your wife/self have known medical problems?</p>

              <p>I think you have a mistaken idea about evolution.</p>
              <p>For one, evolution by itself is no longer a theory it is a
              scientific fact.It has been an observable phenomenon based on
              experiments conducted on fruit flies and bacteria (since they're
              pretty much the only ones with a short enough lifespan for us to
              actually observe)</p>
              <p>You may say that bacteria and fruitflies can hardly be used to
              explain the complexity of the human body. But cancer is also an
              example of a cell mutating beyond its original intent, that is why
              as one grows older the chances of getting cancer increases because
              as a cell divides the percentage chance of a cancer cell forming
              increases. </p>
              <p>In case you're wondering, there are also several types of cancer
              on one organ. There are for example, several types of blood cancer
              based on different behaviours.</p>

              <li>Multiple Myeloma<br></li>
              <li>Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The human body also, is not as complex as most would like to
              think. The wheat for example has 50,000 genes compared to the
              human's 26,000 (quotes from pg 239, <em>The End of Food</em>)
              because unlike animals, the wheat cannot <em>think</em> about how
              to adapt to its environment, it must evolve to have a hardwired
              response for every possible eventuality", a specific programmed
              response to cope with the thousand of conditions that determines a
              plant's sucess.</p>
              <p>Now, there are different theories on the exact progression on
              the steps on how an organism evolve (there is a view that our
              ancestors may be a little like whales and hippos than chimps
              because of our relative hairlessness and another that the older the
              genome, the less hair we have accounting for the body hair
              difference between the Caucasian, Mongolian and African )</p>
              <p>But there are no major disagreements on that evolution works in
              all living organisms. Creationism on the other hands only point out
              the holes in evolution and do not present any contrary evidence to
              support their view. There may be imagination involved with
              re-constructing our ancestors but on the whole it is based off
              observations of current existing apes.</p>
              <p>Most important of all, these re constructions have to be peer
              reviewed by experts in related fields in order to be established as
              fact.</p>
              <p>Your coelacancths example for one simply means that they made a
              conclusion based on one piece of evidence but they are more than
              willing to adjust or completely overturn the idea if a new piece of
              evidence shows itself later. That is why no one now insist that
              coelacanths are extinct(that i know of!), though they may be with
              climate change. </p>
              <p>The idea of Evolution also presents in religion i would say that
              is why Judeo based religions such as Islam/Christian/Jewish are
              different from Hindu and pagan based religions like those in China
              and the Native Americans.</p>
              <p>If i draw an analogy, Evolution is like a book which contents
              are constantly being updated and adjusted as new evidence shows
              itself. It seems to me healthier than following a book written
              slightly more than a thousand years old with completely no room for
              updating and adjusting as new facts present itself. </p>
              <p>I do not see why there must be shame and indignity on being
              associated with apes, our direct ancestors were pretty ignorant too
              considering the exaggerations they put in their holy books, why do
              we seemed so proud to be attached to something written so long
              ago?</p>

              <p>That's pretty much what you're trying to ask from me.You want me to produce evidence of Point A going to Point Z, while rejecting everything else inbetween.</p>
              <p>The process at which a monkey(well our ancestors, monkeys were a different branch off) turns into what we understand to be Homo Erectus (modern man) is a continous cycle of change, spanning across hundred and thousands of generations.</p>
              <p>And there has already been a lot of evidence and fossils of our early ancestors. And how about you giving me physical proof of the Garden of Eden?</p>
              <p>Evolution is evolution, there isn't any biological difference between a micro and macro evolution. Define for me the exact barrier of which a micro evolution becomes a macro evolution.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing of evolving into a "stronger" form. We can say it's stronger only in  hindsight when it wins out in the survival of the fittest. An award winning body builder and a 180 IQ scientists are both better than the average human but ten thousand years ago the body builder would obviously be the "stronger form" but in today's society a high IQ would get you furthur than a buff body. </p>

              <p>And the way social trends seems to be going, it's entirely possible that it may very well be the idiots who reject contraceptives for religious reasons, bringing up kids who constantly bully people more intelligent than they are that would end up inheriting the Earth.</p>

              <p>Not all monkeys and apes etc turn into humans, did you ever study? They don't turn into humans but evolution slowly causes different species to evolve and as long as that species has characteristics that allows it to survive, it will survive and slowly evolve into a completely different species with some similiarities but not totally similarities with other species that have took a different evolution path.</p>
              <p>Just like there are many species of parrots, many of them looks very similar but they have different colours because the difference in colours have not affected their chance of survivial and thus they slowly evolve into a totally new species with a totally different plummage. Any species that might have evolved otherwise and could not survived would have been extinct and thus not be seen in present day.</p>

              <p>This is my answer from my opinion :D</p>
              <p>Well, IF he did exist, humans are probably new to him[old
              testament], and there was a Satan wrecking havoc with humans. Of
              course as a father, he would be pissed off to see his children
              being stupid and serving Satan, and would of course unleash his
              anger on humans. And he also has to bear with Satan so that humans
              can make a choice to follow God or Satan in their lives, thus, he
              cannot harm Satan until after judgement day.</p>
              <p>While in the new testament, God came down himself as a human to
              understand how is it like to be his own creation, and he probably
              understood how Satan uses his weapons against humans, thus, the
              love and compassion from him came about, and also the mercy.</p>

              <p>Wait, if God cannot harm Satan that means he isn't all powerful isn't it? If you're saying he cannot harm Satan till Judgement Day, then God must be subversient to a higher Order of Balance if he cannot do what he wants isn't it ?</p>

              <p>If God requires to come down to the mortal world to personally inspect his creations to understand what Satan is doing he can't be all knowing either can he? </p>

              <p>Sorry but just because it is compliant with physical laws of the

              the universe.And for your info, evolution does not come with
              evidence but also imagination like how you stated creationism is.
              Those evolutionists only find a small bone in the sand resembling
              that of a human's and claim it is human's ancestor bones, while in
              the musuem, they make up the whole body of the animal with their
              imagination.</p>
              <p>And please read this before you even start calling others
              stupid, which is quite ironic since you yourself is stupid.</p>
              <p>In the early 1800s, some observers in Western Europe
              noticed that certain fossils are usually preserved in sedimentary
              rock layers that, when traced laterally, typically lie above
              somewhat similar fossils. Decades later, after the theory of
              evolution was proposed, many concluded that the lower organism must
              have evolved before the upper organism. These early geologists did
              not realize that a hydrodynamic mechanism, <span>liquefaction</span>, helped sort organisms in that order during
              the flood.  [For an explanation, see pages <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/Liquefaction2.html#wp1100074">172</a>–<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/Liquefaction9.html#wp1092180">183</a>.]</p>

              <p>Geologic ages were then associated with each of these
              “index fossils.” Those ages were extended to other animals and
              plants buried in the same layer as the index fossil. For example, a
              coelacanth fossil, an index fossil, dates its layer at 70,000,000
              to 400,000,000 years old. [See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/AstroPhysicalSciences26.html#wp1438323">Figure 29</a>.] Today, geologic formations are

              (SEE-la-kanth) was first caught in 1938, deep in the Indian Ocean,
              northwest of Madagascar. Rewards were then offered for coelacanths,
              so hundreds were caught and sold. In 1998, they were also found off
              the coast of Indonesia.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1065434"><sup>c</sup></a> How could two groups of

              <p>Before coelacanths were caught, evolutionists

              legs</span>.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1177953"><sup>d</sup></a> Evolutionists reasoned
              that the coelacanth, or a similar fish, crawled out of a shallow
              sea and filled its lungs with air, becoming the first four-legged
              land animal. Millions of students have been incorrectly taught that
              this fish was the ancestor of all amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs,
              birds, and mammals, including people. (Was your ancestor a
              fish?)</p>
              <a id="wp2840894" rel="nofollow" name="wp2840894"></a>
              <p>J. L. B. Smith, a well-known fish expert from
              South Africa, studied the first two captured coelacanths, nicknamed
              the coelacanth “Old Fourlegs” and wrote a book by that title in
              1956. When dissected, did they have lungs and a large brain? Not at
              all.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp2272865"><sup>e</sup></a> Furthermore, in 1987, a
              German team filmed six coelacanths in their natural habitat. They
              were <span>not</span> crawling on all fours.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1397871"><sup>f</sup></a></p>
              <a id="wp1438348" rel="nofollow" name="wp1438348"></a>
              <p>Before living coelacanths were found in 1938,
              evolutionists dated any rock containing a coelacanth fossil as at
              least 70,000,000 years old. It was an index fossil. Today,
              evolutionists frequently express amazement that coelacanth fossils
              look so much like captured coelacanths—despite more than 70,000,000
              years of evolution.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ReferencesandNotes63.html#wp1024358"><sup>g</sup></a> If that age is correct,
              billions of coelacanths would have lived and died. Some should have
              been fossilized in younger rock and should be displayed in museums.
              Their absence implies that coelacanths have not lived for
              70,000,000 years.</p>
              <p>And I guess AndrewPKYap is too stupid to even google
              arguments against the theory of evolution. As I said, go lick a
              monkey's arse if you like them so much as to think they are your
              ancestors.</p>

              <p>I agree totally. Religious teachings and science can complement
                      each other, but to explain perfectly; as in merely using each
                      other's terminologies and concepts, would only lead to more doubts,
                      confusion and prolonged frustration for some. Religious teachings
                      cannot totally replace the role of science and vice versa.</p>
              <p>Science is continuous human learning in inconceivable time and
                      space - direct human observation, experimentation and experience
                      with nature and sensually-perceivable or describable phenomena. But
                      religious teachings can have concepts which transcend beyond what
                      is humanly possible to experience, at least on a mass scale (at
                      least more than say 80% of the world population) with one's limited
                      lifespan.</p>
              <p>For example, how many people can see infra-red light with their
                      eyes, without the use of any special visual aid or equipment?</p>
              <p>A female gynaecologist may be the expert on female birth methods
                      and so on, but if she has not been pregnant or given birth before,
                      what she knows, feels or has observed through many deliveries is
                      still indirect experience at the core.</p>

              <p>I asked you a valid question, mr. hybrid religion. You are labeling me a troll?</p>
              <p>If your analogy of PRC Chinese and Singaporean Chinese  is what you mean by evolution, the evolutionists will be embarrassed by your logic.</p>
              <p>Mr. hybrid religion, first you said this:" <strong>Personally i'm a Deist, i'm not against the idea of the
                                      possibility of a God existing because the world would be pretty
                                      bland and boring without such romantic ideas to bring life into it.
                                      Without religion, there would also be none of the art and
                                      literature that fansinates our imagination." </strong></p>
              <p>Now what is the definition of deist in your dictionary?</p>
              <p>....and  you are in support of evolution theory. An evolutionist cannot be a deist. A deist cannot support evolution theory. There is no in-between.</p>
              <p>May be, I can now coin a word for your standing in-between the two. How about evoludeist? How do you like that, besides being a hybrid religion man?</p>

              <p>Responding to your gynaecologist example of course personal
              experience is very handy to have, that is why midwives are still
              quite popular these days with pregnant women.</p>
              <p>But experience can be a double edged sword when complications
              occurs outside of one's experience (massive internal bleeding, baby
              in the wrong position...etc). At that point, the midwife knows as
              much as the novice.</p>
              <p>That's why gynaecologist fills up that gap with knowledge of the
              human anatomy and is recommanded for high risk pregancies
              (diabetes, heart diseases...etc).</p>
              <p>Even a midwife must start somewhere, while a gynaecologist is
              trained very extensively in order to qualify as one.</p>
              <p>Of course there is a gap where experience would made a midwife
              perform better than a gynaecologist but if you're faced with the
              choice of chosing an inexperienced midwife or an inexperienced
              gyanecologist which one would you prefer especially if your
              wife/self have known medical problems?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Maybe the inexperienced gynae in the above assumed scenario. But if my wife or myself don't have any known medical problems, or don't know we have known medical problems due to whatever reasons, then it's like more like a gamble in terms of who is readily available to help, the inexperienced midwife or the gynae.</p>

              <p>But you already mentioned there are no known proofs and evidences for certain unknowns and unexplained. Which means it's possibly out of your intelligence level to establish those proofs and evidences. If it's within your ability to discover the proofs for any unknowns and unexplained, you wouldn't need to post questions like these already.</p>
              <p>I have replied in another post or comment by you that I simply put aside what cannot be proven or explained satisfactorily to me or mankind in general.</p>
              <p>No need to come up with a religion, That's too troublesome. =)  Even religions with proofs on unknowns and unexplained cannot be totally relied on without deep and critical self-reflection on a life-long basis.</p>
