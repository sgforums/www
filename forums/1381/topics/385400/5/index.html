              <p><strong>"Gravity is not about faith" because gravity comes with proof, observations, logical explanations and experiments.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Gravity is not about faith" because faith is about conjecture, delusions, beliefs and baseless hope.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Science can lead physicists to abandon atheism? How? Which physicists?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>That is the problem with religious people. They ask stupid questions without stating what science and which physicists. Just because some physicists say they abandon atheism, they jump on it without finding out what science and whether the physicists is misinterpreting data; what possible motives the physicists have in doing it and whether his explanations for doing it make sense.... </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Without even trying to find out the truth first and simply asking that kind of question is just plain stupid.</strong></p>

              <p>WTF! Without yr mum, will she be here attending church? Is jesus bigger than her mum? Her answer is something like she only pray for 1 GOD. Really feel like give her a big slap on her face!</p>

              <p>My last reply to you on this issue. I mean I am not interested in spending  my time going to church and read bible to find answers, too time consuming. I have some of the answers but not all. Even then, I am not satisfied with the answers. I just want to hear whether there are any other sayings.</p>

              <p>A friend of mine turn into christian. One day, her mum died. Her mum is not christian. There are jossstick to pray her mum. But her daughter told her siblings and uncles that she cannot take jossstick to pray her mum.</p>
              <p>WTF! Without yr mum, will she be here attending church? Is jesus bigger than her mum? Her answer is something like she only pray for 1 GOD. Really feel like give her a big slap on her face!</p>
              <p>This is totally unacceptable. Her mum raised her up from baby till a lady. Now, convert to christian, treat her mum like that? Go to hell!</p>
              <p> Maybe some pastor would like to tell my what is the reason behind this stupid idea from christian.</p>
