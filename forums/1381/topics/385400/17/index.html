              <p>About jesus ultimate love by sacrificing himself... I don't really think he did any sacrifice at all.... I mean he go to heaven, he know he will go to heaven, he did not die, it is actually his father, which is actually him, plan his own death to satisfy himself.

              <p>If it is so SIMPLE.. everyone wouldve attained that degree and Jesus like already. Even if i pray, how do i know it is the answer ? Have i been more in tune to know it ? You guys may be my answer as i have NEVER participated in this kind of discussion even in church. I find it... somewhat, more informed.</p>
              <p>I always wondered what real love is. Is BGR love ? what love is that ? Affection , lust ? How do i know its love ? Am i too blinded by material things and money ?Most of the time i seem to be answering my own questions. And i have to thank you all to be honest.</p>
              <p>I never particiapted in EH. Only this few weeks when i notice the strings of attacks n statements. So i had to challenge myself. My own understanding to date. I learn alot of things myself.</p>

Lets focus only on the 4 books that describe jesus. Jesus stated tat everyone must follow the old laws. He stated tat the rich must give up all his wealth before he could join christainity. And there is one line tat says believe in jesus is all tat is needed. And surprisingly, they just choose tat line for the direction of christianity. It depend on one or two line only.

              <p>I agree tat being pierced by nails or poke by spears is painful. And now there r already tons of people who crucified themselves during good friday or christmas. U claim jesus die for us. But the definition of die, is never to exist anymore. Tat is the important part. If he die for just 3 days and wake up, I call tat more of a long sleep. If u talk about love, I find Lim Bo Seng who die in torture without revealing names more noble. He really die, and I believe torture is more painful than crucifix. Furthermore the reason why he die is simply... non logical... It is not like fighting a difficult war to appease another being, or there r no other circumstances, or tis is the only way... he die simply to satisfy his funny ego (god). He could just simply forgive. But he chose to kill himself to forgive. It is like I am angry with a friend and I forgive him by cutting myself with a knife. I might as well just forgive without cutting and cut down on the drama</p>

              <p>Like i said, i agree and understand your skepticism. Thats why, in the end of the day, we learn its message. Sometimes , Christians are quick to condemn others, but they took it too literally. Its the failure in thier part of the understanding, and thier pastor or cell group leaders has failed to properly send the message out to direct and correct them.</p>
              <p>He died because he was pronounced, dead. In Roman law, the roman soldiers overseeing the cruxification , if not dead, they had to break the persons legs, to ensure they are dead. Equally for the soldiers who oversee the cruxification has to ensure Jesus is dead. Hence he has to be totally dead for them not to break his legs</p>
              <p>U have to understand that , Lim Bo Seng totally died. How are so sure Cruxification is less torturous. We are talking about nailed, the weight of your body is being held by big nails... under the sun. Slow.. dying from dusk till dawn. Torture for Lim Bo Seng can be equally as painful. But as noble as it sounds. he did not live the life of Jesus. Its not about appeasing other beings n gods. Its about dying to show the world that this is the kind of love, someone willing to die for you, to bridge between God n Man. Instead of going through priests everytime u want to seek forgiveness like the old testament.</p>
              <p>You cannot equate his sacrifice by saying u cut urself  by being angry. The message u get is totally wrong. Its about forgiveness.  Turn the other cheek when u ar slapped.</p>

              <p>So in the end, u choose to believe the message, whether it is paul's message, constantine's message or john's message. U just believe the message should be true. Ok lor</p>
              <p>I agree with your interpretation of death, which is medical death. But the scary thing about death, is not to live anymore. It is imagining u cannot drink, cannot laugh, cannot be with you loved one and all tat is left is gradually being forgotten. But tat does not happen for christ. He just reach a serious sleep state and wake up three days later, being with his loved one and could enjoy himself ater tat. His death is not scary at all. It is more like a deep sleep. People do tat when they go through severe surgery and sleep for 3 days straight. Think of the final bottomline. Wat is the physical differences to the individual between sleeping for 3 days and dead for just three days.</p>
              <p>And the intention of the death is really just glorified... u say to bridge the distance between man and god etc etc but this distance is self imposed by god in the first placed.  He could simply close tis gap without anyone dying. But he chose to kill himself for it. It is funny u see.</p>
              <p>The analogy about cutting oneself is to show the whole reason for christ death is senseless... he do it to satisfy himself. It is not about appeasing someone beyond his control but for himself. Forgiveness do not require physical death of yourself. Forgiveness is just a mental state. U could achieve tat without doing anything physical</p>

              <p>I believe in the message. The message of forgiveness, love, compassion,  and all that good stuff. Why is it so hard to understand the message ? Fearing the divine being, and try to live a life of Jesus's life, to benefit not myself but the whole world.</p>
              <p>That ressurection gives u the hope, it tells you that, after you are dead, you are no longer trapped in this physical body and you said about joining your loved ones, thats where u get to meet them. Is that not what u would want ? Thats hs whole idea. If you all believe, after leaving this place, you will see your loved ones again. Get it ?</p>
              <p>U have to understand that God dont just CLOSE the gap. If he did so, where is Jesus's message of love and compassion ? Do u even know the inner workins of God ? The whole idea of his death is to bring about the changes from the Old to New testament. A living God. His message now.. in our world that needs it more, is love and compassion. If all christians live the life of Jesus's love, what more can i say ? National Aid organisations driven by the same Protestent faith of Love to those that need is the driving force. Can u see the connections now. Is it not good ?</p>
              <p>Your analogy is not correct. I can give a similiar analogy, of you doing harm to me, but i push you out of the way of an incoming car n get myself killed. Its the message of forgiveness and love.... sigh...</p>
              <p>Self-loving and sacrifice it is THAT ACT of self sacrifice and love. Its not about the concept of the mental state, its his ability after all he has gone through and the way he went out.</p>

              <p>Thats why u have a thing called FAITH. You dont run around with an AK - 47 because u do not believe in hell or heaven.</p>
              <p>If you do not believe, it is fine. Just a simple question. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Have u read the entire bible ? </span></p>
              <p>There are fundamentalists and liberalists. Like i stated in previous posts... because they are also close and narrow minded in their interpretations and totally take everything literally and totally reject science. Do i look like a hardline extremist ? The only thing that annoys me and i come in is when you guys condemn Christians and Christianity AS A WHOLE. And thats like going to a coffee shop and i say.. SINGAPOREANS are STUPID. How do u feel? Maybe some or most are stupid.. but definately not ALL are stupid right ?</p>
              <p>He is God, he KNOWS, and he knows what he needs to do. Have u even read the bible regarding his final days? He wants to remain on this earth as much as he loved the people around him. But he knows what he has to do. He knows the inevitable death. Knowing ur own death, and how brutally painful it will end.But unlike us , throwing ourselves at a parked car is NOT going to forgive anyone. So what purpose is that ?</p>
              <p>Why would i throw myself at a parked car to forgive u? Do u even know ur analogy to this ? We have love and compassion doesnt we are stupid and dumb.</p>

              <p>There is a thing call faith, and it is the thing tat led people into being cheated. I do not run around with an Ak 47 because I believe wat is like living in a society and how people living together should act. In fact I see religious extremist  being the one running around with AK 47</p>
              <p>And for your question, yes I have read the entire bible. Did I give an idea tat I have poor understanding of the bible ?</p>
              <p>Well I do not agree tat people should stereotype and I agree tat christians do not have to be stupid.</p>
              <p>In christianity, god and jesus and the holy spirit r the same thing. He says he love earth, know his death and how it will end (it ends with him being in heaven) but who is the one forcing him to die ? God. And god is him. He could just forgive but he chose to kill himself before he forgive. If u think tat throwing yourself at a parked car so we can forgive other is stupid... but tat is wat exactly happened for christ...</p>

              <p>The person that get cheated is his own choice. Your daily life includes all matters of faith. Your faith in the pilot not crashing the plane, your faith in your own ability to comprehend the concept of science. But Faith can be blind faith. and can be informed faith. If you choose to totally follow blindly, definately u risk the totally cheated. Like wise, as informed as you are, you risk not following what you have faith in. Its a double edged sword.</p>
              <p>Why does one say he is lack of faith, is mere because he lacks faith, or understanding.</p>
              <p>Yes u did give an idea that u have poor understanding of the Bible because of ur statements regarding Jesus and Genesis and not to mention the few verses you quote only. Since u have read it, then i would expect u to be able to understand the concept of love . But you dont seem to understand Jesus's love, and your analogies of 'forgiveness' and self-sacrifice is just so off.  Hence seriously have my doubts. But i just have to take it on face value that u did read the entire Bible.  Because for your truth u have to prove it, and in my mind you did not. But i will take into faith and an open mind that u did even though many things does not add up. But nevertheless i believe you.</p>

              <p>The bible says they are same yet different. And u read the entire Bible ?</p>
              <p>The Bible said, Father Son and Holy Spirit. U have to understand the concept of Father n Son. When he was born on this earth, he was AS human as anyone. No knowledge, NADA. he like everyone has to have strong faith, to PRAY to God. He does not have BOTH the minds of God and Jesus, He is the Son of God and is Jesus.  You are bring The Father , The Son and Holy Spirit down to ur level and saying God is Jesus and they both share the same mind, but in fact, both are actually in thier own individual state of mind.  If He is God himself, why would he still need to pray ? He would just command and do so as he pleases, because he IS God. But He is NOT truly God himself.</p>
