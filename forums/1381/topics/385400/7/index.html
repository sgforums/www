In addition to his work as an astronomer, Hoyle was a writer of <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #002bb8; background-image: none; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial;" title="Science fiction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">science fiction</a>, including a number of books co-written with his son <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #002bb8; background-image: none; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial;" title="Geoffrey Hoyle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hoyle">Geoffrey Hoyle</a>.

He died in <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #002bb8; background-image: none; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial;" title="Bournemouth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, England, after a series of <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #002bb8; background-image: none; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial;" title="Stroke" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke">strokes</a>.<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">"</span></span></p>

Of course you would . . . A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference" style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #002bb8; background-image: none; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: initial; white-space: nowrap; background-position: initial initial;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

              <p><strong>You see, the main difference between Religious people and Scientists is that, Scientists publish their work and findings and then let the whole world look at it. They have nothing to hide.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Religious people hold on to their own convictions which are mostly delusions that cannot see daylight. Scientist can also be classed as delusional when they says things that no other scientists agree.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It is pointless for Religious people to claim many agree with them. Whatever they come up with has no good proofs and solid evidence. Delusions based on other delusions.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Furthermore, Religious people cannot even agree among themselves (like, christians vs buddhists; christians vs muslims; catholic christians vs protestant christians) showing that what they believe are just delusions in their own heads and each sect have different delusions and then claim that their delusions is the truth.</strong></p>

              <p>But that will not deter the religious or atheist to religious people in continuing thier scientific research to find new discoveries, to try to explain the unexplained. Maybe Hawkins himself is delusional. Even with sold evidence, these solid evidence will continue to be proved to be fallible as new discoveries continue.</p>
              <p>Just like in 10 years time, the new space telescope will search further and may discover new things for new theories to disprove a previous theory. Maybe your strong belief in the big bang has made you yourself so delusional and no different than those with ur delusional religious truth. Delusions or not, athiests and non-atheists alike will continue to break grounds in research and discovery. Dont forget to discount those facts.</p>
              <p>Like science and  ur 'delusions' , will continue to compete and go on the same path of discovery. So unless u are a scientists yourself, you can hardly discredit them, just because they have notions of religious belieft.</p>
              <p>You dont see a pronounced religious scientist giving up on his research and discovery because God says so. The continuation to ask the questions, to seek the answers will not stop there. I am as up to date to science as up to date to the reference of religous references. Till the day i die, i will continue to be updated and will look back knowing, that somethings, are just too uncomprehendable for us to even begin with, but at least we tried and will continue to try.</p>

I know you are not used to the concept that our existence and the universe could not just exists on its own. science could not explain everything, but its much better than relying on a 2000 years old dogma. there are so many hundreds of religions that espoused their god, and then what, all used their explanations to explain everything?</p></div>

              <p>But that will not deter the religious or atheist to religious
                  people in continuing thier scientific research to find new
                  discoveries, to try to explain the unexplained. Maybe Hawkins
                  himself is delusional. Even with sold evidence, these solid
                  evidence will continue to be proved to be fallible as new
                  discoveries continue.</p>
              <p>Just like in 10 years time, the new space telescope will search
                  further and may discover new things for new theories to disprove a
                  previous theory. Maybe your strong belief in the big bang has made
                  you yourself so delusional and no different than those with ur
                  delusional religious truth. Delusions or not, athiests and
                  non-atheists alike will continue to break grounds in research and
                  discovery. Dont forget to discount those facts.</p>
              <p>Like science and  ur 'delusions' , will continue to compete
                  and go on the same path of discovery. So unless u are a scientists
                  yourself, you can hardly discredit them, just because they have
                  notions of religious belieft.</p>
              <p>You dont see a pronounced religious scientist giving up on his
                  research and discovery because God says so. The continuation to ask
                  the questions, to seek the answers will not stop there. I am as up
                  to date to science as up to date to the reference of religous
                  references. Till the day i die, i will continue to be updated and
                  will look back knowing, that somethings, are just too
                  uncomprehendable for us to even begin with, but at least we tried

              <p><strong>So what is the difference between you or religious people "keeping up with religious knowledge" or "religion keeping up with the latest findings/knowledge" and scientists/philosophers/science keeping up with the latest findings/knowledge?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Let's take your perception/people's perception of the world as an example. You see red/blue/green/yellow around you. The color blind person sees only shades of grey.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What does that tell you? Colors are people's delusions in that there are no colors in this world! There are only spectrum of light! Your brain assign colors to these different spectrum of light!</strong></p>
              <p>The color blind person can still touch an elephant and say, elephant! He will never ever touch a color and say, blue! Blue does not exist, not like an elephant, and you need a brain to see blue (just having eyes will not do, just as color blind people have eyes).</p>
              <p> If you lose the sense of touch, you will still be able to see an elephant. You will still be able to hear and elephant if it calls out. Not the same with color. You lose the ability to interpret the different wavelengths of lights, you cannot see color because colors do not exist. What humans see as blue, an insect could very well see something else and very likely see something else! (Actually what we see, everything we see is but an interpretation... but that is another story hahaha)</p>
              <p><strong>You are right in saying that what scientists know about the universe today is still ongoing. You are wrong in saying religious people are seekers. Religious people (maybe not you) are people that claim to have found the truth/people that have found IT!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Jesus IS the ANSWER" they claim. You ever hear them say "Jesus is a small part, maybe the answer"? Of course not. That is not how religious people operate. You want people to give you 10% of their salaries in the name of Jesus, you have to tell them "Jesus IS the answer" or else no one will or very few will give you even a cent.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Scientists will tell you: "All the findings, all the research, all the observations, points us to this direction but once we come up with new evidence and proofs, we will let you know."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The evidence, proofs, observations are open to all to review, criticize and object to. Some religious people will kill you together with other innocent people if you dare criticize their religion. While not all will kill you if you criticize them, ALL, will not accept criticism and change their core beliefs. They will simply cling on to their core beliefs.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You see, if they accept the criticism and change, the religion disappears.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>All religions (otherwise they would not be called religions) are based on unproven beliefs.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Science tells you, "it points to this direction, given the state of the art but subject to change", the religions will tell you: "WE KNOW, WE FOUND IT! IT IS LIKE THIS!"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So the choice is yours and even for some scientists, are you willing to accept the versions the religions offer, when scientist tell you the evidence so far is this but subject to change?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Are you willing to accept the REALITY, the reality based on what we know so far even if it is uncomfortable, or do you want to live in a set of delusional lies, comforting to hold on to, but nevertheless, unproven, illogical and baseless?</strong></p>

              by him as a jocular, perhaps disparaging, name for the theory which
              was the main rival to his own. In addition to his work as an

Of course you would . . . A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference" style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #002bb8; background-image: none; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: initial; white-space: nowrap; background-position: initial initial;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

              <p><strong>So what is the difference between you or religious

              findings/knowledge?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Let's take your perception/people's perception of the
              world as an example. You see red/blue/green/yellow around you. The
              color blind person sees only shades of grey.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What does that tell you? Colors are people's delusions
              in that there are no colors in this world! There are only spectrum
              of light! Your brain assign colors to these different spectrum of
              light!</strong></p>
              <p>The color blind person can still touch an elephant and say,
              elephant! He will never ever touch a color and say, blue! Blue does
              not exist, not like an elephant, and you need a brain to see blue
              (just having eyes will not do, just as color blind people have
              eyes).</p>
              <p> If you lose the sense of touch, you will still be able to
              see an elephant. You will still be able to hear and elephant if it
              calls out. Not the same with color. You lose the ability
              to interpret the different wavelengths of
              lights, you cannot see color because colors do not exist. What
              humans see as blue, an insect could very well see something else
              and very likely see something else! (Actually what we see,
              everything we see is but an interpretation... but that is another
              story hahaha)</p>
              <p><strong>You are right in saying that what scientists know about
              the universe today is still ongoing. You are wrong in saying
              religious people are seekers. Religious people (maybe not you) are
              people that claim to have found the truth/people that have found
              IT!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Jesus IS the ANSWER" they claim. You ever hear them say
              "Jesus is a small part, maybe the answer"? Of course not. That is
              not how religious people operate. You want people to give you 10%
              of their salaries in the name of Jesus, you have to tell them
              "Jesus IS the answer" or else no one will or very few will give you
              even a cent.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Scientists will tell you: "All the findings, all the
              research, all the observations, points us to this direction but
              once we come up with new evidence and proofs, we will let you
              know."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The evidence, proofs, observations are open to all to
              review, criticize and object to. Some religious people will
              kill you together with other innocent people if you dare criticize
              their religion. While not all will kill you if
              you criticize them, ALL, will not accept criticism and
              change their core beliefs. They will simply cling on to their core
              beliefs.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You see, if they accept the criticism and change, the
              religion disappears.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>All religions (otherwise they would not be called

              <p>First of all, i must say that i understand your point of view. The notion of its logic in the material plane to be supported by concrete evidence, and not some 'delusion' to rely on ones faith, such as believers on the meaning of the creation of the universe.</p>
              <p>And regarding contradictions and affirmations(which agnostics, atheists,non-believers always rely on),<span style="font-family: Arial;"> upon an examination of the
              accounts in the Gospels, it will be seen that none of the writers
              denies, what one of the other Gospel writers affirms.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">If, however, one talks about a
              sun that is always light, yet dark, contradictory statements are made.
              By definition that which is <em>always</em> light cannot be dark. Nor
              can one talk about a square circle, since by definition a circle is
              round and not square. The property of squareness precludes the
              possibility of a square being a circle.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">In certain instances not all
              problems may be resolved by a careful reading of the contexts and a
              clarification of what is, and what is not, claimed by the narratives.
              Such ought not to be the source of undue embarrassment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The fact that
              no resolution of a problem is immediately possible is not proof that
              the right solution is not available.</span> Humility is required that one does
              not confine the divine inspiration of Scripture to the level of one's
              intellectual attainments. </span></p>
              <p>Let me just begin with the simple notion of supported evidence of biblical proportions. Crossings of the red sea by Moses.</p>
              <p>While the above locations of Mount Sinai and Yam Suf have been
              conventional wisdom for centuries, during just recent decades,
              mountain-climbing-adventurers and deep sea divers (devoted Christian
              Bible-believers) have made remarkable discoveries in the Gulf of Aqaba
              and in Saudi Arabia. By 21st century standards of artifacts, topography
              and logic, these facts-on-the-ground establish that the Bible and the
              Passover Haggadah are arguably <em>true factual histories of ancient events</em> - including the "miracles" described in the Old Testament.</p>
              <p>What
              has been found are coral-covered remnants of ancient Egyptian chariots:
              wheels, hubs, axles and shafts, the diameters and spoke designs
              matching Egyptian murals and museum collections of the 18th Dynasty
              (compatible era-wise with the biblical Exodus). Photos of such
              artifacts, although underwater (removal is not permitted by Egyptian
              and Saudi authorities), can be seen in numerous books, films, even on
              the Internet. The artifacts, including bones of men and horses, are
              strewn along a seven mile underwater ridge, from Egypt to the Saudi
              Arabian shore.</p>
              <p>A 21st century realist viewing these items in books, film or Internet,
              can ask, "Are these coral-covered remains of ancient chariots really
              there?" An affirmative answer comes from solid reasoning - the numerous
              well-known personages accompanying the diving expedition, the many
              authors of books and films, all attest to authenticity - such serious
              professionals would not risk their reputations and careers in any
              duplicitous scheme (such as if the artifacts depicted were
              non-existent). Thus by logic, those coral-covered relics of ancient
              Egyptian chariots are truly there - scattered on an undersea ridge
              between Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and Saudi Arabia, miles from Egyptian
              shore and <em>hundreds of feet below sea level</em>.</p>
              <p>Q:Why Did the Charioteers Enter the Ridge - Water Hundreds of Feet Above?</p>
              <p>For it is only logical to explain that, it has to have a passage of way, to enter and pursue. The key element here is the rationale behind the pursuit of the chariots.The only rationale has to be that it looked safe - <em>since the
              Israelites were fleeing without concern for the water, hundreds of feet
              above their heads, and "somehow" being held back</em>! - That is just a thought for you to ponder on.</p>
              <p>Now the next issue will be regarding Science and Religion.</p>
              <p>I am sure we have all seen or head the story about a young boy/girl, asking the mum/dad 'Where did i come from?' pleased to have the opportunity to discuss such an important matter with her son, 
              began by offering an elementary account of human biology, even introducing some 
              references to the theory of evolution. Lest she restrict her analysis to the realm 
              of the purely physical, she spoke of God's role in the creation of each human 
              soul, and ultimately of God as the source of all that is. After she had finished, 
              her young son, looking somewhat bemused, said to her that he had wondered about 
              this because his friend next door had told him that he had come from Iowa.</p>
              <p>The 
              question of where we come from can be answered in many ways. We need to keep this 
              fact in mind when we turn our attention to the account given by contemporary cosmology 
              of the origins of the universe. I seriously dont want to go into the details of the Big Bang 
              as a "singularity," that is, an ultimate boundary or edge, a "state of infinite 
              density" where space-time has ceased.Just as sub-atomic particles appear to emerge spontaneously in vacuums 
              in laboratories, as the result of what is called "quantum tunneling from nothing," 
              so the whole universe may be the result of a similar process, however rejected by Hawkings that he 
              universe, according to him, does not have a boundary: "It is completely self-contained 
              and not affected by anything outside itself." He thinks that the only way to have 
              a scientific theory is if "the laws of physics hold everywhere, including at the 
              beginning of the universe." That issue even though exetremely interesting to look at the competeting ideas, i shall stop here. To continue on..  i use one of the natural law jurisprudence by Thomas Aquinas in the explaintaion like how too often contemporary discussions 
              about the relationship between science and religion suffer from an ignorance of 
              history, and our question is an example. For we can save God and natural theology 
              from the dustbins simply by turning to the sophisticated analyses of the natural 
              sciences and creation that took place during the age of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism">High Scholasticism</a>. &lt;--- Click to save time for explainations.</p>
              <p>Recent speculations that the universe 
              began as "quantum tunneling from nothing" reaffirm the ancient Greek principle 
              that you cannot get something from nothing. For the "vacuum" of modern particle 
              physics, whose "fluctuation" some see as bringing our universe into existence, 
              is not absolutely nothing. It is not anything like our present universe, but it 
              still is something. Or else, how could it fluctuate? The key to Aquinas' analysis is the distinction 
              he draws between <em>creation</em> and <em>change</em>.</p>
              <p>Aquinas did not think that the opening of Genesis 
              presented any difficulties for the natural sciences, for the Bible is not a textbook 
              in the sciences. What is essential to Christian faith, according to Aquinas, is 
              the "fact of creation," not the manner or mode of the formation of the world.</p>
              <p>For Aquinas, the literal meaning of the Bible 
              is what God, its author, intends the words to mean. The literal sense of the text 
              includes metaphors, similes, and other figures of speech useful to accommodate 
              the truth of the Bible to the understanding of its readers. For example, when 
              one reads in the Bible that God stretches out His hand, one ought not think that 
              God has a hand. The literal meaning of such passages concerns God's power, not 
              His anatomy. Nor ought one think that the six days at the beginning of Genesis 
              literally refer to God's acting in time, for God's creative act is instantaneous.</p>
              <p>Hence, Aquinas would have no difficulty accepting Big Bang cosmology, even with 
              its recent variations, while also affirming the doctrine of creation out of nothing. 
              He would, of course, distinguish between advances in cosmology and the philosophical 
              and theological reflections on these advances. Like the little 
              boy/girl i mentioned at the outset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we are being told a great deal that is beside the 
              point of our question.</span> Thomas Aquinas did not have the advantage of the Hubble 
              Space Telescope, but in many ways he was able to see farther and more clearly 
              than those who do.</p>
              <p>Sorry for such a long post, as i am trying to use logical explainations using the jurisprudence of natural law as opposed to positivist point of view to try and make my state ment.</p>
              <p>Finally, i must end this by saying that, yes i believe in the realities. But the difference between me and those that follow blindly, i accept science and religion together. Maybe you need to see LKY's body (and/or skeptical) to believe he is dead even though his body together with 500 people perished in the sea(as reported in New Strait Times), you will not give the benefit of the doubt, and unless solid proof that he is dead, u still have inclinations of him hiding at some cave with his billions of the peoples money. Unless you want DNA proof :-</p>
              <p>If u were to believe in DNA , let me give you another example of why I say it takes just as much
              faith to believe evolution as it does to believe in God. There is
              exactly zero evidence of one species of beings evolving into another
              species. None, not one example or proof. Yet we are told that we all
              came from a common ancestor. People will even try to point to DNA and
              how close our DNA is to apes and say, see that is proof. Did you
              realize that our DNA is also close to the DNA of a tomato? Wow, did we
              come from tomatoes? Of course not, so what does it prove? To me it
              proves that we had a common Creator. Our Creator not only made us but
              He made tomatoes too!! And apes and grasshoppers, etc...</p>
              <p>So i hope you will understand the way i believe in the bible as much as i believe in science.</p>

              <p><strong>You are just a typical religious person. You do not question your own assumptions. You take all your delusions as truth. </strong></p>

              <p>First of all, i must say that i understand your point of view.
              The notion of its logic in the material plane to be supported by
              concrete evidence, and not some 'delusion' to rely on ones faith,
              such as believers on the meaning of the creation of the
              universe.</p>
              <p>And regarding contradictions and affirmations(which agnostics,
              atheists,non-believers always rely on), <span style="font-family: Arial;">upon an examination of the accounts in the
              Gospels, it will be seen that none of the writers denies, what one
              of the other Gospel writers affirms.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">If, however, one talks about a sun that is
              always light, yet dark, contradictory statements are made. By
              definition that which is <em>always</em> light cannot be dark. Nor
              can one talk about a square circle, since by definition a circle is
              round and not square. The property of squareness precludes the
              possibility of a square being a circle.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">In certain instances not all problems may be
              resolved by a careful reading of the contexts and a clarification
              of what is, and what is not, claimed by the narratives. Such ought
              not to be the source of undue embarrassment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The fact that no resolution of a
              problem is immediately possible is not proof that the right
              solution is not available.</span> Humility is required that one
              does not confine the divine inspiration of Scripture to the level
              of one's intellectual attainments.</span></p>
              <p>Let me just begin with the simple notion of supported evidence
              of biblical proportions. Crossings of the red sea by Moses.</p>
              <p>While the above locations of Mount Sinai and Yam Suf have been
              conventional wisdom for centuries, during just recent decades,
              mountain-climbing-adventurers and deep sea divers (devoted
              Christian Bible-believers) have made remarkable discoveries in the
              Gulf of Aqaba and in Saudi Arabia. By 21st century standards of
              artifacts, topography and logic, these facts-on-the-ground
              establish that the Bible and the Passover Haggadah are arguably
              <em>true factual histories of ancient events</em> - including the
              "miracles" described in the Old Testament.</p>
              <p>What has been found are coral-covered remnants of ancient
              Egyptian chariots: wheels, hubs, axles and shafts, the diameters
              and spoke designs matching Egyptian murals and museum collections
              of the 18th Dynasty (compatible era-wise with the biblical Exodus).
              Photos of such artifacts, although underwater (removal is not
              permitted by Egyptian and Saudi authorities), can be seen in
              numerous books, films, even on the Internet. The artifacts,
              including bones of men and horses, are strewn along a seven mile
              underwater ridge, from Egypt to the Saudi Arabian shore.</p>
              <p>A 21st century realist viewing these items in books, film or
              Internet, can ask, "Are these coral-covered remains of ancient
              chariots really there?" An affirmative answer comes from solid
              reasoning - the numerous well-known personages accompanying the
              diving expedition, the many authors of books and films, all attest
              to authenticity - such serious professionals would not risk their
              reputations and careers in any duplicitous scheme (such as if the
              artifacts depicted were non-existent). Thus by logic, those
              coral-covered relics of ancient Egyptian chariots are truly there -
              scattered on an undersea ridge between Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and
              Saudi Arabia, miles from Egyptian shore and <em>hundreds of feet
              below sea level</em>.</p>
              <p>Q:Why Did the Charioteers Enter the Ridge - Water Hundreds of
              Feet Above?</p>
              <p>For it is only logical to explain that, it has to have a passage
              of way, to enter and pursue. The key element here is the rationale
              behind the pursuit of the chariots.The only rationale has to be
              that it looked safe - <em>since the Israelites were fleeing without
              concern for the water, hundreds of feet above their heads, and
              "somehow" being held back</em>! - That is just a thought for you to
              ponder on.</p>
              <p>Now the next issue will be regarding Science and Religion.</p>
              <p>I am sure we have all seen or head the story about a young
              boy/girl, asking the mum/dad 'Where did i come from?' pleased to
              have the opportunity to discuss such an important matter with her
              son, began by offering an elementary account of human biology, even
              introducing some references to the theory of evolution. Lest she
              restrict her analysis to the realm of the purely physical, she
              spoke of God's role in the creation of each human soul, and
              ultimately of God as the source of all that is. After she had
              finished, her young son, looking somewhat bemused, said to her that
              he had wondered about this because his friend next door had told
              him that he had come from Iowa.</p>
              <p>The question of where we come from can be answered in many ways.
              We need to keep this fact in mind when we turn our attention to the
              account given by contemporary cosmology of the origins of the
              universe. I seriously dont want to go into the details of the Big
              Bang as a "singularity," that is, an ultimate boundary or edge, a
              "state of infinite density" where space-time has ceased.Just as
              sub-atomic particles appear to emerge spontaneously in vacuums in
              laboratories, as the result of what is called "quantum tunneling
              from nothing," so the whole universe may be the result of a similar
              process, however rejected by Hawkings that he universe, according
              to him, does not have a boundary: "It is completely self-contained
              and not affected by anything outside itself." He thinks that the
              only way to have a scientific theory is if "the laws of physics
              hold everywhere, including at the beginning of the universe." That
              issue even though exetremely interesting to look at the competeting
              ideas, i shall stop here. To continue on..  i use one of the
              natural law jurisprudence by Thomas Aquinas in the explaintaion
              like how too often contemporary discussions about the relationship
              between science and religion suffer from an ignorance of history,
              and our question is an example. For we can save God and natural
              theology from the dustbins simply by turning to the sophisticated
              analyses of the natural sciences and creation that took place
              during the age of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism">High
              Scholasticism</a>. &lt;--- Click to save time for
              explainations.</p>
              <p>Recent speculations that the universe began as "quantum
              tunneling from nothing" reaffirm the ancient Greek principle that
              you cannot get something from nothing. For the "vacuum" of modern
              particle physics, whose "fluctuation" some see as bringing our
              universe into existence, is not absolutely nothing. It is not
              anything like our present universe, but it still is something. Or
              else, how could it fluctuate? The key to Aquinas' analysis is the
              distinction he draws between <em>creation</em> and
              <em>change</em>.</p>
              <p>Aquinas did not think that the opening of Genesis presented any
              difficulties for the natural sciences, for the Bible is not a
              textbook in the sciences. What is essential to Christian faith,
              according to Aquinas, is the "fact of creation," not the manner or
              mode of the formation of the world.</p>
              <p>For Aquinas, the literal meaning of the Bible is what God, its
              author, intends the words to mean. The literal sense of the text
              includes metaphors, similes, and other figures of speech useful to
              accommodate the truth of the Bible to the understanding of its
              readers. For example, when one reads in the Bible that God
              stretches out His hand, one ought not think that God has a hand.
              The literal meaning of such passages concerns God's power, not His
              anatomy. Nor ought one think that the six days at the beginning of
              Genesis literally refer to God's acting in time, for God's creative
              act is instantaneous.</p>
              <p>Hence, Aquinas would have no difficulty accepting Big Bang
              cosmology, even with its recent variations, while also affirming
              the doctrine of creation out of nothing. He would, of course,
              distinguish between advances in cosmology and the philosophical and
              theological reflections on these advances. Like the little boy/girl
              i mentioned at the outset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we are being told a great deal that
              is beside the point of our question.</span> Thomas Aquinas did not
              have the advantage of the Hubble Space Telescope, but in many ways
              he was able to see farther and more clearly than those who do.</p>
              <p>Sorry for such a long post, as i am trying to use logical
              explainations using the jurisprudence of natural law as opposed to
              positivist point of view to try and make my state ment.</p>
              <p>Finally, i must end this by saying that, yes i believe in the
              realities. But the difference between me and those that follow
              blindly, i accept science and religion together. Maybe you need to
              see LKY's body (and/or skeptical) to believe he is dead even though
              his body together with 500 people perished in the sea(as reported
              in New Strait Times), you will not give the benefit of the doubt,
              and unless solid proof that he is dead, u still have inclinations
              of him hiding at some cave with his billions of the peoples money.
              Unless you want DNA proof :-</p>
              <p>If u were to believe in DNA , let me give you another example of
              why I say it takes just as much faith to believe evolution as it
              does to believe in God. There is exactly zero evidence of one
              species of beings evolving into another species. None, not one
              example or proof. Yet we are told that we all came from a common
              ancestor. People will even try to point to DNA and how close our
              DNA is to apes and say, see that is proof. Did you realize that our
              DNA is also close to the DNA of a tomato? Wow, did we come from
              tomatoes? Of course not, so what does it prove? To me it proves
              that we had a common Creator. Our Creator not only made us but He
              made tomatoes too!! And apes and grasshoppers, etc...</p>
              <p>So i hope you will understand the way i believe in the bible as
              much as i believe in science.</p>

              <p>The red sea is just one of the scientific evidence of it actually happening.  Thier refusal is well documented, the photos, and onsite verification of rock formations, topography was done on the site, but they were unable to physically excavate it out and it still lies in the red sea until today.</p>
              <p>Like i said, u do not believe so thats why however minute it is, u will refuse to believe. I do not blame your skepticsm at all. It just challenges me to provide more concrete facts with scientific evidence to support my statements.</p>
              <p>See, again the 10% issue, u view it in such skepticsm. Its like how realists approach to the world of how can i help u if i cant help myself, but the other side will be thinking, how would i help you instead then i help myself after helping u.</p>
              <p>But then again, u never read the bible, so it can be frustrating for me to try to explain something that u have never seen or read yourself. Like i have read scientific articles, i have read a evolutionist point of view, and all that, and understood the bible, thats why i am able to understand your point of view. And even though u dont believe doesnt mean u cant give the book a good read. In fact , if u allow. I can send one leather bound brand new copy, free of charge, fast post to arrive at your place the very next day. Have a good read, and challenge its scriptures and prove the fallacies currently supported together biblically with scientific facts and properly researched and verification by current technological advances after u finished the book. And i will be more then welcome to let you continue on with this debate.</p>

              <p>I dont blindly take TV as scientific proof. But it can be
              reference from where you start. I mentioned it because you already
              refuse to read the journals and articles ma...   
              -_-"</p>
              <p>The red sea is just one of the scientific evidence of it
              actually happening.  Thier refusal is well documented, the
              photos, and onsite verification of rock formations, topography was
              done on the site, but they were unable to physically excavate it
              out and it still lies in the red sea until today.</p>
              <p>Like i said, u do not believe so thats why however minute it is,
              u will refuse to believe. I do not blame your skepticsm at all. It
              just challenges me to provide more concrete facts with scientific
              evidence to support my statements.</p>
              <p>See, again the 10% issue, u view it in such skepticsm. Its like
              how realists approach to the world of how can i help u if i cant
              help myself, but the other side will be thinking, how would i help
              you instead then i help myself after helping u.</p>
              <p>But then again, u never read the bible, so it can be frustrating
              for me to try to explain something that u have never seen or read
              yourself. Like i have read scientific articles, i have read a
              evolutionist point of view, and all that, and understood the bible,
              thats why i am able to understand your point of view.
              And even though u dont believe doesnt mean u cant give the
              book a good read. In fact , if u allow. I can send one leather
              bound brand new copy, free of charge, fast post to arrive at your
              place the very next day. Have a good read, and challenge its
              scriptures and prove the fallacies currently supported together
              biblically with scientific facts and properly researched and
              verification by current technological advances after u finished the
              book. And i will be more then welcome to let you continue
              on with this debate.</p>

              <p>Again, you just dont understand how the mind of the Almighty works because, you HAVE NOT READ the bible.</p>
              <p>I gave an example of Bill Gates, or any super powerful person in nature. For you to believe in him, do you think u can juts summon him over. Who are u to just ask Bill Gates to come over to show you that he exists and demand that he show you some of his Microsoft power just to know that Him n Microsoft exists? True .. in a thousand years time he may be gone, Microsoft existed and so is his legacy, does that mean he doesnt exists?</p>
              <p>Science depends upon observation and replication. Miracles, such as the Incarnation (Christ's virgin birth)
              and the Resurrection, are by their very nature unprecedented events. No
              one can replicate these events in a laboratory. Hence, science simply
              cannot be the judge and jury as to whether or not these events occurred. Maybe u can replicate the way the water parts or fire from the sky, but the key element of the catalyst just cant be replicated.</p>
              <p>The
              scientific method is useful for studying nature but not super-nature.
              Just as football stars are speaking outside their field of expertise
              when they appear on television to tell you what razor you should buy,
              so scientists are speaking outside their field when they address
              theological issues like miracles or the Resurrection.</p>
              <p>God has showen AGAIN n AGAIN his miracles, the red sea, the exodus, the fire, the plague, the water from the rocks... countless countless miracles. Come on, the peolpe that witness the miracles, in a few years went back to idol worshipping and was punished when the earth cracked open and burned swallowed.  If people thousands of years ago witness gargantuan miracles in your face and can still turn away, i wounldnt be suprise people like you kept demanding he show himself. Seriuosly man.. who are you to ask him to show himself, you of such small faith or NO faith demand something like this. You put it in this context,  seriously you will understand what it means.</p>
              <p>Only after u read the bible can u fully understand, but you refuse to. And your ignorance of the bible you can only use the same thing over n over again, the logic philosophy of nothing into something, or If there is God why people still suffer. You are not even 100 yrs old you hardly can say that miracles never happened and God never showed himself.</p>
              <p>Moses Splits Rock for Water (Rephidim - Unnatural Phenomenon!)</p>
              <p>In
                  the Bible the Israelites cry out for water at a place called Rephidim,
                  and in exasperation, Moses is said to strike a rock, from which water
                  flows. An unbelievable sight (except perhaps, from Hollywood studios),
                  is an unusual rock formation on a nearby hill - two shafts, fifty feet
                  tall, a constant and parallel gap of twenty inches between them. (On
                  the Internet, one can see photos of adventurers posing in the gap). At
                  the base, per geologists and many visitors, are marks of water erosion.
                  (Note: The area is desert!) - but of course, you want MORE evidence, how about u spend 4 years and take a geology degree and go down there and do your research and then come back and tell us what do u think. Scientists and geologists ? Sure. Like i said, you dont believe, you WONT believe, with so many scientists n geologists trying to figure it out, they just cant. N the answer.. Unnatural Phenomenon! *full stop* but of course, u are cynical and extreeeeemly skeptical.</p>
              <p>You say i am addicted to religion, but because of the way you challenge my facts and statements that were properly documents by scientists that makes me even more curious about Christianity and why people just wont believe even tho talking statement by statement and fact by fact, which leads me to come to the conclusion that, its pointless to present facts to someone who has never even read the bible. Its exactly how the bible has said about believers and non-believers alike. Man forgets and they sin with thier ignorance.  Its like trying to have scientific discussion with a non-scientific person who doesnt even know science to begin with.</p>
              <p>And you talk about all-loving God, you dont even comprehend Him, he wants people with free-will. Not automaton robot like people. Like i said, again n again, you didnt even read the bible, just nit picking little facts and piecing together and putting forward the logic to its conclusion. To criticise, please at least study the material, dun judge a preview without even watching the movie. Because you are not all-knowing.</p>
              <p>I can disseminate dubious claims and delusions, but you however, are just too cynical and skeptical to even accept tabled truths, scientific facts and study.  Thats our difference. I am willing to learn , adopt and constantly challenge myself, my faith and science to better clearer answers.  But you however.. well, you have always been a cynic and an extreme skeptic anyways. =)</p>
