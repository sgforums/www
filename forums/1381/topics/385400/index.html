              <p><strong>The way some Christians argue against science like when they pit the creation story against evolution is just pure stupidity.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In my conversations with some European Christians, they have no problems accepting evolution as scientific truth.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>From my conversations with many Christians in Singapore, (probably because of the influence of the Church in America), the stupidity is glaring.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The will argue with you what is proven scientifically and call into question that which has been peer reviewed with things that some pastor, some "authority" claim to be the truth with no or no good basis.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>One way Christians need not be stupid is to accept that god is beyond human understanding and description.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Whatever you read in the Bible or Koran or Sutra fails to explain god.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It can only hint at what god is like. It can only describe people's experiences with god.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>To say that the bible explains and describes god accurately is sheer arrogance and gross stupidity. How can human words and language explain god? What kind of stupid god is that? What a stupid god he is if humans can understand and explain him.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You might think that the way to approach religion is for it to be as "provable" and "logical" as science and philosophy.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rubbish. Stupid.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>That only degrades your god.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Read the bible as trying to describe something that is indescribable and mysterious.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Don't ever read the bible as a science text book and what is written in there as scientific truth. It need not be conflicting. It can be complementary.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The present scientists are doing religious people a big favor by pointing out the inaccuracies (scientifically speaking) of the religious texts. If religious people take that as offensive, they are just stupid.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>It is the opposite of Idolatry which is what many if not most christians that claim to eschew idols now practice.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What is an idol? It is man putting god into a form that they can see and understand. When you pigeonhole god into certain characteristics even if they are noble characteristics that is an even worse form of idolatry.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>All you can say is: "My experience with god is this and that..." and never "God is this and God is that".</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What is written in so-called scriptures must be taken as "allegory", people trying to describe their experiences with god and never to be taken literally. Once you take it literally, you create an idol in your head. You presume to know god and understand god as having characteristics as written in the scriptures.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>As allegory, there will never be conflict between scientific proofs and scriptural inconsistencies. They are allegories, get it? They tell you something other than what is written. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>You are far from stupid and you begin to be stupid when you start to say god is this and that and when you try to argue against something that is proven with something that is not to be taken literally.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Some manifestations are more important, like the Hindu Trinity you cited.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Some manifestations can be a physical object like a tree or a chair.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Hindus have no problems worshiping a chair or tree if it manifests God. Manifestation of God and God himself are regarded as similar.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Buddhists believe in Gods but not the way other religions believe in Gods. Like Buddhists talk about Brahma but not in the same way Hindus talk about Brahma.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>When you treat the bible as allegory, the inconsistencies are no longer important. You cannot treat the bible as a logical, scientifically valid (that is, in alignment with the known laws of nature), and consistent document. It is not and will never be.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Does that mean it is useless? To a scientist it is useless. To a believer it is not. It is a rich source to learn about God but what is important is not what you learn about god in the bible but your own experiences of god in your life.</strong></p>

              <p>Agree with you partially but not totally. Some of the things said in the scriptures are scientifically proven and some are yet to be proven. Just 3 examples below :</p>
              <p>1) Buddha once held up a cup of water and remarked that there were 84,000 (a number to denote "many" or "countless") beings in it. No one understand what He meant. Today, we use a microscope and see that He referred to invisible microorganisms.</p>
              <p>2) Buddha described worlds beyond ours in the vastness of outer space and other dimensions which are inhabited by many other intelligent sentiment life forms, many of which are unlike ours. Aliens existence are yet to be proven.</p>
              <p>3) Buddhism believes in indestructibility or preservation of energy. This is in line with the law of conservation  of energy, which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be transformed from one form to another. The teaching of rebirth, is an example of  transfer of imperishable Mind or mental energy from  one body into another. It is yet to be proven but some scientists are looking into this issue.</p>

              <p>all these god religion are revealing religions. what do I mean by revealing religions? It means that there are prophecies of sorts, that is able to predict am event that happens in future, before it actually happened of course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to me its just like the same as having your fortune teller telling you that some things will happen to you in future, such as they tell you to avoid driving in december cos you might get an accident if you drive in december. the fortune teller did not tell you why you could not drive in december or how to neutralise it, just tell you if you drive in december, you will involve in an accident, thats all. the poor fellow, on hearing this, will avoid driving in december and worse, he may avoid all forms of transportation in december to avoid being involved in an accident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what if the prophesies are correct in the bible and I am saying if? what has it done to improve the lives of the people? none whatsoever. if the bible say there is a huge tsunamis that occur in 26 december 2004 in Indonesia and if alot of lives are saved as a result, then I say kudos to the bible for saving lives. but then if god is almighty, why cant he do something to prevent the tsunamis from happening in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the thing I am trying to say is this, religions tend to create fear of the unknown to prey on the minds of people and it actually works. some of your christian friends, being compassionate, may preach to you to accept Jesus, so as to save you from going to hell when you die. if the religion is true and universal, then there is no need to create fear on the minds of people, believers and non believers.</p>

              <p>if god created us, who created god then? if they tell you god existed in the beginning, then what is the beginning of the beginning? then there is the issue of being omnipotent. if god is almighty, can god create something he cant lift? if he cant create it, he is not almighty. if he can create it, then he also isnt almighty. see the paradox of the concept. think about it.</p>

              <p>I was actually trying to give a response to those who trying to put Science and Religion in a BLACK and WHITE manner (antagonistic in nature). Perhaps this is because of our educational system.</p>
              <p>And the majority of the feedback I've perceived is that "Don't care about such people, they don't know what they are talking about, SCIENCE obviously has more utility".</p>
              <p>And these feedback feels to me is like some sgians trying to bring them into the BLACK and WHITE light. Marking them as radicals.</p>
              <p>previously quoted:</p>
              <p><strong>The way some Christians argue against science like when they pit the creation story against evolution is just pure stupidity.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In my conversations with some European Christians, they have no problems accepting evolution as scientific truth.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>From my conversations with many Christians in Singapore, (probably because of the influence of the Church in America), the stupidity is glaring.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The will argue with you what is proven scientifically and call into question that which has been peer reviewed with things that some pastor, some "authority" claim to be the truth with no or no good basis.</strong></p>
