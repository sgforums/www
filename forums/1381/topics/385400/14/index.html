              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I asked you a valid question, mr. hybrid religion. You are
                  labeling me a troll?</p>
              <p>If your analogy of PRC Chinese and Singaporean Chinese  is
                  what you mean by evolution, the evolutionists will be embarrassed
                  by your logic.</p>
              <p>Mr. hybrid religion, first you said this:" <strong>Personally
                  i'm a Deist, i'm not against the idea of the possibility of a God
                  existing because the world would be pretty bland and boring without
                  such romantic ideas to bring life into it. Without religion, there
                  would also be none of the art and literature that fansinates our
                  imagination."</strong></p>
              <p>Now what is the definition of deist in your dictionary?</p>
              <p>....and  you are in support of evolution theory. An
                  evolutionist cannot be a deist. A deist cannot support evolution
                  theory. There is no in-between.</p>
              <p>May be, I can now coin a word for your standing in-between the
                  two. How about evoludeist? How do you like that, besides being a
                  hybrid religion man?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The modern iterations of  Monkeys and apes did not play a part in
                  the reproductive cycles of the Modern Homo Erectus. So i can say we do
                  not descend from them.</p>
              <p>I use the PRC/Singaporean analogy
                  because it's the same logic, we would have shared a common ancestor
                  with the PRC, but as our closer ancestors migrated off to Singapore and
                  started their own family their children would identify themselves as
                  Singaporean Chinese.</p>
              <p>These Singaporean Chinese would meet other
                  Singaporean Chinese and marry to have more children. Thus it becomes gradually
                  rare for a young Singaporean Chinese to have either of their parents
                  being from the PRC(though, that is changing now with the liberal
                  immigration policy).</p>
              <p>So, i can say we share a common ancestor
                  with those from the PRC but we are descended from Singaporean Chinese.
                  It's the same way in evolution, we evolve from a common ancestor as the
                  chimps and apes but they play no part in the reproductive process of
                  the modern Homo Erectus, so we can safely say we do not descend from
                  them.</p>
              <p>First you ask me for the definition of being a Deist.
                  Then you assume that Deism and the Evolution theory cannot co exist?
                  Quite a strange conclusion. Are not the Protestants, Evangelists,
                  Mormons and the Roman Catholics all Christians?</p>
              <p>Don't Islam, Christianity and Judaism all worship the God of Abraham?</p>
              <p>Firstly i do believe in the <strong>possibility</strong> of a God but this God do not answer prayers, is not interested in sins
                  or confessions, does not even bother to read our thoughts and do not
                  bother with capricious miracles. He/She/It certainly does not behave
                  like a petty human.</p>
              <p>I'm assuming that any headways or misfortunes i make in life is
                  due to a lucky combination of random events (which includes effort on
                  my own part), not because of some divine being intervening on my
                  behalf.All the shit and lucky things that happens in life is my own
                  responsibility, not anyone else's.</p>
              <p>I do not need someone to
                  interpret for me the meaning of a book a thousand years old on how i
                  should behave and what i should believe. Nor do i need to be with
                  hundreds of people once every week in order to feel i'm doing the right
                  thing.</p>
              <p>Since i'm quite capable of making any judgement on my
                  own without the need of a propaganda book, a priest or a congregation,
                  i do not need to fall back on outdated notions to define my worldview.</p>
              <p>I
                  prefer to read the many works of people who has spent decades of their
                  lives researching a particular subject to slowly build up my worldview.
                  Rather than just one book.</p>
              <p>Since so many scientists have devoted their career to evolution
                  and is able to provide the evidence, concrete proof and solid logic on
                  why evolution is true i do not see any reason why it would clash with
                  my world view and certainly not Deism. </p>
              <p>There is certainly no grounds for saying one cannot believe in Deism and in Evolution at the same time.
                  If you insist that this be called a hybrid religion, then every
                  educated man and woman capable of thinking for themselves all have
                  their own hybrid religions.</p>
              <p>Considering that you enjoy so much giving people insulting names, what else should i call you besides a troll?</p>

              <p>It was a system the church used in the time of the inquisition. The "holy" would torture and kill before going to confession. The most ridiculous part of history remains in the fact that hordes of catholics went to fight their "holy war" in the crusades just because the pope said their sins would be forgiven if they did. How easily manipulated the fools were</p>

              <p>What?</p>
              <p>I am using the Chinese as an example to explain the difference between a common ancestor and being descended from. We share the common ancestor of the dragon (using your metaphor) but we no longer identify ourselves as a PRC Chinese.</p>
              <p>We shared a common ancestry with apes and chimps but descended in a different path. We are all descendents of this common ancestor but evolve to be a different species(with the scientific definition as being unable to mate naturally and produce a viable offspring).</p>
              <p>The Chinese have thousands of ancestors but the dragon metaphor is used to define that point where we all share that common ancestor.</p>
              <p>Homo Erectus, Apes and Chimps have millions of ancestors but there is one point where we all shared that same ancestor.</p>
              <p>How more simple do i need to make this for you? You  can only see the points i make but seemed incapable of making any connections.</p>
              <p>If my example was wrong laurence82, dcdx, Rooney and your fellow Christians here would have pointed it out already </p>
              <p>There are different degrees of belief in a supreme being.</p>
              <p>Deists believe that a supreme being created the universe then left it alone for the universe to do whatever such beings do to occupy time. We believe such beings do not interfere with the natural world after creation but can be understood rationally.</p>
              <p>Theists are people are like you and LarryTeo, believing that everything that happens God intentionally lets it happen. An overseer or a Big Brother that peeks in every moment.</p>
              <p>I just believe in the possibility that a rational being created a system that's running on automatic, by just setting the rules of physics and chemistry that makes the stars and planets possible and left it as that. </p>
              <p>Evolution is just one of the systems running that we're trying to understand.</p>
              <p>What in the world is an evolution controversy anyhow and why in hell would this be one?</p>

                              common ancestor.</p>
              <p>Homo Erectus, Apes and Chimps have millions of ancestors but
                              there is one point where we all shared that same ancestor.</p>
              <p>How more simple do i need to make this for you? You  can
                              only see the points i make but seemed incapable of making any
                              connections.</p>
              <p>If my example was wrong laurence82, dcdx, Rooney and your
                              fellow Christians here would have pointed it out
                              already </p>
              <p>There are different degrees of belief in a supreme being.</p>
              <p>Deists believe that a supreme being created the universe then
                              left it alone for the universe to do whatever such beings do to
                              occupy time. We believe such beings do not interfere with the
                              natural world after creation but can be understood
                              rationally.</p>
              <p>Theists are people are like you and LarryTeo, believing that
                              everything that happens God intentionally lets it happen. An
                              overseer or a Big Brother that peeks in every moment.</p>
              <p>I just believe in the possibility that a rational
                              being created a system that's running on automatic,
                              by just setting the rules of physics and chemistry that makes the
                              stars and planets possible and left it as that. </p>
              <p>Evolution is just one of the systems running that
                              we're trying to understand.</p>
              <p>What in the world is an evolution controversy anyhow and why in
                              hell would this be one?</p>

              <p>Descendance and ancestry are interchangable and mean the same thing.</p>
