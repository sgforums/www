              <p>Evolution is not a proven theory at all. Why must we all accept evolution as the scientific truth especially when it has many more loopholes than the concept of a creator? Is it any of your business that we christians do not believe in the theory of evolution? And the reason why europeans believe in the theory of evolution is because the Pope of vatican approved it for the church. It was more of an aim to get richer i guess.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Evolution makes no sense at 
              all.  I just don't see how any intelligent person could believe such 
              nonsense.  I mean, have you ever seen an ape that could be taught to do 
              algebra?  No!  Other than the most basic skills (which a dog can also 
              be taught), an ape does not have the capacity to learn anywhere near the human 
              level.  Apes are dumb!  You can say a dog is smart (and it might be), 
              but it can't logic like a human being can.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Furthermore, if we evolved from a lower species, then why is it 
              that the apes didn't evolve in the evolutionary process?  Come on folks, 
              you don't need a PHD (post hole digger) to figure this out.  Where are all 
              those half man/half ape fossils which should be abundant in the earth's soil 
              layers?  They don't exist.  This is what is known as the "missing 
              link" by evolutionists.  Notice that I didn't call them "scientists" 
              because there is NOTHING scientific about evolution.  Science by it's very 
              definition means "the study of."  To "study" something, it must be 
              observable.  Not only is evolution not observable, it is not testable or 
              repeatable in a lab.  Do you realize that evolutionists CANNOT display even 
              ONE single proof of evolution...NOT ONE!  Dinosaur fossils don't prove 
              anything except that they existed.  Whether dinosaurs existed in Biblical 
              times or during a pre-Adamic period is debatable amongst theologians.  Many 
              preachers believe that Lucifer operated a kingdom upon the earth prior to 
              Genesis 1:2.  The Bible does support this theory with credible evidence.  
              This is commonly known as the "gap theory."  Regardless, the fact that 
              dinosaurs once inhabited this earth adds no credibility to the THEORY of 
              evolution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Even today, this world is filled with simple one-cell structured 
              living organisms.  Why didn't they evolve?  Furthermore, if evolution 
              were true, then you would think that different groups of animals could naturally 
              breed.  A horse and a giraffe cannot breed offspring.  A cat and a dog 
              cannot breed offspring.  Only through modern genetic DNA tampering can 
              scientists play God and create monsters.  Do a web search under "spider 
              goats" if you want to be freaked out.  Then read up on "Frankenfoods."  
              Agricultural scientists have created potatoes that produce their own internal 
              pesticides from silk moth DNA genetically placed into the potatoes.  The 
              moths die when they eat the potatoes...yummy.  Do you know what you're 
              eating?  The same is true of genetically altered corn.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">According to Charles Darwin's own words, there 
              	is nothing "fair" about what is going on today in the public school system.  
              	Children are only being presented one side of the argument, as if it were a 
              	fact.  But the problem of dishonest scientists (what the Bible calls 
              	"science falsely so called" in 1st Timothy 6:20) goes far beyond just the 
              	school children.  I was recently watching an episode of Walt Disney's
              	<em>History Channe</em>l, titled <em>THE UNIVERSE</em>, in which they claim that 
              	the entire universe began with a "BIG BANG" 13.7 billion years ago.  
              	They claim that the whole universe today originated from a particle smaller 
              	than a single atom.  I couldn't help but laugh.  How could anyone 
              	be so naive as to believe such nonsense?  They teach this garbage with 
              	such certainty, as if it's absolute truth.  They are arrogant fools.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">If, as evolutionists claim, all of 
              	mankind evolved from the SAME primitive life-source, then how did we end up 
              	with 7,000 different languages? Did one gorilla get angry at another gorilla 
              	and decide to start a new language? I'm intrigued to know. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The Bible teaches that God created all the 
              	different languages at Babel... "<em>Go to, let us go down, and there 
              	confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech 
              	... Therefore is the name of it called Babel; <strong>because the LORD did there 
              	confound the language of all the earth</strong>: and from thence did the LORD 
              	scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth</em>" (Genesis 11:7,9). It 
              	is far more reasonable to accept the Biblical claim that God created all of 
              	mankind's different languages; than it is to believe that some space-dust 
              	from a massive chaotic explosion somehow became life, and then took on 
              	intelligence, and then from the same evolutionary process ended up with 
              	7,000 different languages. That makes no sense at all. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">There are no "primitive" 
              	languages. All languages have a system of sounds, words, and sentences that 
              	can adequately communicate the content of culture. This is evidence of a 
              	divine Creator. The languages of the so-called "primitive" peoples are often 
              	very complex in their grammatical structures. If mankind had advanced 
              	through an evolutionary process, then there should still be developing 
              	languages today; but in fact, one languages disappears every 2-weeks... </span></p>

              <p>Again, you just dont understand how the mind of the Almighty
              works because, you HAVE NOT READ the bible.</p>
              <p>I gave an example of Bill Gates, or any super powerful person in
              nature. For you to believe in him, do you think u can juts summon
              him over. Who are u to just ask Bill Gates to come over to show you
              that he exists and demand that he show you some of his Microsoft
              power just to know that Him n Microsoft exists? True .. in a
              thousand years time he may be gone, Microsoft existed and so is his
              legacy, does that mean he doesnt exists?</p>
              <p>Science depends upon observation and replication. Miracles, such
              as the Incarnation (Christ's virgin birth) and the Resurrection,
              are by their very nature unprecedented events. No one can replicate
              these events in a laboratory. Hence, science simply cannot be the
              judge and jury as to whether or not these events occurred. Maybe u
              can replicate the way the water parts or fire from the sky, but the
              key element of the catalyst just cant be replicated.</p>
              <p>The scientific method is useful for studying nature but not
              super-nature. Just as football stars are speaking outside their
              field of expertise when they appear on television to tell you what
              razor you should buy, so scientists are speaking outside their
              field when they address theological issues like miracles or the
              Resurrection.</p>
              <p>God has showen AGAIN n AGAIN his miracles, the red sea, the
              exodus, the fire, the plague, the water from the rocks... countless
              countless miracles. Come on, the peolpe that witness the miracles,
              in a few years went back to idol worshipping and was punished when
              the earth cracked open and burned swallowed.  If people
              thousands of years ago witness gargantuan miracles in your face and
              can still turn away, i wounldnt be suprise people like you kept
              demanding he show himself. Seriuosly man.. who are you to ask him
              to show himself, you of such small faith or NO faith demand
              something like this. You put it in this context,  seriously
              you will understand what it means.</p>
              <p>Only after u read the bible can u fully understand, but you
              refuse to. And your ignorance of the bible you can only use the
              same thing over n over again, the logic philosophy of nothing into
              something, or If there is God why people still suffer. You are not
              even 100 yrs old you hardly can say that miracles never happened
              and God never showed himself.</p>
              <p>Moses Splits Rock for Water (Rephidim - Unnatural
              Phenomenon!)</p>
              <p>In the Bible the Israelites cry out for water at a place called
              Rephidim, and in exasperation, Moses is said to strike a rock, from
              which water flows. An unbelievable sight (except perhaps, from
              Hollywood studios), is an unusual rock formation on a nearby hill -
              two shafts, fifty feet tall, a constant and parallel gap of twenty
              inches between them. (On the Internet, one can see photos of
              adventurers posing in the gap). At the base, per geologists and
              many visitors, are marks of water erosion. (Note: The area is
              desert!) - but of course, you want MORE evidence, how about u spend
              4 years and take a geology degree and go down there and do your
              research and then come back and tell us what do u think. Scientists
              and geologists ? Sure. Like i said, you dont believe, you WONT
              believe, with so many scientists n geologists trying to figure it
              out, they just cant. N the answer.. Unnatural Phenomenon! *full
              stop* but of course, u are cynical and extreeeeemly skeptical.</p>
              <p>You say i am addicted to religion, but because of the way you
              challenge my facts and statements that were properly documents by
              scientists that makes me even more curious about Christianity and
              why people just wont believe even tho talking statement by
              statement and fact by fact, which leads me to come to the
              conclusion that, its pointless to present facts to someone who has
              never even read the bible. Its exactly how the bible has said about
              believers and non-believers alike. Man forgets and they sin with
              thier ignorance.  Its like trying to have scientific
              discussion with a non-scientific person who doesnt even know
              science to begin with.</p>
              <p>And you talk about all-loving God, you dont even comprehend Him,
              he wants people with free-will. Not automaton robot like people.
              Like i said, again n again, you didnt even read the bible, just nit
              picking little facts and piecing together and putting forward the
              logic to its conclusion. To criticise, please at least study the
              material, dun judge a preview without even watching the movie.
              Because you are not all-knowing.</p>
              <p>I can disseminate dubious claims and delusions, but you however,
              are just too cynical and skeptical to even accept tabled truths,
              scientific facts and study.  Thats our difference. I am
              willing to learn , adopt and constantly challenge myself, my faith
              and science to better clearer answers.  But you however..
              well, you have always been a cynic and an extreme skeptic anyways.

              <p>Evolution is not a proven theory at all. Why must we all accept
              evolution as the scientific truth especially when it has many more
              loopholes than the concept of a creator? Is it any of your business
              that we christians do not believe in the theory of evolution? And
              the reason why europeans believe in the theory of evolution is
              because the Pope of vatican approved it for the church. It was more
              of an aim to get richer i guess.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Evolution makes no
              sense at all.  I just don't see how any intelligent person
              could believe such nonsense.  I mean, have you ever seen an
              ape that could be taught to do algebra?  No!  Other than
              the most basic skills (which a dog can also be taught), an ape does
              not have the capacity to learn anywhere near the human level. 
              Apes are dumb!  You can say a dog is smart (and it might be),
              but it can't logic like a human being can. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Furthermore, if we
              evolved from a lower species, then why is it that the apes didn't
              evolve in the evolutionary process?  Come on folks, you don't
              need a PHD (post hole digger) to figure this out.  Where are
              all those half man/half ape fossils which should be abundant in the
              earth's soil layers?  They don't exist.  This is what is
              known as the "missing link" by evolutionists.  Notice that I
              didn't call them "scientists" because there is NOTHING scientific
              about evolution.  Science by it's very definition means "the
              study of."  To "study" something, it must be observable. 
              Not only is evolution not observable, it is not testable or
              repeatable in a lab.  Do you realize that evolutionists CANNOT
              display even ONE single proof of evolution...NOT ONE! 
              Dinosaur fossils don't prove anything except that they
              existed.  Whether dinosaurs existed in Biblical times or
              during a pre-Adamic period is debatable amongst theologians. 
              Many preachers believe that Lucifer operated a kingdom upon the
              earth prior to Genesis 1:2.  The Bible does support this
              theory with credible evidence.  This is commonly known as the
              "gap theory."  Regardless, the fact that dinosaurs once
              inhabited this earth adds no credibility to the THEORY of
              evolution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Even today, this world
              is filled with simple one-cell structured living organisms. 
              Why didn't they evolve?  Furthermore, if evolution were true,
              then you would think that different groups of animals could
              naturally breed.  A horse and a giraffe cannot breed
              offspring.  A cat and a dog cannot breed offspring.  Only
              through modern genetic DNA tampering can scientists play God and
              create monsters.  Do a web search under "spider goats" if you
              want to be freaked out.  Then read up on "Frankenfoods." 
              Agricultural scientists have created potatoes that produce their
              own internal pesticides from silk moth DNA genetically placed into
              the potatoes.  The moths die when they eat the
              potatoes...yummy.  Do you know what you're eating?  The
              same is true of genetically altered corn.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">According to Charles
              Darwin's own words, there is nothing "fair" about what is going on
              today in the public school system.  Children are only being
              presented one side of the argument, as if it were a fact.  But
              the problem of dishonest scientists (what the Bible calls "science
              falsely so called" in 1st Timothy 6:20) goes far beyond just the
              school children.  I was recently watching an episode of Walt
              Disney's <em>History Channe</em>l, titled <em>THE UNIVERSE</em>, in
              which they claim that the entire universe began with a "BIG BANG"
              13.7 billion years ago.  They claim that the whole universe
              today originated from a particle smaller than a single atom. 
              I couldn't help but laugh.  How could anyone be so naive as to
              believe such nonsense?  They teach this garbage with such
              certainty, as if it's absolute truth.  They are arrogant
              fools. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">If, as evolutionists
              claim, all of mankind evolved from the SAME primitive life-source,
              then how did we end up with 7,000 different languages? Did one
              gorilla get angry at another gorilla and decide to start a new
              language? I'm intrigued to know.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The Bible teaches that
              God created all the different languages at Babel... "<em>Go to, let
              us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not
              understand one another's speech ... Therefore is the name of it
              called Babel; <strong>because the LORD did there confound the
              language of all the earth</strong>: and from thence did the LORD
              scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth</em>" (Genesis
              11:7,9). It is far more reasonable to accept the Biblical claim
              that God created all of mankind's different languages; than it is
              to believe that some space-dust from a massive chaotic explosion
              somehow became life, and then took on intelligence, and then from
              the same evolutionary process ended up with 7,000 different
              languages. That makes no sense at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">There are no
              "primitive" languages. All languages have a system of sounds,
              words, and sentences that can adequately communicate the content of
              culture. This is evidence of a divine Creator. The languages of the
              so-called "primitive" peoples are often very complex in their
              grammatical structures. If mankind had advanced through an
              evolutionary process, then there should still be developing
              languages today; but in fact, one languages disappears every
              2-weeks...</span></p>

              <p>And why do you believe in the theory of evolution which is only a theory but not proven? Because it is publicised as a fact even when it is not? What proof do you have to say there is no proof of God's existence? Don't you know archeology verifies much of the bible? The number of findings that verify the bible are more than the findings which verify evolution. Oh yeah, evolution cannot be verified anyway. So you say the bible is rubbish. I say what you say is even more of rubbish, and also SHIT. Why? Because you believe that one day your TV will suddenly become alive and grow it's own wings.  Have you even read the book Origin of the species? If not how do you know evolution is true? Have you read the bible either? If not how do you know it's false? If you are going to spread your propaganda here, go spread it in the atheist forums.</p>
              <p>After this, you will say then why is it that evolution is so supported by many. But you do not look what happened backstage in those museums which display dinosaur bones. Do you know most of the so called ''half man and monkey'' displays there are fake? The evolutionists only find one bone in the sand, and then they assume it is a body part of a prehistoric human, and the displays are actually part of their imagination to cover up the missing links. When you ask an evolutionist ''can we observe evolution these days?'' they will say yes, and use macro-evolution as a factor. But no, macro-evolution is not evolution, it is just an animal's body adaptation towards some disease. We don't see that the animal cross-breed from a cat to a dog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that again, the evolutionist will argue that our genes are 98% similar to chimps. But humans share 50% of their genes with bananas. So humans are half banana? Then they will ask why is it we look like monkeys. But a snake looks like a worm. So snakes are from worms too? <strong>ABSURD.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Thus, with the way evolutionists fail to proof evolution, I deduce evolution is false, for evolution is not observable, and not proven either. </strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">IF, as evolutionists claim, the 
                earth is billions of years old, and mankind has evolved from a lower and 
                simpler form of life, then why has mankind gone from writing upon stones to 
                laser printers in just the past 3,500 years?  When God gave Moses the Ten 
                Commandments, they were written upon stone.  It is abundantly clear that 
                the Egyptians carved messages into stone (hieroglyphics).  So why is it 
                that mankind has only discovered better inventions in the past few thousand 
                years?  If mankind had evolved, as evolutionists claim, then why didn't 
                man discover ink a million years ago?  Think about it.  This is an 
                astonishing thought--There were NO planes, cars, computers, refrigerators, 
                electricity, lights, gas, powered-equipment, telephones, recording devices, CD 
                players, MP3 players, electric razors, televisions, record players, movie 
                cameras, or a million other modern technological inventions--just a mere 170 
                years ago.  Civilization has advanced from utter primitiveness to 
                incredible mind-boggling achievements in just a little over 100 years.  
                So why didn't mankind discover any of this stuff 100,000,000 years ago, or 
                100,000 years ago for that matter?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Look at the ignorance of doctors 
                over the past few centuries.  Sanitary practices, such as washing hands, 
                were laughed at by doctors, while thousands of patients continued to die.  
                It was unimaginable to doctors back then, that washing one's hands somehow was 
                related to a patient's health in the operating room.  Can you believe 
                that?  Evolutionists today are just as ignorant of the truth of God's 
                Word, and of common sense itself.  It's hard to imagine that millions of 
                people were dying from a simple lack of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) just a 
                couple hundred years ago.  If evolution is true, then it took man 
                billions of years to learn all these kindergarten lessons.  And 
                ironically, man has only learned these lessons in the past couple hundred 
                years.  You've got to be kidding me!  Don't tell me that it took 
                mankind BILLIONS of years to learn to wash his hands to prevent disease!  
                The truth is that mankind has taken baby-steps since 4,000 B.C., and it did 
                take him nearly 6,000 years to learn to wash his hands.  This is just 
                another undeniable PROOF that evolution is a lie.  If mankind had evolved 
                over millions of years, then men would have discovered these inventions a very 
                long time ago. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The truth is that evolutionists are 
              	hardhearted against the truth of God's Word.  The Word of God declares that God 
                created the world at approximately 4,000 B.C.—YOU'D BE A FOOL NOT TO BELIEVE 
                IT, BECAUSE THERE'S NO HISTORY PRIOR TO 4,000 B.C.  As incredible as this 
                fact is, it is undeniable proof against evolution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><em>       </em><em>R</em>ecently, a thought captivated my mind that proves that the theory of 
                evolution is a big hoax.  The thought is simple and yet profound ... why 
                is there no recorded history before approximately 4,000 B.C.?  The answer 
                is obvious ... there was no history!  Think about it!  Evolutionists 
                claim that man evolved over billions of years (that's billions with a "B").  
                If there were any truth to these false claims by unscrupulous scientists, then 
                man's historical record should span back at least hundreds-of-thousands of 
                years, if not millions.  There is no record of a cataclysmic event that 
                destroyed mankind prior to 4,000 B.C.  And if there were, surely some of 
                the survivors would have passed this information down to generations to 
                follow.  The Bible dates creation, as we know it today, at approximately 
                4,000 B.C.  Thus, it was approximately 6,000 years ago that God, Jesus 
                Christ, created the heavens and the earth in 6-days.  It was 6,000 years 
                ago that Jesus Christ spoke the stars into existence.  It was 6,000 years 
                ago that Jesus spoke animals, fish, plants, and land into existence.  And 
                it was 6,000 years ago that God formed man out of the dust of the earth.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Such Biblical claims seem absurd to 
                modern evolutionists, who have convinced themselves that the earth is billions 
                of years old.  Ironically, they have absolutely NO EVIDENCE of such 
                longevity.  Evolutionists have sought out dishonest scientists, who 
                distort the facts, use faulty testing methods, and make erroneous assumptions 
                (unethically stating such assumptions as if they were facts).  Evolution 
                is at best still a THEORY.  Yet, children are brainwashed in godless 
                public schools all across the world, with evolution, which is taught as if it 
                were a fact.  This is evil.  It is evil to deny students the 
                Biblical account of creationism.  The Word of God makes infinite more sense than the 
                fairytale of evolution.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">One of the simplest and best proofs 
                that evolution is a joke, is the FACT that there is NO recorded history prior 
                to 4,000 B.C.  The world's history is CLEARY defined by SIX world powers 
                since time began: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome.  
                Since Rome's fall in 476 A.D., there have been no world-powers (many 
                super-powers; but, no world-powers).  At the time of Moses, Egypt ruled 
                the world.  The Israelites were used as slave labor by Pharaoh to build 
                the pyramids.  Before Egypt, there is absolutely nothing recorded in 
                history about a world-power.  It is NO coincidence that Revelation 17:10 
                speaks of these world-powers, "<em>...five are fallen, and one is, and the 
                other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</em>"  
                At the writing of Revelation, Rome was still a world-power.  The Apostle 
                John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, tells us that Rome is the 6th 
                world-power, and there is one more to come.  The 7th world-power will be 
                the beast system, the kingdom of the antichrist.  This diabolical <em>New 
                World Order </em>is quickly forming now (i.e., a universal religious view, 
                global centralized government, a one-world economic system, a cashless 
                society, etc.). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Do you think it's a mere coincidence 
                that the Word of God is so concise on world history?  The Bible records 
                the beginning of mankind at about 4,000 B.C., and secular history is eerily 
                silent before 4,000 B.C. for those who claim to believe in evolution.  If 
                I were an evolutionist, I would be extremely disturbed by this FACT.  
                Prove me wrong!  I dare you.  I triple-dog dare you to show me any 
                recorded civilization before 4,000 B.C.  And I don't mean some pottery 
                jug or item that you claim is 14,000 years old--Show me any evidence of 
                civilization prior to 4,000 B.C.  You cannot.  In fact, it is 
                difficult to find much recorded history before 2,500 B.C., because the flood 
                of Noah's day destroyed most of it.  How can evolutionists be so naive 
                and foolish as to totally ignore this incredibly obvious fact?  There is 
                NO recorded history prior to 4,000 B.C.--no writings, no carved stones, no 
                battles, no wars, no countries, no nothing!  It's as if mankind just 
                suddenly began (which is exactly what the Bible teaches happened).  God 
                created man out of the dirt, the elements, of the earth.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">There were no humans before 
                approximately 4,000 B.C.  Hard to imagine?  Why should it be?  
                There is no history to indicate that humans existed prior to 4,000 B.C.  
                This fact is irrefutable.  Oh sure, some stubborn evolutionists are going 
                to start talking about carbon-dating, archeological findings, etc.  BUT, 
                the bottom line is that the history of mankind should be traceable far beyond 
                4,000 B.C., going back million of years IF evolution were true. <br>

              <p>Besides, you are a buddhist right? Do you know that much of Buddha's original teachings are already gone? They are just passed down like that, with extras added to it. So it's not original. And so you believe in something that is not original and yet you claim it to be? And then , you say christians are stupid and arrogant. But look how ironic your words are. You fit the perfect description of what God calls a fool. Who says the bible does not describe God, when it is the word of God? The bible didn't come from man, it came from God.

              <p>The erroneous beliefs of Buddhism vary greatly from country to 
                            country, because over the past 2500 years, this religion has mingled 
                            with the various local religions, customs, and established cultures 
                            of countries into which it has spread. Today, the varieties of Buddhism 
                            practiced in Japan, China, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and America 
                            are all quite different from one another.</p>

              As historical sources show, Buddha always chose to speak about his 
                          basic tenets and deliver his way of worship orally; centuries of research 
                          has determined that he left behind no written texts. Buddhists maintain 
                          that his sermons were passed down orally from generation to generation 
                          for 400 years, until they were finally compiled in the Pali canon. 
                          However, most scholars believe that the great majority of these words 
                          are not Buddha's at all, but were added to in the course of centuries 
                          until they attained their present form. Therefore Buddhism, not relying 
                          on any written texts, underwent many changes and distortions over 
                          the course of time, being considerably reshaped by additions and omissions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddhist philosophy denies the existence of God, but bases itself 
                          on a few aspects of human morality and on escaping from sufferings 
                          of this world. Without any intellectual or scientific support, it 
                          rests upon the twin concepts of karma and reincarnation-the idea that 
                          human beings are continually reborn into this world, that their subsequent 
                          lives are shaped by their behavior in their previous ones. No Buddhist 
                          scripture considers the existence of a Creator, much less how the 
                          universe, the world and living things came to be. No Buddhist text 
                          describes how the universe was created from nothing; or how living 
                          things came into being; or how to explain the evidence, to be seen 
                          everywhere in this world, of an incomparable creation. According to 
                          the Buddhist deception, it is not even necessary to think about these 
                          things! The only important thing in life, Buddhist texts claim, is 
                          suppressing desires, revering Buddha, and escaping from suffering.</p>
              <p>As a religion, therefore, Buddhism suffers from a very narrow vision 
                            that keeps its believers from considering such basic questions as 
                            where they came from, or how the universe and all living things 
                            came to be. Indeed, it deters them from even thinking about these 
                            things and presses them into the narrow mold of their present earthly 
                            life.</p>

              <p>Buddhism enslaves its devotees in misty monasteries and forces 
                            them into a life of suffering and poverty. Strangely, it discourages 
                            good food, cleanliness, comfort-the blessings that God has created 
                            for human beings-accepts suffering as a virtue and advises its devotees 
                            to lead a miserable life.</p>
              <p>For Buddhist monks and nuns, life is full of all kinds of difficulties. 
                            They are forbidden to work or own property, obliged to feed themselves 
                            by going from door to door and begging among the people, with their 
                            bowls in their hands. For this reason, Buddhist priests are even 
                            called <em>bhikkhus</em> (beggars) by the people. Buddhist priests 
                            are forbidden to marry or have any kind of family life; they may 
                            own only one robe, which must be of poor quality yellow or red cloth.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>And so you say Christians are narrow-minded, stupid and idiotic. Now look which religion actually contributes more to the suffering of people. FOOL.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Larryteo:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>And why do you believe in the theory of evolution which is only a theory but not proven? Because it is publicised as a fact even when it is not? What proof do you have to say there is no proof of God's existence? Don't you know archeology verifies much of the bible? The number of findings that verify the bible are more than the findings which verify evolution. Oh yeah, evolution cannot be verified anyway. So you say the bible is rubbish. I say what you say is even more of rubbish, and also SHIT. Why? Because you believe that one day your TV will suddenly become alive and grow it's own wings.  Have you even read the book Origin of the species? If not how do you know evolution is true? Have you read the bible either? If not how do you know it's false? If you are going to spread your propaganda here, go spread it in the atheist forums.</p>
              <p>After this, you will say then why is it that evolution is so supported by many. But you do not look what happened backstage in those museums which display dinosaur bones. Do you know most of the so called ''half man and monkey'' displays there are fake? The evolutionists only find one bone in the sand, and then they assume it is a body part of a prehistoric human, and the displays are actually part of their imagination to cover up the missing links. When you ask an evolutionist ''can we observe evolution these days?'' they will say yes, and use macro-evolution as a factor. But no, macro-evolution is not evolution, it is just an animal's body adaptation towards some disease. We don't see that the animal cross-breed from a cat to a dog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that again, the evolutionist will argue that our genes are 98% similar to chimps. But humans share 50% of their genes with bananas. So humans are half banana? Then they will ask why is it we look like monkeys. But a snake looks like a worm. So snakes are from worms too? <strong>ABSURD.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Thus, with the way evolutionists fail to proof evolution, I deduce evolution is false, for evolution is not observable, and not proven either.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">IF, as evolutionists claim, the earth is billions of years old, and mankind has evolved from a lower and simpler form of life, then why has mankind gone from writing upon stones to laser printers in just the past 3,500 years?  When God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, they were written upon stone.  It is abundantly clear that the Egyptians carved messages into stone (hieroglyphics).  So why is it that mankind has only discovered better inventions in the past few thousand years?  If mankind had evolved, as evolutionists claim, then why didn't man discover ink a million years ago?  Think about it.  This is an astonishing thought--There were NO planes, cars, computers, refrigerators, electricity, lights, gas, powered-equipment, telephones, recording devices, CD players, MP3 players, electric razors, televisions, record players, movie cameras, or a million other modern technological inventions--just a mere 170 years ago.  Civilization has advanced from utter primitiveness to incredible mind-boggling achievements in just a little over 100 years.  So why didn't mankind discover any of this stuff 100,000,000 years ago, or 100,000 years ago for that matter?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Look at the ignorance of doctors over the past few centuries.  Sanitary practices, such as washing hands, were laughed at by doctors, while thousands of patients continued to die.  It was unimaginable to doctors back then, that washing one's hands somehow was related to a patient's health in the operating room.  Can you believe that?  Evolutionists today are just as ignorant of the truth of God's Word, and of common sense itself.  It's hard to imagine that millions of people were dying from a simple lack of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) just a couple hundred years ago.  If evolution is true, then it took man billions of years to learn all these kindergarten lessons.  And ironically, man has only learned these lessons in the past couple hundred years.  You've got to be kidding me!  Don't tell me that it took mankind BILLIONS of years to learn to wash his hands to prevent disease!  The truth is that mankind has taken baby-steps since 4,000 B.C., and it did take him nearly 6,000 years to learn to wash his hands.  This is just another undeniable PROOF that evolution is a lie.  If mankind had evolved over millions of years, then men would have discovered these inventions a very long time ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The truth is that evolutionists are hardhearted against the truth of God's Word.  The Word of God declares that God created the world at approximately 4,000 B.C.—YOU'D BE A FOOL NOT TO BELIEVE IT, BECAUSE THERE'S NO HISTORY PRIOR TO 4,000 B.C.  As incredible as this fact is, it is undeniable proof against evolution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><em>      </em> <em>R</em>ecently, a thought captivated my mind that proves that the theory of evolution is a big hoax.  The thought is simple and yet profound ... why is there no recorded history before approximately 4,000 B.C.?  The answer is obvious ... there was no history!  Think about it!  Evolutionists claim that man evolved over billions of years (that's billions with a "B").  If there were any truth to these false claims by unscrupulous scientists, then man's historical record should span back at least hundreds-of-thousands of years, if not millions.  There is no record of a cataclysmic event that destroyed mankind prior to 4,000 B.C.  And if there were, surely some of the survivors would have passed this information down to generations to follow.  The Bible dates creation, as we know it today, at approximately 4,000 B.C.  Thus, it was approximately 6,000 years ago that God, Jesus Christ, created the heavens and the earth in 6-days.  It was 6,000 years ago that Jesus Christ spoke the stars into existence.  It was 6,000 years ago that Jesus spoke animals, fish, plants, and land into existence.  And it was 6,000 years ago that God formed man out of the dust of the earth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Such Biblical claims seem absurd to modern evolutionists, who have convinced themselves that the earth is billions of years old.  Ironically, they have absolutely NO EVIDENCE of such longevity.  Evolutionists have sought out dishonest scientists, who distort the facts, use faulty testing methods, and make erroneous assumptions (unethically stating such assumptions as if they were facts).  Evolution is at best still a THEORY.  Yet, children are brainwashed in godless public schools all across the world, with evolution, which is taught as if it were a fact.  This is evil.  It is evil to deny students the Biblical account of creationism.  The Word of God makes infinite more sense than the fairytale of evolution. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">One of the simplest and best proofs that evolution is a joke, is the FACT that there is NO recorded history prior to 4,000 B.C.  The world's history is CLEARY defined by SIX world powers since time began: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome.  Since Rome's fall in 476 A.D., there have been no world-powers (many super-powers; but, no world-powers).  At the time of Moses, Egypt ruled the world.  The Israelites were used as slave labor by Pharaoh to build the pyramids.  Before Egypt, there is absolutely nothing recorded in history about a world-power.  It is NO coincidence that Revelation 17:10 speaks of these world-powers, "<em>...five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</em>"  At the writing of Revelation, Rome was still a world-power.  The Apostle John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, tells us that Rome is the 6th world-power, and there is one more to come.  The 7th world-power will be the beast system, the kingdom of the antichrist.  This diabolical <em>New World Order</em> is quickly forming now (i.e., a universal religious view, global centralized government, a one-world economic system, a cashless society, etc.).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Do you think it's a mere coincidence that the Word of God is so concise on world history?  The Bible records the beginning of mankind at about 4,000 B.C., and secular history is eerily silent before 4,000 B.C. for those who claim to believe in evolution.  If I were an evolutionist, I would be extremely disturbed by this FACT.  Prove me wrong!  I dare you.  I triple-dog dare you to show me any recorded civilization before 4,000 B.C.  And I don't mean some pottery jug or item that you claim is 14,000 years old--Show me any evidence of civilization prior to 4,000 B.C.  You cannot.  In fact, it is difficult to find much recorded history before 2,500 B.C., because the flood of Noah's day destroyed most of it.  How can evolutionists be so naive and foolish as to totally ignore this incredibly obvious fact?  There is NO recorded history prior to 4,000 B.C.--no writings, no carved stones, no battles, no wars, no countries, no nothing!  It's as if mankind just suddenly began (which is exactly what the Bible teaches happened).  God created man out of the dirt, the elements, of the earth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">There were no humans before approximately 4,000 B.C.  Hard to imagine?  Why should it be?  There is no history to indicate that humans existed prior to 4,000 B.C.  This fact is irrefutable.  Oh sure, some stubborn evolutionists are going to start talking about carbon-dating, archeological findings, etc.  BUT, the bottom line is that the history of mankind should be traceable far beyond 4,000 B.C., going back million of years IF evolution were true. <br> <br></span></p>

              <p>LoL, just because someone mentioned stupidity, you have to mention what he said is shit.</p>
              <p>Just because evolution is a theory doesnt mean creation is true. Seriously, if you are talking about the bible is true, then the same applies to similar writings such as Kuran.</p>
              <p>Technically, carbon dating is suspect as it is a theoretically assumption that radioactivity of C-14 decays at the same rate as present time.</p>
              <p>Seriously, just because no recorded history means no human existed prior to 4,000 BC is seriously flawed. This is an assumption.</p>

              <p><br>It is just a spiritual acceptance, Larry. Accepting that the world was created by creator will bring the same question, who created the creator. If creator can be omnipresent then universe can be too.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it is just perspective. I usually stand on the side where, unless proven true, I have the right to disbelieve in both.</p>
