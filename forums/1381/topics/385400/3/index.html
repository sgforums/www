              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Religion also deals with experience, for example what the Buddha
              taught are not theories but his own experience and further more he
              taught How anyone can come to his own conclusion by experience.
              Most often the case however, an originally great contemplative
              tradition over times becomes corrupted by people and politics into
              dogmas and blind following.</p>
              <p>The Buddha clearly explained how he does not teach based on
              theories and beliefs:</p>
              <p><em>The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One
              has understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes
              away. He has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and
              passes away. He has understood what perception is, and how it
              arises, and passes away. He has understood what the mental
              formations are, and how they arise, and pass away. He has
              understood what consciousness is, and how it arises, and passes
              away.<br> <br> Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won complete deliverance
              through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection, and
              getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of all inclination to
              the vainglory of I and mine.</em> <em><br> <br> - Majjhima Nikaya, 72</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, <em>even HH the</em> Dalai Lama himself has said “<em>If
              science</em> proves some belief of <em>Buddhism</em> wrong, then
              <em>Buddhism</em> will have to change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do agree with your statement:</p>
              <p><strong>All you can say is: "My experience with god is
              this and that..." and never "God is this and God is
              that".</strong></p>

              <p><strong>For me it is, "If you cannot prove it, then forget it. Conjecture and speculations will not do."</strong></p>

              <div class="quote_body" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8em; clear: left; padding: 0px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Agree with you partially but not totally. Some of the things said in the scriptures are scientifically proven and some are yet to be proven. Just 3 examples below :</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">1) Buddha once held up a cup of water and remarked that there were 84,000 (a number to denote "many" or "countless") beings in it. No one understand what He meant. Today, we use a microscope and see that He referred to invisible microorganisms.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2) Buddha described worlds beyond ours in the vastness of outer space and other dimensions which are inhabited by many other intelligent sentiment life forms, many of which are unlike ours. Aliens existence are yet to be proven.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">3) Buddhism believes in indestructibility or preservation of energy. This is in line with the law of conservation  of energy, which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be transformed from one form to another. The teaching of rebirth, is an example of  transfer of imperishable Mind or mental energy from  one body into another. It is yet to be proven but some scientists are looking into this issue.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><br></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">1) If Buddha said 84,000 but we know it is in the millions. Furthermore, it is conjecture on people's part that he meant germs and other microbes. This kind of stuff, conjecture like that, is not acceptable. It is open to interpretation. You cannot afford to be vague like that. You have to be precise. </strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">2) Again, you have no basis to say that he meant alien life forms like evolved life on earth. he could very well be describing "gods" and "demons". At best it is conjecture on people's part what he meant. Again not acceptable.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">3)The cutting edge theoretical physics now considers, with mathematical proofs, calculations and observations that the total amount of energy (the sum of the positive energy and the negative energy) in the universe is zero. That is to say, energy appears from nothingness.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Since energy and therefore mass can appear from nothing, it is possible that this universe is not the only one. The conditions of this universe, however support</strong><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">s life as we know it, on earth.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Cutting edge theoretical physics show that there is no need for Gods, Buddhas or the super-natural forces to explain the existence of the universe.</strong></p>

              <p>I am not trying to be funny but trying to relate human beings to science.</p>
              <p>Question : If God created Adam and Eve, human beings were multiplied from there, does it mean Adam's and Eve's children had relationship and reproduced ? Or else how human beings multiply with just Adam and Eve.</p>
              <p>Answer from my relative who is a christian : Yes, but God forbids somewhere along the line because He found that it was not right.</p>
              <p>My question : No matter when He forbids, He could not change the fact that we are the decendants of incest. If we are from the same ancestors, how come today there are so many races. After more than 2000 years, we chinese still look very chinese in appearance (disregard the inter-marriage).Scientifically, children from parents who have close genes are mainly abnormal but majority of us are normal.</p>

              <p>I feel sad when people keep quoting supernatural stuffu to mean empirical matter, despite myself often use "GOD THROWING APPLE DOWN ON NEWTON'S HEAD" as a thinking statement for the confused students.</p>
              <p>People need to stop relying on single teachers, we need to strive to be capable persons, searching for individual values in different teachings be it christianity, buddhism or even science. By taking analogical information 'wholesale' you risk taking  irrelevant values that may not help you in this day and age.</p>
              <p>I have met faithful people religious people who knows that not of what they learn are true, especially when they understand that such teachings (i.e. Bible) are written by a group of real people, and they know there may be different interpretations of each.</p>
              <p>It is just perpectivism, my principle is that everything (anything I've understood) is valid, until proven wrong. Iterative cycles of mental evaluation of reality also help me to define what is (my) reality, what is literature, and what is fiction.</p>
              <p>PEOPLE, PLEASE WAKE UP. Do your own research into your own religion and stop relying on what religion tells you. If you want to look capable to your peers, you must UNDERSTAND what god tries to teach you, not merely DESCRIBING what you have been innoculated.</p>

              <p>The concept of divinity is flawed because you are using something u think u know to explain something u dont know. Even if it is flawed , the proven is not fully proven.  Even it, has inconsistencies and paradoxes. So what are you on about ? We not even stopped at our discovery. The whole idea of science, is to find explainations. And the explainations we recieve just begs MORE questions. Dont u see that it will all come back to the same question.. How Did It Happen?</p>
