                  even the Muslims or at least their prophet since so much of the

              <p>Proof of existence of God is everywhere. But u already refuse to see it. Even with the scientific explainations u will continue to disbelieve. Because thats you. Ur heart is rock solid with cynicsm and skepticsm. You wont believe in Bill Gates if u dont want to believe even with all the evidence around you. You will only believe once u yourself want to open urself up to give the possibility, like u said, that 10% possibility that its wrong/right . U yourself answered that in previous posts and dont u see it ?</p>
              <p>Replicating miracles is one thing, replication of the ressurection is also another thing.</p>
              <p>If u really want me to go down to replicating of miracles, sure, there are some miracles that CAN be replicated, or theoretically through quantum physics. And it is not long before we fully understand down the subatomic levels.. and things will continue to get smaller. IF u know what quantumn physics is about, if not, i give u the low down on it.</p>
              <p>Faith makes us believe in the Miracles of the Bible, when we are "scientific" scripture scholars, we will not.</p>
              <p>Quantumn physics definately supports the idea of miracles happening. In the world o science, using quantumn physics , miracles happen "scientifically" and that is at a subatomic level all of material reality is supported not by atoms, but tubatmoic particles, one of wich is the quanta. The quanta particle is a chameleon, meaning that it changes in valence and function of a quanta particle. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literally mind over matter.</span></p>
              <p>THe double slit experiment of quantumn physics shows a dispersion pattern that is impossible given ordinary newtownian physics assumptions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Morever, Bell's Theorem proves non-local communcation at a distance between  atoms, thus making the idea of "psychic channeling" scienfitically possible. Additionally, if non-local communication is possible, and if subatomic particles ca change subatmoic particles non-locally at a distance, meaning a prayer can change subatomic particles non-locally at a distance, then it is certainly possible that atoms and molecules, and even cells, which are ultimately composes of subatomic particles could also change.</span></p>
              <p>So when we talk about virgin birth scientifically possible, as well as moving large amounts of water, and healing the blind and the lame. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THe foregoing is confirmed by the face that modern scientific prayer studies show that prayer provides a statistically significant diference in the healing of heart attack patients, quantumn particles, called quanta and the Quantum Field that they compose, can change matter physically. Underlygint material physical reality is not atmoic separateness, but instead the Quantum Ield masking itself as various subatomic particles. Thus, Miracles are not scientifically possible, but probable. </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not only are the modern "scientific" miracles of the microwave oven, the television, the computer, the gameboy, the playstation , the dvd player made possible with Quantumn Physics, so too are the "scientific" miracles of the virgin birth of Jesus.</span></p>
              <p>I dont know if u are getting all this or not, but i am just here to properly logically and with reason and science, point to you the questions that we pose in a scientific point of view that not only helped us solve and answer all your answers you so now take for granted as, " scientific proof" , it also makes us wonder and always question the very nature of the biblical miracles and finding the answers for those can find answers for our future technological advances or the other way round.</p>
              <p>You have always spoken with much skepticism, and cynicsm, but only as much optimism about your economical predictions. You feel so empowered by your correctness of your statistical datas your garnered and your experience through your years in the field. However you do not seem to put forth as much learned comprehension and understanding as you do here like u did in speakers corner. And i am a bit disappointed. I do not believe that you are 100% sure about exactly how the economic will go, you have a high possibility of it happening with data's and current trends and your expeirence in the market or perhaps a degree in economics for that matter. Thats about it. I can predict it with a 20% probability, but it takes as much FAITH as you did for you to be right. Unless you are also in ur "delusion" , you could hardly discount the fact that you are not 100% sure.Its like how duty cannot exist without faith. Something which maybe you know or dont, but surely u will deny when it comes to God and the bible.</p>
              <p>Oh btw.. Santa Claus ? Now that is something i do not believe.</p>
              <p>CSI and Conan the Barbarian. Both got the job done in the right ?</p>
              <p>But sometimes, a lil faith... can go a long way. Thats why the difference between me and  u will most probably be that u will die in a desert scenario, while i may survive a couple hundred yards more, or even miraclelously survive with my faith and scientific knowledge of my physiology and its limits.</p>
              <p>Anyways, Happy New Year. I wont be around for the week. I be partying
                  and having as much faith that the world wont blow in up in my face
                  after the new year.</p>
              <p>And one more thing, i dont curse, because we are told in the bible and morally that we dont go around cursing people, while u do, that just tells alot about a person u know. N dont tell me its not wrong to curse, or its o.k to curse someone You will definately not want ur kids to curse another or want me to curse you, but on the other hand, you can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Besides, you are a buddhist right? Do you know that much of Buddha's original teachings are already gone? They are just passed down like that, with extras added to it. So it's not original. And so you believe in something that is not original and yet you claim it to be? And then , you say christians are stupid and arrogant. But look how ironic your words are. You fit the perfect description of what God calls a fool. Who says the bible does not describe God, when it is the word of God? The bible didn't come from man, it came from God. It is God's manifestation through man's handwriting.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>The erroneous beliefs of Buddhism vary greatly from country to country, because over the past 2500 years, this religion has mingled with the various local religions, customs, and established cultures of countries into which it has spread. Today, the varieties of Buddhism practiced in Japan, China, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and America are all quite different from one another.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.islamandbuddhism.com/images_buddhism/pictur123.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192"><br><span>In Tibet, the dissemination of Buddhist texts is one of the most important acts of worship. In particular, priests who have removed themselves from the world completely give themselves solely to this work. With no idea of the true nature of the afterlife, these people live out their worldly lives in vain pursuits.</span></p>
              <p>As historical sources show, Buddha always chose to speak about his basic tenets and deliver his way of worship orally; centuries of research has determined that he left behind no written texts. Buddhists maintain that his sermons were passed down orally from generation to generation for 400 years, until they were finally compiled in the Pali canon. However, most scholars believe that the great majority of these words are not Buddha's at all, but were added to in the course of centuries until they attained their present form. Therefore Buddhism, not relying on any written texts, underwent many changes and distortions over the course of time, being considerably reshaped by additions and omissions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddhist philosophy denies the existence of God, but bases itself on a few aspects of human morality and on escaping from sufferings of this world. Without any intellectual or scientific support, it rests upon the twin concepts of karma and reincarnation-the idea that human beings are continually reborn into this world, that their subsequent lives are shaped by their behavior in their previous ones. No Buddhist scripture considers the existence of a Creator, much less how the universe, the world and living things came to be. No Buddhist text describes how the universe was created from nothing; or how living things came into being; or how to explain the evidence, to be seen everywhere in this world, of an incomparable creation. According to the Buddhist deception, it is not even necessary to think about these things! The only important thing in life, Buddhist texts claim, is suppressing desires, revering Buddha, and escaping from suffering.</p>
              <p>As a religion, therefore, Buddhism suffers from a very narrow vision that keeps its believers from considering such basic questions as where they came from, or how the universe and all living things came to be. Indeed, it deters them from even thinking about these things and presses them into the narrow mold of their present earthly life.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Since you attacked my religion, I will also attack yours.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Buddhism enslaves its devotees in misty monasteries and forces them into a life of suffering and poverty. Strangely, it discourages good food, cleanliness, comfort-the blessings that God has created for human beings-accepts suffering as a virtue and advises its devotees to lead a miserable life.</p>
              <p>For Buddhist monks and nuns, life is full of all kinds of difficulties. They are forbidden to work or own property, obliged to feed themselves by going from door to door and begging among the people, with their bowls in their hands. For this reason, Buddhist priests are even called <em>bhikkhus</em> (beggars) by the people. Buddhist priests are forbidden to marry or have any kind of family life; they may own only one robe, which must be of poor quality yellow or red cloth.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>And so you say Christians are narrow-minded, stupid and idiotic. Now look which religion actually contributes more to the suffering of people. FOOL.</p>

              <p>what a load of rubbish, nonsense. let me do the comparison here.</p>
              <p>to go to heaven in your religion, accept Jesus and when you die, you will go to heaven, otherwise eternal hell for you.

              <p>in the history of mankind, no other religion advocate the efforts of human beings obtaining their own salvation more than Buddhism. I would say 99% of the religions in the world all have the concept of god and salvation is thru that divine being ie promises of heaven and some even promises of virgins and nymphs. Buddhism did not say only buddhists will attain enlightenment and not other religions.</p>
              <p>regarding about karma, it means actions and intentions and is not some concept belonging to Buddhism. if you do not believe in karma or rebirth, so be it, you wont go to hell if you dun believe it. in this sense, which are the more tolerant? even the Buddha admonished his followers not to believe his teachings and follow blindly, or out of respect for the teacher or tradition/custom, but to test and try it out onself. so who is the more dogma here? another comparison is there is no soul in Buddhism, but I would not discuss this. most of the religions all believe in a soul, but not buddhism. finally Buddha is a human being who achieved enlightenment and did not claim to be a divine being or the world and universe is created by him. then there are causes and effect and dependent origination, just to add on. the concept are a welcome change from the concept of world of god, satan, soul, heaven and hell.</p>

              <p>Proof of existence of God is everywhere. But u already refuse to see it. Even with the scientific explainations u will continue to disbelieve. Because thats you. Ur heart is rock solid with cynicsm and skepticsm. You wont believe in Bill Gates if u dont want to believe even with all the evidence around you. You will only believe once u yourself want to open urself up to give the possibility, like u said, that 10% possibility that its wrong/right . U yourself answered that in previous posts and dont u see it ?</p>
              <p>Replicating miracles is one thing, replication of the ressurection is also another thing.</p>
              <p>If u really want me to go down to replicating of miracles, sure, there are some miracles that CAN be replicated, or theoretically through quantum physics. And it is not long before we fully understand down the subatomic levels.. and things will continue to get smaller. IF u know what quantumn physics is about, if not, i give u the low down on it.</p>
              <p>Faith makes us believe in the Miracles of the Bible, when we are "scientific" scripture scholars, we will not.</p>
              <p>Quantumn physics definately supports the idea of miracles happening. In the world o science, using quantumn physics , miracles happen "scientifically" and that is at a subatomic level all of material reality is supported not by atoms, but tubatmoic particles, one of wich is the quanta. The quanta particle is a chameleon, meaning that it changes in valence and function of a quanta particle. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literally mind over matter.</span></p>
              <p>THe double slit experiment of quantumn physics shows a dispersion pattern that is impossible given ordinary newtownian physics assumptions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Morever, Bell's Theorem proves non-local communcation at a distance between  atoms, thus making the idea of "psychic channeling" scienfitically possible. Additionally, if non-local communication is possible, and if subatomic particles ca change subatmoic particles non-locally at a distance, meaning a prayer can change subatomic particles non-locally at a distance, then it is certainly possible that atoms and molecules, and even cells, which are ultimately composes of subatomic particles could also change.</span></p>
              <p>So when we talk about virgin birth scientifically possible, as well as moving large amounts of water, and healing the blind and the lame. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THe foregoing is confirmed by the face that modern scientific prayer studies show that prayer provides a statistically significant diference in the healing of heart attack patients, quantumn particles, called quanta and the Quantum Field that they compose, can change matter physically. Underlygint material physical reality is not atmoic separateness, but instead the Quantum Ield masking itself as various subatomic particles. Thus, Miracles are not scientifically possible, but probable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not only are the modern "scientific" miracles of the microwave oven, the television, the computer, the gameboy, the playstation , the dvd player made possible with Quantumn Physics, so too are the "scientific" miracles of the virgin birth of Jesus.</span></p>
              <p>I dont know if u are getting all this or not, but i am just here to properly logically and with reason and science, point to you the questions that we pose in a scientific point of view that not only helped us solve and answer all your answers you so now take for granted as, " scientific proof" , it also makes us wonder and always question the very nature of the biblical miracles and finding the answers for those can find answers for our future technological advances or the other way round.</p>
              <p>You have always spoken with much skepticism, and cynicsm, but only as much optimism about your economical predictions. You feel so empowered by your correctness of your statistical datas your garnered and your experience through your years in the field. However you do not seem to put forth as much learned comprehension and understanding as you do here like u did in speakers corner. And i am a bit disappointed. I do not believe that you are 100% sure about exactly how the economic will go, you have a high possibility of it happening with data's and current trends and your expeirence in the market or perhaps a degree in economics for that matter. Thats about it. I can predict it with a 20% probability, but it takes as much FAITH as you did for you to be right. Unless you are also in ur "delusion" , you could hardly discount the fact that you are not 100% sure.Its like how duty cannot exist without faith. Something which maybe you know or dont, but surely u will deny when it comes to God and the bible.</p>
              <p>Oh btw.. Santa Claus ? Now that is something i do not believe.</p>
              <p>CSI and Conan the Barbarian. Both got the job done in the right ?</p>
              <p>But sometimes, a lil faith... can go a long way. Thats why the difference between me and  u will most probably be that u will die in a desert scenario, while i may survive a couple hundred yards more, or even miraclelously survive with my faith and scientific knowledge of my physiology and its limits.</p>
              <p>Anyways, Happy New Year. I wont be around for the week. I be partying and having as much faith that the world wont blow in up in my face after the new year.</p>
              <p>And one more thing, i dont curse, because we are told in the bible and morally that we dont go around cursing people, while u do, that just tells alot about a person u know. N dont tell me its not wrong to curse, or its o.k to curse someone You will definately not want ur kids to curse another or want me to curse you, but on the other hand, you can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I beg to differ from your statement that proof of god is everywhere. the second statement you chose not to see it, sad to say, sorely mistaken. depending on who you ask, if you ask god followers, they will say without doubt god exists. if you ask free thinkers, athiest, agnotists, they will tell you god is a concept invented by men.</p>

              <p>You are not even god-like... maybe once you attain god-like, just maybe u can start to actually question. You dont understand man's stupidity. All its going to take is a Dengue mosquito to take you down and humble you.</p>
              <p>Ur question itself already shows ur limitation of figuring out things. Man can create things they cant lift.. but they can create things to lift it. If u cant even understand THAT.. i truly and ultimately rest my case with you right now.</p>

              <p>what a load of rubbish, nonsense. let me do the comparison
              here.</p>
              <p>to go to heaven in your religion, accept Jesus and when you die,
              you will go to heaven, otherwise eternal hell for you. If this is
              not fear mongering or fear inducing, I dunno what is. even people
              like osama bin laden, for all his evils and extremism, will go to
              heaven if he accepts Jesus. to me, thats just a cheap ticket to
              heaven.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in the history of mankind, no other religion advocate the
              efforts of human beings obtaining their own salvation more
              than Buddhism. I would say 99% of the religions in the
              world all have the concept of god and salvation is thru that divine
              being ie promises of heaven and some even promises of virgins and
              nymphs. Buddhism did not say only buddhists will attain
              enlightenment and not other religions.</p>
              <p>regarding about karma, it means actions and intentions and is
              not some concept belonging to Buddhism. if you do not believe
              in karma or rebirth, so be it, you wont go to hell if you dun
              believe it. in this sense, which are the more tolerant? even the
              Buddha admonished his followers not to believe his teachings and
              follow blindly, or out of respect for the teacher or
              tradition/custom, but to test and try it out onself. so who is the
              more dogma here? another comparison is there is no soul in
              Buddhism, but I would not discuss this. most of the religions all
              believe in a soul, but not buddhism. finally Buddha is a human
              being who achieved enlightenment and did not claim to be a
              divine being or the world and universe is created by him. then
              there are causes and effect and dependent origination, just to add
              on. the concept are a welcome change from the concept of world
              of god, satan, soul, heaven and hell.</p>

              <p>Buddhism teaches that there are five (sometimes six) realms of rebirth,

              <p>And why do you believe in the theory of evolution which is only
              a theory but not proven? Because it is publicised as a fact even
              when it is not? What proof do you have to say there is no proof of
              God's existence? Don't you know archeology verifies much of the
              bible? The number of findings that verify the bible are more than
              the findings which verify evolution. Oh yeah, evolution cannot be
              verified anyway. So you say the bible is rubbish. I say what you
              say is even more of rubbish, and also SHIT. Why? Because you
              believe that one day your TV will suddenly become alive and grow
              it's own wings.  Have you even read the book Origin of the
              species? If not how do you know evolution is true? Have you read
              the bible either? If not how do you know it's false? If you are
              going to spread your propaganda here, go spread it in the atheist
              forums.</p>
              <p>After this, you will say then why is it that evolution is so
              supported by many. But you do not look what happened backstage in
              those museums which display dinosaur bones. Do you know most of the
              so called ''half man and monkey'' displays there are fake? The
              evolutionists only find one bone in the sand, and then they assume
              it is a body part of a prehistoric human, and the displays are
              actually part of their imagination to cover up the missing links.
              When you ask an evolutionist ''can we observe evolution these
              days?'' they will say yes, and use macro-evolution as a factor. But
              no, macro-evolution is not evolution, it is just an animal's body
              adaptation towards some disease. We don't see that the animal
              cross-breed from a cat to a dog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that again, the evolutionist will argue that our genes are
              98% similar to chimps. But humans share 50% of their genes with
              bananas. So humans are half banana? Then they will ask why is it we
              look like monkeys. But a snake looks like a worm. So snakes are
              from worms too? <strong>ABSURD.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Thus, with the way evolutionists fail to proof
              evolution, I deduce evolution is false, for evolution is not
              observable, and not proven either.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">IF, as evolutionists
              claim, the earth is billions of years old, and mankind has evolved
              from a lower and simpler form of life, then why has mankind gone
              from writing upon stones to laser printers in just the past 3,500
              years?  When God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, they were
              written upon stone.  It is abundantly clear that the Egyptians
              carved messages into stone (hieroglyphics).  So why is it that
              mankind has only discovered better inventions in the past few
              thousand years?  If mankind had evolved, as evolutionists
              claim, then why didn't man discover ink a million years ago? 
              Think about it.  This is an astonishing thought--There were NO
              planes, cars, computers, refrigerators, electricity, lights, gas,
              powered-equipment, telephones, recording devices, CD players, MP3
              players, electric razors, televisions, record players, movie
              cameras, or a million other modern technological inventions--just a
              mere 170 years ago.  Civilization has advanced from utter
              primitiveness to incredible mind-boggling achievements in just a
              little over 100 years.  So why didn't mankind discover any of
              this stuff 100,000,000 years ago, or 100,000 years ago for that
              matter?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Look at the ignorance
              of doctors over the past few centuries.  Sanitary practices,
              such as washing hands, were laughed at by doctors, while thousands
              of patients continued to die.  It was unimaginable to doctors
              back then, that washing one's hands somehow was related to a
              patient's health in the operating room.  Can you believe
              that?  Evolutionists today are just as ignorant of the truth
              of God's Word, and of common sense itself.  It's hard to
              imagine that millions of people were dying from a simple lack of
              ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) just a couple hundred years ago.  If
              evolution is true, then it took man billions of years to learn all
              these kindergarten lessons.  And ironically, man has only
              learned these lessons in the past couple hundred years. 
              You've got to be kidding me!  Don't tell me that it took
              mankind BILLIONS of years to learn to wash his hands to prevent
              disease!  The truth is that mankind has taken baby-steps since
              4,000 B.C., and it did take him nearly 6,000 years to learn to wash
              his hands.  This is just another undeniable PROOF that
              evolution is a lie.  If mankind had evolved over millions of
              years, then men would have discovered these inventions a very long
              time ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The truth is that
              evolutionists are hardhearted against the truth of God's
              Word.  The Word of God declares that God created the world at
              approximately 4,000 B.C.—YOU'D BE A FOOL NOT TO BELIEVE IT, BECAUSE
              THERE'S NO HISTORY PRIOR TO 4,000 B.C.  As incredible as this
              fact is, it is undeniable proof against evolution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><em>      </em> <em>R</em>ecently, a thought captivated my mind that proves that
              the theory of evolution is a big hoax.  The thought is simple
              and yet profound ... why is there no recorded history before
              approximately 4,000 B.C.?  The answer is obvious ... there was
              no history!  Think about it!  Evolutionists claim that
              man evolved over billions of years (that's billions with a
              "B").  If there were any truth to these false claims by
              unscrupulous scientists, then man's historical record should span
              back at least hundreds-of-thousands of years, if not
              millions.  There is no record of a cataclysmic event that
              destroyed mankind prior to 4,000 B.C.  And if there were,
              surely some of the survivors would have passed this information
              down to generations to follow.  The Bible dates creation, as
              we know it today, at approximately 4,000 B.C.  Thus, it was
              approximately 6,000 years ago that God, Jesus Christ, created the
              heavens and the earth in 6-days.  It was 6,000 years ago that
              Jesus Christ spoke the stars into existence.  It was 6,000
              years ago that Jesus spoke animals, fish, plants, and land into
              existence.  And it was 6,000 years ago that God formed man out
              of the dust of the earth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Such Biblical claims
              seem absurd to modern evolutionists, who have convinced themselves
              that the earth is billions of years old.  Ironically, they
              have absolutely NO EVIDENCE of such longevity.  Evolutionists
              have sought out dishonest scientists, who distort the facts, use
              faulty testing methods, and make erroneous assumptions (unethically
              stating such assumptions as if they were facts).  Evolution is
              at best still a THEORY.  Yet, children are brainwashed in
              godless public schools all across the world, with evolution, which
              is taught as if it were a fact.  This is evil.  It is
              evil to deny students the Biblical account of creationism. 
              The Word of God makes infinite more sense than the fairytale of
              evolution. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">One of the simplest and
              best proofs that evolution is a joke, is the FACT that there is NO
              recorded history prior to 4,000 B.C.  The world's history is
              CLEARY defined by SIX world powers since time began: Egypt,
              Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome.  Since Rome's
              fall in 476 A.D., there have been no world-powers (many
              super-powers; but, no world-powers).  At the time of Moses,
              Egypt ruled the world.  The Israelites were used as slave
              labor by Pharaoh to build the pyramids.  Before Egypt, there
              is absolutely nothing recorded in history about a
              world-power.  It is NO coincidence that Revelation 17:10
              speaks of these world-powers, "<em>...five are fallen, and one is,
              and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue
              a short space.</em>"  At the writing of Revelation, Rome was
              still a world-power.  The Apostle John, under the inspiration
              of the Holy Spirit, tells us that Rome is the 6th world-power, and
              there is one more to come.  The 7th world-power will be the
              beast system, the kingdom of the antichrist.  This diabolical
              <em>New World Order</em> is quickly forming now (i.e., a universal
              religious view, global centralized government, a one-world economic
              system, a cashless society, etc.).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Do you think it's a
              mere coincidence that the Word of God is so concise on world
              history?  The Bible records the beginning of mankind at about
              4,000 B.C., and secular history is eerily silent before 4,000 B.C.
              for those who claim to believe in evolution.  If I were an
              evolutionist, I would be extremely disturbed by this FACT. 
              Prove me wrong!  I dare you.  I triple-dog dare you to
              show me any recorded civilization before 4,000 B.C.  And I
              don't mean some pottery jug or item that you claim is 14,000 years
              old--Show me any evidence of civilization prior to 4,000 B.C. 
              You cannot.  In fact, it is difficult to find much recorded
              history before 2,500 B.C., because the flood of Noah's day
              destroyed most of it.  How can evolutionists be so naive and
              foolish as to totally ignore this incredibly obvious fact? 
              There is NO recorded history prior to 4,000 B.C.--no writings, no
              carved stones, no battles, no wars, no countries, no nothing! 
              It's as if mankind just suddenly began (which is exactly what the
              Bible teaches happened).  God created man out of the dirt, the
              elements, of the earth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">There were no humans
              before approximately 4,000 B.C.  Hard to imagine?  Why
              should it be?  There is no history to indicate that humans
              existed prior to 4,000 B.C.  This fact is irrefutable. 
              Oh sure, some stubborn evolutionists are going to start talking
              about carbon-dating, archeological findings, etc.  BUT, the
              bottom line is that the history of mankind should be traceable far
              beyond 4,000 B.C., going back million of years IF evolution were
              true. <br>  <br></span></p>

              <p>Proof of existence of God is everywhere. But u already refuse to
              see it. Even with the scientific explainations u will continue to
              disbelieve. Because thats you. Ur heart is rock solid with cynicsm
              and skepticsm. You wont believe in Bill Gates if u dont want to
              believe even with all the evidence around you. You will only
              believe once u yourself want to open urself up to give the
              possibility, like u said, that 10% possibility that its wrong/right
              . U yourself answered that in previous posts and dont u see it
              ?</p>
              <p>Replicating miracles is one thing, replication of the
              ressurection is also another thing.</p>
              <p>If u really want me to go down to replicating of miracles, sure,
              there are some miracles that CAN be replicated, or theoretically
              through quantum physics. And it is not long before we fully
              understand down the subatomic levels.. and things will continue to
              get smaller. IF u know what quantumn physics is about, if not, i
              give u the low down on it.</p>
              <p>Faith makes us believe in the Miracles of the Bible, when we are
              "scientific" scripture scholars, we will not.</p>
              <p>Quantumn physics definately supports the idea of miracles
              happening. In the world o science, using quantumn physics ,
              miracles happen "scientifically" and that is at a subatomic level
              all of material reality is supported not by atoms, but tubatmoic
              particles, one of wich is the quanta. The quanta particle is a
              chameleon, meaning that it changes in valence and function of a
              quanta particle. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literally mind over
              matter.</span></p>
              <p>THe double slit experiment of quantumn physics shows a
              dispersion pattern that is impossible given ordinary newtownian
              physics assumptions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Morever, Bell's Theorem proves
              non-local communcation at a distance between  atoms, thus
              making the idea of "psychic channeling" scienfitically possible.
              Additionally, if non-local communication is possible, and if
              subatomic particles ca change subatmoic particles non-locally at a
              distance, meaning a prayer can change subatomic particles
              non-locally at a distance, then it is certainly possible that atoms
              and molecules, and even cells, which are ultimately composes of
              subatomic particles could also change.</span></p>
              <p>So when we talk about virgin birth scientifically possible, as
              well as moving large amounts of water, and healing the blind and
              the lame. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THe foregoing
              is confirmed by the face that modern scientific prayer studies show
              that prayer provides a statistically significant diference in the
              healing of heart attack patients, quantumn particles, called quanta
              and the Quantum Field that they compose, can change matter
              physically. Underlygint material physical reality is not atmoic
              separateness, but instead the Quantum Ield masking itself as
              various subatomic particles. Thus, Miracles are not scientifically
              possible, but probable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not only are the
              modern "scientific" miracles of the microwave oven, the television,
              the computer, the gameboy, the playstation , the dvd player made
              possible with Quantumn Physics, so too are the "scientific"
              miracles of the virgin birth of Jesus.</span></p>
              <p>I dont know if u are getting all this or not, but i am just here
              to properly logically and with reason and science, point to you the
              questions that we pose in a scientific point of view that not only
              helped us solve and answer all your answers you so now take for
              granted as, " scientific proof" , it also makes us wonder and
              always question the very nature of the biblical miracles and
              finding the answers for those can find answers for our future
              technological advances or the other way round.</p>
              <p>You have always spoken with much skepticism, and cynicsm, but
              only as much optimism about your economical predictions. You feel
              so empowered by your correctness of your statistical datas your
              garnered and your experience through your years in the field.
              However you do not seem to put forth as much learned comprehension
              and understanding as you do here like u did in speakers corner. And
              i am a bit disappointed. I do not believe that you are 100% sure
              about exactly how the economic will go, you have a high possibility
              of it happening with data's and current trends and your expeirence
              in the market or perhaps a degree in economics for that matter.
              Thats about it. I can predict it with a 20% probability, but it
              takes as much FAITH as you did for you to be right. Unless you are
              also in ur "delusion" , you could hardly discount the fact that you
              are not 100% sure.Its like how duty cannot exist without faith.
              Something which maybe you know or dont, but surely u will deny when
              it comes to God and the bible.</p>
              <p>Oh btw.. Santa Claus ? Now that is something i do not
              believe.</p>
              <p>CSI and Conan the Barbarian. Both got the job done in the right
              ?</p>
              <p>But sometimes, a lil faith... can go a long way. Thats why the
              difference between me and  u will most probably be that u will
              die in a desert scenario, while i may survive a couple hundred
              yards more, or even miraclelously survive with my faith and
              scientific knowledge of my physiology and its limits.</p>
              <p>Anyways, Happy New Year. I wont be around for the week. I be
              partying and having as much faith that the world wont blow in up in
              my face after the new year.</p>
              <p>And one more thing, i dont curse, because we are told in the
              bible and morally that we dont go around cursing people, while u
              do, that just tells alot about a person u know. N dont tell me its
              not wrong to curse, or its o.k to curse someone You will definately
              not want ur kids to curse another or want me to curse you, but on
              the other hand, you can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
