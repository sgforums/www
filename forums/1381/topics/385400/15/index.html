              <p>When Jews are said to be ''Chosen people'', it does not mean that they are superior to the Asians or Americans. You see that they are punished in the holocaust right? </p>
              <p>What is this uniqueness? Historically, it goes back to Abraham. Abraham
              lived in a world steeped in idolatry, which he concluded was
              contradicted by the reality of design in nature. So Abraham came to a
              belief in G-d, and took upon himself the mission of teaching others of
              the monotheistic ideal. Abraham was even willing to suffer persecution
              for his beliefs. After years of enormous effort, dedication and a
              willingness to accept the responsibility to be G-d's representative in
              this world, G-d chose Abraham and his descendents to be the teachers of
              this monotheistic message.</p>
              <p>In other words it is not so much that G-d chose the Jews; it is more accurate that the Jews (through Abraham) chose G-d.<br> Chosenness was not part of G-d's "original plan." Initially all of
              humanity was to serve the role of G-d's messengers, but after the fall
              of Adam, humanity lost that privilege, and it was open for grabs. Only
              Abraham chose to take the mantle. If others would have (and they were
              offered the choice), they too would have joined in this special
              covenant which was sealed upon the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai.</p>
              <p>If a privilege is offered to everyone willing to pay the necessary
              price, nobody can protest that those willing to make the extra effort
              are being shown favoritism. For example: It is reasonable that an
              employee who agrees to work overtime, attend training seminars, and
              manage special projects, should be entitled to a performance bonus --
              particularly if each employee was given the same opportunity.<br> The essence of being chosen means responsibility. It is a
              responsibility to change the world -- not by converting everyone to
              Judaism, but by living as a model community upheld by ethics, morals
              and beliefs of one God. In that way, we can influence the rest of
              mankind, a "light unto the nations" (Isaiah 42:6).</p>

              <p>When Jews are said to be ''Chosen people'', it does not mean
              that they are superior to the Asians or Americans. You see that
              they are punished in the holocaust right? </p>
              <p>What is this uniqueness? Historically, it goes back to Abraham.
              Abraham lived in a world steeped in idolatry, which he concluded
              was contradicted by the reality of design in nature. So Abraham
              came to a belief in G-d, and took upon himself the mission of
              teaching others of the monotheistic ideal. Abraham was even willing
              to suffer persecution for his beliefs. After years of enormous
              effort, dedication and a willingness to accept the responsibility
              to be G-d's representative in this world, G-d chose Abraham and his
              descendents to be the teachers of this monotheistic message.</p>
              <p>In other words it is not so much that G-d chose the Jews; it is
              more accurate that the Jews (through Abraham) chose G-d.<br> Chosenness was not part of G-d's "original plan." Initially all of
              humanity was to serve the role of G-d's messengers, but after the
              fall of Adam, humanity lost that privilege, and it was open for
              grabs. Only Abraham chose to take the mantle. If others would have
              (and they were offered the choice), they too would have joined in
              this special covenant which was sealed upon the giving of the Torah
              at Mount Sinai.</p>
              <p>If a privilege is offered to everyone willing to pay the
              necessary price, nobody can protest that those willing to make the
              extra effort are being shown favoritism. For example: It is
              reasonable that an employee who agrees to work overtime, attend
              training seminars, and manage special projects, should be entitled
              to a performance bonus -- particularly if each employee was given
              the same opportunity.<br> The essence of being chosen means responsibility. It is a
              responsibility to change the world -- not by converting everyone to
              Judaism, but by living as a model community upheld by ethics,
              morals and beliefs of one God. In that way, we can influence the
              rest of mankind, a "light unto the nations" (Isaiah 42:6).</p>

              <p>How and why was Abraham, if he even existed, get chosen? Maybe god disliked the Indians the Chinese? Apparently his willingness to murder his son makes him special? Such teachings only justify Jewish actions such as the invasion of Palestinian land, because they think its "God-given"? The Old Testament would have been a great tool to propagate the cause of Jewish superiority and the invasion of the lands of others. Religion is not the only way a race seeks to justify its own superiority and actions, even countries place themselves above others. China means centre of the universe. Thus I think that it remains nothing but a propaganda and political tool which has no basis in the modern 21st century</p>

              <p> God was trying to test Abraham's faith. The willingness to murder his son for God shows that Abraham is a faithful person to God. Obviously because of that, he will get chosen as God's person. BTW, if the Jews were really the ones who invented God, the God would probably be like those Greek and Roman Pagan Gods, and many other Gods from many religions. The simillarity of man's ideas has proven likewise, if the Judeo-christian God is really invented and faked, then it would probably be a God with human-like character, and there should also be many Gods instead of just one. If it were really but a propaganda, I am not too sure about that. However, since Israel's becoming of a nation in the bible has been prophecised more than 2000 years ago, and it has been said that one generation after independence the wars and tribulation shall occur, we will know if the bible is true to its word or not very soon, in the next 10-40years.</p>

              <p>If god was omnipotent, he would have know Abraham's loyalty without any need to test it. In defence of the monotheism principal, I am given to believe that Zoroastrianism was the first monotheistic religion followed by the monotheistic practice of Pharaoh Akhenaten in Egypt, thus it is entirely possible that the Judeo-Christian god was faked.</p>

Are you assuming that there is any similarity between so-called Pagan Gods and Humanity and absolute zero similarity between God and man? On what basis are you assuming, since it seemed to be that God was angry, jealous, unforgiving, merciless, and takes time to achieve understanding on the trials of man? Say like some thousand years later?</span></p>
