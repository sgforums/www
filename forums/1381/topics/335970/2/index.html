              <p>I think you have some mis-understanding....Priests are not given
              any gadgets by the Church and certainly not latest laptops and
              handphones. Some priest who need a laptop (such as for out of
              Church events) may be given one but it belongs to the Church and
              not the priest. Like your rifle in army - it's not yours.
              Handphones are personal for sure and most Church do not even
              reimburse the priest for the line.....certainly not the phone.</p>
              <p>All priests DO NOT own cars as they belong to the Church and I
              believe that it cannot be more than 1600cc. But only for parish
              Churches because priest need to travel to serve the community as
              mentiuoned.</p>
              <p>You do make a very serious allegations when you said  "i
              doubt that they can resist picking on the donations". The donations
              are not counted by the priests but by a committee of lay
              people.</p>
              <p>If you know any "loop holes" that may allow a priest to dip into
              donations, perhaps you can raise them so that something can be done
              or...</p>
              <p>If you know of any or suspect that any priest is dipping into
              donations, you can always make a report to the Archbishop or even
              the police.</p>
              <p>$500 is for real and not face value only.....</p>
              <p>Why would someone wants to give up everything (and some priests
              do give up successful careers) to join a seminary for 7-8 years
              (when they get even lesser - used to be $50 a month but not sure
              now) just to get a chance to dip into donations?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>First off, i would like you to understand that these are my doubts and that i'm not making any allegations regarding the financial management of the Church.</p>
              <p>For the rifle part, you do have several good points there. However, you have to take into consideration that it may be misused for personal gains (for example, the recent AWOL soldier with his SAR). If even the army cannot ensure total security over their men and equipment, I think its resonable to doubt the ability of a ( not the ) church to ensure that no money is being used for "other purposes".</p>
              <p>A gentle reminder, indiviual contributions maybe insignificant, but if you consider the scale of the church ( like cityharvest or novena ), it is worth quite alot. Just around 1% of the total donation per annum could easily ensure the priest a decade of good life. You may argue that a group of people will monitor every movement of the donations, but if the priest can't be trusted, can they?</p>

              <p>There bounds to be cases of misuse of funds. Like there bounds to be criminal cases or corrupt people. But that doesn't mean that all people are criminal or all people are corrupt.</p>
              <p>I consider the misuse of church funds to be a major offence not to men but to God. I know that God doesn't need the funds but rather it was raised for the benefit of supporting God's cause. If it was misused it would be the same as stealing from the God whom he or she worship and that's the same with contempt.</p>

              <p>Well, if it is something you presume, then there is nothing we need to discuss further. You can cast your doubts but are they cause for concern? Perhaps it would be better if you find out more about priesthood and what they really are and do.</p>
              <p>Maybe this link will help <a title="Life in Kampung Punggol" href="http://kampungpunggol.blogspot.com/">Life in Kampung Ponggol</a> if you are free on 16.11.08</p>
              <p>When you said "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but i doubt that they can resist picking on
                                          the donations.</strong></span>" sounds like an allegations that the priests do dip into the donations.</p>
              <p>The collections are done during Mass and counted after by a committee. City Harvest is different because they have no priest there and I am not familiar with their check and balance although I was there for a while. So I have no comments.</p>
              <p>If a priest wants a "good life" in your context, I don't think they will enter priesthood in the first place.</p>
              <p>I can trust the priests for what they are representing. Wonder why you cannot trust them...misconceptions?</p>
              <p>I conclude that your doubts are with the integrity of the priests and anybody else serving the Church because of the temptations of money...... which is fair enough.</p>
              <p>Well, can you trust our government? We have corrupted ministers
                  before....how? Stop paying taxes? Label all minsisters as corrupt? Or do we improve our check and
                  balance and continue to have faith?</p>
              <p>Christianity teaches against the temptation of greed although I know the current hype is to preach the greedy gospel but then, that is not what the faith is teaching isn't it?</p>

              <p>Do correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p><br>From a layman perspective, a Catholic priest is someone the Catholic Church ordains and given powers to celebrate Mass and the Eucharist (Holy Communion) and to forgive sins in persona Christi (in the person of Christ), amongst other things.</p>
              <p>The priest may i) belong to a religious order such as the Jesuits or the Dominicans which have their own 'specialisations' such as theology or evangelisation, or ii) take care of a community, preaching, administering sacraments (baptism, holy communion, confirmation, reconciliation, holy matrimony, annointing of the sick), providing advice etc. In the latter role, the priest is known as a parish-priest or a pastor.</p>
              <p>A number of protestant denominations do not believe in an ordained priesthood and therefore do not have priests. Virtually anyone can start his own church and call himself a pastor to the congregation who attend his church.</p>

              <p><strong>Priests</strong> are the masters of healing and preservation,
              restoring their wounded allies, shielding them in battle, and even
              resurrecting their fallen comrades from death. While they have a
              variety of protective and enhancement spells to bolster their allies,
              priests can also wreak terrible vengeance on their enemies, using the
              grand powers of the Holy Light to smite and purge their enemies, or the
              devastating powers of the Shadow to decimate their minds. They are a
              diverse and powerful class, highly desirable in any group and capable
              of fulfilling multiple roles.</p>
              <p>The Priest is perhaps the best healing
              class with a surprisingly strong damage potential as well
              (should the player choose to enhance this aspect of the class). Their
              ability to heal and buff allies, avoid aggro, dispel buffs on enemies, dispel debuffs on their allies, and Resurrect fallen comrades makes them an important member of any group, whether it's <span class="mw-redirect">PvP</span> or <span class="mw-redirect">PvE</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>Priests</strong> practice a complex, organized form of spirituality
              that embraces moralistic philosophies, the worship of a particular
              deity (such as Elune)
              in some cases, and/or idol worship, rather than the reverence of the
              elements that shamans practice, or the close divine connection with
              animals and the wilderness that Druids maintain. Priests serve not only
              as influential religious figures in their respective societies, but
              also as powerful practitioners of divine magic, which they use to heal
              and protect, or harm and weaken.</p>
              <p>Devotion to the faiths of Azeroth leads many Priests to the
              paths of courage and heroism. In dark times, priests carry the light of
              faith with them as a reminder of the powerful forces at work beyond the
              comprehension of the peoples who walk the land. Powerful healers with an intimate connection to the divine, Priests are empowered with abilities that aid them in times of dire need.<sup><em></em></sup></p>
              <p><strong>Priests</strong> comprise a very varied group in Azeroth. A female priest is called a "priestess". Many are followers, in some manner, of the <span class="mw-redirect">Holy Light</span>. Some priests choose to be pyremasters or <span class="mw-redirect">Priestesses of the Moon</span>, while some of the most experienced become epic Priests.</p>

              <p>The Clerics of Northshire were human priests who served the kingdom of Stormwind during the First War.  The clerics
              served as healers on the battlefield, but were ill-prepared for the
              hazards of combat, and thus suffered heavy casualties. This order was
              largely destroyed, and the Second War saw fragile Priests replaced on the battlefield by armored <span class="mw-redirect">paladins</span>; The Knights of the Silver Hand, established by the Clerics' leader Archbishop Alonsus Faol, and his apprentice <span class="mw-redirect">Uther Lightbringer</span>.</p>
              <p>During events of the Third War, despite the <span class="mw-redirect">high elves'</span> official departure from the Alliance, some elves still remained true to their former human and dwarven allies. The altruistic Priests of <span class="mw-redirect">Quel’Thalas</span> refused to abandon their roles as healers and agreed to remain in Lordaeron despite the edicts from their reclusive masters in <span class="mw-redirect">Silvermoon</span>.
              The high elven Priests used their Light-given powers to heal the
              wounded and bolster the spirits of Lordaeron’s fighting elite. A holy
              field medic, these padres roam the battlefield curing the wounds of
              fallen comrades.</p>

Losing the hope of owning the luxuries of this world. Getting moved from time to time so there is no one place that he could truly call home or to everyplace he must call them home.</p>
              <p>Have you heard of mother teresa?</p>
              <p>I din't say that being a family man was bad but to be frank a family man busies himself with the things of the world and his family and have much less time to serve others in need.</p>
              <p>In comparison a family man is more oriented towards his own family(who doesn't put his own family as top priority?)while a priest or nun serve a lot more people with selfless motive.</p>
              <p>I'm sorry If my writing that taking care a family is a selfsih act offended you. I apologize. Of course each family must be strong before it can give any positive contribution to society. I wasn't sensible enough to consider the fact that people might take it offensive.</p>

              <p><strong>Priests</strong> are the masters of healing and
              preservation, restoring their wounded allies, shielding them in
              battle, and even resurrecting their fallen comrades from death.
              While they have a variety of protective and enhancement spells to
              bolster their allies, priests can also wreak terrible vengeance on
              their enemies, using the grand powers of the Holy Light to smite
              and purge their enemies, or the devastating powers of the Shadow to
              decimate their minds. They are a diverse and powerful class, highly
              desirable in any group and capable of fulfilling multiple
              roles.</p>
              <p>The Priest is perhaps the best healing class with a surprisingly
              strong damage potential as well (should the player choose to
              enhance this aspect of the class). Their ability to heal and buff
              allies, avoid aggro, dispel buffs on enemies, dispel debuffs on
              their allies, and Resurrect fallen comrades makes them an important
              member of any group, whether it's <span>PvP</span> or
              <span>PvE</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>Priests</strong> practice a complex, organized form of
              spirituality that embraces moralistic philosophies, the worship of
              a particular deity (such as Elune) in some cases, and/or idol
              worship, rather than the reverence of the elements that shamans
              practice, or the close divine connection with animals and the
              wilderness that Druids maintain. Priests serve not only as
              influential religious figures in their respective societies, but
              also as powerful practitioners of divine magic, which they use to
              heal and protect, or harm and weaken.</p>
              <p>Devotion to the faiths of Azeroth leads many Priests to the
              paths of courage and heroism. In dark times, priests carry the
              light of faith with them as a reminder of the powerful forces at
              work beyond the comprehension of the peoples who walk the land.
              Powerful healers with an intimate connection to the divine, Priests
              are empowered with abilities that aid them in times of dire
              need.</p>
              <p><strong>Priests</strong> comprise a very varied group in
              Azeroth. A female priest is called a "priestess". Many are
              followers, in some manner, of the <span>Holy Light</span>.
              Some priests choose to be pyremasters or <span>Priestesses
              of the Moon</span>, while some of the most experienced become epic
              Priests.</p>

              <p>The Clerics of Northshire were human priests who served the
              kingdom of Stormwind during the First War. The clerics served as
              healers on the battlefield, but were ill-prepared for the hazards
              of combat, and thus suffered heavy casualties. This order was
              largely destroyed, and the Second War saw fragile Priests replaced
              on the battlefield by armored <span>paladins</span>; The
              Knights of the Silver Hand, established by the Clerics' leader
              Archbishop Alonsus Faol, and his apprentice <span>Uther
              Lightbringer</span>.</p>
              <p>During events of the Third War, despite the <span>high
              elves'</span> official departure from the Alliance, some elves
              still remained true to their former human and dwarven allies. The
              altruistic Priests of <span>Quel’Thalas</span> refused to
              abandon their roles as healers and agreed to remain in Lordaeron
              despite the edicts from their reclusive masters in <span>Silvermoon</span>. The high elven Priests used their Light-given
              powers to heal the wounded and bolster the spirits of Lordaeron’s
              fighting elite. A holy field medic, these padres roam the
              battlefield curing the wounds of fallen comrades.</p>
