              <p>Becoming a Catholic Priest entails some sacrifice but it can also be a very rewarding vocation if one is called to it. This point is brought across very nicely in an advertisement for the priesthood by the St.Francis Xavier Major Seminary, an extract of which is shown below.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i380.photobucket.com/albums/oo241/omnia8/priest2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="311"></p>
              <p>The requirement for Catholic priests to remain single is Church discipline and not dogma. It echoes what St. Paul wrote in the bible,</p>
              <p>"<em>I should like you to be free of anxieties. An unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. But a married man is anxious about the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and he is divided ..." </em>(1Cor7:32:34)</p>

              <p>And  not one to be toyed about. It's a very serious decision.</p>
              <p>To be a priest who took the oath of poverty and celibacy you must really believe(and know) that your reward is not here. That the very best of life is not of this world but after.</p>
              <p>That is after God raises you to life....</p>
              <p>A toast to all priests and those who pursue their salvation with rigor: "To the very best of life", "To future kings and queens", "To everlasting power " ;-)</p>
              <p>I still remember a comment from an NTU entrepreneurship lecturer when he said (Christian) priests are not doing anything. And to think what has that lecturer done in his life to merit him making such a comment.</p>
              <p>As far as I know he wasn't not doing anything aside trying to make his and his family ends met. A very selfish goal I'd say.</p>

              must really believe(and know) that your reward is not here. That
              the very best of life is not of this world but after.</p>
              <p>That is after God raises you to life....</p>
              <p>A toast to all priests and those who pursue their salvation with
              rigor: "To the very best of life", "To future kings and queens",
              "To everlasting power " ;-)</p>
              <p>I still remember a comment from an NTU entrepreneurship lecturer
              when he said (Christian) priests are not doing anything. And to
              think what has that lecturer done in his life to merit him making
              such a comment.</p>
              <p>As far as I know he wasn't not doing anything aside trying to
              make his and his family ends met. A very selfish goal I'd say.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Any goal that benefits the lifes of others shouldn't be considered selfish. The lecturer may not have the merits to comment, but i think only a fool would say that trying to make his family's ends meet is a selfish act.</p>
              <p>Besides, i don't think what you, if you will to be so kind as not to be offended, have done in your life which give you the rights to judge others.</p>

              <p><br>Well its up to them. Remember the Vatican is a soveriegn country so I don't think it can just reveal all its financial data. Even up till today Singapore has yet to fully account all his reserves.</p>
              <p>Most of its money comes from its investments, art, treasures/money from the now defunct Papal States and of course real estate.</p>

              <p>I think you have some mis-understanding....Priests are not given any
                  gadgets by the Church and certainly not latest laptops and handphones. Some priest who need a laptop (such as for out of Church events) may be given one but it belongs to the Church and not the priest. Like your rifle in army - it's not yours. Handphones are personal for sure and most Church do not even reimburse the priest for the line.....certainly not the phone.</p>
              <p>All priests DO NOT own cars as they belong to the Church and I believe that it cannot be more than 1600cc. But only for parish Churches because priest need to travel to serve the community as mentiuoned.</p>
              <p>You do make a very serious allegations when you said  "i doubt that they can resist picking on
                  the donations". The donations are not counted by the priests but by a committee of lay people.</p>
              <p>If you know any "loop holes" that may allow a priest to dip into donations, perhaps you can raise them so that something can be done or...</p>
              <p>If you know of any or suspect that any priest is dipping into donations, you can always make a report to the Archbishop or even the police.</p>
              <p>$500 is for real and not face value only.....</p>
              <p>Why would someone wants to give up everything (and some priests do give up successful careers) to join a seminary for 7-8 years (when they get even lesser - used to be $50 a month but not sure now) just to get a chance to dip into donations?</p>

              <p>What are your doubts about the Vatican's finance management?</p>
              <p>It will be interesting to know.....and maybe you would also like to know that the Pope is another priest. He owns nothing that belongs to the Vatican and will die poor with nothing to his name. Everything belongs to the Church and his people.</p>
