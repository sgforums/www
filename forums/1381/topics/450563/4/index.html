              <p>I beg to differ. From what I have gathered based on my past exchanges with you, the reason why you left Christianity was because you never had a deep foundation to begin with. You knew little about the faith and was not equipped to handle intellectual assaults on the faith. Just reflect on the immature kind of objections you threw out here, and the shallow nature of your arguments. The sad fact is that there are many Christians just like you in the church today. Many live on feel-good sermons and are not being properly grounded in the truths of God's Word, or to defend it against those who seek to undermine the faith and Bible.</p>

              <p>Where did the Bible said that God created us so that we can worship Him? Show Chapter and Verse please. It's as absurd as saying that our parents gave birth to us so that we can call them father or mother. The reason why we call our parents "father" or "mother" is because they gave birth to us, and thus we are to honour them as such. We owe it to them because without them there would be no us. The same with God, who created the universe and all that is in it. The creation owes its existence to the Creator. While honor is due to our parents who begat us, much more than honor is due to God who made the universe and gave us life.</p>
              <p>Why does God demand that we worship Him? The same way that our parents demand that we do not anyhow call other people "father" or "mother". Or wives demand that their husbands only love them and vice versa. It's being jealous for the right reasons.</p>
              <p>But why let you off the hook? Does it make sense that the universe made itself from nothing? You tell me.</p>

              <p>Don't change the subject to the amount of drugs being smuggled or the severity of the consequences. The issue is whether there is a choice or not. There is. No one is forcing you not to smuggle drugs. You can either choose to smuggle drugs or not to, given the fact that you know the law and its consequences. The govt has the right to set the consequences for those livng in Singapore just as God has the right to set the consequences for those living in His universe.</p>
              <p>Fact is, you will die physically whether you believe in God or not. What is at stake here is not your physical life, but your spirit. Where will you spend eternity? It's not as if you have two new roads before you, turn left to hell and turn right to heaven. If this is what you are thinking then it again shows how poor your Bible knowledge is. The Bible teaches that all have sinned and fallen short. We are already condemned and already are going down the road to hell because of our sins. Make no mistake, if you persist in your rebellion against God, it would not be because of unbelief that you end up in hell, but because of your rebellion against God and the sins you have committed against Him. Believing in Jesus is the only way we can be lifted out of this path and emplaced onto the highway to heaven, so to speak.</p>

                  Just like the murderer broke the law and must face the death penalty, the unbelievers broke God's law and must face an eternity in hell. I am in no way saying that unbelievers are murderers. Chill man.

              <p>Dr David Catchpoole writes:</p>
              <p>I must admit, the ferocity of many of the hostile comments we receive in response to our articles has surprised me.</p>
              <p>A decade ago I naively thought that when people could be shown via creation science information that the Bible’s account of history can be trusted, they would excitedly embrace the truth—the salvation freely offered through Jesus Christ, our Creator and our Lord.</p>
              <p>But now, the doggedness some correspondents show in refusing to accept obvious, observable facts prompted me to frustratedly say to a CMI colleague, “I feel like I’m bashing my head against a brick wall. We practically gift-wrap the truth for people in our articles, yet many still can’t see it.”</p>
              <p>Hearing this, another Christian friend said, “Actually, I think in some cases it’s not that they <em>can’t</em> see it, it’s that they <em>won’t</em> see it.”</p>
              <p>In light of a recent experience during a speaking ministry tour, I suspect he’s right. After giving a creation presentation, it’s not unusual to have someone come up and say, “I’m an atheist”, and then proceed to ask hostile questions. But recently, a young man whom I’ll call Brev introduced himself quite differently. His first words were, “I’m a seeker after truth”—and then he proceeded to ask hostile questions. On the existence of God, Brev said he was more agnostic than atheist.</p>
              <p>His questions were against the background of his thinking that the universe can be explained via yin and yang forces over billions of years. I turned the questions back onto his own mixed-up views, and after about 45 minutes we got to the point where I asked him a simple yes/no question about whether there was any possibility that the history outlined in the Bible might be true. To my amazement, Brev said (after a long reflective pause) something that I’ve never previously heard any atheist or agnostic dare to admit: “<strong>Uh-oh, I can see where that question leads … but it can’t, we can’t go there … because the consequences of that would change my whole life—if the Bible’s history is true then I’d have to devote my whole life to serving God … The commitment would be too great … No, it’s impossible.”</strong></p>
              <p>Brev’s candid admission helps explain why the battle over the truth of the Bible’s historical account is so fierce. Brev’s candour is in stark contrast to atheists and agnostics who won’t admit what their <em>real</em> objection to the creation message is. And in one sense, Brev is right. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If the history of the Bible is correct, then the implications are indeed huge for every individual alive today.</span> There is indeed a ‘cost’—something Jesus spoke of (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=ESV&amp;passage=Luke%2014:25-33"><span style="color: #1e80bc;">Luke 14:25–33</span></a>). But having been on both sides of the divide (for I was once an atheist, living in line with the selfish purposelessness conveniently bestowed by the evolutionary paradigm), I can say that, for me, it’s a clear choice. There is nothing more satisfying than to joyfully commit your whole life to serving your Creator God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength—we are here for a <em>purpose</em>.</p>
