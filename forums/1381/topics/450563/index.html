              <p>I am starting this thread on the above topic since there does not seem to be a thread on this, at least not one that is being kept alive. Anyway, my first post on this thread is from an unlikely source.</p>

              <p>Everyone is biased, whether you are a theist or an atheist. There is simply no such thing as a neutral person. What's important is that we have the correct bias. So it boils down to which bias is the best bias to be biased with.</p>
              <p>I am certainly keen to take on your debate offer, but I am concerned about the productivity of discussing "problem Bible passages" with an atheist who does not share the same worldview as a Christian. The only way that this can be productive is that the atheist, for the sake of argument, be willing to step into the worldview of the Christian and see the answers from a Biblical perspective. Otherwise the atheist would simply be predisposed to dismiss the answers. Would you be willing to do that?</p>
              <p>Also, the topic is whether creationism is true (i.e. there is a Creator-God) or whether evolutionism is true (i.e. chance is the "creator", even though chance is not a thing or being) and I think we should first try to focus on that level rather than dive into these so-called Bible difficulties which is really a very wide topic. In short, I think we ought to address the issue whether those features seen in those creatures in Post #1 is best explained by intelligence or by chance.</p>
              <p>Lest you think there is no answer at all to your question or that I am trying to evade, your question is answered by theologican Charles Ryrie:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Though by many inerrantists the question of where Cain got his wife would not be considered a problem at all, this question is often used by those who try to demonstrate that the Bible is unreliable in what it claims. How could it claim that Adam and Eve were the first human beings who had two sons, one of whom murdered the other, and yet who produced a large race of people? Clearly, the Bible does teach that Adam and Eve were the first created human beings. The Lord affirmed this in <a href="http://net.bible.org/#!bible/Matthew%2019:3-9"></a><a class="NETBibleTagged">Matthew 19:3-9</a>. The genealogy of Christ is traced back to Adam (<a href="http://net.bible.org/#!bible/Luke%203:38"></a><a class="NETBibleTagged">Luke 3:38</a>). <a href="http://net.bible.org/#!bible/Jude%2014"></a><a class="NETBibleTagged">Jude 14</a> identifies Enoch as the seventh from Adam. This could hardly mean the seventh from “mankind,” an interpretation that would be necessary if Adam were not an individual as some claim. Clearly, Cain murdered Abel and yet many people were born. Where did Cain get his wife?</p>
              <p>We know that Adam and Eve had other sons and daughters in addition to Abel, Cain, and Seth (<a href="http://net.bible.org/#!bible/Gen.%205:4"></a><a class="NETBibleTagged">Gen. 5:4</a>), and <strong>if there was only one original family, then the first marriages had to be between brothers and sisters.</strong> <strong>Such marriages in the beginning were not harmful</strong>. Incest is dangerous because inherited mutant genes that produce deformed, sickly, or moronic children are more likely to find expression in children if those genes are carried by both parents. Certainly, Adam and Eve, coming from the creative hand of God, had no such mutant genes. Therefore, marriages between brothers and sisters, or nieces and nephews in the first and second generations following Adam and Eve would not have been dangerous.</p>
              <p><strong>Many, many generations later, by the time of Moses, incest was then prohibited in the Mosaic laws</strong> undoubtedly for two reasons: first, such mutations that caused deformity had accumulated to the point where such unions were genetically dangerous, and second, it was forbidden because of the licentious practices of the Egyptians and Canaanites and as a general protection against such in society. It should also be noted that in addition to the Bible most other legal codes refuse to sanction marriages of close relatives.</p>
              <p>But here is another issue to consider. <strong>If one accepts the evolutionary hypothesis as to the origin of the human race, has that really relieved the issue of incest?</strong> Not unless you also propound the idea of the evolution of many pairs of beings, pre-human or whatever, at the same time. No matter what theory of the origin of the human race one may take, are we not driven to the conclusion that in the early history of the race, there was the need for intermarriage of the children of the same pair?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think the last part of the answer is the counter-punch to the atheist's objection because it shows that the atheist (who must be an evolutionist) also have an "incest problem". So how do you answer that?

              <p>An atheist believes that matter is all there is, which is why he cannot see how something done in the spiritual realm can affect the physical realm. But God is Spirit, and He spoke the material universe into existence. But even the most hardcore atheist will concede that in this world there are material and immaterial things, and the immaterial can affect the material. For example, depression or stress can lead to sickness.</p>
              <p>The saying that "no man is an island" is true. While we are held accountable for our own actions, our actions affect not just us but others as well. So when Adam fell, we fell in him, as did all creation. And because we are all in Adam, we inherit his sin nature as well. It's nothing to do with fairness or unfairness at all. We are all born into existing conditions. The solution is not to whine about the past, but to make conscious decisions that can make a difference in our future.</p>
              <p>Thanks for trying to don the atheist's hat. Don't worry I know you did not abandon the faith.</p>

              <p>Which is why the atheist need to get rid of that strawman and realise that he is NOT being judged for Adam's sin. He is being judged for his own sins. And that the reason why he sins is because he is a sinner. His spirit is dead in Adam but it can be made alive in Christ.</p>

              <p>The doctrine of Original Sin is that it was Adam's sin in the Garden of Eden which brought in death into the world. The entire creation groans as a result of that one act of rebellion. Because we are all descended from Adam, we inherit his nature, both physical and spiritual. Like I said, there is really nothing fair or unfair about this. Besides, the issue isn't whether we are born sinless, but that none of us can claim moral perfection.</p>
              <p>And I would also like to add that an atheist has no basis to call something fair or unfair, to do so would be to presuppose some objective standard of judgement which atheism does not have. So unless the atheist wishes to affirm the Biblical worldview or admits that he needs the Biblical worldview, he really shouldn't be complaining.</p>

              <p>But even not claiming to be morally perfect presupposes the existence of objective moral values. In fact, a consistent atheist ought not make any moral judgements at all since atheism supplies no such basis. But the reality is that atheists do not live by their creed at all, for they keep making moral judgements all the time. They live as though there is right and wrong, true and false, good and evil, and these are things that make sense within theism but not within atheism.</p>

              <p>Everyone is biased, whether you are a theist or an atheist.
                  There is simply no such thing as a neutral person. What's important
                  is that we have the correct bias. So it boils down to which bias is
                  the best bias to be biased with.</p>
              <p>I am certainly keen to take on your debate offer, but
                  I am concerned about the productivity of discussing
                  "problem Bible passages" with an atheist who does not share
                  the same worldview as a Christian. The only way that this can be
                  productive is that the atheist, for the sake of argument, be
                  willing to step into the worldview of the Christian and see the
                  answers from a Biblical perspective. Otherwise the atheist would
                  simply be predisposed to dismiss the answers. Would you be willing
                  to do that?</p>
              <p>Also, the topic is whether creationism is true (i.e. there
                  is a Creator-God) or whether evolutionism is true (i.e. chance is
                  the "creator", even though chance is not a thing or being) and I
                  think we should first try to focus on that level rather than dive
                  into these so-called Bible difficulties which is really a very wide
                  topic. In short, I think we ought to address the issue whether
                  those features seen in those creatures in Post #1 is best explained
                  by intelligence or by chance.</p>
              <p>Lest you think there is no answer at all to your question or
                  that I am trying to evade, your question is answered by
                  theologican Charles Ryrie:</p>
              <p>I think the last part of the answer is the counter-punch to the
                  atheist's objection because it shows that the atheist (who must be
                  an evolutionist) also have an "incest problem". So how do you
                  answer that?</p>

              <p>Ryrie figured out that the power of god allows the Adam's family to immune from genetic disorder. This sound reasonble if I believe the power of god. What is your views on DNA ? I am convinced that the science has produced logical evidence of supporting human and some animal species sharing the same ancestral roots. What is your view ?</p>
              <p>I have been travelling around the world quite a bit over the years. This is my observation. Most hotel has a bible in theroom. I always have a habit of flipping it. Recently, I observed that the new bible version do not have the book of genesis. In the past, there is genesis in bible as a starter. I think this is the better stop gap measure than Charles Ryrie's explanation. Omitting the troublesome book of Genesis is easier method. The new comers of christ will have less confusion in the future.</p>
              <p>In your last question, atheist has incest problem. I think you are referring to the context of  primitive organism. I agree. Even today, we are see animals inter-breeding. Example: orangutan in our zoo. I read from newspaper, son and mother together give birth to next generation. They are not atheist. They are animals. Atheist are people. It is because of this incest behavior in animals that make it harder of animal to develop in more superior species. Fortunately, the human species did better than them and evolve into a more stronger and intelligent state. You have any objective to what I say ?</p>

              <p><br>If that is your impression then you failed to read properly what I wrote. I said that atheists cannot account for moral values, not that atheists have no morals. Atheists BORROW the morality from theism but deny the source of those values. Why would you accuse me of arrogance simply because I point that out correctly? Mind you, atheists usually speak condescendingly about the intelligence of religious people and rave about their own intellectual superiority in being free from any God-idea compared to the deluded religious folk. How is that not arrogance?</p>

              <p>Ryrie said nothing about God's power protecting genetic disorder. What he wrote was that the original creation was perfect and marriage between siblings would have no problem. Even after the fall, the mutation of genes as a result of the Fall will take place over time so initially it would still have been OK until Moses' time.</p>
              <p>DNA is INFORMATION. Information presupposes intelligence. That's my view. The belief that humans and animals share common ancestry is just that, a BELIEF. Science does not prove that at all. It is better explained as common design since there is a common designer, GOD.</p>
              <p>I have no idea why the Bible in the hotels would remove Genesis. But your suggestion that removing Genesis would solve the problem is not a solution at all. Starting the Bible from Leviticus makes as much sense as watching Twilight from the second movie.</p>
              <p>Lastly, you have not addressed the issue of incest of humans according to evolution at all. You have sidestepped it by talking about other animals.</p>

              <p>1. You are begging the question here. You simply assert that humans evolve. But that is precisely the question being asked here: DID HUMANS EVOLVE? Or were they created? If creation has a so-called incest problem and thus ought to be rejected, then evolution also has its own incest problem which you acknowledged as well. And for you to claim that humans basically evolved better than the animals does not even explain WHY incest is morally wrong. In fact it commits the naturalistic fallacy. I know your explanation is empty of God-content, but I don't see how it is a BETTER explanation than mine, other than it having an anti-supernatural bias. And why talk about me worshipping Charles Ryrie? I no more worship him than you worship Charles Darwin. But then again, there are many atheist-evolutionists who apparently worship Darwin, thus there is Darwinism but I know of no Christian into Ryrism. And why talk about me quoting from others and taking it as God's truth? I no more does that than you quoting from scientists and evolutionists and taking it as infallible opinions. But then again, many atheists fall into scientism. So there you go.</p>
              <p>2. I did not say you look down on religious folks. I am telling you that many atheists do, taking pride in their "enlightened stance" that they are being rational rather than the religious-minded folks who are superstitious. If that is no arrogance then what is?</p>
              <p>3. You still missed my point. I said it again, I am not saying that atheists are immoral people or have no morals. I am saying that atheists CANNOT ACCOUNT for the existence of morals from within their atheism. Why do atheists know right or wrong, affirm good and evil? Not because their atheism provides them with the basis for making such declarations or discernment, but because they are BORROWING from the theistic worldview that affirms the existence of objective moral values and absolutes. Saying that you got your moral values from your parents does not explain the existence of moral values. You simply push back the question one generation back.</p>
              <p>4. You can't remove Genesis from the Bible and expect the Bible to make sense just like you cannot start watching the "Twilight" movie trilogy from the second movie, or Harry Potter from the second book onwards. Genesis is the book of beginnings, it's the foundational book of the Bible. Whatever reasons the publisher of the Bible may have removed Genesis, I don't think they did it for the reasons you cited.</p>
              <p>5. What exactly is the evidence for common ancestry? I suspect your evidence would involve a lot of circular arguments. If you cite homology as evidence that would only be begging the question.</p>
              <p>6. The English language does change over time, but that does not mean truth changes over time. William Paley appealed to design too with his watchmaker analogy. Be careful of trying to deny truth by appealing to postmodernism.</p>

              <p>Your approach is highly commendable.</p>
              <p>Atheists should never fear to debate on such matters at all, at least they should not follow the example of this <a href="http://creation.com/global-atheists-reject-debate-challenge">http://creation.com/global-atheists-reject-debate-challenge</a></p>

              <p>1. You are begging the question here. You simply assert that
              humans evolve. But that is precisely the question being asked here:
              DID HUMANS EVOLVE? Or were they created? If creation has a
              so-called incest problem and thus ought to be rejected, then
              evolution also has its own incest problem which you acknowledged as
              well. And for you to claim that humans basically evolved better
              than the animals does not even explain WHY incest is morally wrong.
              In fact it commits the naturalistic fallacy. I know your
              explanation is empty of God-content, but I don't see how it is a
              BETTER explanation than mine, other than it having an
              anti-supernatural bias. And why talk about me worshipping Charles
              Ryrie? I no more worship him than you worship Charles Darwin. But
              then again, there are many atheist-evolutionists who apparently
              worship Darwin, thus there is Darwinism but I know of no Christian
              into Ryrism. And why talk about me quoting from others and taking
              it as God's truth? I no more does that than you quoting from
              scientists and evolutionists and taking it as infallible opinions.
              But then again, many atheists fall into scientism. So there you
              go.</p>
              <p>2. I did not say you look down on religious folks. I am telling
              you that many atheists do, taking pride in their "enlightened
              stance" that they are being rational rather than the
              religious-minded folks who are superstitious. If that is no
              arrogance then what is?</p>
              <p>3. You still missed my point. I said it again, I am not saying
              that atheists are immoral people or have no morals. I am saying
              that atheists CANNOT ACCOUNT for the existence of morals from
              within their atheism. Why do atheists know right or wrong, affirm
              good and evil? Not because their atheism provides them with the
              basis for making such declarations or discernment, but because they
              are BORROWING from the theistic worldview that affirms the
              existence of objective moral values and absolutes. Saying that you
              got your moral values from your parents does not explain the
              existence of moral values. You simply push back the question one
              generation back.</p>
              <p>4. You can't remove Genesis from the Bible and expect the Bible
              to make sense just like you cannot start watching the "Twilight"
              movie trilogy from the second movie, or Harry Potter from the
              second book onwards. Genesis is the book of beginnings, it's the
              foundational book of the Bible. Whatever reasons the publisher of
              the Bible may have removed Genesis, I don't think they did it for
              the reasons you cited.</p>
              <p>5. What exactly is the evidence for common ancestry? I suspect
              your evidence would involve a lot of circular arguments. If you
              cite homology as evidence that would only be begging the
              question.</p>
              <p>6. The English language does change over time, but that does not
              mean truth changes over time. William Paley appealed to design too
              with his watchmaker analogy. Be careful of trying to deny truth by
              appealing to postmodernism.</p>

              <p>1. What are some of the evidence that convinced you that evolution is true? What in your opinion is the best evidence for evolution? Do you think that microbes to man evolution have been PROVEN? By what evidence? Or do you think it is a BELIEF about the past? Your answer as to why incest is wrong is because it will create pain in the family. Is the existence of pain the criteria to determine what is wrong? Pain is a physical sensation whereas saying something is wrong is a moral judgement. I think you are still committing the naturalistic fallacy here.</p>
              <p>2. Interesting. Do you think it is arrogant for atheists to call themselves "Brights"? Otherwise, on what basis do you accuse me of arrogance? Why would you not ascribe it to different tastes and refrain from passing judgement?</p>
              <p>3. Atheism MUST borrow moral values from somewhere since it does not have the ability to provide those moral values. The opposite of atheism is simply theism. Whether some religions kill or not is besides the point. If atheists think it is wrong to kill it would not be due to anything inherent in atheism's philosophy. Atheism in itself does not supply the basis for calling anything wrong. I hope you can see this point. Avoiding pain and unhappiness does not determine morality. Being happy does not mean something is good or true either. Objective moral values mean that some things are absolutely wrong regardless of how one feels.</p>
              <p>4. As far as I know, the book of Genesis has not been removed from the Bible. It may have been allegorised beyond recognition but it certainly have not been removed at all. Some Gideon Bibles also include the Psalms in their NT mini Bibles but one cannot conclude that they are trying to remove the rest of the OT.</p>
              <p>5. But what evidence for common ancestry are you talking about? Can you be more specific? In case you do not know, naturalism is just as much a religious view since it makes a dogmatic stance on metaphysics.</p>
              <p>6. What do you mean by not believing the truth? Do you believe there is such a thing as truth? </p>
