It is just a study of the nature of God. We will never fully understand God in this world.</div>

He &amp; many others killed Stephen just bcos Stephen took care of the poor widows in Acts. Anyway learned or not, Saul later Paul couldn't argue with God so he &amp; others had to stop God's mouth by executing Stephen or they will go crazy! Am i right? He mended tents bcos he didn't want to burden the poor church members or cause ppl to accuse him that he took money from the church &amp; profited from his ministry which so many r doing. His theology came from the risen Christ Himself by revelation not by simply studying &amp; memorising things from books which he did most of his life until Jesus appeared to him on the road to Damascus &amp; blinded him for 3 days bcos he was breathing murder to Christians. I was glad Stephen died &amp; sowed the seed for Saul's conversion. May God be highly exalted in the heavens &amp; earth! Praise &amp; worship you Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!</div>

I agree also that we can never fully understand God in this world bcos i am also in a fix abt many things. Very confused sometimes. Want to go ask God but i need to go heaven in this case that means i had to die! Scary thot. So can only trust by faith certain things like why so much unfairness, so much suffering, pain, sickness etc here. I hope u understand.</div>

In the bible, it talks about earth which is of 3-dimensional but it also talk about the spiritual world (heaven and hell) which is of another dimension. So God has talked to us in reference to two worlds - the earthly and the spiritual world. So sometimes, we will get confused. So I still beleive no one can fully understand the bible ba.</div>

Why bcos he used philosophical traditions to try to convince the greeks. He realised his mistake &amp; wrote in other epistles to other churches like Corinth saying he came to them not in great speeches but in preaching Christ Jesus &amp; Christ crucified. The power &amp; wisdom of God w/c sounded foolish to the Greeks &amp; stumbled the Jews. Foolish means stupid in old english, so Paul acted smart aleck &amp; tried to reason out with them to no use.<br><br>One very good eg of public speech was by Peter &amp; in one speech a mega church was born with 3000++ members! So how could an uneducated fisherman be so good in public speaking? It's bcos of the Holy Spirit!<br><br>Yes, i agree not all rich but the richer the church is the more problematic.
