I will not touch on predestination because it will take another thread, so i will briefly share my views about Limited Atonement. Note that i am coming from a presbyterian point of view.<br><br>I believe that ChristÂ’s atonement was sufficient for all, but efficient only for the elect. Here is where we derive the common statement "Sufficient for all, Effective for the Elect". It is correct to say that Christ died to save only the elect, when the context is the design and intention of the atonement, and not its sufficiency. That is quite a mouthful, so try to digest slowly.<br><br>If you need scripture verses, here you go:<br><br>Matthew 1:21 says, "...for He shall save His people from their sins." The term Â‘his peopleÂ’ here refers to the elect.<br><br>Ephesians 5:25 Â– "...even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it." Again the term Â‘churchÂ’ demarcates a group of people, not the whole world.<br><br>There is actually 3 views in Christian world,<br>1) Calvanistic - Upholds TULIP and most fundamental church<br>2) Non-Calvanistic - I can safely say all charismatic and armeinian churches<br>3) Hyper-Calvanistic - they base their faith on TULIP, quite a dangerous group<br><br>So thats about it for now. hope these gave you a better picture.<br><br></div>

He chose to let us choose. <strong>You miss the point here, God wants all to be saved, but He has always let us chose the path we walk in life. </strong></blockquote>Isn't this what your paragraph was saying? Let me quote your entire reply:<br><br><blockquote>Conditional Election of Arminianism<br><br>God's choice of certain individuals unto salvation before the foundation of the world was based upon His foreseeing that they would respond to His call. He selected only those whom He knew would of themselves freely believe the gospel. Election therefore was determined by or conditioned upon what man would do. The faith which God foresaw and upon which He based His choice was not given to the sinner by God (it was not created by the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit) but resulted solely from man's will. It was left entirely up to man as to who would believe and therefore as to who would be elected unto salvation. <strong>God chose those whom He knew would, of their own free will, choose Christ. Thus the sinner's choice of Christ, not God's choice of the sinner, is the ultimate cause of salvation. </strong><br><br>I think that this is wrong, we are all predestined to be saved, but God still gives us a choice. We choose whether we get saved or not. </blockquote>Bottomline - We still get to choose.</div>

My pastors every now and then remind us of the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ and the end times is getting nearer and nearer. So I can safely conclude that your point of view is absolutely incorrect, base on wrong perceptions, and unfounded. Moreover, I read quite a lot of the Calvinism vs Arminianism article and do not see any of them saying Arminianism is equivalent to A-MILLENNIALISM. You are the first one to tell me that leh.<br><br>Sorry if I a bit harsh in words, but I would like to remind you to do your homework before you jump to conclusions ma.
