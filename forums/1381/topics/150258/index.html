            <div class='col-md body'>Conditional Election of Arminianism<br><br>God's choice of certain individuals unto salvation before the foundation of the world was based upon His foreseeing that they would respond to His call. He selected only those whom He knew would of themselves freely believe the gospel. Election therefore was determined by or conditioned upon what man would do. The faith which God foresaw and upon which He based His choice was not given to the sinner by God (it was not created by the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit) but resulted solely from man's will. It was left entirely up to man as to who would believe and therefore as to who would be elected unto salvation. God chose those whom He knew would, of their own free will, choose Christ. Thus the sinner's choice of Christ, not God's choice of the sinner, is the ultimate cause of salvation.<br><br>I think that this is wrong, we are all predestined to be saved, but God still gives us a choice.

            <div class='col-md body'>Total Inability or Total Depravity of Calvinism<br><br>Because of the fall, man is unable of himself to savingly believe the gospel. The sinner is dead, blind, and deaf to the things of God; his heart is deceitful and desperately corrupt. His will is not free, it is in bondage to his evil nature, therefore, he will not - indeed he cannot - choose good over evil in the spiritual realm. Consequently, it takes much more than the Spirit's assistance to bring a sinner to Christ - it takes regeneration by which the Spirit makes the sinner alive and gives him a new nature. Faith is not something man contributes to salvation but is itself a part of God's gift of salvation - it is God's gift to the sinner, not the sinner's gift to God.<br><br>We are all spirits that have a soul and live in a body... we are first and foremost spiritual beings, and we are created in the image of God. Therefore to say that we are so woefully gone that we cannot choose good over evil is hard to believe... there are so many examples of people who have chosen good over evil... all the time. We all have faith, the question is whether we choose to exercise that faith.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Particular Redemption or Limited Atonement  of Calvinism<br><br>Christ's redeeming work was intended to save the elect only and actually secured salvation for them. His death was substitutionary endurance of the penalty of sin in the place of certain specified sinners. In addition to putting away the sins of His people, Christ's redemption secured everything necessary for their salvation, including faith which unites them to Him. The gift of faith is infallibly applied by the Spirit to all for whom Christ died, therefore guaranteeing their salvation.<br><br>Fallacy, Christ died for all mankind not just some... again it boils down to our choice. Do we accept the gift?</div>

How close the interpretations depends on how accurate individual understand God's words. God is the author of the bible. The writers were inspired to write the scripture, by the Holy Spirit who revealed to them what should be written.</div>
