            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Thomas Lee Zhi Zhi's letter, 'Condo success: What's faith got to do with it?' (Online forum, March 3) decries that Newton One's developer attributes - on signage - faith to its sales. He finds that it threatens our multi-religious orientation.<br>This is redolent of a former colleague who ascribed little successes to Him as in, 'He has blessed me in doing such-and-such' which, ad nauseam, grates.<br><br>I'm not areligious. But if I reserve coarse speech for all-guys carousing, shouldn't religious spouters save it for co-religionists? In the wrong contexts, language imposes and discomforts. It's worse if it is a gambit to proselytise.<br><br>Similarly, religious paraphernalia shouldn't obtrude. Commendably, some establishments secrete their staff's altars in the rear while some retail premises display their figurines or altars - of whatever faith - prominently.<br><br>There's a barber whose premises look like a shrine - his co-believer competitors shake their heads bemusedly each time he loses a customer to them. Is he announcing: 'For fellow-believers only'?<br><br>In secular contexts, manifesting your freedom to worship shouldn't presume on others' comfort zones. Even a home that looks like a shrine is incongruous, let alone business premises that exude worship. If religion defines your business, great! If not, don't unnerve and confuse your prospects!<br><br>Religiousness should raise empathy for those of different faiths or none. Self-misleading adherents do humanity, their faiths and co-believers a great disservice. Faiths should unite, not divide people - now especially.<br><br>Anthony Lee Mui Yu</blockquote>Follow up article on ST online today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I pass by the Newton signboard very often. Never find the signboard religiously offensive! why should anybody feel offensive? It didn't say "only God could have done it", or "Praise be to God who achieved what no man have ever succeeded."<br><br>I never ask "Which God?" when I saw the sign, but had assumed that the developer was a Christian. If the developer had prayed to God for the sales of the development, now it is "Sold Out",  should he say "Thanks"? If he continues to pray for the construction, and the project completed on schedule, within budget, without accident, shouldn't he also say "Thanks be to God"?<br><br>Can we express our gratitude to God in public then? I once saw a certain prize presentation to successful musical artists in Taiwan, and this group artist, comprising two man and a girl, was awarded the most welcomed new group, on receiving the prize, the leading lady singer said " firstly, I want to thank my God for this prize".  Shouldn't the guests present, as well as the millions of taiwanese in front of the TV, who are predominantly buddists feel offended? No, and nobody said the group mix religion with entertainment. May be there are a lot more tolerant than Singaporeans, or less sensitive?<br><br>We see the sign "Halal" in most food courts in Singapore, it is religious, isn't it? are we mixing religion with food business? no, we have learned to accept it.<br><br>Religious harmony comes with citizens who are more tolerant rather than more sensitive to religious expressions.</div>

If you want to sell to muslims, you need to be Halal. If you want to sell to the Jews, you must declare the food "Kosher". If you don't, you are not in this business!<br><br>The developer's big "Thank" came after the condos was sold. He did not start the selling by claiming that the condos is blessed by the pastors of all christians denomination. No Christians values were attached to the condos before it was sold out. Nobody even knew the developer was a Christian before the sales.  In what way was this sales of condos mixed with religion? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
