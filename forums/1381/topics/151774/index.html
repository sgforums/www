But the way to hell is broad like an expressway? Can we blame Christians or God for this? Bcos ppl are cowardly or forced to renounce faith by dictators or risk execution? We r very fortunate in S'pore with freedom of religion. Wait till we are born in China or Mideast. Then do we really dare to proclaim that we r Christians publicly? That's where the rudder meets the rope. Even falungong a false religion is being persecuted w members executed, jailed &amp; tortured etc in<br>China, what more Christians? Even ppl who speak for democracy &amp; human rights r being oppressed &amp; silenced there. So who to blame-God or Mao Tse Tung?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

As long as you know what you are doing can liao. Dun have to compare other Christians mah becos they are also sinners. Juz that they decided to place their faith in Christ. Nothing different unless they change from the inside out as they truely see God lo.<br><br>You attend church to understand more of God's word mah and learn to apply lo.

I dun consider myself a good christian too and I deem other christian to be good. So I decided to observe them because I want to learn to be a good christian but then as I find out more, the more I am disappointed. I realise that being a Christian doesn't mean you will be holy, you will be good, you will have a good life and most importantly you will not sin. It is really a relationship with God and as you walk each day with Him, let Him change you so that the fruits of the Spirit is evident in your life. Have you really understood God's word? Have you understood God's plan for you? Have you know His will in your life?</div>

I see many people starting to take their religion seriously. More people are also turning to buddhismand other religions.</div>
