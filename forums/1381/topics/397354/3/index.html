              <p>wow, to those who have contributed and suggested the above, kudos to you!</p>
              <p>You have proven Scriptures wrong when it refers to you (those who say there is no God) as "fools" in Psalm 14:1 and many other places. In fact, even though the root word of this word is "moros" in Greek, the equivalent of "moron" in today's English language (bet you must have guessed it too!), you are totally not living up to what Scriptures calls you!  I mean, you guys actually figured out the whole point of Christianity.  </p>

              <p>you <strong>dun</strong> have to give money to a church to be a christian.</p>
              <p>but when you truly are born again you realise the awe of God when the Spirit moves, you know you have a duty yourself to fulfill thecommandments in the Bible. Christianity is all about making decisions that please God.</p>
              <p>you can condemn it all to the leadership of the churches seeking for wealth and riches but I can tell you all these things will past away but his Word will remain forever. there will be people with wicked and deceitful ideas in which Satan clearly puts. do yuo realise Christianity is the most persecuted ideology in the world because we clearly stand true to what we know. the crucifixion of Christ was so real that the whole Earth rumbled and you saw people flying out of graves into the sky. these wre actual life accounts of non Christians.</p>
              <p>i dun believe in a story. i believe that God is moving and active. I've seen Him come through so many times and I know that my faith is built and will never be shaken/</p>
              <p>the whole point is that we have done wrong in our lives and that there is a need for us to made clean for it is intolerable to have sin in our lives. that is why God sent His Son, Jesus Christ who lived a holy life without any wrongdoing. For he is perfect he is able to purchase our sins with every nail and stripe he bore on the Cross so that we can all be washed clean and that when we put our faith in Jesus and choose to follow Him, we have a gift of eternal life with God. whatever you think, its up to you. i'm here just to sow the seed and i have done my part. i believe you will remember what i say when you truly see God at the end of your life. not to scare you but the truth is not easy to digest.</p>
