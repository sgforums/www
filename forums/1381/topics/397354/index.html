              <p>We should not be too persistent, the church is incorrect to do, we should allow the holy spirit to convict them of their sins and lead them to repent and to church, but we all must play our role to spread the gospel to those unsaved , as this will be the only means of exposing non christians (pre-believers NOT non-believers, atheists, check the difference of these words before you post !) to christ. </p>

              <p><br>I can only say that there is no such rule in the bible, not sure about how churches teach. TS is correct in saying there are Christians that are very persistent. But there are also Christians that are not persistent that does not appear in the public too. Because people only see those aggressive Christians in the open, that why the mentality that all Christians are like that. I'm bothered by some Christians as well in the street sometimes too =( but I'm not angry because it is out of goodwill that they preach.</p>

              <p>Its a numbers game. Really. The Math is simple. If you train 1 person to recruit 10, the 10 will go on to recruit 100. And the 100 will recruit 1000 and so on.</p>
              <p>As a church leader, imagine how much revenue you can potentially bring in if everybody gives 10% of their income to God! =D</p>
              <p>Some will, of course, feel the to give more than 10% as they believe that doing so will bring them more favours from God! =D Now dont bank on everyone doing that! </p>

              <p>Well,those are hardcore christians,from what i know,the 20%(i think) of the money given is usually used to sponsor groups based on religions like the boys and girls brigade(i am in the boy's brigade so i know)but remember,each church houses at least 1000+ devoters,which means,they have MONEY! well what can money do? help the poor and weak? 20% chance of that happening. From what i hear being the pastor for the church earns alot as i see from my officer...he lives quite a carefree life as a singer for the church...he lives in a 1 level terrence looking house behind the church and he seems to be very free...But most hardcore christians are goody two shoes actually,and the weekly prayers keep people together,which means.......once you went to a session,they will bite you and don't let go for like 6 months? I went to one since i am very free...and i felt disturbed...every 3 days i get a sms wanting me to go to the church sessions,camps and stuff like that.And they call me like twice a week? yucks<br><br>Advantages of being a Christian<br>You get blessed (or at least you think you are)<br>You don't lack friends<br>You get financial support if you are poor<br>You never get bored as there are ALWAYS outings,camps,sessions and stuff<br>You increase your social networking skills as you will learn to speak with more people<br>You get a better job oppurtunity as you could meet your next boss in a session</p>

              <p>most of the people are looking at earthly gains, don't they know religion is much more than just this ? is about souls and not just the impermanent body which will start rotting the moment we die. i think very few people have  deeper thoughts when comes to what is religion all about.</p>

              <p>LOL! It is very superficial if your beliefs in any religion is based on these kind of material factors.</p>
              <p>you made it seems like going to church is like going to a party, and missing the whole point about the basic requirement of being a member of any religion: The belief in God/Gods/ godesses etc.</p>
              <p>but well, it pretty well reflects the trend of youngster nowadays. joining a religion just for socialising.</p>
