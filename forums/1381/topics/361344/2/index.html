              <p>And do you know how much money he gets going overseas to preach ? Why does a servant of God need to get so much money in return for preaching in another church? Shouldn't this be done for free? At most his travel expenses should be paid, that is all.</p>
              <p>Do you know how much money he receives from his cds, books and dvds?</p>
              <p>compare this with 8k a month. Its nothing to him! so he conveniently chose to disclose to the WHOLE world that he stopped taking salary. LIKE HE IS SOME BIG HERO.</p>

              <p>6. kong hee sits on the board of the david yonggi;s full gospel church.</p>
              <p>7. sun ho dress like a slut but she is doing good deeds.</p>
              <p>8. they give money so they will get 100 fold back in return.</p>

              <p>how many times do you city harvest members want to repeat this? Do you think we are stupid? He declared it so loudly on city harvest website. Scared the whole world don't know?</p>
              <p>But do you know, that it such a coincidental timing that he stopped taking his 8k salary immediately after TT durai was being investigated? LOL</p>
              <p>And do you know how much money he gets going overseas to preach ? Why does a servant of God need to get so much money in return for preaching in another church? Shouldn't this be done for free? At most his travel expenses should be paid, that is all.</p>
              <p>Do you know how much money he receives from his cds, books and dvds?</p>
              <p>compare this with 8k a month. Its nothing to him! so he conveniently chose to disclose to the WHOLE world that he stopped taking salary. LIKE HE IS SOME BIG HERO.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think by not taking money from church itself is considered a noble cause. As for taking a token for preaching overseas, we really do not know how much the token is... But every worker deserves his pay, willing seller willing buyer kinda concept.</p>
              <p>Not that I am agreeable to this kind of concept, but if that's the way it is, then thats the way it is...</p>
              <p>As for selling of books, CDs &amp; DVDs, getting a royalty is not something against the law, technically speaking, its only business...</p>
              <p>Now now, its his own hands that created his worldly wealth, shouldn't we be more concerned about the loss?</p>

              <p>So how much money goes to mission funds and how much go to building your church and spending money on your silly sound systems and titanium walls??</p>
              <p>Judging from your posts, I can tell that youyayu is still most probably in sec school and very very immature in his christian walk.</p>
              <p>youyayu, firstly, what you need to do is read the entire bible and see for yourself if what the bible says actually is in line with what kong says.</p>
              <p>You may wish to also start doing your own research about 'prosperity gospel'. A simple google search on it will do.</p>
              <p>I am deeply concerned that many young teens like youyayu (note I am not targetting you, just using your nick as an example) blindly follow false prophets like kong hee without even knowing much about the christian faith.</p>
              <p>Here are some good articles about city harvest:</p>

              <p>There are at least 4 group of people who go to city harvest.<br> <br> 1.	Youth or teenagers who wanted some fun. CHC is one of the few churches which is modern and 'hip', focus on bright lights and loud music.<br> 2.	People who wanted to get rich.<br> 3.	People who truly believes in God but do not know how to filter “unwanted messages” like prosperity gospel.<br> 4.	People who truly believes in God and know how to filter “unwanted messages”</p>
              <p>Sadly,<br> Most people there belong to 1, 2 and 3.</p>
