              <p>What is the point in talking to you. You are a very ignorant christian. No wonder you are so supportive of JP.</p>
              <p>Tell me where in the bible talks about money ? Please point me out a verse?</p>
              <p>Do you not know that prosperity preaching is man-made? It is not a doctrine from God. Have you done ANY research on it yourself? Don't just listen to JP and follow what he says.</p>
              <p>If you do not know which church has one billion people, it shows you do not know much about christianity. It is now proven by you and many other 'megachurch' goers that they really don't know anything about other churches or denominations AT ALL. They are so ignorant, hence they believe everything their pastor says.</p>
              <p>I would urge you to do research on your own before posting here and embarassing yourself. It is also for your own good.</p>

Anyway you're telling us not to poke into other's business, but then here you are pocking in our business. Us criticising them is obviously none of your business, so why do you even bother poking your nose into this?</p>

              <p>What is the point in talking to you. You are a very ignorant

              <p>hehe...flame on...</p>
              <p>do the crows reap or sow??do they got fed??if God feeds even them, are you not worth so much more??blessings need not need to be given in terms of money..the blessings God wants us to have is to lead a happy and correct life according to his standards because he knows best..just like a car manufaacturer knows best how a car can perform under what conditions...and how then do we live according to his standards??by doing his will as in the bible..where do we get bible??either buy one or get a free one..it isnt wrong to earn money..because it is a medium of exhange for resources created by God...but too many scriptures shows hoarding excessive money is harmful..we will be too busy with that to live a good life according to his standards..</p>
