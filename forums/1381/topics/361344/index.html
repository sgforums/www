              building, pays good money to its staff too.<br> <br> The independent church paid one employee between $500,001 and $550,000
              in its last financial year, checks by The Straits Times showed.<br> <br> The church did not confirm if the amount went to its leader, Senior
              Pastor Joseph Prince, but told The Straits Times that its policy is to
              'recognise and reward key contributors to the church and Senior Pastor
              Prince is the main pillar of our church's growth and revenue'.</p>

              <p>Judge not bro, lest you be judged... Money making is a personal kind of matter... A chruch leader is expected to preach God's Word in a right way... If he did his part in this area, it should not be a problem...</p>

              <p>Last sentence says, not a lover of money... It gives others this kind of image that NCC is of that kind... Any NCC people want to give an explanantion how it was being put across in the church. We don't want to speculate...</p>

              <p>lol.. o.k. Cause they did say about paying me, but i said donate to church. Damn , i shouldve asked how much first. hahaha. Maybe i shouldve just payed 10% n keep the rest. he he. But dunno why that time i felt uneasy about getting money from church. Too use to putting in, as opposed to taking out.</p>

              <p>money and religion go hand in hand in the megachurches of today. especially 'commercialised businesses' like ncc and city harvest.</p>
              <p>Since their focus is on making money, they should be taxed like any other mnc.</p>
              <p>their members will argue they give to the poor and send their people to do mission works. But I ask them 'how much money goes to paying your church board members, to your grand buildings and marketing campaigns?'</p>
              <p>now compare this money to what they give to the poor and needy.</p>
