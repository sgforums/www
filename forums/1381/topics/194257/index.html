            <div class='col-md body'>A scenario and some questions:<br><br>If u are a Christian leader living in turbulent times where Christian faith were shaken, and ur enemies want ur blood, would u resort to burning one of ur enemy at the stake becoz he has wrote heretical stuff abt the trinity?<br><br>Would u defend ur actions by saying:"Is it not murderous for this man to bring others to hell?" After u burn this guy, ur enemies become fearful and fled from u.<br><br>U are a Christian leader who have written great treatises abt the bible and u believe the only way to god is salvation by faith (and the five point of calvinism). U have just written:"Every murder is homicide against God."<br><br>How would ur action be? Would u kill the heretic to save others? Would u kill ur enemy to save urself?<br></div>
