              <p>the word "santanic" came in your statement. People can talk about heaven and hell, if you don't believe then there is nothing true or false about something that doesn't exist. if God and Satan don't exist then why are things satanic?</p>
              <p>But to the Buddhists who believe in karma, they will continue to encourge people to do good. To the Christians who believe in heaven and hell, they will continue to encourage people to accept the way to heaven and not hell.</p>

              <p>Indeed, if God doesn't exist, then satan isn't real. Christians believe that God is the creator of the universe, and there is only One God. If Christians believe also in other religions then they are not Christians.</p>

              <p>I think there are some big hints in Genesis 1:1-29:</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-1" class="versenum">1</sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup id="en-NIV-2" class="versenum">2</sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of 
                          the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-3" class="versenum">3</sup> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. <sup id="en-NIV-4" class="versenum">4</sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup id="en-NIV-5" class="versenum">5</sup> God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-6" class="versenum">6</sup> And God said, “Let there be a vault of waters to separate land from land, and land from heaven.” <sup id="en-NIV-7" class="versenum">7</sup> So God made the vault and separated the land of the left from the land of the right. And it was so. <sup id="en-NIV-8" class="versenum">8</sup> God called the vault “sea” and "ocean". And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.</p>
              <p><sup id="en-NIV-24" class="versenum">9</sup> And God said, “Let the land teem with creatures according to their
                           kinds: the livestock, the creatures that please God, and the
                          many wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. <sup id="en-NIV-25" class="versenum">10</sup> And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-24" class="versenum">11</sup> And God said unto the Godless wild creatures of strange tongues, “Suffer your brothers go where they want to go, lest my fleet cross the oceans into your seas as I did on the first day. Though you hold my credit, I am God, and bid your creatures of the land, sea and air read the last chapter of my book before I say unto your land "Let there be a bright light!"</p>

              <p>Hindu God - Based on good works and praying to the Hindu Gods</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jewish God *Yahweh - There is no heaven or hell in Judaism</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddhism - Depending on the sect, some Buddhists do believe in reincarnation, heaven and hell for ALL humans but some Buddhists do not believe in these places.</p>

              <p>
              </p><p>Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet. A human being is a part of the whole, called by us the "Universe," a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest – a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.<br><strong><em>—Albert Einstein (1879–1955)</em></strong></p>
