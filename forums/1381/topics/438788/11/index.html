              <p>1. Lol based on your narrow interpretations of the bible, you belong to the creationist-fundamentalist denomination. There are many other denominations which do not agree with you. Stop trying to pretend like the whole christianity is "united spiritually". Even within singapore, there are so many doctrine/belief issues christians argue about. I know because i have visited many diff churches before. Tongues and healings is one hot issue!</p>
              <p>2.  Who are you to say that that is what defines a christian? just because majority of christians believe jesus is god doesnt make it a hard fact. Many christians call themselves christians even though they do not believe jesus is god. These are the mormons and the JWs. And worldwide, they add up to the numbers of christians under the umbrella of christianity. Who are you to throw them out? Just because you are the majority you think you can overrun them?</p>
              <p>3. Again, if thebible was straight to the point, precise and direct, there wouldnt be 20,000 denominations, hundreds of versions of bibles and so many different interpretations  and kinds of christianities.</p>

              <p>1. On what basis do you say my interpretation of the Bible is narrow? Like it or not, truth is by nature narrow, either a proposition is true or it is false. Is insisting that 1+1=2 being narrow minded? Yes, I am one of those people who believe that the earth is only about 6000 years old. Does calling me names make you happy, or make my belief false? Yes there are many who do not agree with me, but so what? Am I saying that everyone must believe the same from A-Z? No, and you don't know anything about the spiritual unity I am talking about. Again this shows how shallow you were when you supposedly left the Christian faith.</p>
              <p>2. Who are you to say that who am I to say what a Christian is? Is this the childish game you want to play? I am telling you that the Bible does not view as believers those who deny that Jesus is God in the flesh. I also never said that many believe in Jesus' deity means it is a fact. But it is a fact that the Bible teaches the deity of Christ. And I said before that Christian is now more used as a cultural label, or used loosely. Anyone can claim to be a Christian, in the same way that Jesus warned that many will claim to be Christ. We need to be discerning and not just accept what people call themselves. There are wolves in sheep clothings everywhere.</p>
              <p>3. The reasons for denominations are complex and it is a reductionistic fallacy to attribute it to just one factor, that the Bible is unclear. If the Bible is so unclear as you said, how come it is so clear to you that you know it should be discarded and rejected? You mean it is unclear to Christians but clear to non-Christians? That's just you engaging in special pleading.</p>
