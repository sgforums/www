              <p>1. Yes the universe is complex but it does NOT HAVE to be the work of something or someone out there. It could always have been. THIS is one possibility.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If you say it's your God who did it, where is your proof? AH YOU WOULD SAY your proof is in your bible. Well, muslims, hindus, sikhs and even taoists all use their holy books to prove that it was their Gods who did it to. Now, who are you to think that it was only your God who did it? Maybe all the Gods did it together?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why should living in the year 2011 means we ought not believe that those who reject Christ as Savior would end up in Hell? BTW, the year 2011 us made with reference to the birth if Jesus Christ and He taught a lot about Hell and its dreadful reality. And Jesus is not a liar.</div>

              1. The idea that the universe is eternal (a metaphysical claim, not a scientific one) has already been debunked by what science has known in the last century. It is no longer a possibility at all. And I thought you were boasting about being scuentific? 
              
              2. You asked why if there is a Creator it must be the Christian God and not others. Why don't you argue and defend that case if you think it so? Why should it be narrow minded to believe in one God? You are an atheist who believe in NO God at all. Why doesn't that make you even more narrow minded, if not closed minded?
              
              3. Yes the Bible called bats as birds since it does not use modern scientific terms like mammals. It is a catch all term to designate the flying animals. So why are you imposing modern terminology and scientific precision terms on the Bible? It is as silly as saying that the Bible is wrong because the word dinosaur is not found there but this term was only invented in 1841!

              <p>It is erroneous to think that belief in God would be a science stopper. In fact it is this belief that provided the impetus for modern science. And there are many scientists who concur that there is a God.</p>

              <p>many scientists who believed in god? u say one or what? any evidence to support your contention?</p>
              <p>in fact creationism has no place in this world at all, as it is backward, simple and naive. I would shudder to think that if we believed in god, society would be extremely backward. who would want to study, experiment and innovate when all day long, we are praying to god and believing all this dope.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rooney, you need to meet more people. I personally know of Christians who are scientists. And your polemic against creationism is just that, mere polemic. In fact, evolutionists like Dawkins are intimidated by creationists that they do not even dare to debate with them in public. Of course they give crap excuses like not wishing to dignify the opposition blah blah blah. I think he is just being a coward.</div>
