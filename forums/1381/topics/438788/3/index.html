              <p>By your Matthew 25:31, a Christian who brings thousands to God and sucks them thousands of their blood and treasure, is a goat.</p>

              <p>no wonder Neal of Matrix, wants to be out of the matrix. if this is the system, then I wouldn't want to be a part of it, not that it exists anyway. man created god, that is why it is too human to be divine. how divine can this type of system in it, just doesnt make sense of it all. luckily science, medicine and techonoly is evidence based discovery. otherwise I wonder what society will be like based on dogmas and commandments. backwards you bet.</p>
              <p>when I was young, my mom told me to pray to the books god (if there is such a thing as god of study) in a temple, saying I will be good in study if I pray to it. When I had stomach ache, she burnt the amulet into the water and I have to drink it.but I dun blame her, cos she is ignorant, as most uneducated people in that generation era are. even those who are highly educated also doesnt fare better, to believe in this kind of dogma that are not relevant in this day and age of discoveries. But I dun blame them, because it has been like this for the past 2 millenniums. but once they start asking questions and the answers given, they will start to realise perhaps there is no god after all.</p>

              You are correct about that Christian probably being seen as a goat due to his own selfish desires.
              
              "And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold." And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost." (Luke 19:8-10) As you can see, it is clear that Zaccheus realised that he had to make up for his previous sins to show his sincerity about turning over a new leaf to our Lord. Jesus, in His love for us, doesn't sit back and wait for us to repent. He makes it as easy as possible for us to do so, BUT we still have to do the repenting.
                      
              As for the almost-stoning of the adulteress, this incident actually shows how Jesus forgave her and yet upheld Jewish law at the same time, by reminding her executors that they have no right to condemn others if they themselves are hardly perfect. Hmm, come to think of it, this applies to many in this forum who choose to offend, insult and criticise others, not realising that they themselves show even worse behaviour.
                      
              And even if our Lord chooses to forgive others on His own accord regardless of what they may or may not have done, who are we to question His mercy? This is also shown in your quoted story about the vineyard owner who hired workers. Only He can see right into our hearts and truly understand our sincerity.

              <p>I guess Jesus will forgive and admit to heaven those he sees fit to, and we cannot complain as we have at some point sinned in our lives.</p>
              <p>Furthermore it is not the heinousness of the sinner's deeds, but how much remorse he feels, that matters. I guess we'll meet a great diversity of people in heaven.</p>
              <p>I hope in choosing to accept him in my last days, I will not be seen as too grave a sinner, will have opportunity to accept and will be seen as having sincerity.</p>
              <p>*About meeting people in heaven, why do Christian widows remarry? Won't the first deceased after all his waiting, have to go alone while seeing his wife and children call another man husband or father, for all eternity?</p>

              <p>Oh and since you respond with such grace, let me ask another question.</p>
              <p>1. Heaven is perfect, and we can have anything we want. Say bubble tea (an innocent pleasure, notice I am not saying we would be rich). However, we would be in our highest moral states, having zero greed and desire to consume. Would we want bubble tea in heaven? Furthermore, the only thing we would want is God, because nothing is better. God is infinitely good and we would want infinitely more of him to the exclusion of other things.</p>
              <p>Aside from God, will there be any point in having all these wonders of heaven?</p>
              <p>2. We would be in our highest moral states, our sins would be washed away.</p>
              <p>Is this at all possible? We would be sinless, and therefore equal to God, and yet nothing on earth or in heaven can equal God!</p>
              <p>3. Being infinitely patient I might be happy to queue for my own bubble tea. Yet you, my infinitely helpful friend, would do it for me. Who would buy it, or is heaven so perfect that it appears out of thin air?</p>
