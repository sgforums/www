              Hi Alize, I actually did mention non-Christians in my post too. What I said was that at the end of the day, God looks into our hearts and knows what our intentions are. He is love, so if people act out of love for others, even if they are non-Christian, they will have the same opportunity as Christians to spend eternal life with the Lord. 
              
              So yes, this includes people who have never heard of Christianity and infants, since they are incapable of making a moral decision at that age.

              Jesus mentioned very clearly who will be admitted into His kingdom in Matt 25:31-46. Will these people be Christians? Not necessarily - it will be those who have reached out to others. As James 2:14-26 also mentioned, no point trumpeting the fact that we are Christians if we don't lift a finger to help others. And according to 1 Corinthians 13, which of the 3 Christian virtues of Faith, Hope and Love are the most important? 
              
              Yes, no one goes to the Father except through Jesus Christ, because He enables all good and holy people, including non-Christians who have loved the way He did, to enter His kingdom.

              Not true, many Christians also believe in faith and acts of charity for salvation. Actually, ALL Christians believed in this for 1500 years from the time of Jesus Christ until differing beliefs started taking shape after that.

              Frankly, I don't worry about this because Jesus Christ gave us His church - the church that existed from day 1 since His resurrection and has not changed till now, 2000 years later, to guide us along. So it is not my interpretation, but that of a billion other people united in faith.
              
              And the God that the church reveals to us - the one and the same God that I know, is not a God that runs heaven like an exclusive membership club for only Christians. He is a God who is compassionate and merciful to all, and all we have to do is to respond to His invitation and do His will - showing His love to others.

              <p>Not true, many Christians also believe in faith and acts of
              charity for salvation. Actually, <span>ALL</span> Christians believed in this for 1500 years from the time of Jesus
              Christ until differing beliefs started taking shape after that.</p>

              <p>so are you saying many christians are getting it wrong nowadays?</p>
              <p>many christians do not believe good works is a requirement to attain salvation.  believing in god alone is enough.</p>

              <p>Jesus mentioned very clearly who will be admitted into His
              kingdom in Matt 25:31-46. Will these people be Christians? Not
              necessarily – it will be those who have reached out to others. As
              James 2:14-26 also mentioned, no point trumpeting the fact that we
              are Christians if we don’t lift a finger to help others. And
              according to 1 Corinthians 13, which of the 3 Christian virtues of
              Faith, Hope and Love are the most important?</p>
              <p>Yes, no one goes to the Father except through Jesus Christ,
              because He enables all good and holy people, including
              non-Christians who have loved the way He did, to enter His
              kingdom.</p>

              <p>I see. As a Christian, if I bring thousands to God but take huge amounts of money from them to enrich myself, will I go to heaven?</p>

              Perhaps. If Christians believed in both faith AND acts of charity for the first 1500 years, who are we to suddenly change that? If you look at all the parables that Jesus spoke about in the Gospels, ask yourself honestly - are they mostly about faith or acts of charity?
