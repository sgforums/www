            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's predestination. If God is sovereign, He controls everything right down to the speck of dust. So man has no choice. It seems we have a choice when the gospel is preached but really we didn't. God knows in advance who will be saved &amp; who will not. He already predestined it. So too bad for some vessels of dishonour. Good for the vessels of honour. It seems quite unfair but God is sovereign. He rules over all. May God have mercy on me.<br><br>In another related topic is God's mercy. Altho He might have predestined some for hell, He might still change His mind &amp; relent according to His great love &amp; mercy. God did relent many times in the bible. For eg nineveh case. He also repented before the flood. So God can still change His mind as to the predestiny of many humans on earth. I was wondering whether God will throw Christians into hell then if He does change His mind abt some Christians?<br><br>So predestination doesnt mean fixed destiny. God is a living God. He is also a loving &amp; gracious God. He can change this &amp; that. He will show love &amp; mercy to the undeserving. He is not subject to our will or fancy. May God have mercy on my soul! May He choose me &amp; never leave me nor forsake me. It's fearful to fall into the hands of God. Worship Him in fear &amp; trembling. Work out our salvation in fear &amp; termbling.</div>

I find it very funny &amp; very angry! Why God so cruel??<br><br>He is even more cruel if there is predestination. Predestination only benefits those who believe. Those who don't believe leh?

If He is really worthy, people will choose what. &amp; also why He allow muslims, buddhists etc to be born Muslims, buddhists? Why He allow so many religions to confuse people?

            <div class='col-md body'>During the Katrina hurricane, alot of people waited in agony for a long time to be rescued. I remember there was a footage of a rescue boat coming by to save a number of people sitting on the roof. There was this woman with her cat. They wanted to take her in the boat but she had to leave her cat behind. And I could hear someone in the background saying that she would rather die than be parted from her cat. Indeed she refused. The rescue boat moved on and I don't know what happend to her.<br><br>How about his analogy: God has provided the only means of rescue...like the rescue boat. His intention is to save all but people have a choice as to whether they would accept the boat ride. Some do and are saved. But there are those like that woman who would not give up her possessions and would rather die with them. The voice in the background I heard knew that woman and before she responded that voice could already pre-determine her decision---that she would say 'no'. God is omniscient and knows that some would never accept the free gift of salvation and are predestined to be damned. So in that sense the predestination is a natural consequence of foreknowledge:<br><br>Rom 8:29-<br>" For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."<br><br>There are differing views on this and a doctrinal debate over hundreds of years is not going to be easily resolved in a forum. That is how I see it anyway.<br><br>As for those who would exploit doctrinal differences to cast aspersions on Christianity, perhaps it is best to simply ignore them. The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."<br><br>Don't suffer fools gladly.<br><br></div>
