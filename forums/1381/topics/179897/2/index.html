If we do not have free will we cannot be held responsible for what we do.<br><br>According to Christians, God is all-knowing - he knows all the past, all the present and all the future. If this is so, then God must know everything we do long before we do it. This means that our whole life must be predetermined and that we act not according to the free exercise of our wills but according to our predetermined natures. If we are predetermined to be good we will be good and if we are predetermined to be evil we will be evil. We will act not according to our will or choice but according to the way God has already foreseen we will act. Although Christians will insist that we do have free will, God's omniscience simply makes this logically impossible. And that people will act only as God determines is verified in the Bible<br><br>If people are evil it is because God has chosen to make them evil (Rom 1:24-2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and caused them to disobey him (Rom 11:32). If they do not understand God's message it is because he has made their minds dull (Rom 11:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and caused them to be stubborn (Rom 9:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. God prevents the Gospel from being preached in certain areas (Act 16:6-7) and he fixes long before it will happen when a person will be born and when he or she will die (Act 17:26). Those who were going to be saved were chosen by God before the beginning of time (ii Tim 1:9 Eph 1:11). If a person has faith and is thereby saved, their faith comes from God, not from any effort on their part (Eph 2:9-10). One may ask "If a person can only do what God predetermines them to do, how can God hold them responsible for their actions?" The Bible has an answer for this question.<br><br>But one of you will say to me: "If this is so, how can God find fault with anyone? For who can resist God's will?" But who are you, my friend, to answer God back? A clay pot does not ask the man who made it: "Why did you make me like this?" After all, the man who makes the pot has the right to use the clay as he wishes, and to make two pots from one lump of clay, one for special occasions and one for ordinary use. And the same is true of what God has done (Rom 9:19-22).<br><br>So apparently in Christianity a person's life and destiny are due purely to the whim of God and as mere humans we have no right to complain about what God has decided for us. The idea that we are all predetermined is quite consistent with the idea of an all-knowing God but it makes nonsense of the concept of making a' effort to do good or avoid evil.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by neutral_onliner:</div><div class="quote_body">For the religious life to be meaningful we must have free will, we must be able to choose between good and evil. If we do not have free will we cannot be held responsible for what we do.<br><br>According to Christians, God is all-knowing - he knows all the past, all the present and all the future. If this is so, then God must know everything we do long before we do it. This means that our whole life must be predetermined and that we act not according to the free exercise of our wills but according to our predetermined natures. If we are predetermined to be good we will be good and if we are predetermined to be evil we will be evil. We will act not according to our will or choice but according to the way God has already foreseen we will act. Although Christians will insist that we do have free will, God's omniscience simply makes this logically impossible. And that people will act only as God determines is verified in the Bible<br><br>If people are evil it is because God has chosen to make them evil (Rom 1:24-2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and caused them to disobey him (Rom 11:32). If they do not understand God's message it is because he has made their minds dull (Rom 11:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and caused them to be stubborn (Rom 9:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. God prevents the Gospel from being preached in certain areas (Act 16:6-7) and he fixes long before it will happen when a person will be born and when he or she will die (Act 17:26). Those who were going to be saved were chosen by God before the beginning of time (ii Tim 1:9 Eph 1:11). If a person has faith and is thereby saved, their faith comes from God, not from any effort on their part (Eph 2:9-10). One may ask "If a person can only do what God predetermines them to do, how can God hold them responsible for their actions?" The Bible has an answer for this question.<br><br>But one of you will say to me: "If this is so, how can God find fault with anyone? For who can resist God's will?" But who are you, my friend, to answer God back? A clay pot does not ask the man who made it: "Why did you make me like this?" After all, the man who makes the pot has the right to use the clay as he wishes, and to make two pots from one lump of clay, one for special occasions and one for ordinary use. And the same is true of what God has done (Rom 9:19-22).<br><br>So apparently in Christianity a person's life and destiny are due purely to the whim of God and as mere humans we have no right to complain about what God has decided for us. The idea that we are all predetermined is quite consistent with the idea of an all-knowing God but it makes nonsense of the concept of making a' effort to do good or avoid evil.<br><br></div></blockquote>So God - according to you, must have "pre-determined" you for posting this "predetermination theory" !<br><br>If that is the case, you can just sit back and do nothing - since God predetermined everything.  Your body and arms and legs will move accordingly to do what is pre-determined.   Well, start doing it - you got to do it in order for people to find "evidence" in your pre-supposed ideas.  Then after "one week", you tell me what God has "pre-determined" for you.<br><br>You have a good way of picking what to believe and what not to - even though you are a self proclaimed - what ? - Strong Atheist ?  Since you like to matriculate your thoughts - tell me - how do you categorise between a strong and weak atheist ?  What ? a strong Atheist do not believe in the existence of God "more" ? Huh ? Isnt that contradictory to your theory of absolutness in evidencing the unseeing ?<br><br>Define God ? You cant even define what you proclaim as an Atheist.  Who are you to define God ?<br><br>"Only female give life" -  So God is female ?  So now the male sperm is but a lifeless splurt of pleasure ?  Since when does females became mosquitoes?<br><br>You are attempting to define within your conjecture as a human, living a life of experience according to your own.  But the reality of this world and the love of our Lord is not this shallow.<br><br>Evidence for God ? There are Billions of them in this phyiscal world and many of which are walking.  A person who tell you his most initmate encounters with God is more precious than proclaimation of fossils found in some caves which time stamps keep changing as the scientist change their underwears.<br><br>Stop insulting our Lord.<br><br></div>

It can, for example, be proved that there is no even prime number greater than two. Other people use to say that there is no way to prove if there is a god or not, or even that we cannot get any knowledge of god (agnosticism).
