If it is going to interest you, I am not one of those who believe that creation took place in 6-24 hr days.... but this is just my personal view. In any case, I don't see it as holding a conflicting view of the Bible. There are many parts of the Bible that is written as analogies and Jesus Himself told many parables to illustrate specific points.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">I am puzzled by tis explanation. God gives the punishment, the punishment is suffering. (tat particular) Punishment=suffering. Now u telling me they r not the same thing. Wat is the technical difference between these 2 ?<br></div></blockquote>This is simple. Punishment is something that someone inflicts upon oneself, suffering is what one feels. Obviously, in many cases, punishment can result to suffering. However one need to understand that there are cases where there is suffering but no punishment, and vice versa. At the end of the day, the individual has to decide if he is suffering or not.<br>I am diabetic.... but am I suffering? Sure, from the figure of speech, it can be said that "I am suffering from a disease", but in my own mind, I am not suffering. I only happen to have a disease and have come to terms with it and take care of my diet so that this disease to not worsen. But am I suffering, of course not.<br>Punishment.... say I am not happy with my son's results and I punish him by not allowing him to watch TV. In the meantime, he finds other things to do... did he suffer? No.....!<br><br>I am sure you'd say that my explanation is probably too simplistic, it probably is, but all I am trying to do is to differentiate the issues between punishment and suffering.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Suffering, if u follow genesis, did follow from disobedience. However technically the creator of suffering is still god, who implement it as suffering to the people. It is not men who have the power to create suffering and worse still implement it on themselves</div></blockquote>Ok, putting it this way is not too incorrect. But let's take a step back, we cut ourself, we bleed. So we can also say that God created the bleeding. Or if I spill my coffee now, I'd screw up my keyboard, and again hold God responsible for my damaged laptop.... it this a fair game?<br>Yup, God created the whole infrastructure of spaceship earth. He created consequences, but we are responsible for the consequences, not Him....<br></div>

For the information of the other readers, the passage quoted by dave is from Exodus 4:11.<br><br>The context of the verse is when God told Moses to go and have his chat with the Pharaoh. God is telling Moses that Moses is only an instrument, and all Moses needed to do is GO. Everything else that needed to be done is done through the strength of the Lord.<br><br>Going back to the context of this thread, being deaf, mute or blind is a physical condition. It does not mean that a man that is deaf or mute or blind is SUFFERING.<br><br>My advice to you, young dave, is, when you are quoting scripture, please check the context of why it was written. Just lifting a verse out of it's original context does not do justice to the Word Of God!</div>

Suffering is a state of mind.
