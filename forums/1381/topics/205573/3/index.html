Suffering exists simply and tat cause suffering. Tat is it. Without suffering, everybody is in a non-suffering state and tat is wat we want. Same as heat, everything exists because there is heat.

If there is, I'd like to have that quotation pointed out to me. I'd rather view it as suffering may be necessary in order for us to know what is good. My current stand? Yup, suffering can be good, when there is a lesson learnt, and an objective achieved.... which obviously has nothing to do with people in poverty...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ben1xy:</div><div class="quote_body">Another question i would like to pose... is there something called needless suffering? Where suffering happens not for the better good, but juz happens abitrarily?<br></div></blockquote>Sure there is needless suffering. I'd say that these are the suffering that people refuse to come to terms with. Say, a love one dies and those who survived the deceased continues to grief over the loss. Coming to terms with it will put an end to the suffering.... obviously there are other more severe examples which I may not be able to quote.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ben1xy:</div><div class="quote_body">instead of your son's example.. people use the classic example of a parent who's kid is in ICU. They send him to the hospital against his own wishes and the son has deemed his hospital stay as suffering. but this is not the case as his parents are doing this for the betterment of his health. However, unlike God, the parent will try to explain and be around the kid... this contrast with the silence of God, which gives little consolation to sufferers.<br></div></blockquote>Silence of God or deafness of men? We need also to come to terms with that.<br><br>It all goes back to what is the definition of suffering to the individual......<br>Physical pain? Sickness? Depravation of certain niceties in life? Lack of the essentials? Lack of wealth?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Ok, you example is still the Genesis account. Personally, I am not one of those who subscribe to the "literal" account of Genesis but as an analogical approach(yup, some of my Christian brethen may flame me for this one). I see Genesis as more of an philosophical version of creation. I also subscribe to the "Old Earth" theory of creation. </blockquote>Fair enough, then can u explain wat is your interpretation of the genesis 3:14-19 using an analogical approach<br><br><blockquote>The PUNISHMENT is directly implimented by God, the SUFFERING is the consequences of the punishment. Technically very different. </blockquote>I am puzzled by tis explanation. God gives the punishment, the punishment is suffering. (tat particular) Punishment=suffering. Now u telling me they r not the same thing. Wat is the technical difference between these 2 ?<br><br><blockquote>So going to my POV of an analogical Genesis account, it is to show the consequences of disobedience. Therefore, to me, suffering is still the consequence of disobedience, the details are less important.</blockquote>Suffering, if u follow genesis, did follow from disobedience. However technically the creator of suffering is still god, who implement it as suffering to the people. It is not men who have the power to create suffering and worse still implement it on themselves</div>
