Christian are the most blessed. if you are a unbeliever and you don't think so, it's ok. you may stop reading.<br><br>Please don't tie in death (for believer) as suffering. many of the new testiment believer Fell asleep before they died. eg acts 7:60. so is sleeping a suffering?<br><br>Moses walked to his burial place and the bible says his eyes are not weak nor his strength gone. suffering ?? deut 34:7 He is over hundred years old. He knows he's going home. He has to die cos Jesus has not yet come.<br><br>Paul booast about his suffering 2 cor 11:16. He must have enjoyed with what we see as suffering for him to say that. and peter ask us to rejoice in suffering in 1 peter. so what is suffering if u can rejoice ? suffering and rejoice don't seem to match.<br><br>I have seen many christian being heal and they are not trouble by the medical report but trusted God that they will be healed. some people trusted the medical report thus self made suffering and say aiya why God this and that. reminds me on the stroy of Job.<br><br>well, for people born blind, Jesus answer in the bible.whose sin casue that? father , mother , adam... Not a problem. Creation have fallen (that's y we need a new body)but now it's time for redemption that the glory may reveal in him. cannot blame God for people born blind, blame sin cause by adam that creation have fallen.<br><br>God don't change his mind but we change.(sometime we believe sometime we don't) we have to ask for blessing and protection constantly thru prayer. ( that's y Jesus teach us to pray "give us today our daily bread." y not yearly or eternal bread ? then no need to pray anymore right?) If you ask for something yet don't believe God will supply ( aka try try) sure won't happen one. and sometime when thing don't happen soon enough, devil taking the opportunties saying won't happen one, God will bless meh ? what have u done to deserve it?!? then loose hope and try something else. oh man, the devil's same trick on adam and eve works again.<br><br>Jesus never went to the hospitals in Isreal and say, ok everybody get up and go home. But he heal those who came to him. and he sometime ask sick ppl, "do you want to be well?"John 5:6. if the answer is No. The rest is history.<br><br>i'm not a teacher or ministry worker or anything but a believer. i'm just sharing my 2 yrs experience walking with the Lord.<br><br></div>

He knows he's going home. He has to die cos Jesus has not yet come.<br><br>Paul booast about his suffering 2 cor 11:16. He must have enjoyed with what we see as suffering for him to say that. and peter ask us to rejoice in suffering in 1 peter. so what is suffering if u can rejoice ? suffering and rejoice don't seem to match.<br><br>I have seen many christian being heal and they are not trouble by the medical report but trusted God that they will be healed. some people trusted the medical report thus self made suffering and say aiya why God this and that. reminds me on the stroy of Job.<br><br>well, for people born blind, Jesus answer in the bible.whose sin casue that? father , mother , adam... Not a problem. Creation have fallen (that's y we need a new body)but now it's time for redemption that the glory may reveal in him. cannot blame God for people born blind, blame sin cause by adam that creation have fallen.<br><br>God don't change his mind but we change.(sometime we believe sometime we don't) we have to ask for blessing and protection constantly thru prayer. ( that's y Jesus teach us to pray "give us today our daily bread." y not yearly or eternal bread ? then no need to pray anymore right?) If you ask for something yet don't believe God will supply ( aka try try) sure won't happen one. and sometime when thing don't happen soon enough, devil taking the opportunties saying won't happen one, God will bless meh ? what have u done to deserve it?!? then loose hope and try something else. oh man, the devil's same trick on adam and eve works again.<br><br>Jesus never went to the hospitals in Isreal and say, ok everybody get up and go home. But he heal those who came to him. and he sometime ask sick ppl, "do you want to be well?"John 5:6. if the answer is No. The rest is history.<br><br>i'm not a teacher or ministry worker or anything but a believer. i'm just sharing my 2 yrs experience walking with the Lord.<br><br></div></blockquote>Icemoon, you know the cheng2 gong1 shen2 xue2 tat i said about?<br><br>Success theology(direct translation)<br><br>I guess this is a good example.<br><br>Illvison:<br>If i pray and say may God heal my illness, will God do it immediately?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, i feel that after one prays for healing, one shld be in the right mind that God's will is THE BEST, and nt think that God will definitely heal one, cos God has the will whether or nt to.<br><br>If every prayer God will listen to, then God isnt God, but a all-powerful servant that listens to one's commands.<br><br>Another thing you said about the daily bread, Shld we be praying for bread daily or 3 times a day?</div>

But before that you must first believe the following verse.<br><br>John 16:24<br>Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.<br><br>John 14:13-14<br>And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.<br><br>this is what Jesus himself said. and all the promises are Yes and Amen.<br>am i right to say health is included?<br><br>Job's suffering is done by the devil and God allowed it( God's protection departed) as Job is not a man of faith( he doubt that perhaps his sons have sin job 1:5) but a man of self-righteous. if you read his whole story , he say i have done this , done that, why still suffer. complain to his friends about God is unjust. then God have to come until the end and tell him off, "where were you when i laid the foundation of the earth?" job 38:4 . is like saying,(my own term) why? trying to gain credits huh? Then when job realised he need God and humbled himself, God restored him double of what he lost.<br><br>the same story, notice how come satan can present himself before God? i believe adam gave his place to him, that's y when Jesus died, he has to cleansed the heaven with his blood as well. and as a lawyer appear to the judge to condemn, the judge must execute justice just as satan (the accuser) appeared to God. now after Jesus died, he is in our defend as high priest seated on the right hand of God. so satan cannot condemn anyone to God cos he has no place in heaven.<br><br>yes, i seen christian suffer as well, but i have also seen and hear testimonies about people healed, deliver out of trouble and many other things <span style="text-decoration: underline;">when they believe God will do it</span>. i'm not saying if you don't believe He can heal you, you are an unbeliever, you just don't receive thats all. The criteria to be believer is to believe Jesus is the Son of God the bible is very clear on that. the Bible also say how to recognise a true believer. someone who shows love and if anyone who hate his brother is not born as a christian. 1 john.<br><br>aren't christian blessed ? don't we have eternal life? if you are an unbeliever, well... he won't force blessing on people. (eg: do you want to be well?) perhaps you(anyone who's an unbeliever) can ask the god you believe to bless you instead?<br><br>I believe this is the will of God. (Jesus is saying)<br>John 6:39-40<br>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."<br><br>I believe this is the work God requires us to do.<br>John 6:28-29<br>Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"<br>Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."<br><br>for prayer, i encourage you to pray as much as u like and have a good walk with the LORD. but i believe we should at least pray once a day. ( don't we talk to our Gf every day when we are in love?)<br><br>I believe you are right saying i'm "deluded". i used bible verse to To "deceive" my mind into thinking God is Good unless you have bible verse to tell me otherwise. i'm still growing in the Lord and if anyone feel that i have misinterprate , offended or stumble someone( which i don't mean to), do me a favor by voicing out with bible verse and we can discuss on it. i believe this is how we learn and grow.<br></div>
