            <div class='col-md body'>hope i'm speaking to christians if not i'm probably from the wrong forum.  Because we should believe the word because The word is God 1 John 1:1.<br><br>Paul warned, if anyone preaches anything other than the gospel, let it be a curse.<br><br>Aren't this forum Eternal Hope&gt; Sufferings &gt; are discussed such that every one will get hope and build one another not to bring ppl down?? i will not start a war but to share my views and things i have learn to build one another.  i'm open to be corrected but on basis. not from some Dr so and so... without bible verse. Aren't christian be worried receiving from people preaching reader digest?<br><br>thanks Icemoon for bringing the part on God boasting about job. I have found and learn something new.<br><br>let God answer his action<br><br>Ezekiel 14<br><br>12 The word of the LORD came to me: 13 "Son of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I stretch out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and kill its men and their animals, 14 even if these three menÂ—Noah, Daniel [a] and JobÂ—were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign LORD.<br>15 "Or if I send wild beasts through that country and they leave it childless and it becomes desolate so that no one can pass through it because of the beasts, 16 as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate.<br><br>17 "Or if I bring a sword against that country and say, 'Let the sword pass throughout the land,' and I kill its men and their animals, 18 as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved.<br><br>19 "Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath upon it through bloodshed, killing its men and their animals, 20 as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness.<br><br>21 "For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: How much worse will it be when I send against Jerusalem my four dreadful judgmentsÂ—sword and famine and wild beasts and plagueÂ—to kill its men and their animals! 22 Yet there will be some survivorsÂ—sons and daughters who will be brought out of it. They will come to you, and when you see their conduct and their actions, you will be consoled regarding the disaster I have brought upon JerusalemÂ—every disaster I have brought upon it. 23 You will be consoled when you see their conduct and their actions, for you will know that I have done nothing in it without cause, declares the Sovereign LORD."<br><br>whatever God does there's a reason and it's usually recorded.<br>just remember he's before christ. and what God booast is correct.<br>Abraham, issac , jacob are righteous by faith.<br><br>if we don't go by faith then what? pls enlighten me<br><br>and pls don't say ppl are this and that without letting the author know on what basis, i appriciate Icemoon for letting me know what i should lookout for.<br>and clear people's doubt.<br><br>you may be right when you ask God for wealth. Not buy lottery and wait and ask God to help you strike(cos tomorrow might not see him in church anymore). He know how to give it to the person. probably gave him a good career, and probably some challange came and he trusted the Lord to overcome it, walk with the Lord and learn responsibilities thru the job, then still have time for family and friends and go to church.<br><br>Deuteronomy 8:18<br>But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gives you the ability</span> to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your forefathers, as it is today.<br><br>notice it's the ability, not just give u wealth.<br><br></div>

Noah was a righteous man, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">blameless among the people of his time</span>, and he walked with God.<br><br>question. blameless among people of his time can it mean he's the best of the lot and the lot may be bad? yet he got drunk and lay nude.<br><br>Job 1:6<br>There is no one on earth like him.<br>can it means he's the best God have at that time? but may not be perfect by God's standard?<br><br>notice the story started with, the accuser presented himself before the Lord. question. what "good" intend does he have to present himself? surely to accuse right ?and anything not perfect he will accuse? why not God wanted to test Job and thus invited Satan?<br>do you think God know Satan's intend and satan already have someone in mind? will satan choose some donno who to accuse? waste time right.<br>and as a perfect judge, if a case presented to you, will you take it up? thus satan have to show prove.<br><br>This is what Job said<br>Job 27:6<br>I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.<br><br>what self righteousness is this. Am i right, usually thru suffering you see people's ture colour but God already saw his heart And Satan, even thou he cannot see ppl's heart he can see job is self-righteous?<br><br>Job 32:1<br>So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.<br><br>in his own eye, not God's eye<br><br>self righteous is a form of no faith, they trusted themself. Abraham didn't trusted his own work but because abraham believe God.<br><br>you should read Job 32 - 35 on what elihu have said and he's the only one God never scold like the other 2 friend. it also have a beautiful picture of Jesus as a redeemer in job 33. Suffering still don't want repent and ask God to save and deliver him. Job 34:30-33<br><br>next. on the burn offering. i'm happy that u brought this up and i have since gain new knowledge. thanks.<br><br>let's look at Leviticus 1<br><br>3 " 'If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he is to offer a male without defect. He must present it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting so that it [a] will be acceptable to the LORD. 4 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him</span>. 5 He is to slaughter the young bull before the LORD, and then Aaron's sons the priests shall bring the blood and sprinkle it against the altar on all sides at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 6 He is to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces. 7 The sons of Aaron the priest are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. 8 Then Aaron's sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the burning wood that is on the altar. 9 He is to wash the inner parts and the legs with water, and the priest is to burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.<br><br>notice he(the sinner) will lay his hand, and it(the offering) will be accepted on his behalf. If Job is self righteous, do you think he thinks he needs an atonement? that's y he might be doing for his children and not for himself<br>Read Job 34 onward and it's said that will God come and warn you. If his sons have sin , will he not warn him?<br><br>Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom. Job 1 :5<br>notice he sacrifice for each of them, then y not say for himself and his family?<br><br>perhaps is a word  which create doubt.<br><br>faith? what is faith? it's just believeing God is a good God, Jesus is Good,  he came to heal, love and forgive and many good things.<br><br>look at the people Jesus commented as "Great is your faith", "Your faith", and also people he commented as "you man of little faith"<br>you will find why Jesus say that.<br>i'll leave it for you who are interested or hungry to seek it out.<br><br>I say this becos i want Him to receive all the Glory.<br>my life was a mess and i have many troubles and friendship problem.<br>Jesus delivered me which took me a period of time and restored more. but during this time i trusted him.<br><br>My relationship. all i know, JESUS LOVES ME.<br><br>finally,  it should be clear now who is the righteous He's refering to ?<br><br>May you find the nuggets of Gold in the bible and Jesus is to key to many event in the old testiment to unlock treasures. Love stroy of Ruth, David and Jonathan close friendship, Joseph as a picture of Jesus and Isreal, the interesting drama of Esther. and Noah found Grace are few interesting bible event i encourage you to read on . thanks.<br><br></div>
