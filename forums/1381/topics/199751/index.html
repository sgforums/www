            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ben1xy,<br><br>Got the extract from a website which particularly deals with the subject matter you are pursuing. it is by Dennis Bratcher. i read it - in particular para 2 which correlates with vince's findings and make sense to me.  The last 2 paras in the extract is also edifying. I dunno, you might find more use of it.<br><br>website: <a href="http://www.cresourcei.org/branch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cresourcei.org/branch.html</a><br><br>Blessings.<br><br>__________________________________________<br><br>The prophets used various metaphors to refer to this anticipated revival of the ideal monarchy to replace the corrupt kings of the day, including "servant" (Haggai, Isaiah), "signet ring" (Haggai), "shepherd" (Micah, Ezekiel), or simply "David" (Amos). But in all three of the above examples, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah also use the term "branch" as a metaphor to refer to the new king that God would raise up from the line of David (Isa 4:2, 11:1, Jer 23:5, Zech 3:8, 6:12). The metaphor is most clearly expressed in Isaiah 11:1: There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.<br><br>In Hebrew, the word "branch" is netzer, actually only three consonantal letters: NZR. Note that the town NaZaReth contains the same three primary letters (plus an ending often attached to nouns). In the Aramaic form of Nazareth, (Aramaic was the common language spoken by most Israelites after the exile; some have suggested that the entire book of Matthew was originally written in Aramaic rather than Greek), it comes very close in sound to the Hebrew word for "branch."<br><br>It seems, then, that Matthew was not at all "mistaken" in this Old Testament reference, although he was certainly not exegeting Isaiah. He was identifying the obscure Galilean town of Nazareth in which Jesus grew up with the OT reference to a netzer God would raise up to bring justice and righteousness and peace to His people. In other words, this was the means Matthew used to identify Jesus, even as a child returning to an obscure town in remote Galilee ("can any good thing come from Nazareth?" -John 1:47), as the "King" from the line of David whom God had finally raised up to restore His people.<br><br>It is no coincidence that it is Matthew more than the other Gospels in which the idea of the Kingdom of God and the reign of God through His King finds particular prominence. This is MatthewÂ’s way of confessing Jesus to be the Messiah (the Christ)! But he is not doing it historically, or geographically, as we so often assume, nor is he simply connecting predictive prophecy with its later fulfillment. He is doing it theologically, by using the similarity in sound between a word in Hebrew and a word in Aramaic, as he is (probably) writing in Greek! He is not interpreting Isaiah directly; He is bearing witness to Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah, the Branch!<br><br>What all of this suggests is that it is very unlikely that Isaiah in 700 BC, or Jeremiah in 600 BC, or Zechariah in 520 BC had in mind the city of Nazareth as they talked about the Branch. They were not predicting anything about the city of Nazareth.   MatthewÂ’s application here cannot be used as the key to understand those books. It must work the other way; we cannot really understand MatthewÂ’s reference without first understanding the entire concept and set of metaphors, and some cultural history, from the Old Testament prophets. What those prophets affirm in the metaphor of the Branch is that God will not leave His people without a leader to show them how to be His people. It is not a predictive prophecy; it is an affirmation about GodÂ’s grace, that He will continue to work in history to enable His people to respond faithfully as His people.<br><br>And Matthew, understanding both the significance of the coming of Jesus, and the affirmation about God that those prophets of long ago made, links the two in affirming that in Jesus, the Christ, the Branch, God has once again been faithful to His people by entering history and providing a way for them to be His people. Matthew takes the insignificant town in which Jesus grew up and uses it as a metaphor to confess Jesus as the fulfillment of the hopes of a thousand years, and the revelation of the faithfulness of God to His people. To me that is a far more significant affirmation than trying to figure out how to use Matthew to interpret Isaiah, or to use this as an example of predictive prophecy.</div>

We see them today as the very first  'Christians'  even though the term Christian is not mentioned until Acts 11:26<br><br>If a Christian studied the beliefs of the Ebionites he/she might even consider them as heretics by our beliefs today.<br><br>The town of Nazareth did not exist in the Old Testament nor in the time of Jesus's ministry.
