            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><strong>Oh! ItÂ’s just nature</strong><br><br>Harry struggled to keep his balance; with his tired feet wobbling, he barely managed to walk six feet. He is not used to walking that way actually, in fact, he hates to do it. He is not himself walking with his two feet. You see Harry is a pet dog. As a dog he naturally walks on all fours, thatÂ’s dog-nature. He is not a dog because he barks, salivates profusely, walks on all fours, eats bones and does dog stuff, no, he is not a dog because he does these things because a deranged human being can do these things and still is a human being and not a dog, rather, he (Harry) does these things because he is a dog, he has a dog nature in him. ItÂ’s your nature that determines who you are. The basic governing principle intrinsic in us determines what we do, what we think, what we say and what we feel.<br><br>ItÂ’s the same way with sinners. One is not a sinner because he has committed sins, rather he commits sins because he is a sinner. He has a sinful nature in him. He just canÂ’t help it. Holiness and righteousness is just foreign to his nature. These things are BOOORIIING to him. If the sleeping pill fails to deliver, holy and righteous things will. We are not to be surprised why many people enjoy the world rather than godly things. We should not be surprised why many find it easy doing bad and sinful things rather than doing godly and holy things. No matter how extensive and intensive you teach a child godly and holy things, he will just naturally know and do bad and sinful things without you teaching him so.<br><br>Why? Because ever since sin entered the world, man is a natural with regards to sin. He naturally thinks sinful thoughts, talks sinful words, does sinful acts, feels sinful feelings and plans sinful things. Sin has invaded every nook and cranny in man. His mind. His emotions. His will. His natural disposition is just one destined for hell or eternal death. As the Bible calls him: Â“Â…Â…Â…Â….<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BY NATURE children of wrath</strong></span>Â…Â…Â…..Â” Ephesians 2:3.<br><br>Sin will always incur GodÂ’s righteous anger, every one who sins is worthy and is destined for GodÂ’s righteous anger. And man has sinned and is sinning and will continue to sin because he just canÂ’t help it. He has a sinful nature innate in him. Huge problem for man isnÂ’t it? What man needs is an atonement for all his sins past, present and future and a new nature.<br><br>And Jesus Christ has all that for sinners. He died for the sins of sinners anyone who will put their trust on His work on the cross will be forgiven all their sins and at the moment of trusting in Him the Holy Spirit of God will dwell in the sinner giving him a new nature, giving him a new governing principle operative in him.<br><br>Â“There is therefore now no condemnation [hell] for those who are in Christ Jesus.For the <strong>law of the Spirit of life </strong>in Christ Jesus has set you free from <strong>the law of sin and of death</strong>.Â” [Romans 8:1-2]<br><br>The word Â‘lawÂ’ above refers not to a set of rules and regulations but Â‘lawÂ’ here refers to the governing principle or nature in a thing, in this verse the governing principle of the Holy Spirit and the governing principle of Sin.  Law of the Spirit or the governing principle of the Holy Spirit is just another name for the Â‘Divine natureÂ’ and Law of Sin or governing principle of Sin is just another designation for the Â‘Sinful natureÂ’.<br><br>It is called Â‘<strong>the law of the Spirit </strong>of lifeÂ’ because it is the nature of the Holy Spirit in the Christian making possible for him to live a godly life pleasing to God. It is called Â‘the law of the Spirit of <strong>lifeÂ’</strong> because it gives the abundant life promised in John 10:10. True life is actually a life lived for God with God indwelling in the Christian. Living a life of sin as the outgrowth of the sinful nature is not the true life, it is a life marked with guilt, fear and anxieties resulting in eternal death in hell [the law <strong>of sin and of death</strong>].<br><br>Every one of us has this Â“law of sinÂ” in us, thatÂ’s the reason why we canÂ’t help but sin, much less, have this Â“holy worryÂ” for sin. Just as the law of gravity makes every object that goes up go down, the law of sin makes us sin and continue to sinÂ…we just cant help it, itÂ’s in us, itÂ’s our nature. And sin will always incur for us spiritual death or eternal separation from God in hell. The law of sin that results to death.<br><br>To free us from this bondage to our sinful natures we must have the Holy Spirit in us and  govern us.<br><br>How? Trust in the saving work of the Lord Jesus on the cross and He will forgive all your sins and give you a new life..<br></div>
