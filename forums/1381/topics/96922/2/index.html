If tat is the case, then don't spread the word ! From ancient times, stop the religion and keep the bible for yourself ! Then everywhere will become an "ulu" place and everyone goes to heaven !

The killer is definitely sinful, no doubt about tat. But does the victim surely goes to heaven ? If they do, then there will be people who don't mind killing their babies to ensure they get to heaven. Someone had to go to hell, might as well ask him to kill off thousands of babies or children so they all can go to heaven. The important thing is, thousands of babies get to benefit while only 1 person had to go to hell. DOesn't tat make it a dangerous idea ? In tat case, doesn't abortion make perfect sense then ?</div>

Then what is the conscious for? God will judge those who have not had the chance to hear the Gospel according to their conscious.<br><br>I understand your point of view and now let me explain mine.<br><br>I may not have able to explain what i mean by "don't want to hear &amp; don't have the chance to hear".<br><br>If u are some kind of africa tribe (that what i mean ulu) whose language is  ancient that not many people can speak or they cannot read, then that is under "no chance to hear".<br><br>If you are educated or even can speak common modern language, and when some people tried to share the word with you but you dun have to hear, that is "dun want to know". Not "no chance to hear".<br><br>I hope you can understand why do not hear (and do not spread the word) does not = to go to heaven bcos we are still judge by our conscious.<br><br>Human standard of right and wrong varies with each individual.

They too get judged at the end of it all. Not all those who cry lord lord get to be in heaven u know. They r too judged for their conscious. So wat is the diff ? The diff is the people who heard the word and not being believers r going to hell straight. Before they still have an equal chance as believers. Aren't u causing them more harm than good ?<br><br><blockquote>i may not have able to explain what i mean by "don't want to hear &amp; don't have the chance to hear". </blockquote>I TOTALLY understand wat do u mean by not hearing and doesn't want to hear. I KNOW tat since the very beginning. THE POINT I am driving through is, THE SPREADER of the WORD r SINFUL because they r condemning all the people they told about god a straight path to hell. It is a FACT tat most people refuse to believe christainity after hearing the word. It is a FACT in the bible tat non-believer go straight to hell. Therefore we can conclude tis religion should have been covered up since the very beginning. Those who knew it are cursed to be believers of it. Otherwise they have to rot in hell. There r still ulu villages in some part of asia etc. Stop all evangelising and leave them in peace. They get to go to heaven too, why give them the possibility to make them go straight to hell ? In fact christians should stop all evangelising to china or other parts of the world in the first place. They r sending the chinese, japanese, malays etc straight to hell as well.<br><br><blockquote>Human standard of right and wrong varies with each individual. Your right may not be my right, so who right is right? Who set the standard? </blockquote>So u mean sending people to hell is possibly a right thing to do ? I thought tis is a clear cut case.</div>

I don't really felt any of such things before but I can be sure the form it take will depend on wat religion u r in.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Firstly, the assumption that God created hell for people is not from the Bible.

He made hell and send him there. He purpose torment him so he can be more sadistic when he was released. (I thought human civilisation itself has already gone beyond torturing people) But sadly, he is gonna release him after 1000 years so tat he can to wage a war against him again. U can get to see billions and billions of gogs and minions of evil against fire in the sky. Where does human stand then ? Frankly he had planned for all these to happened. After all these, he is still gonna send u to hell, to live with satan. The original intention is not important anymore. U r still gonna go there. In fact, u should be more afraid since it is designed to punish an immortal like satan, which clearly has a tougher body than u.<br><br><blockquote>Secondly, God didnt send people to hell. People choose to go to hell themselves because they have decided to join the rebelliousness of satan and his demons and therefore come under the same judgment. </blockquote>Tis part is so very wrong. People don't choose to go to hell. Who will choose to go to a horrible place where they will suffer pain for the rest of eternity ? They were <span style="font-style: italic;">FORCED</span> to be there just because they do not believe in God for a good reason. It still boils down tot he same point which u r not answering. Twisting the word is not gonna help much. From your tone, u appears to be blaming buddhist to be buddhist, taoist to be taoist, hindu to be hindus and free thinker to be free thinker. Perhaps they r blaming u to be christians as well, and u will be the one tat undergoes their hell instead. Frankly, I do not see any justification to believe in christianity up till now<br><br><blockquote>Thirdly, no doubt the God of the Bible is love but we also cannot neglect the truth is that God is also Justice and righteousness. In His justice, sin has to be punished and in His love He sent His only Son- Jesus Christ - for us as the atoning sacrifice. </blockquote>The problem is he made the laws and he made the judgement himself. When u r borned, when u have no conscience and not thoughts, u have already sinned and will surely go to hell. How good a justice is tat ? He don't give evidence of his existence, he don't show himself yet he expect everyone to fully believe him, otherwise he will face hell. How righteous can he be ? There is nothing about justice here, it all boiled down to him plainly demanding u to be a mere servant, and giving a hell lot of excuses for it.</div>
