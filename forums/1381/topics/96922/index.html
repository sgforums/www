By killing them and send them to heaven..oh thanks thats a good solution ya? but what abt u as a baby killer? Ni bu lu di yu, shui lu di yu (mandarin)?<br><br>God is Sovereign and sound. And when we quote Bible, make sure we read and understand it in totality and in context. Not trying to quote A and counter B. No one goes to the Father except thru Jesus Christ still holds. What makes us think that Christ nv die for the sins of babies? No chance to response means death? Like the article says, babies have original sins but they are not in the capacity to carry out the act of sinning like many of us (including me) after knowing something is wrong still does it.<br><br></div>

Don't you think it is rude and inconsiderate to jump in here to post some base less accuses?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NeonTetra:</div><div class="quote_body">the reason y ppl like u and me at times ask such a question tells tt we dunt fully trust God for who he is and we do not understand his divine nature. The bible says that God is absolutely good and in him there lies no evil and sin.<br><br>God is not some holy but unreasonable cosmic tyrant waiting to strike down those who sin against him and sadistic enough to see souls burning in the lake of fire.<br><br>The God revealed in the Bible saves. He sent His Son Jesus Christ not to create another religion to flame others or to be flamed. The Son of God came to save sinners because God is not willing that anyone should perish but to come to repentance. How to repent when one is not aware of sins? How to say sorry to you when i dun know i stepped on ur toes last evening?<br><br>To have knowledge of laws and to break them is sin. To have lack of faith is also sin. To outright go against God's holy standards (be it civil or laws mentioned in the Bible) is sin. Sinners have to be punished.<br><br>As much as ppl focus on the judgemental side of God. yes God is the Judge of the living and the dead. We need to see the loving and forgiving aspect of God, He pardons and redeems.<br><br>The Bible mentioned that the reason why the end of world hasnt come not because God the Father lost His palmtop but rather he says that THIS gospel will be preached to all the earth and THEN the end shall come.<br><br>"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." (Matthew 24:14)<br><br>God does not condemn nor punished without any reasons. Just like a sound father doesnt cane his naughty kid without explaining to him the reason for tt punishment. God in His holy laws and testimony and even for those who do not know the Bible - a conscience, so that we know what is right and wrong and we are without excuse. But of course, those who do not know God (absolutely) will be judged on a different basis and since I am but a human (some ppl say i am god) i cannot provide you with God's marking scheme.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The bottomline is...if you know How loving and good this God is...these questions fades away.<br><br></div></blockquote>but neon. he has a right to ask, and to allow someone to convince him doesn't it? dun u think saying "u can't ask, because it means u have no faith, if u have faith, then these question fades away" is not going to help? it sounds like what someone would say if they couldn't quite answer u know? and it sure as hell ain't gonna make him start believing.<br><br>my point being, i dunno if u realise, that u said a lot without actually saying anything? and that he DOES have valid questions. I would think that what he's questioning is not God's words, but rather, if OUR interpretation of the bible is 100% accurate?<br><br>anyways, personally nothing against u neon, but i felt that "bottomline" statement does sound more zealot than explanatory.</div>
