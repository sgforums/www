              <p>In recent years, the sedition and religious harmony acts have been brought into sharp focus with sensitive remarks being made and sensitive actions being taken in the public square. <br><br>What makes a speech or action, whether by an individual or organisation, seditious and a cause of disharmony between religious groups in the Singapore context?<br><br>What can preachers, Christians and Christian organisations do to avoid offending sedition and religious harmony laws in their zeal to proclaim the Gospel to one and all, and in private and public settings? <br><br>"Act with common sense and prudence," says a professor of law at the National University of Singapore (NUS). <br><br>"You want to persuade someone, not irritate them," adds Professor Dr. Thio Li-ann, a leading Singapore constitutional scholar, in a recent email interview with The Christian Post following a talk she delivered late last month at the St. Andrew's Cathedral on Christian engagement in the public square. <br><br>Since God will not force any person to believe in Him, Christians "cannot coerce faith," she emphasises. <br><br>Elaborating on that point, Professor Dr. Thio says: "You should not abuse your position e.g. with a captive audience, to tell someone about your faith when they are disinterested. If they are, strike up a conversation, not a monologue."<br><br>She had Christians consider what they would do if someone tried to convert them. <br><br>Putting herself in the position of those being approached by people trying to share their faith - Singaporeans have different religious affiliations and non-affiliations - she reveals that she would "politely but firmly say: 'Thank you. I am not interested, I am a follower of Jesus Christ' and expect the person to be sensible enough to stop at that point, though if she was in the mood for it, she might engage in a discussion. <br><br>"The point is, be sensible," she says. "Don't compromise the integrity of your mission, but do so in a winsome and persuasive manner."<br><br>After all, <em>agape</em> or the unconditional love of Christ requires such kindness, civility, compassion and respect. "Remember, that freedom of religion, to practice your faith, also includes freedom from religion," she cautions. "And that protects all of us from having something we don't agree with imposed on us."<br><br>This, she says, is not a question of the Rational Man who is tolerant of all views because he values free enquiry but the Emotional Man, who gets upset, hurt and offended. <br><br>In her observation, "Some people are very sensitive; some are more able to be thick skinned and tolerant because they value free speech and intellectual inquiry more." Her advice: Use discretion.<br><br>So what are the rules governing evangelism in Singapore? Specifically what can and cannot be done by churches and individual Christians in street evangelism, if street evangelism is legal in the first place. <br><br>Professor Dr. Thio, who is a Barrister (Gray's Inn), prefaced her response by noting that "Evangelism is legal and in fact a constitutional right" and that "It would in fact be intolerant to ban this form of speech."</p>

              <p>Why?? I mean I am just asking you why no taoists or buddhists are ever caught for insulting religions in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Is is because they are peace loving and respect religious harmony and multi-religious society?</p>
