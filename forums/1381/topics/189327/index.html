In ancient times, as offerings to and from the gods, gifts were put under the tree.

The One of the Scriptures, or some corrupted, man made invention? Do people then begin celebrating according to G-d's Word?

Is their heart changed to seek out all righteousness, or have they just fallen in love with the "spirit" of the season? Remember, the true Holy Spirit of G-d only obeys and promotes the Scriptural Holy Days of the Most High. So what "spirit" then is the "Spirit of Christmas".

I was saved during Christmas. Am I a bad fruit? Think u mistaken, in case u dunno, I am a durian. I smell but I am a good fruit. Please drop in someday and eat some durians.
