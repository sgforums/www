              <p>On what basis do you conclude that just because someone belongs to a "club" (be it Christianity or Buddhism) that he is sure to exercise selective attention or deception, versus someone who is not. So which existentialist club do you belong to?</p>
              <p>If someone challenge my beliefs, I do not appeal to numbers for that would be to commit a fallacy. I should appeal to arguments and reasons to defend my beliefs. Counting heads is never a determinant of truth.</p>
              <p>Sheep do not follow blindly anyone who calls them, but only listen to the voice of the shepherd. Jesus wants us to follow Him. You got a problem with that? I don't.</p>

              <p>But in the first place who told you that being intellectual is just about collecting and reciting sources, or that intelligence is inner etc etc? There are always people who do not examine their own beliefs just as there are also people who do. So why just harp about those who don't? And when was the last time you questioned your own existentialist musings?</p>

              Stupidity is to question existential .... if i m swimming in the sea, and questioning about the sea or looking for the sea, i must be delusional. And if I am i must be imposing my own idea of what existence is or should be. Does the cat in the neighbourhood question its existence. Human mind is so conditioned that it is imposing its own ideas n concepts about that which cannot be defined, at the best/worse it is and expereince or a non-experience.  
              This is what happens when one is mired in concepts. Like i uttered many times before, i m talking spirituality, can one find it? One is being spiritual or one simply is not. One can find religion, especially that which is defined, isms are traps, and that does not, I am talking about isness, and u are stuck with isms! 
              The madness of one be delusion, the madness of many - organized religion! Stupidity is to organize truth or organize what is true. One can say a furniture is truth, it is dead and hence it labelled, it is a finished product, can one say the sun is truth, or a human being is truth, the sun is true, the human being is true, the latter are not dead things, labelling them as truth, is negating the isness of the sun or a human being.

              Being stupid cannot get better than this - existential is paradoxical happening/non-happening. How can it become a belief? Do i have to believe in the sun? I will n can expereince it, taste it, presupposing i am awake, if i m sleepwalking i would miss that expereince. Can one box what is true, one moment it is hot , the next it is cold. the only thing one can do is talk ABOUT ..... eg, my holding a book is a reality, my thinking and talking ABOUT reading that particular book is mind-play, is it real? It is real and only real when i AM actually in the process of READING IT! If I go around simply saying or uttering that this author is good, this book is good and most likely i am repeating and borrowing someone's idea or experince to support my stance. That is delusion, that is lying to myself. 
              I m not asking anyone nor u to follow me. I leave it to the discerning to decide/undecide and that is something that may or may not resonate with one's own being.

              <p>BTW, what is MEANING of existentialism? What are your BELIEFS about it? How did you CONDITION yourself to think existentialially?</p>

              Stupidity is to question existential â€¦. if i m swimming in the sea, and questioning about the sea or looking for the sea, i must be delusional. If I am living in the mind , I m not living and most probably i would look for meaning and purpose. meaning and purpose is what one is being now, what one is doing now. Meaning and purpose comes in when one has an idea what living should be or not be. Hence, one misses what is obvious! And if I am i must be imposing my own idea of what existence is or should be. Does the cat in the neighbourhood question its existence. Human mind is so conditioned that it is imposing its own ideas n concepts about that which cannot be defined ,existence; at the best/worse existence is and expereince or a non-experience cos it is not independent of the one perceiving and even than the perceiving is bound to impose colour on what is transpiring especially when the conditioning, programming or beleifs dominoe one's pscyhological terrain
              . Can anyone define this and conceptualize it (existence)? One can talk ABOUT it but it is merely psychological and if one gets lucky, a bit of social relevance. Why social relevance, cos in a club all think alike and all pat each other's shoulders to affirm and perpetuate fictional mythology! Spiritual truths? can one find it ? one is either being spirituial or one simply is not.  
               This is what happens when one is mired in concepts. Like i uttered many times before, i m talking spirituality, can one find it? One is being spiritual or one simply is not. One can find religion, especially that which is defined, isms are traps, and that does not, I am talking about isness, and u are stuck with isms!
               The madness of one be delusion, the madness of many â€“ organized religion! Stupidity is to organize truth or organize what is true. One can say a furniture is truth, it is dead and hence it labelled, it is a finished product, can one say the sun is truth, or a human being is truth, the sun is true, the human being is true, the latter are not dead things, labelling them as truth, is negating the isness of the sun or a human being.Hence I reiterate, that as long as it is not in one's existential experience, simply talking about it, repeating others, quoting.... is simply lying or one is sleepwalking
              
              I dont believe,disbelieve, why? i would if i belong to a club. 
              
              BIC - this is your predicament, u seem to question others cos that is the only defensive stance u seem to adopt so as to negate/avoid  wanting to see the predicament u are in, any intelligent person can see thru that. Just look at the questions u ask, unbelievably stupid! Selective deception and attention is paranoia, is being at un-ease with oneself, why? FEAR
              U are very good at quoting .... and questioning, but u do not see is the fear of findiing  out that what ever u are attached to, believe in might not hold up to what is reality. Why, let me guess, the fear of self, the fear of one's self is threatened and why should it be so, cos the self is propped up by .... I will fear the same, if i have a belief or  attached to ... how can one who has no belief/non-beleif be attached to or fear the demise of the self.

              <p>In short, it is sheer hypocrisy to ask people to question their own beliefs while you immunise your own beliefs from questioning by claiming that to question existentialism is stupidity. This is sheer special pleading fallacy committed by you. You ASSUME without proof or evidence that existentialism is the true worldview, yet when taken to task you are UNABLE to defend your worldview, except to harp about how unenlightened the one challenging your beliefs is.</p>
              <p>Again, you CLAIMED to be talking spirituality, but NOTHING in your musings show any spirituality at all. You say I am in a predicament, pray tell what it is? You said it is selective deception, pray tell deceived by what? Fear of my beliefs being challenged? That's absolutely false. There are no lack of atheists and folks like you in this forum always thinking that they can deal a death blow to Christianity, but there are a few of us who have confronted these arguments head on and dealt them the death blow instead.</p>
              <p>Question is, why are YOU so fearful of answering my questions? Why do you resort to calling me stupid in order to defend your own beliefs? Why do you see the need to call others stupid for questioning your existential musings? Why so upset? Looks like you are again stepping on your own toes and eating your own words.</p>

              Most question, certainly they do, but look for answers and ( nmost likely to reaffirm what has been told to them, answers derived from someone or a book or â€¦. They do not question beleifs, traditions, so on so forth and why? There is another type that questions, â€“ they question and NOT look for answers but reevaluate, examine and drop what is misleading or erroneous. The third type â€“ simply being aware of â€¦. , cos the latter is a synthesis of inner and outer (inner and outer) Hence, i reiterate one can be religious and gravitate towards being spiritual. Religion, most are merely pointers to being spiritual. Religion (all) is learning and of course, for the seeker the possibility of it as a device to being spiritual is there. For the follower, if one is sleepwalking â€“ it is nothing but rituals after rituals. Spirituality is unlearning, not collecting, it is unlearning, a process where one unloads all the â€™â€™rubbishâ€™â€™. True or false all depends on where one is on the spectrum of learning/unleraning/relgion/spirituality
              It is only when one is being self-honest does it have meaning or will it make sense!

               I m talking existential reality which is the ''isness'' of living, not ISMs: does the fish in the sea look for the sea and question about life, meaning and death and morals? Does one who is swimming in the sea ask ...such questions? If one is asking such qeustions while in the proecss of being in the sea and swimming, one's expereince is most likely to be that of adulteration. Which means one is stuck with .. and utterly distorted and all that is obvious is missed.  Existence has no rite/wrong meaning. It has no dogmas/doctrines and one cannot find it. What is true now can become untrue in an instant, what is cold now can become hot the next instant. Can one box it and utter n say that this is existentialism. One is either being existential or one is not? One is either being religious or one is not, the same for spirituality. 
                One can at the most talk about the taste of the sea, the swimming experience and share that experience after it is over but one cannot say that it will be the same for another. 
              
               when i do belong to a club i can answer cos most of these questions that u pose and ask about cos u are asking for theories, dogma, definitions In fact, i can simply cope and paste satre, heidegger or  ... to support my stance, that is simply being a copycat, simply proppin my views and my stances. They were talking ABOUT .... anyone who criticizes satre or heidegger or their views/stances or existentialism would threaten me, my sense of self is bound to be vulnerable.

I dont know cos it is merely .... concepts and  .... and as for fearing I would fear  if someone criticizes satres' view of existentializm or even criticize existentialism.

              <p>when i do belong to a club’’ i can and should be able answer cos most of these questions that u pose and ask about is asking for theories, dogma definitions In fact, i can simply cope and paste satre, heidegger or … to support my stance, that is simply being a copycat, simply proppin my views and i can certainly answer these questions, but it is not in my experience so how to answer ur questions on isms!</p>
              <p>If I am for existentialism (which is entirely different from being … existential) i will and can answer cos the former is dogma, doctrine, theories ..? I dont know cos it is merely …. concepts and .... and as for fearing I would fear if someone criticizes satres’ view of existentializm or even criticize existentialism. When I am attached to the idea, or identify with the belief of existentializm, i have already defined myself in terms of this concept, belief, i m bound to be defensive.</p>
              <p>Existentialism and worldview is possible, being existential and having a worldview – it must be crap!</p>
              <p>Playing mind-games is easy and it happesn all the the time, but self-deception is no dignity</p>

              <p>Why give excuses about whether you belong to a club or not? I am asking YOU for YOUR answers to the questions of life that every religion (or club if you like), including science, seeks to answers. Either you CAN answer, or HAVE some answers, or you cannot and do not have.</p>
              <p>If you claim to have found the worldview of existentialism as true but yet CANNOT derive basic answers from that worldview, then muse over the conclusion that you have simply engaged in self-deception, only holding on to a form of knowing but without content or substance or knowledge.  </p>
