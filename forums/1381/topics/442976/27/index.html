              <p>Your question begs the question in equating religions with DVD players. Anyway, for some people it is important, but for some people it is not important. But no one disagree that the DVD player is the product of intelligent design. Yet life is many times much more complex than the DVD player and you have atheists believe it came about by chance?

              <p>Sure I can aagrree with you partly that all things complex could have been created.</p>
              <p>But then when it comes to your God/Goddess who is so much more complex, you apply special pleading and say that the logic of "creaor-creation" does not apply anymore.</p>
              <p>Seriously? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You say "OH YEA everything complex MUST HAVE A CREATOR"</p>
              <p>I ask "Erm, so how about your God/Goddess who is so much more complex?"</p>
