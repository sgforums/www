              <p><strong>What is the Sun?</strong><br>
              Religion: The sun is a God. Either that, or it's a gift from
              God.<br>
              Science: A sun is a massive lump of plasma held together by
              gravity.</p>
              <p><strong>What are the stars?</strong><br>
              Religion: The stars are gifts from Gods.<br>
              Science: The stars are distant suns, with their lights reaching us
              from hundreds of years in the past.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>What is rain?</strong><br>
              Religion: Rain is a gift from God.<br>
              Science: Rain is part of a water cycle, where water moves from
              various states in our environment before coming down as rain.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>How did Man come about?</strong><br>
              Religion: God made Man out of thin air, and Woman using a part of
              Man.<br>
              Science: Human beings are evolved from millions of years of
              evolution, which explains our similarities with the great apes,
              among other things.</p>
              <p><strong>Why is this couple unable to have
              children?</strong><br>
              Religion: Infertility is a punishment from God. Pray for
              redemption.<br>
              Science: Infertility is a medical condition. It may be
              treatable.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Why is this dude writhing on the ground?</strong><br>
              Religion: He has been possessed by a demon. He needs an
              exorcism.<br>
              Science: He has epilepsy. He needs treatment.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>What was the first origin of the universe?</strong><br>
              Religion: The universe was made by God.<br>
              Science: We are not sure if there is such a thing as a first origin
              of the universe. We have theories like the M-theory, but these
              require much more investigation.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>How was the first self-replicable cell
              reated?</strong><br>
              Religion: It was made by God.<br>
              Science: We don't know for sure. There are theories using RNA, but
              these require further investigation. The element of chance could
              have played a part as well.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>All but the last two questions have been satisfatorily answered
              by science (your denial of evolution notwithstanding). Furthermore,
              as I suggested above, the scientific method not only provides
              answers, it provides ways to run tests and predictions, such that
              we now have real ways of inducing rain (instead of praying),
              predicting the motion of distant "heavenly" bodies, and treating
              both physical and mental illnesses.</p>
              <p>For most of these questions, the religious answers have been all
              but debunked. And yet modern-day Christian evangelists take refuge
              in the yet-unanswered questions, proffering the same God
              explanation that served ancients thousands of years ago.</p>
              <p>You accuse me of "clinging" to naturalism by faith. If you look
              at the respective track records of science versus religion, you'll
              find that science has utterly trounced religion in its ability to
              explain the world around us. If I had to bet on the next few
              unanswered questions, I would say that science will most likely
              provide the better answer -- once again.</p>
              <p>And then I predict that the Christian apologists will shift to
              the next unanswered questions, and claim to see God's active hand
              in them. Classic God-of-the-Gaps. If there's a caricature, I'm

              It is clear that you have chosen to engage in caricaturing the Christian answers to make reliogion esp Christianity look bad. Tell me, which Christian will disagree with a scientific explanation of how things work under Experimental Science? You seem to again forgot that modern science was born out of a Christian worldview. So for you to perpetuate some kind of eternal warfare between science and religion is to perpetuate an insidious myth. In fact, the question of the origins of the universe would capture the whole debate. You believe the universe made itself but I believe the universe was made by God. Both are religious beliefs about the origins of the universe. Question is, which is the most reasonable explanation?

                  It is always easy to demolish strawman arguments and you have completely ignored what I said. Instead you insist on saying that the ancient people believed that and simply ascribed them to me. If I deny the scientific explanation then you at least have a case, but I don't. So please respond to MY arguments rather than attack strawman points.
                  
                  That modern science owes its rise to the Christian worldview is a well documented fact of history. You show me your evidence that it is despite of and I will show you that it is because of. Fair challenge to you, you up to it?
                  
                  As to the origins of the universe, you again appeal to ignorance and a fallback on scientism and naturalism. Appeal to future knowledge is moot. I can also rebutt that by saying that in future science will prove that God did it, so? Please stick to what we know now and not make a fallacious argument from ignorance. As it now stands you are guilty of a naturalism of the gaps argument. Which is to say, we don't know how the universe made itself but surely no God did it, it must be a natural process that science has yet to discover. If this is not naturalism of the gaps then I don't know what is.

              Thank goodness for science? What goodness are you talking about? You should be thanking God for science, and give credit to the Christian worldview that provided the impetus for modern science.

                      Yes I am well aware that he purposely chose a nick that would be a direct affront to the Christian. In fact I doubt his surname is Tan too. He is simply playing on the SATan name. He does not hide the fact that he is a troll out to troll here, and his responses pretty well confirmed that. This is just an account newly created today to troll the forum here.

              evidence that it is despite of and I will show you that it is
              because of. Fair challenge to you, you up to it? As to the origins
              of the universe, you again appeal to ignorance and a fallback on
              scientism and naturalism. Appeal to future knowledge is moot. I can
              also rebutt that by saying that in future science will prove that
              God did it, so? Please stick to what we know now and not make a
              fallacious argument from ignorance. As it now stands you are guilty
              of a naturalism of the gaps argument. Which is to say, we don't
              know how the universe made itself but surely no God did it, it must
              be a natural process that science has yet to discover. If this is

                  reasonable.atheist,
                  
                  It seems that you have shifted the goalposts. Now you are talking about who made the sun? The Bible teaches that God made the stars and the sun and the heavenly hosts on Day 4 of creation week. The founders of modern science who were believers also believed that. What caused rain to fall? Well we know about the water cycle and science can tell us what happens. But who set the laws of nature in motion that allows for rain? Again the point is that what we do KNOW about the world does not negate the need for God as the ultimate explanation for all that exists.
                  
                  You should not project your ignorance to me. Why can't I be certain that God created the universe just as you are certain that He did not? Again the point is that he who has no roof over his head should not challenge the owner of the house to a rock throwing contest to see who breaks more of each other's windows. Your faith in science is mere scientism, a religion in itself. Thus it is special pleading on your part to uphold naturalism while faulting me for my belief in a Creator God. In any case it is still a naturalism of the gaps argument you are invoking.
                  
                  Fine with me if you think the Buddhism thread is more interesting. I suspect you will purposely find little to disagree even though it has its own metaphysical beliefs and supernatural elements. There is really little more we can talk about if you refuse to see that it boils down to worldviews that cannot be proven but are held by faith. Have fun at the Buddhist forum.

              No need to be so defensive. It is just a suspicion that I think you would be more forgiving towards other religions than to Christianity. Dawkins like to reserve his ammunition for Christianity too. Anyway how you choose to handle your opponents in the Buddhist forums is really none of my concern so I shall not say anymore.

              <p><br> No need to be so defensive. It is just a suspicion that I think you
                      would be more forgiving towards other religions than to
                      Christianity. Dawkins like to reserve his ammunition for
                      Christianity too. Anyway how you choose to handle your opponents in
                      the Buddhist forums is really none of my concern so I shall not say
                      anymore.</p>

              <p>Usual tactic of BIC -</p>
              <p>1. Refuses to read carefully and look at the evidence</p>
              <p>2. Refutes all our statements without credible evidence</p>
              <p>3. Throws in a lot of christian jargon, as if everyone's christian here and as if the bible is applicable to everyone.</p>
              <p>4. Makes  alot of baseless statements</p>
              <p>5. Accuses others of logical fallacies but commits 2 fallacies - confirmation bias and special pleading</p>
              <p>6. Uses only religious sources</p>

              <p>When doing a research paper or finding an answer, all of us (me including) must try to look at all kinds of sources.</p>
              <p>When discussing with BIC, I look at both christian and non-christian sources and even agree to some of his points.</p>
              <p>But BIC chooses only christian religious sources and insists he is being more objective than me.</p>
              <p>I dont expect him to agree with me. BuT I do expect that if we want an intellectual discussion, we should look at more sources instead of committing the error of confirmation bias by looking at what we want to look at only.</p>
