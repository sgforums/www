              <p>Exactly!</p>

              <p>my point is we can never be 100% sure!</p>
              <p>You say belief in jesus is requried to be saved.</p>
              <p>I say belief in jesus isnot required.</p>
              <p>Both of us are not 100% sure!</p>
              <p>Thats my point!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You get my point? </p>
              <p>My point is not to tear downyour beliefs, but to show you and BIC that no one can ever be 100% sure that their beliefs are correct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not me, not you and not BIC.\</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As long as there are different beliefs, then we must consider all, and say to ourselves "Oh we might be wrong".</p>
              <p>Dont be so prideful.</p>

              <p>despondent,</p>
              <p>You did on many times try to tell me that belief in jesus is required to be saved.</p>
              <p>And when I tell you it might not be the case, you insist jesus is required. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So now I know you are not 100% sure, like me, then I am ok with you. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes its good that you admit thatyou are not 100% sure, because I am not 100% sure if theres no god too!</p>

              <p>Can quote Bible verses you get cold feet and all confused again? See what I mean? You do not have the proper foundation to evaluate what Christians say. You see chapter and verse your brain all freezed up and you go into confused mode.</p>
              <p>You got chapter and verse? Bring it on. Let's debate and reason it out. I can tell you, many times the effort to do this pays off because you can form an opinion as to who has the better argument. But of course if your Bible knowledge is shallow to begin with you have no tools and base to evaluate anything at all. If you are not competent to begin with, then it is no wonder that you are confused.</p>
