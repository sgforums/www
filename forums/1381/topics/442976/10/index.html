              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Prior to china simplifying the chinese words, the word <span style="font-size: 15px;">èˆ¹ was also written as </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">èˆ¹.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">The word <span style="font-size: 15px;">èˆ¹ has never been changed. It has never been "simplified".  The word </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; background-color: #f5f5f5;">å…« has also always been </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; background-color: #f5f5f5;">å…« and never been simplified.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">So the difference has always been there between <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; background-color: #f5f5f5;">å…« and </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">å‡  or </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">å¹¾</span><span style="font-size: 15px;">. The difference is irreconcilable.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">So the <span style="font-size: 15px;">å‡  on the </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">èˆ¹ has always been a </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">å‡  and not a </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; background-color: #f5f5f5;">å…«.  So how can you say that </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">å‡ </span><span style="font-size: 15px; text-align: left;">  refers to </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; background-color: #f5f5f5;">å…«?</span></p>

              <p>So I am showing him that both words are different</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>One Chinese character, maybe we can attribute it to coincidence and forget about it. But what if there are many such "coincidences"? See the book "The Discovery of Genesis" that you can read for free here <a href="http://www.bibleetnombres.online.fr/genesis.pdf">http://www.bibleetnombres.online.fr/genesis.pdf</a></p>
              <p>Of course at the end of the day, you can still say "So what? It proves nothing, you just want to see what you want to see." I would say, suit yourself then. You don't have to believe if you don't want to. Making an argument for something is like building a house, it takes effort and time to make a good argument. Demolishing a house is easy. Press detonate or just anyhow whack at it, don't think too much. Atheists like to see how they can whack the Bible and the Christian faith, but all too often they will evade making a case for their own belief system or defending it. A classic tactic will be to engage in elephant hurling and asks, "what about this, that, this, that......" always attempting to put the Christian on the defensive so that everyone forgets that the atheist also need to defend his own worldview. Of course, a classic excuse would be for the atheist to say "I don't know the answer, so what's there to examine about my beliefs? But since you say you know, I attack you lor! Hoot Ah!"</p>

              will be to engage in elephant hurling and asks, "what about this,
              that, this, that......" always attempting to put the Christian on
              the defensive so that everyone forgets that the atheist also need
              to defend his own worldview. Of course, a classic excuse would be
              for the atheist to say "I don't know the answer, so what's there to
              examine about my beliefs? But since you say you know, I attack you
              lor! Hoot Ah!"</p>

              <p>We take christian sources only if they are sound, just like how I took christian sources about the age of the dead sea scrolls.

              <p>Why not for a start you actually interact with the arguments? All you did is to say "What? You believe in 6000 years of world history? Wah, that means EVERYTHING ELSE you say is unreliable liao." This is the fallacy of hasty generalisation. For one, other than appealing to authority for saying that the world is billions of years old, you have done nothing to refute the belief that the world is about 6000 years old.</p>

              <p>Yes BIC.</p>
              <p>I will reiterate what I said.</p>
              <p>Quoting all from christian sources is bias. And all professors and lecturers will agree with me and sadly, not you.</p>
              <p>I tell you many times but you seem to be blinded.</p>
              <p>I have no problem with christian sources.</p>
              <p>I have a problem when you quote all from christian sources.</p>
              <p>That is when you become extremely biased and your views warped.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Complaining about bias is not the same as proving that the content is WRONG.</p>
              <p>Like I said, all of us are biased to begin with. Bias by itself does not mean it is wrong. You have still to argue for the truth of your argument.</p>

              <p>I'm inclined to believe that Jesus was a saint and had saved many people....but I also believe that there were many saints in other religions too....their objectives were to save people and guide them towards everlasting happiness......what do you think of this ?</p>

              <p>Do atheists use Christian sources to prove atheism?</p>
              <p>It's like saying that a Jew cannot write a history about the holocaust because he is biased. You buy this reasoning?</p>
