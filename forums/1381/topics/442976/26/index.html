              <p>don't think I am judging anybody, and there should not be any judging by anybody here. It is not for us to judge who would be saved and who would not, whether those baptized or not baptized can be saved, those who don't believe in what we believe, and many many other things discussed here.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, no matter what rituals we go through, what knowledge we have, spiritual or academic, what intelligent decision we made through details analysis, it is God who sees the heart and it is He who judges.</p>
              <p>This is for anybody who thinks I am judging them.</p>
