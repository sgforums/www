He is simply playing on the SATan name. He does not hide the fact that he is a troll out to troll here, and his responses pretty well confirmed that. This is just an account newly created today to troll the forum here.</p>

              <p>This forum used to be very informative, I learned a lot, even from the non Christians who posted here. It was a place for Christians to discuss and shares, non Christians came here with questions and queries, many with very strong personal opinion, but most respected this as a Christians forum, and more importantly, they respected God whom they do not accept, it is like going to somebody's house you respect his father even though he is not your father.</p>

              <p>When the religious people ask me if any scientists know about the origins of the big bang, I say no one really knows.</p>

              <p>What is miracle? it is something that we cannot explain with
                          existing knowledge, and Christians believe that is the power of
                          God, do you accept the answer, even if you don't accept that
                          reasoning?</p>
              <p>You may not be happy is whatever made others happy, you cannot
                          deny the fact that others are happy.</p>

              <p>2. So basically, you are saying that there is no evidence for the miracles because you cannot explain it. Ok so I thank you for your answer. At least you answered!</p>
              <p>3. Since you already answered me about christian miracles "surpassing" all human knowledge. Can I also ask what is your opinion on hindu miracles, muslim miracles and buddhist miracles?</p>

              <p>It's something new to you because you probably are not aware of the Christian roots of modern science. Again SECULAR sources are available for you to read up on this. I even quoted Loren Eisley, a non-Christian, who relunctantly credit the Christian worldview for being the impetus for modern science. It's a historical fact, the earlier you concede that the less you have the mistake of thinking that science and the Bible are in perpetual conflict.</p>

              <p>1. Which parts of my discussions led you to believe that I have a closed mind? If you can, please show me </p>
              <p>2. Yes I acknowledged that you say that there is currently no evidence for miracles because miracles 'are supposed to be' beyond human comprehension.</p>
              <p>3. For muslim miracles and hindu miracles, I just want your opinion? I mean I would love to ask them if I could, but since we are on the topic of miracles, I thought it would be relevant to ask you because you do believe in a "supernatural world". Do you think their miracles are also powerful and a testimony for their respective God?</p>

              <p>My social Studies teacher back in secondary school.. and my uni
              lecturer has been telling me that if the source itself is
              unreliable, the content itself will be unreliable. So you are
              asking TCMC to interact with unreliable content?</p>

              <p>I have no problem with religious sources, if they are sound.</p>
              <p>But what BIC is doing wrongly is to quote all his sources from religious websites and books and insists he's being objective.</p>
              <p>It's wrong. The correct method is to quote from both religious and nonreligious.</p>
              <p>Thats what I do too. E.g, When i look up the age of the dead sea scrolls, i look at both religious and nonreligious sources.</p>
