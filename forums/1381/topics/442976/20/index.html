              <p>The commandment to preach the Good News is exactly that, a commandment. Christians are to obey, even if some of us don't like it. And I think the fact is that many Christians find evangelism (esp street evangelism and just talking to people like that) something very difficult to do, and cite all kinds of reasons for that. But of course, relatively speaking, it would be that talking to someone about Christ is easier than to love God and love our neighbours as ourselves since we always battle with the flesh.</p>

              <p>1. Wait but do you obey all the commandements? Then why you choose the great commission verse to obey only? How you pick and choose which to obey? Just curious :)</p>
              <p>2. Ok you are ok with people coming to you to convince you to leave your religion? Wow. But you tell me to leave christians alone. Anyway, it doesnt mean if you are ok with it, other people are ok also. They might not like it when you tell them to leave their religion?</p>

              <p>James 1:27 says "Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you."</p>

              <p>correction....baptists are called because of our strong belief that baptism is a public proclaimation of your faith, for confessing Christians, therefore there is no child baptism; <strong>Baptism is not a mean to salvation, for salvation comes by faith alone,</strong> and baptists believe in baptism by immersion, as an emulation of the baptism that Jesus went through.</p>

              <p>Christianity wouldn't agree on tat cos it's nt stated in the bible. I do nt deny though tat Buddha may have really existed as a human being. The issue to christians is nt whether Buddha, Guan yin etc existed. Its abt who is God the creator. Which is why I told tcmc b4 tat we can only compare creationistic wif creationistic, non creationistic wif non creationistic.  </p>

              <p>Christians heaven is also an exclusive clubs for Christians....Jesus said that man cannot be good enough, by God's standard to enter heaven. Man needs to accept Jesus as their personal savior, to enter heaven, to be saved from outside the heaven. Jesus has paid the price for those who believe in Him.</p>
              <p>Don't think there is any other faith that is similar.</p>
