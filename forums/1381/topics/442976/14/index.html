              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Your reasons for rejecting belief in the afterlife are fallacious and they are commit the fallacy of begging the question.</p>
              <p>1. Is it because no one has been there, therefore there is no afterlife, or because there is no afterlife thus no one has been there? Which is which? And how do you know no one has been there? Because there is no afterlife. How you know there is no afterlife? Because no one has been there. If you cannot see the circularity of your argument then you really need to take a logic 101 course. Need me to teach you?</p>
              <p>2. Why do you assume that the afterlife is a physical place? Who told you that the afterlife is a physical place? This also exposes the naturalism that you cling to. Always looking for things that can be available to the five senses. Yet in your daily life you are happy to know that many things are real and true despite not being susceptible to empirical testing. The laws of logic is one good example.</p>
              <p>3. How you know that no one knows? You could just as well be projecting your own ignorance here. Have you known everyone who has ever lived on the planet? Then how you conclude that no one knows? What if someone does claim to know? You will then ask for proofs that commit the same question begging fallacies as 1 or 2 above.</p>

              <p>1. You agreed it can be interpeted in many ways easily, whether callously or not. Is it because the bible is too generic? Or is it because on one chapter it says salvation is by grace and in another chapter it says baptism is needed for salvation?</p>
              <p>2. Why you always talk until so serious? "Throw the whole christianity is disarray"?? No. I am just confused regarding christians interpeting the verses differently, even in the core essentials of the faith.</p>
              <p>a) Like even in issues of whether jesus was god and nature of heaven and hell, there are differences. SOme christians tell me that heaven and hell are not literal places and I do not have to worry while some christians tell me they are literal places.</p>
              <p>b) Some christians tell me there will be a2ND CHANCE when I die where jesus will preach the gospel in hades again but soem christians tell me there is no 2nd chance.</p>
              <p>So who should I believe? I also want to "be safe and saved"</p>

              <p>1. There are many reasons why people can have different interpretations of the Bible. It is reductionistic to ascribe it to one reason, generic. I have also given you another reason, people (like you lah) are just being shoddy and callous in handling the Word of God. Also, everyone has their own cultural and social background that we often import into the text, and this can affect how the Bible is to be read. A good example is the belief in evolution. If one believes that science determines truth, then one will take evolution as true and force it onto the Bible, or else force the Bible to fit the evolutionary view and come up with what Dawkins called "barking mad" theistic evolution. BTW, nowhere does the Bible says that baptism is needed for salvation. But the Bible clearly says that salvation is by grace so that no one can boast of works. You need to let the clear words of Scripture take precedence. A good interpretation will be able to account for other APPARENTLY conflicting verses. But such explanations cannot be ad hoc or arbitrary.</p>
              <p>2. Dude, you are confused? Who are you kidding? Is your personal confusion a reason for rejecting the faith? No, you seem not to be confused at all that Christianity must be rejected. Stop giving the impression that you are a helpless victim of confusion. Many times we are confused because we lack the necessary knowledge. But you take the lack of knowledge as your certainty and confidence to reject the faith.</p>
              <p>3. You truly confused about Jesus, heaven and hell meh? Doesn't look like it to me at all. Jesus Himself claimed to be God, and never denied the worship due to God alone. Even when Thomas called "My God and my Lord" Jesus did not correct him. All indicators clearly point to Jesus' deity. And Jesus spoke about heaven and hell a lot. He spoke of hell as a place of torment. You think this torment is fictional and not real? If so, what's so scary about a nonliteral hell? And even if you want to be allegorical about it, you will then have to come to terms with an allegorical hell that is literally tormenting. I would say a real hell is consistent with real torment.</p>
              <p>4. You are so easily confused and swayed by what others are telling you because you NEVER had a proper foundation to begin with. You cannot even make a stand and study the Bible diligently, or reason properly. Hebrews said that it is appointed for man to die ONCE and face judgement. Ask yourself then where is the place for a second chance? Did Jesus ever hint of a second chance in any of the Gospels? Hebrews also say "Today is the day of salvation", saying that we ought to make a choice for God today while we still have today. It does not say, "no worry, you can still make a choice after you are dead."</p>

              <p>1. I am not reductionist what. I know there are a few reasons. No, I really  understand what you are saying about social and cultural background. Like christians in catholic churches worship in a different way compared to protestant christians like you etc. But the goal is the same, I understand. </p>
              <p>But my question is - All christians supposedly hear the voice of God. And God apparently tells them whether E.g tongues is biblical/unbiblical. So one camp says "GOd tells me" and the other camp also says "God tells me". Yes it could probably be cultural differences or different understanding. But the problem comes when boths sides say "God tells me". If both claim "God tells me", then one has to be wrong because apparently, God cannot contradict himself.So how do you tell who is wrong and who is right when BOTH camps quote verses? This is what I am trying to ask you all the time. I know your answer will be "by the spirit". But both camps also do go by "the spirit". So how?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Lets skip this question of whether jesus is god or not because you seem not to understand that non-trinitarian christians also can quote verses in the bible to justify non-trinitarian beliefs, just like you can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. About salvation, </p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: -webkit-auto; font-size: medium;">1 Peter 3:18-19 read as follows:</p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: -webkit-auto; font-size: medium;">"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;"</p>

              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: -webkit-auto; font-size: medium;">So for christians who told me that jesus will go to "prison" to preach to the spirits to give the dead a second chance, they quote the above verses.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: -webkit-auto; font-size: medium;">So yes you believe there's no second chance after we die by quoting verses, these christians also tell me that there's a second chance.</p>

              <p>Your reasoning is absurd. Perhaps you are ignorant, but it is easy to verify that LOTR is a work of fiction simply because that's what the author himself said. Same with Narnia.</p>
              <p>And yes, I am basically saying that just because empirical proofs are not there, it doesn't mean you conclude that the said thing in question does not exist. Neither am I saying that it exists. We have to consider the rationale for the belief that it exists or it does not exists. For you, you simply take the option that what cannot be empiricallly proven must be rejected. But empiricism itself is self-refuting. Do you have empirical proof that empiricism is the truth?</p>

              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">1. I am not reductionist what. I know there are a few reasons. No, I really  understand what you are saying about social and cultural background. Like christians in catholic churches worship in a different way compared to protestant christians like you etc. But the goal is the same, I understand. </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">But my question is - All christians supposedly hear the voice of God. And God apparently tells them whether E.g tongues is biblical/unbiblical. So one camp says "GOd tells me" and the other camp also says "God tells me". Yes it could probably be cultural differences or different understanding. But the problem comes when boths sides say "God tells me". If both claim "God tells me", then one has to be wrong because apparently, God cannot contradict himself.So how do you tell who is wrong and who is right when BOTH camps quote verses? This is what I am trying to ask you all the time. I know your answer will be "by the spirit". But both camps also do go by "the spirit". So how?</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">2. Lets skip this question of whether jesus is god or not because you seem not to understand that non-trinitarian christians also can quote verses in the bible to justify non-trinitarian beliefs, just like you can.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">3. About salvation, </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">1 Peter 3:18-19 read as follows:</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;"</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><em>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me, because the Lord has anointed Me to preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound.ï¿½ (Isaiah 61:1)</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">So for christians who told me that jesus will go to "prison" to preach to the spirits to give the dead a second chance, they quote the above verses.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">So yes you believe there's no second chance after we die by quoting verses, these christians also tell me that there's a second chance.</p>

              <p>Maybe it has to do with collective consciousness....I think all

              <p>Interesting. But what was not mentioned was, prayers to who? Who did they interview? What's the mix of religion included in the research? And why insist that prayers include the phrase, "for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications"? Why do these researchers ASSUME that prayers are like rubbing a genie bottle that will always get you what you want?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it is mentioned that "Analyzing complications in the 30 days after the operations, the researchers found no differences between those patients who were prayed for and those who were not." Is it not possible that those who were prayed for and lived, would have died had no prayers been made at all? Did the researchers consider this possibility?</p>
              <p>But let's not go further than what is warranted. This study is hardly conclusive as already admitted by the article. It is only SUGGESTIVE. No need to press panic button.</p>

              <p>That depends much on what you prayed for, isn't it? Didn't you know that God always answer prayers, just that the answers can be yes, no or wait? A "no" answer is still an answer, no? Yes?</p>
