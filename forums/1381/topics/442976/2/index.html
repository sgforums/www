              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>LOL! Now you are shaking in your knees liao ya? You asked me to empirically prove that miracles happened. This means that you KNOW there is a way to do so. I asked you what is the accepted way to empirically prove miracles happened 2000 years ago and you now give crap excuses? I am 100% willing to provide the proofs you want, but you are 100% unwilling to supply the tools for such a task. When a scientist makes a scientific claim, he knows he can rely on the scientific method to prove or disprove a claim. Now tell me, what methodology should I use to prove that an event or miracle took place 2000 years ago?</p>
              <p>You still cannot provide me with an answer?</p>

              <p>You make a claim and you ask me how to prove it? Hahahahaha! This is by far the funniest thing I have heard.</p>
              <p>BIC, honestly, I have met christians who are more humble than you are. They make a claim about miracles but they admitthey cannot prove it. They also tell me that it is by faith that they believe that the miracles took place. And I accepted their reasoning. These christians are nice and reasonable.</p>
              <p>But you? You want to twist your argument, twist facts. You want to talk as if you can prove the miracles when in fact you can't and also push the responsibility to me. You were the one who made the claim.</p>
              <p>Come on, if you made a claim, YOU find the means to prove it. No one goes around begging for the means to prove something they claimed.</p>
              <p>Scientists use the scientific method and they prove their claim. If you cant use the scientific method, then find another method to prove your claim! No one goes around BEGGING for the means to prove their own claims!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>End of the day, like what Rooney said, the onus is ON YOU, the claimant, to prove your claims, no matter what method you use, I dont care. But if you claim it, you prove it.</p>
              <p>Can you imagine when Isaac Newton proposed about gravity and someone asks him to prove it and Isaac Newton says "GIVE ME THE METHODOLOGY TO PROVE GRAVITY THEN I WILL SHOW YOU THAT GRAVITY IS REAL!"</p>

              <p>1. Since when did I ask you to prove that miracles in the Bible happened? I am only asking you to prove the claim that it is empirically possible to prove that miracles happened. And if so, provide the methodology. Until now you still FAIL to do so.</p>
              <p>2. I see that humble Christians are those who agree with you. What a self-serving definition of humility!</p>
              <p>3. How am I twisting anything? You said that miracles can be empirically proven. I asked you how. You cannot answer me and now you are blaming me for your failure? Please don't try to divert things here. You demand for empirical proof that miracles happened. I am asking you to first prove the claim that there are empirical methods for proving such things. Do you not know that the scientific method is the empirical method? Looks like you don't know anything at all! Tell me what other method is empirical besides the scientific method. You tell me and I sure provide you the proof you demand.</p>
              <p>4. Yes, the one who makes the claim prove the claim. So since you make the claim that empirical methods can prove that miracles happened, I am asking you to prove that claim. Why can't you do that? Tell me you are denying that empirical methods can prove miracles and I will not push this point and embarass you further.</p>
              <p>5. Isaac Newton used the scientific method to prove gravity. I have no quarrel with that at all. I will use the scientific method to prove a scientific claim. But now we are talking HISTORY, whether something happened before. So tell me again, what accepted empirical methodology do you have in mind that can be used to prove that miracles happened 2000 years ago? How come you still cannot give me a simple answer to a simple question?</p>
              <p>6. For the record I say it again. You show me how miracles can be proven by empirical means and I will show you that the miracles happened. Until now you FAILED to rise up to the challenge. I am willing to shoulder the burden of proof. I am NOT asking you to prove the miracles in the Bible so don't be so defensive and scared. I am only asking you if you know of any empirical way to prove that miracles happened. If you don't know, then how are you going to assess anything?</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">But this was a truth which he had known for certain and had always assumed for many years.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Certainly there can be no doubt that the peculiar geometrical form in which the exposition of the<em>Principia</em> is dressed up bears no resemblance at all to the mental processes by which Newton actually arrived at his conclusions.</p>

              <p>1. I emphasize again. No one goes around asking for a methodology to prove his own claims. If he claimed something, then he must have a methodology to prove it. If I claim a fairy talked to me and turned my teapot into a pumpkin, do I ask you to give me a methodology to prove it? Answer me. You're ridiculous!</p>
              <p>2. No. You didnt read again. How lazy! They believe miracles happen but with no evidence, only by faith. I dont believe in miracles. Yet we can resolve our differences nicely because they can come to terms that they cant prove it. We dont agree with each other but yet these christians know there isnt any evidence for miracles.</p>
              <p>3. So you're also saying, miracles cant be proved empirically, which means there's no evidence! then why dont you just admit it instead of asking me to provide you with another methodology? And in any case, you should be the one finding another method to prove if you cant do it empirically, not me. It's always the claimant job, dear creationist.</p>
              <p>4. Same as 3. If you cant prove it empirically, then find another method. And if you cant find another method, then admit theres no evidence instead of pushing the responsibility to the person who asked you to prove your claim. That is just irresponsible.</p>
              <p>5. Again, if empirically, you cant prove the miracles or you cant reproduce them, then use another method. And if you dont have any method, then admit that right now, there is no evidence for miracles in the bible. Simples as ABC. You only look irresponsible and incoherent when you push the proving job to another person when you were the one who made the claim.</p>
