              <p>yes there are no commandments in Buddhism. even the precepts are voluntary. the Buddha say you can try and test it out, dun believe and accept in anything you are taught because of teacher, tradition, holy books etc.</p>
              <p>buddhism is unlike god religions beliefs</p>
              <p>there are no self or soul</p>
              <p>no supreme god being</p>
              <p>cause and condition and dependent origination. nothing arose from being independent.</p>
              <p>salvation is obtainable by self.</p>
              <p>that is why buddhism is more receptive and readily accepted. Buddha did not claim his teachings are the truth and all other religions false.</p>

              <p>yes there are no commandments in Buddhism. even the precepts are
              voluntary. the Buddha say you can try and test it out, dun believe
              and accept in anything you are taught because of teacher,
              tradition, holy books etc.</p>
              <p>buddhism is unlike god religions beliefs</p>
              <p>there are no self or soul</p>
              <p>no supreme god being</p>
              <p>cause and condition and dependent origination. nothing arose
              from being independent.</p>
              <p>salvation is obtainable by self.</p>
              <p>that is why buddhism is more receptive and readily accepted.
              Buddha did not claim his teachings are the truth and all other
              religions false.</p>

              <p><br>god concept has been around for at least 5000 years, as Hinduism is around that. xtian 2011 and Islam about there. modern science has been around for 100 years or thereabouts, so it is not readily accepted by these people,  because if this is so, all their beliefs will be reduced to ruins and fraud. so they rather chose to believe there is a god and will defend it what you call blind faith.</p>

              <p><br>god concept has been around for at least 5000 years, as Hinduism is around that. xtian 2011 and Islam about there. modern science has been around for 100 years or thereabouts, so it is not readily accepted by these people,  because if this is so, all their beliefs will be reduced to ruins and fraud. so they rather chose to believe there is a god and will defend it what you call blind faith.</p>

              <p>Polemic hot air. No need to respond to such assertions above if you do not even bother to substantiate any of your points. Yes, the idea of God has been around for a long time. Explain why people believe in God, whether in the past or till today. Believers in God comes in all forms, from the humble farmer to the those in the highest echelons of academia.</p>
