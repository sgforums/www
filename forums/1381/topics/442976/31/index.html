              <p>not trying to get in between your discussion with BIC on this subject. We are answerable to the local laws where we are. You can't bring fruits or honey from melbourne to perth but nobody will check you for taking some drugs around. In Singapore, you are free to bring in any fruits but if you carry more than 15 gm of drugs, you will be hanged. The countries set the law, and that is the yardstick on how far you can go, here is nothing fair or not fair.</p>
              <p>You will also be answerable to your own conscience. Do you feel at ease if you steal from somebody? that is your moral yardstick.</p>
              <p>There is also a higher legal yardstick set by government, an american company set up a plan in Vietnam, they will have to follow the pollution control yardstick in america AND in Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Of course there is a higher moral yardstick for man going into eternity, that is set by God. In your case whoever in your Buddhist religion. The moral yardstick for religion and local government may be different, e.g. abortion is legal in Singapore, but it is against the moral yardstick set by God.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, which yardstick will prevail, to whom you will have to be answerable? that is for man to decide.</p>

              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>I understand this. The point is that the law must be given, and this by somebody. The law is not impersonal because an impersonal thing or force cannot enforce something that is moral. Only moral beings can hold moral beings morally accountable. The Bible teaches that a personal God, not an impersonal force, upholds the whole of creation and judges the world in righteousness. He will reward the righteous and punish the wicked, not capriciously but in accordance to His holy nature. God is not present in all things, but He created the universe and interacts with His creation.</p>
