              I never said it is wrong to attack the Christian worldview. I take issue with people like Tcmc who claims to be sincere but all I see is his constant bashing of the faith.

              <p>1. But the bible says you got to be well equipped to provide answers for nonchristians. Wouldnt it be better you think, if you look for the evidence for the miracles? Either that or there's no evidence. It's very clear cut. Got evidence - You should find. No evidence - Just say no evidence. What's so hard?</p>
              <p>2. According to the quran - Muhammed ascended into heaven, just like Jesus did. Muhammed was also illiterate but yet he wrote most the quran himself, "inspired" by angels, like how the bible is "inspired" by God.</p>
              <p>If you speak to taoists in singapore, they will tell you how their prayers were answered by the Gods. And how taoist mediums are able to help them speak to the spirits. These are miracles to them. Also some taoists believe that the Jade Emperor created humans from clay, like in the Genesis book in the bible.</p>
              <p>What do you think of these miracles?</p>

              <p>Christians believe supernatural power exists, and the power can do many things that man cannot explain or comprehend. In the Bible we read of supernatural power besides Jesus, but Jesus performed miracles to glorify God.</p>
              <p>Therefore it is not against Christianity in the belief in supernatural power!</p>
              <p>People are converted to Christianity not because of the work of supernatural power, or else they will change their faith everytime they see something they cannot explain. I believe the same goes for the muslims and the buddhists, you don't see them focus on miracles in their religious life. On the contrary, some Christians pay much attention to asking for miracles, such as divine healing. There is more to religion than just miracles.</p>

              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p>Many people convert to Buddhism or Islam too because of the teachings, the experiences that they felt with their beliefs.</p>
              <p>Same for cChristians. </p>
