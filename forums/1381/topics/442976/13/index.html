              Just live with it lah. Otherwise it looks like a case of Christophobia. Some things we just have to accept. But if you want to change things then be my guess. Good luck trying to do that.

              <p>When Jesus was on earth, His conduct was also judged as evil by others. They called Him as one who has the devil. Jesus chased the people out of the temple using a whip. Was that good or admirable in your view? Yet no one can accused Jesus of sin when He challenged them.</p>

              <p>Didn't you know, that we should all seek to emulate Christ? Paul said, imitate me just as I imitate Christ. But of course you DIDN'T know that.</p>
              <p>Nah, I think you just go for personal attack when your arguments have been demolished. You were probably thinking you were on a winning streak when few bothered to respond to your elephant hurling tactics. But I suppose the tables turned on you when I began to take you on.</p>

              <p>Actually there are different christian perspectives on this, according to the many christians I have met.</p>
              <p>1. Some christians believe that the spirits go directly to heaven or hell after death</p>
              <p>2. Some christians believe that the spirits "wait somewhere" until the last day. On the last day, jesus judges the spirits and then they will go to their respective places.</p>
              <p>3. Some christians believe that the spirits are "asleep" until the last day. On the last day, jesus judges the spirits and then they will go to their respective places.</p>
              <p>4. Some christians also believe that the spirits will wait somewhere and on the last day, these spirits will be given a SECOND CHANCE to hear the "gospel" to get into heaven</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are the 4 different interpretations from christians I know :))))</p>

              <p>Nope I dont believe in an afterlife whether its the christian afterlife, muslim afterlife or reincarnation or hindu afterlife.</p>

              <p>1. No one has been there</p>
              <p>2. No one has seen these places physically</p>

              Do you perceive there is a link between OSAS and pre-trib view? I happen to think that the pre-trib view is well supported. But as you said, none of these are salvation issues.

              <p>Yes, the Bible indeed can be easily interpreted in many ways. You have amply demonstrated it yourself with the callous way you handle Scripture, using prooftexts instead of building up a case with sound exegesis. Interpretation of the Bible come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. But no Christian worth his salt believe in the absurd notion that all interpretations are equally valid and true regardless of how they are contrary or contradictory to each other.</p>
              <p>Yes, Christians CAN disagree on passages of the Scripture and what they mean. You probably have never heard of the Counterpoint series of books where Bible scholars debate on the different views. But as I said, none of these authors subscribe to the notion that just because there are differing interpretations, therefore there cannot be a right interpretation and we must throw up our hands in despair and adopt a "what's true for you is not true for me" self-refuting relativism approach. There is always room for honest dissent over matters that does not affect the salvation of a believer. You are merely trying to hype things out and blow things out of proportion, trying to poison the well that because Christians do disagree therefore the whole Christian world is in disarray and we must reject the faith. But you conveniently ignore the fact that Christians are united over the core essentials of the faith, the non-negotiables that are clearly taught in the Scripture, while allowing for differences in view over non-essential issues.</p>

              <p>Again you expose the shallowness of your own so-called Bible study. If baptism was required for salvation, then explain how the thief on the cross could have been promised Paradise by Jesus that very day?

              <p>1. You agreed it can be interpeted in many ways easily, whether callously or not. Is it because the bible is too generic? Or is it because on one chapter it says salvation is by grace and in another chapter it says baptism is needed for salvation?</p>
              <p>2. Why you always talk until so serious? "Throw the whole christianity is disarray"?? No. I am just confused regarding christians interpeting the verses differently, even in the core essentials of the faith.</p>
              <p>a) Like even in issues of whether jesus was god and nature of heaven and hell, there are differences. SOme christians tell me that heaven and hell are not literal places and I do not have to worry while some christians tell me they are literal places.</p>
              <p>b) Some christians tell me there will be a2ND CHANCE when I die where jesus will preach the gospel in hades again but soem christians tell me there is no 2nd chance.</p>
              <p>So who should I believe? I also want to "be safe and saved"</p>

                      very day? One exception is enough to refute the argument that
                      baptism must be required for salvation.</p>
