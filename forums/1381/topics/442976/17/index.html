              <p>1. Baptism is required to go heaven </p>

              <p>No, the bible verses doesnt say all that you have mentioned!</p>
              <p>They are very clear cut that baptism is needed for salvation! Why do you say "<span style="font-size: 15px;">Mind you, I am not saying that if you are not baptised then you are not saved.</span><span style="font-size: 15px;"> "</span></p>
              <p>Why are you trying to change the verse or explain away the verse?</p>
              <p>Yes synonymous i agree, but still the verse clearly says that baptism IS NEEDED for salvation! Read the verses clearly!</p>
              <p>How can you use your "baptism not needed" verses to explain the "baptism needed" verses? Why dont you use the "baptism needed" verses to explain the "baptism not needed" verses?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Mark 16:15-16 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</em></p>
              <p><em>John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</em></p>
              <p><em>Acts 2:37-8 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</em></p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. Oh so the verses does not say what I have mentiond, but it says what you have mentioned, that it teaches that baptism is required for salvation? So the same question is thrown back at you also, why should your interpretation be more correct than mine? See, it is not just an issue for Christians only, even atheists like you also part of the interpretive problem!</p>
              <p>2. Why are you so dead sure that baptism is required for salvation and charge me with changing the verse? I did not change the verse or explained it away, I INTERPRETED the verse and explained it. And the thing is, you actually agreed with me that baptism is synonymous with salvation! So why are you still harping on the idea that baptism must precede salvation? You are really one confused bloke or else just playing the troll! BTW, do you baptise believers or do you baptised unbelievers? Answering this question will give you an answer. I also told you that one exception is enough to disprove the notion that baptism is required for salvation. The thief on the cross was not baptised but still he went to Paradise. Please explain this instead of explaining it away. Until now you have not even given a response to this.</p>
              <p>3. And your throwing verses at me proves nothing, since I can easily explained them and I have done so. In the early church, all believers are baptised (with some rare exceptions as mentioned), and belief is expressed by and through baptism. So this explains Mark 16 and Acts 2. As for John 3, nothing in the context hints at Jesus teaching about baptism. It is absurd of you to see water and automatically think it means water baptism. Had Jesus meant water baptism He would have told Nicodemus something like, "Yo Nick, why you so daft? Why you think it means going back to the mother's womb? It just mean I dunk you in water mah! Haiz...." So what if other Christians tell you it means water baptism? They can't be wrong? And if you say I am wrong, then you had better give me a better exegesis, something you failed to do on many occasions. BTW, one website I particularly like (doesn't mean I agree with everything it says though) has this to say so please read <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-John-3-5.html">http://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-John-3-5.html</a> </p>
              <p>4. But here's the clincher to sum all this up. Whether you believe baptism saves you or not is totally IRRELEVANT to the command to be baptised. It's like debating whether you should stop your car 10cm before the stop line or that your car overshot by 1cm, just stop lah, talk so much for what? Just obey and be baptised, and this issue will never bother you. It only bothers you if you disregard the command to obey for no good justification and you are worried. But then again, as an atheist I don't think you give two hoots about it. You are making this issue and hyping it up just to put Christians in a bad light, tio boh?</p>
              <p>And here's one scholarly article <a href="http://www.dbts.edu/journals/1999/McCabe.pdf">http://www.dbts.edu/journals/1999/McCabe.pdf</a> that suggests it has probably nothing to do with baptism or physical birth at all. Interesting read.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Do you think salvation is an event? Or is it a decision made in the past that one is being committed to? Wedding is an event, but marriage is a committment. In the same way, Jesus says we must abide in Him, it is a present continuous tense. If you do not abide in Him but have abandoned Him and have gone apostate, why should you believe that you are still saved and bound for heaven just because you got baptised before? You think it's fair to compel you into heaven because of baptism (a historical event that you cannot go back to change) when you have already presently decided to turn away?</p>

              <p>I thought my postings were clear enough? Anyway, I don't believe non-Christians go to heaven. Like I said, baptism is an initiation rite. There is no unbaptism rite to undo the baptism. So long as you believe, you should be baptised. But if you don't believe, there is no requirement to be unbaptised, whatever that means!</p>

              <p>Take for example a desperate situation.</p>
              <p>Old Ah Ma is dying in a few hours time and has not been baptised because of family objection.</p>
              <p>a) If her church doesnt believe baptism is not necessary for salvation, then theres no need to be baptised. But if it turns out that baptism IS needed, she will be in eternal damnation.</p>
              <p>b) If her church believes baptism is NECESSARY for salvation, then they must quickly do it, no matter what. But if it turns out that baptism isnt needed, she will still be heaven.</p>

              <p>1. Exactly my point! No one is 100% sure! Not me, not you!</p>
              <p>2. Why i am dead sure that baptism is needed for salvtion? The same reason why you are "dead sure" baptism isnt needed for salvation. Same method.</p>
              <p>3. You think its absurd, but apparently other christians from other denominations dont think so. They firmly believe that born of water IS water baptism. Still there are other verses that I have shown you. LIke i said, there are different perspectives but we can never be 100% sure if we are correct? Can you at least agree on this?</p>

              <p>You are still confused as ever. You said no one can be sure, but in the next paragraph you so dead sure. And then you try to include me in your problem. Sorry man, I no agree. There are things I am dead sure of, and there are things I am more tentative about but still confident to state. I don't think we need to insist on 100% certainty on every piece of doctrine. I accept the existence of differing interpretations, but I do not accept the absurd idea that there is no correct interpretation and that no one can know the correct interpretation.</p>
              <p>And I don't quite get your question #4 above? What dod you mean Christian? Are you squabbling again on Christian sources aka genetic fallacy?</p>

              <p>Now then you "make" God's character to suit your own beliefs.</p>
              <p>I thought God doesnt change his righteousness. he is righteous right? and if he indeed say baptism is needed for salvation and ah ma didnt baptise in time, she will still go to eternal fire.</p>
              <p>Its like if an atheist did not repent in time, no matter how good he is, he will still end up in eternal fire, according to christianity.</p>
              <p>So if baptism really needed for salvation, ji bai si liao. Really die this time. All the ah mas and ah gongs cannot baptise.</p>
