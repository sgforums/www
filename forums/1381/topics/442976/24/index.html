              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>The Bible teaches that pain, suffering, death are intrusions into the perfect creation. Such came about because of man's sinful rebellion against God's law not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Instead of depending on God and trusting what God said, man wanted to be independent of God and trust in the serpent to doubt the goodness of God. And the wages of sin is death. Today there is a lot of pain in this world. CS Lewis said that pain is God's megaphone to the world that He is there. Many think that the existence of pain reflects the non-existence of God. But the converse is true. The existence of pain is a reflection of a sin-cursed world, it is part of God's judgement on sin. And yet God is no stranger to pain. He endured the cross to atone for our sins. Through pain and death God in Christ brought about eternal life for all who would obey. Just as through one man (Adam) death came into the world, so through one man (Jesus the second Adam) life comes to all who would believe.</p>

                  every religion also have their trinity and thus Christianity is
                  hardly unique. I have been through this issue before with Tcmc.</p>

              <p>Indeed, but since when did I arge that uniqueness is an indicator of truth? I think you are equivocating too much on the word "unique". Atheism is also unique in that it claims there is no gods or supernatural, but that hardly makes it true either. So I am not making uniqueness the test of truth. But neither should you just be superficial to find some similarities between all religions and then declare they are all the same and thus man-made and thus false. Oh, of course to you they are all beautiful but completely false which IMO is one of the most patronising thing to say.</p>

              <p>that is true. Most define heaven the way they want it. The definitions defer very very widely. Thank God for revealing to us and thank Jesus for the salvation.</p>

              <p>No, Jesus did not do the same. Jesus suffered humiliation, yes, pain in the heart, foresaken by the Father when he bore the sins of the world, but it is His resurrection that make a victorious pathway to heaven, not the suffering.</p>

              <p>Trinity in Christianity is about God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit. It is not 3 in 1, and I know nothing about the Buddhists trinity, in fact, this is the first time I am hearing it. Do Buddhists call past present and future buddha buddhist trinity? If you do, then NO, there is no similarity between the Buddhist trinity and Christian trinity.</p>
