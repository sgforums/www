              <p>Wrong. In the Christian worldview, 100% of prayers get answered. But if you are only looking at "yes" answers, then you have simply entertained a genie-in-the-bottle deity which is not the God of the Bible.</p>

              <p>1. I am not reductionist what. I know there are a few reasons. No, I really  understand what you are saying about social and cultural background. Like christians in catholic churches worship in a different way compared to protestant christians like you etc. But the goal is the same, I understand. </p>
              <p>But my question is - All christians supposedly hear the voice of God. And God apparently tells them whether E.g tongues is biblical/unbiblical. So one camp says "GOd tells me" and the other camp also says "God tells me". Yes it could probably be cultural differences or different understanding. But the problem comes when boths sides say "God tells me". If both claim "God tells me", then one has to be wrong because apparently, God cannot contradict himself.So how do you tell who is wrong and who is right when BOTH camps quote verses? This is what I am trying to ask you all the time. I know your answer will be "by the spirit". But both camps also do go by "the spirit". So how?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Lets skip this question of whether jesus is god or not because you seem not to understand that non-trinitarian christians also can quote verses in the bible to justify non-trinitarian beliefs, just like you can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. About salvation, </p>
              <p>1 Peter 3:18-19 read as follows:</p>
              <p>"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;"</p>
              <p><em>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me, because the Lord has anointed Me to preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound.ï¿½ (Isaiah 61:1)</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So for christians who told me that jesus will go to "prison" to preach to the spirits to give the dead a second chance, they quote the above verses.</p>
              <p>So yes you believe there's no second chance after we die by quoting verses, these christians also tell me that there's a second chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. Do Christians go round telling people "Hey, God just spoke to me audibly and told me that baptism is required?" Sorry, I don't think that is the case at all. God speaks primarily and mainly through His Word, which is why believers are to diligently study the Word of God. God has communicated to us all that is necessary for our instruction, faith and practice. I am usually skeptical of anyone who says "God told me this or that teaching..." because of the possibility that someone may be trying to override the clear teachings of Scripture and its authority by appealing to his own subjective experience that cannot be verified or proved. Unless that has to do with God revealing certain knowledge about some event or somebody which may require your action. I believe that happens still. In any case, whatever someone claims must always be tested by Scripture, properly interpreted. Again there are tonnes of books out there on Bible interpretation. Please check them out. There is no short-cut.</p>
              <p>2. It's easy to cite prooftexts to support a certain position that one holds. The reader must then evaluate the case and see if it stands up to scrutiny. You say that there are anti-trinitarian verses. I'd say, "Bring them on and let's see if these verses really support your view." And those few verses that you earlier cited I believe I have already explained to you that the doctrine of the Incarnation can account for them all. You did not really respond to that.</p>
              <p>3. Are you that easily swayed by what people are saying and always in a confused state just because Christians differ on things? Can't you evaluate what people are saying to see if it makes sense or support what they claim? Or you never had the training to do such Bible checking? You can't fault me for being skeptical of your claim to have studied the Bible for yourself.</p>
              <p>Does 1 Peter 3:18-19 PROVE that the dead will get a chance to repent and be saved? I will say No. Why? Because those who quote the above verses to you FAILED to quote the rest of the passage and missed out verse 20. The complete text says <em>"Christ suffered for our sins once for all time. He never sinned, but he died for sinners to bring you safely home to God. He suffered physical death, but he was raised to life in the Spirit. So he went and preached to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the spirits in prison— those who disobeyed God long ago when God waited patiently while Noah was building his boat.</span></strong> Only eight people were saved from drowning in that terrible flood."</em> So tell me, WHO are these spirits mentioned? Are these just the spirits of people who die daily, or do they refer to the fallen angels (who are also spirits) who sinned against God (by consorting with the daughters of men, giving rise to the nephilims and corrupting mankind to gross wickedness necessitating in the Flood) and are now held in chains in a spiritual prison, a view I hold to? The preaching to these spirits is IMO Jesus proclaiming to these rebellious spirits that their attempts at destroying mankind has failed and that they lost their perfect state whereas sinful men can be made perfect in Christ and enjoy the heavens that the angels forfeited. Anyway I am not keen to further this issue on the fallen angels with you, but suffice it to say that the idea that people who died will have a second chance to accept the Gospel cannot be supported by this verse. Not only that, you still have to contend with Hebrews that say it is appointed for man to die once and after that to face judgement. Does this sound like a second chance?</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>I think your confusion stems from not understanding how things worked in the early church. Today we have the practice of altar calls, say the salvation prayer, and then get baptised later, sometimes much much later! In the early church, salvation was synonymous with baptism because baptism was the initiation rite into the faith, in other words, baptism was the "salvation prayer" so to speak. You want to be a Christian? Let's get baptised! Once you understand this then all the above verses will be easily explained. They do not prove that you need baptism to be saved, they only teach that one's salvation is expressed through baptism.</p>

              <p>Quick answer: They were not expecting Him to come back from the dead. The Jews have the idea of a resurrection of the dead at the end of history when the curtains are drawn, so to speak. So the idea of resurrection in 3 days not so expected. Or it could be that Jesus' dressing was different as usual but this is my speculation. It is same person same body. Remember He showed them the scars on His side and hands? Perhaps the glorified body is different in appearance in some ways, I don't know. But certainly the glorified body is qualitatively different.</p>

                  cited I believe I have already explained to you that the doctrine
                  of the Incarnation can account for them all. You did not really
                  respond to that.</p>
              <p>3. Are you that easily swayed by what people are saying and
                  always in a confused state just because Christians differ on
                  things? Can't you evaluate what people are saying to see if it
                  makes sense or support what they claim? Or you never had the
                  training to do such Bible checking? You can't fault me for being
                  skeptical of your claim to have studied the Bible for yourself.</p>
              <p>Does 1 Peter 3:18-19 PROVE that the dead will get a chance to
                  repent and be saved? I will say No. Why? Because those who quote
                  the above verses to you FAILED to quote the rest of the passage and
                  missed out verse 20. The complete text says <em>"Christ
                  suffered for our sins once for all time. He never sinned, but he
                  died for sinners to bring you safely home to God. He suffered
                  physical death, but he was raised to life in the Spirit. So he went
                  and preached to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the spirits in prison— those who
                  disobeyed God long ago when God waited patiently while Noah was
                  building his boat.</span></strong> Only eight people were saved
                  from drowning in that terrible flood."</em> So tell me, WHO are
                  these spirits mentioned? Are these just the spirits of people who
                  die daily, or do they refer to the fallen angels (who are also
                  spirits) who sinned against God (by consorting with the daughters
                  of men, giving rise to the nephilims and corrupting mankind to
                  gross wickedness necessitating in the Flood) and are now held
                  in chains in a spiritual prison, a view I hold to? The
                  preaching to these spirits is IMO Jesus proclaiming to these
                  rebellious spirits that their attempts at destroying mankind has
                  failed and that they lost their perfect state whereas sinful men
                  can be made perfect in Christ and enjoy the heavens that the angels
                  forfeited. Anyway I am not keen to further this issue on the fallen
                  angels with you, but suffice it to say that the idea that people
                  who died will have a second chance to accept the Gospel cannot be
                  supported by this verse. Not only that, you still have to contend
                  with Hebrews that say it is appointed for man to die once and after
                  that to face judgement. Does this sound like a second chance?</p>

              <p>1. Yes just like you all other christians dont go around saying "god told me this and that". Like you, they get their interpretation and beliefs from the bible and christian books. In this case, they believe that Jesus will give a second chance after humans die by interpreting the verses I gave you. You know what's the problem? You insist that your interpretation is the only correct one. They insist theirs is correct. So IN ESSENCE, you still have not given me a proper and reliable way to tell which christian's interpretation is correct. You use the bible, they use the bible You use christian articles, they use christian articles. You refute them they refute you. So can you give me other ways to know which christian's interpretation is correct? A clearer way.</p>
              <p>2. Similarly I have posed as a non-trinitarian christian and also refute the verses you use to support your trinity beliefs. Strange. You can refute me and I also can refute you. You can refute non-trinity christians but non-trinity christians also can refute you. Why??</p>
              <p>3. Yes I know you are reading in context and that the spirits referred to spirits in Noah's time. But christians who quote that verse to me also tell me that if God did that for Noah's time, he will do it also in the future. They tell me that God never changes, and is always merciful and compassionate. Well, you cant say they're wrong too right? God IS merciful and never changes! </p>
              <p>GREAT! You mentioned hebrew verses that contradict with the verses other christians gave me.</p>
              <p>Then again, if you mention hebrew verses, you must read it in context! Paul (or whoever the hebrew writer is, no one is sure) might be only referring to the people during his time! Read in context like how you read the <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">1 Peter 3:18-19 verse!!!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or do you pick and choose which verses to read in context and which not to?</p>

              <p>I think your confusion stems from not understanding how things
              worked in the early church. Today we have the practice of altar
              calls, say the salvation prayer, and then get baptised later,
              sometimes much much later! In the early church, salvation was
              synonymous with baptism because baptism was the initiation rite
              into the faith, in other words, baptism was the "salvation prayer"
              so to speak. You want to be a Christian? Let's get baptised! Once
              you understand this then all the above verses will be easily
              explained. They do not prove that you need baptism to be saved,
              they only teach that one's salvation is expressed through
              baptism.</p>

              <p>Quick answer: They were not expecting Him to come back from the
              dead. The Jews have the idea of a resurrection of the dead at the
              end of history when the curtains are drawn, so to speak. So the
              idea of resurrection in 3 days not so expected. Or it could be that
              Jesus' dressing was different as usual but this is my speculation.
              It is same person same body. Remember He showed them the scars on
              His side and hands? Perhaps the glorified body is different in
              appearance in some ways, I don't know. But certainly the glorified

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. I know of no other way other than that which I have told you. Or perhaps you prefer the way of Rome, where the Pope speaks infallibly and everyone must take that as the final word, like it or not, disagree or not? Would that be clear enough for you? The heritage of the Reformation is such that the Word of God is made available even to the peasants and laymen. Anyone can read the Word of God and knows what it says for themselves, but that is not a license to mean that the meaning of the text is determined by anyone, the meaning of the text is discovered, not made up. And God has placed in the Church mature believers (teachers, elders) who understand the Bible more than others and who can teach the Word.</p>
              <p>2. Since when did you refute my verses on the Trinity? You refuted John 10:33 meh? When? All you said was "I and the Father are one" can mean this or that. Did you refute my point that the Jews said that Jesus was claiming to be God and thus deserved to be stoned for blasphemy? You did not.</p>
              <p>3. You need to discern what the text says and what Christians do with the text. Christians that say more than what the text says and infer this or that, you just have to tell them that they have went BEYOND what the text says. I will just say that they have went beyond the text and that there is no Biblical grounds to accept that. They are merely arguing for something that is not supported by the text and its context. Moreover there are other verses that negate their view. The whole of Scripture must be taken into account. Prooftexts is not the way to prove doctrine.</p>
              <p>4. You are obviously trying to be funny here with the text in Hebrews. 1 Peter 3 clearly refers to the spirits at the time of the Flood. In Hebrews the writer is making a universal statement, not qualifying it in anyway, that <em>"just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment, so also Christ died once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people."</em> Where is the indication that it was only meant for the people living at the time when Hebrews was written? Still say you are not trolling here? You are just making an objection for the sake of it.</p>

              understand the Bible more than others and who can teach the
              Word.</p>
              <p>2. Since when did you refute my verses on the Trinity? You
              refuted John 10:33 meh? When? All you said was "I and the Father
              are one" can mean this or that. Did you refute my point that the
              Jews said that Jesus was claiming to be God and thus deserved to be
              stoned for blasphemy? You did not.</p>
              <p>3. You need to discern what the text says and what Christians do
              with the text. Christians that say more than what the text says and
              infer this or that, you just have to tell them that they have went
              BEYOND what the text says. I will just say that they have went
              beyond the text and that there is no Biblical grounds to accept
              that. They are merely arguing for something that is not supported
              by the text and its context. Moreover there are other verses that
              negate their view. The whole of Scripture must be taken into
              account. Prooftexts is not the way to prove doctrine.</p>
              <p>4. You are obviously trying to be funny here with the text in
              Hebrews. 1 Peter 3 clearly refers to the spirits at the time of the
              Flood. In Hebrews the writer is making a universal statement, not
              qualifying it in anyway, that <em>"just as each person is
              destined to die once and after that comes judgment, so also Christ
              died once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many
              people."</em> Where is the indication that it was only meant for
              the people living at the time when Hebrews was written? Still say
              you are not trolling here? You are just making an objection for the
              sake of it.</p>

              <p>2. You better go read my posts again. Yes saying jesus and father are one can mean anything. I say again. It can mean anything and not literally one as in that he's God.

              <p>3. Erm... But I think you infer a lot too from the verses like the verse about "jesus and the father are one". I am sure you do inference too with the bible verses. So whats wrong with other christians inferring?</p>
