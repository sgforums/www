              <p>This Jesus in India idea is false which is why the entire Christian beliefs are still intact.</p>
              <p>Even Bart Ehrman, who is not a friend of Christianity, says <em>"Today there is not a single recognized scholar on the planet who has any doubts about the matter.

              Muse over this:
              
              All teachings of Buddha, Jesus, Mohd and so on so forth are meant to be ''devices'' for ''awakening''. The words, stories true or untrue were meant for normal, ordinary people to ''hold'' on to them for just a while and while holding, explore and reflect on them and awake.
              Frankly, is that transpiring? 
              One has to grapple with this - a ''good'' pastor, a ''good'' priest or a ''good'' ... would allow for the above and not make empty promises  that only thru him/her that they can experience whatever that one calls - eg god, Jesus or .... these labels do not matter. They would guide and yet free another. Of course, if one is unfree how to free another? If one has not IN him/her how to give? One can be in bondage or one can be free. 
              If that is not happening, then jolly accept that these so-called people wearing the cloak of religiosity have vested interests.
              In this instance, eg, Jesus uttered seek the kingdom first and all ... or something to the effect. why? probably, he noticed that everyone and everybody is seeking something else that is ''outside' first as opposed to being inner first and flowing to the outer from the inner. The ripple counts!

              <p>Who told you that the words of Jesus were meant to be temporary devices for awakening? Where's your basis for saying that? As far as I can see, none! Jesus said that the Word of God lasts forever. His words were not meant to be temporary. You are wrong.</p>
              <p>Why does Jesus call us to seek first the Kingdom of God? Simple, He wanted us to put God first in our lives rather than to be fixated with our own needs and wants. Our physical needs are temporal, but only God can eternally satisfy our spiritual needs. And when we seek God first, God will take care of our needs in His own ways. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with your musing about inner first or outer first.</p>

              Well, sheep bleats away, there is no dignity being  the shadow of someone! There is no dignity when one tries to imitate the external of ''another'' without understanding the inner being of another.
              
              Fear beleis this stance: of always repeating and propping oneself up. Why, the beliefs that one holds onto are real for oneself, but sadly it is only in the mind. Existentially, it has no reality. The fear of one's sense of self that is attached to ... is being questioned, being challenged. Like I mentioned before, if i say, i m for eg.  a Hindu (krishna), i will fear whenever one challenges the hindu scriptures or .. why? cos I am simply repeating the words or deeds, or expereinces of Krishna, it is not  a reality for me yet n the possibility for being a reality is always open. I must be a hypocrite to go around simply saying that Hinduism is this lah, or Krishna is this lah. This is deluding myself.&gt;
              
              
              If god can satisfy our spiritual needs, then he/she/it must be lacking, how can that which created man in its/his/her own image be or want to satisfy ...? Hence, the reallity is this - Most Christians are imposing theri own versions (aka bigotry/prejudices/wearing coloured lenses) and using that to justify what god/??? is or should be. Man created god or ..in man's own image or idea of .... is or seems to the living reality for most, for the intelligent wants i doubt so
              
              I am talking spirituality and u are mired in constipated concepts and worse is that u simply parrot Jesus, in other words, it may have been true/untrue for him. Till that is a reality within u in terms of expereincing ... all these that u seem to be regurgitating is simply psychological and a bit of social relevance. Social relevance only exists when one belongs in a club. Like minded ego-tripping ones would pat each other on the shoulder and it is nothing more than this - a mutual benefit scheme
              
              I always thought that I was being biased but now I know, that selective deception is awash here with every threat to the demise of the self!

              Most question, certainly they do, but look for answers and ( nmost likely to reaffirm what has been told to them, answers derived from someone or a book or .... They do not question beleifs, traditions, so on so forth and why? There is another type that questions, â€“ they question and NOT look for answers but reevaluate, examine and drop what is misleading or erroneous. The third type â€“ simply being aware of â€¦. , cos the latter is a synthesis of inner and outer (inner and outer) Hence, i reiterate one can be religious and gravitate towards being spiritual. Religion, most are merely pointers to being spiritual. Religion (all) is learning and of course, for the seeker the possibility of it as a device to being spiritual is there. For the follower, if one is sleepwalking â€“ it is nothing but rituals after rituals. Spirituality is unlearning, not collecting, it is unlearning, a process where one unloads all the â€™â€™rubbishâ€™â€™. True or false all depends on where one is on the spectrum of learning/unleraning/relgion/spirituality
              It is only when one is being self-honest does it have meaning or will it make sense!

              <p>Even if it is possible to travel to India or China, that does not mean that Jesus did go there. There is no compelling reason for Jesus to go to China or India, nor do the Gospels hint of such, and there are good evidence to conclude that the Notovitch account was a money-spinning hoax.</p>

              <p>God called His people sheep because He is their Shepherd, and the sheep is supposed to follow the shepherd. I've got absolutely no problem with that! And the Apostle Paul exhorted us to imitate him just as he imitated Christ. The goal of the Christian is to have Christ formed in him. We are to be like Christ. Again I have no problem with that!</p>

              <p>You are NOT talking spiritually at all. There is NOTHING spiritual at all about your existentialistic musings. You accused me of parroting Jesus, guilty as charged! In fact, I would take that as a compliment to be accused of following Jesus than to be accused of following the world.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, you ARE biased, just like everyone else. Problem is, you engage in too much special pleading by putting yourself above the limitations that you subject the rest of us to. Funny how you are somehow immuned to all those self-deception that the rest of us are.</p>

              Hence, it is easy to herd sheep and sheep follows blindly and for a human being (presupposing one knows what is dignity) it is no measure to sustain oneself or lean on something to prop oneself up.
              selective deception n not being self-honest belies fear and that seems to dominoe the psychological terrain of herd-mentality types!
