              <p>Just because you are so politically correct and being liberally inclusive does not mean you are right. If rude means to offend someone, then I can also say that you are being rude to us when you anyhow call people Christians. And I did not say that being different = wrong. But neither should you anyhow label others as Christians when they do not pass the test of orthodoxy as defined by the major creeds. You simply try to portray yourself as some enlightened politically correct dude at the expense of truth, diluting, distorting, and contorting the fundamentals of the Christian faith. You, who have no proper foundation in Christianity, can decide who is Christian or not? Sheesh, you don't even demonstrate basic knowledge of Christianity!</p>

              <p>Just because you are so politically correct and being liberally
              inclusive does not mean you are right. If rude means to offend
              someone, then I can also say that you are being rude to us when you
              anyhow call people Christians. And I did not say that being
              different = wrong. But neither should you anyhow label others as
              Christians when they do not pass the test of orthodoxy as defined
              by the major creeds. You simply try to portray yourself as some
              enlightened politically correct dude at the expense of truth,
              diluting, distorting, and contorting the fundamentals of the
              Christian faith. You, who have no proper foundation in
              Christianity, can decide who is Christian or not? Sheesh, you don't
              even demonstrate basic knowledge of Christianity!</p>

              <p>what logic are you referring to? that non christians are not in the same world as we do? I was refer to the "your world" and "the real world" mentioned, Tcmc is certainly not of the same world where Christians are, but we are coexisting in the same earth. Hehehe...you take that as we live in different planet?</p>

              <p>Don't see him as judging Christians, except for some stupid remarks, and it is not for any of us Christians to judge, Christians or non Christians.  We are of different world because our values are different, our world views are different, what we look forward to are different, ... even among christians, christians of different races in different places are also living differently due to different cultures...how does that end up in war?</p>
              <p>But my point is that people outside my world, or should I say my family, are beginning to put my family members into different categories, that I think is uncalled for. </p>
