              <p>I was enlightening you on how those verses ought to be understood. That they do not prove that you need to be baptised in order to be saved. That a better way to understand these verses is that baptism is synonymous with salvation. Now you are harping on a different thing. If you ask me, I would say that if there is a salvation case before me today then baptism should be the next thing to do. If today you tell me you want to be a Christian, I would say "Good! Now let's set a date for water baptism." Get it? Mind you, I am not saying that if you are not baptised then you are not saved. But that if you are truly saved you would want to be baptised just as the Lord commanded, unless you tell me that you are now hanging on a cross and not convenient to be baptised, or that you are allergic to water.</p>

              <p>Concerning John 3:5, I would add that the context was not teaching about baptism at all. Born of water refers to being born physically, and child birth involves the breaking of water bag. It makes more sense and fits the context this way too.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I like to quote this T-shirt slogan again:</p>

              <p><em>John 3:5...the ''see the kingdom of God'' in this case is

              other words, one had to be born again in order to do these miracles
              or know that these miracles are from God...Jesus was indirectly

              <p>the way you explained away the verses are very funny. You are just finding excuses for yourself not to believe in those verses!</p>
              <p>Some verses you like, you believe they are literal.</p>
              <p>Some verses you dont like, you jus say "theres a deeper meaning".</p>
              <p>Seriously, why do you pick and choose?Buffet ah?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No your answers are not adequate. Because those christians who believe that baptism is needed for salvation also do the same thing you do.</p>
              <p>They explain AWAY those verses that say that "baptism is not needed". They do the same thing as you, but opposite.</p>
              <p>So how am I supposed to know if you are speaking the truth or them?</p>

              <p>Concerning John 3:5, I would add that the context was not
              teaching about baptism at all. Born of water refers to being born
              physically, and child birth involves the breaking of water
              bag. It makes more sense and fits the context this way too.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I like to quote this T-shirt slogan again:</p>
              <p>Born Once Die Twice. Born Twice Die Once.</p>

              <p>Explaining the verse with your wisdom again. BIC. Why?</p>
              <p>TO the other christians who have childlike faith, they just take the verse as it is!</p>
              <p>Born of water = Baptism!</p>
              <p>Seriously. You interpret it as not baptism, but other christians told me it is baptism</p>
