              In Christianity it is taught that the infinite God cannot be known or comprehended, which is way God chose to reveal Himself to us in various ways, so that while we finite beings cannot know God fully we can know God truly in the things revealed to us. But who told you about karma since there is no self revelation from karma about karma?

              I would say that the conclusion does not follow because I can still use the umbrella to shade me from the sun.

              <p>Yes, science is based on logic and reasoning, but why say i.e. atheists? Are all atheists logical in their reasoning? The answer is NO. Do atheists believe in absurd things? YES.</p>
              <p>You said that science cannot explain religion and religion goes against the law of science, but which religions are you referring to? Because it certainly does NOT apply to Christianity, which was the worldview that gave rise to modern science. And you probably don't seem to be well acquainted with scientific literature which are littered with the word "believe".</p>
              <p>Anyway, your last statement has already been proven wrong by history as I earlier alluded to. It was precisely because Science and Religion (i.e. Christianity) mix that we have modern science.</p>
