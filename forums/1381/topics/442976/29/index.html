              <p>But it doesn't teach that our present universe came about because an old one ceased to exist. Remember you are coming from a worldview that says that history is cyclical whereas the Biblical worldview of history is linear. universe has a beginning and there was no universe prior. The new heavens and new earth is the eternal state that God has established after the present fallen state is done away with. The Buddhist view does not talk about a fallen world that needs to be dealt with.</p>

              <p>Yes, it is a fallacy, but the question is, are Christians guilty of it? The answer is, it depends on how one answers it! In other words, some Christians do argue the God of the gaps, and some do not. But more often the case it is the atheist who CARICATURES the answer in an attempt to poison the well, in saying that ALL Christians commit this fallacy. As the following article well demonstrates, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the god-of-the-gaps argument is only good against a particular deistic approach to God and nature, and loses its potency when Scripture and science are pursued together.</span></strong></p>
              <p>See <a href="http://creation.com/whose-god-the-theological-response-to-the-god-of-the-gaps">http://creation.com/whose-god-the-theological-response-to-the-god-of-the-gaps</a></p>
              <p>But what the atheist conveniently forgets, and is obviously blinded to, is his very own fallacious naturalism of the gaps argument which ALL atheists ALWAYS commit, which is that what we do not know now from science, given time we will know and it will have absolutely nothing to do with God.</p>
