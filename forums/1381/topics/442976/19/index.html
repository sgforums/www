              <p>I will put it simply for you ok? I am an exchristian so i roughly know .</p>
              <p>1. Jews believe in the Torah, and that God is YHWH. Religion of jews is called Judaism. Judaism was formed about 4000 years ago. Later Jewish scriptures do mention Jesus as a misguided man. Jews do not believe that Jesus is God.</p>
              <p>2. Christians believe in the Torah and the new testament and that Jesus is God. Christianity was formed about 2000 years ago. </p>
              <p>3. Muslims believe in the Torah (a bit different from the Jewish torah) and the Quran. Islam was formed about 1400 years ago. Muslims also do not believe Jesus is God. Muslims believe Jesus was a good man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Christians believe their new testament supercedes the Jewish Torah. Muslims believe their Quran supercedes BOTH the Torah and Bible.</p>
              <p>Generally speaking.</p>
