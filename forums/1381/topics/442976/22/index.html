              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>I mentioned before that if one takes a rather superficial
                          approach one can find many similarites among the religions. This
                          however, proves too much from too little. To believe that the
                          universes will fade in and out is to believe that matter is
                          eternal. This is of course a faith metaphysical position to hold.
                          Scientifically speaking this is impossible. There is no known
                          natural process that can achieve this. The amount of energy
                          involved would be infinitely enormous. Even a bouncing ball will
                          eventually suffer from "heat death" as in there is no more usable
                          energy left and the ball will just stop bouncing. The Christian
                          worldview does not posit that matter is eternal but that God who is
                          Spirit is eternal. God is thus not subjected to the laws of nature,
                          in fact He is the Creator of the laws of nature and upholds
                          them.</p>

              <p>Okay ok I respect your choice of faith and religion....lets not fight over this....Hahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I didn't say that matter is eternal....In fact for some buddhists, The Buddha is eternal....in spirit/mind...He came down to earth (as a human) to lead people out of sufferings....</p>

              <p>no Buddhism does not have a creator, neither is salvation depended on an external source ie god or whatever. salvation depended on one self. this is the difference. of course this is the buddhist views, you may beg to differ.</p>

              <p>What constitutes "complete" is very subjective.</p>
              <p>To some people, complete doesnt mean need to have a"beginning" and "end".</p>

              <p>Cos in Hinduism salvation is by good works nt by a r/s wif the
              creator. I gave a full explanation to tcmc already how I eliminated
              the religions one by one until I was left wif christianity. But the
              premise is one have to start of creationistic which I was all
              along. Also to the creationists, r/s were created by the creator n
              if u observe the nature of creation, inventors/creators usually
              create wad they desire. So a creator of r/s must be one who desires
              r/s wif his followers. Heaven is part of creation so its the home
              of the creator. The family concept on earth was also put in place
              by the creator. So be comes the qn, when a baby is born, how does
              it get to be part of the same family as the parents? By doing gd or
              simply cos the baby is the child of the parents?</p>

              <p>Your christianity is also based on FAITH and GOOD WORKS.</p>
              <p>Most christians would agree that Faith without works is dead and that belief and faith alone will not save a christian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So essentially, christianity IS the same as many other religions including islam, hinduism and sikhism.</p>
              <p>Most religions require believers to exercise FAITH/BELIEF and also good works.</p>
              <p>There is no difference in fact.</p>

              <p>In islam, you need to believe Allah FIRST, then do good works, similar to CHristianity.</p>
