              <p>I think your definition of faith may need a little tweaking. In my view, faith is not about having all the answers. It is about trusting in God even when we do not have all the answers. It rests on the sufficiency, truthfulness, reliability of the answers we already have. Not having all the answers is not the same as not having all the right answers. I am OK with not having all the answers, but if the answers I have are wrong or false then there is cause for concern! If I am not wrong, all religions purport to teach truths, if not THE truth. Each religion will claim to have the right/true answers in what it teaches. Now as a Christian it is my belief that the Bible is 100% inerrant. This is what Jesus and the apostles taught as well. Today many believe it is not, but for these people where is the assurance then that what they choose to believe is indeed true if the Bible is not inerrant in its entirety?</p>

              <p>Who created God?</p>
              <p>Personally I believe in God but as an atheist thinking, God is merely an imagination from humans, just like in the past, during thunders, humans believed God was angry... science came in and realize the chemistry/physics behind why rain and thunders took place...</p>
              <p>Someone asked me whether I am a free thinker or a Christian, I can say I am both. When it comes to science exams, like physics, unless I want to fail my exams, otherwise I need to use logical explanation in how things work, for example thunder... I cannot say because God is angry.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I believe science has its limitations. Some things are beyond explanation yet because we have yet to grasp that kind of understanding. Like for example, why some people so emo... logical explanation is only possible if someone managed to delve into their brain and understand the DNA/chemical reactions happening between the brain on that exact person at that exact point of time, which at this time is still impossible to do... Science has also yet to tell me a simple answer such as what is the black hole made of? where did all the things they suck go into?</p>
              <p>But for now, I must continue to pass my exams and I must continue to make the best use of my logical knowledge and reasoning to move forward in life... for things such as God, I will know soon enough when I die.</p>

              <p>you are absolutely right, who says God is angry with the Thai and flooded the whole country, why is God angry with NZ with so many earthquake, why is God always angry with the philippino when typhoon is unleashed every year there for several month....we do not attribute everything we know or don't know to God.</p>
              <p>When you study physics, you analyse and explain everything with theories, and when you paint a picture or do a sculpture, you see the beauty and feel the life it illustrates. You dont' feel in physics and you can't analyse in arts, and, for years man thought F=MA is true, but later in the microscopic world when we deal with electrons and neutrons, F=MA is not true anymore. and in arts, what is beautiful to you may not be beautiful to others.</p>
              <p>Don't need to die before you know there is a God, those of us who know God are not dead yet. hahaha...</p>

              <p>Yes religion is (mainly) about faith, often about what we cannot comprehend(fully). And there is definately no science available on what we don't know. But unless i've misread, BIC also believes that religion/faith shouldn't be out of bounds to scientific reasoning, just because we do not have a means/method/techonology yet.</p>
              <p>And i do respect the free choices of others. I engage in disscussions because i believe we can better sort out/refine our thinking/understanding through such. I have personally experienced that having to explain to others my understanding of a subject improves my own understanding as well. I hope you get to benefit from this as much as i do too.</p>

              <p>In saying so, most critics do not have a philosophical problem with a God who is eternal since they can accept the idea of an eternal universe. But to say that the universe i.e. matter is eternal is still problematic. How does mere matter give rise to life or mind or consciousness or morals or logic? It cannot give what it does not have. A self-existing eternal God (who is a Personal Being i.e. possessing mind and will) that is omnipotent can cause into existence matter out of nothing.</p>
