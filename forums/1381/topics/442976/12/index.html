              <p>So according to the Christians, when people die they go to Heaven straight away? Or loiter around the physical planes waiting for Judgement day? I have mixed view points from my Christian frens....so what's your opinion ?</p>

              <p>before we go further, I don't want to go into philosophical discussion, for I am not a philosopher. It doesn't matter what other believes, do you think our life will end the moment we stop breathing and certified dead by the doctor? If you don't, enjoy your life while you still breath...hahaha don't we all want to do that? just don't work so hard making so much money then no time to spend.</p>
              <p>If you think that, may be, there is an after life, then you should seek the one who control the after life. It is a personal search, too much discussions no use, nobody have been there and come back!!</p>
              <p>My opinion is not important, I accepts what the Bible teaches, there is a beginning of time, where God created heaven and earth, there is an end of time, where God will reign in the new heaven and new earth. Where would I be then?  go to Heaven straight away after my physical death or loiter around the physical planes waiting for Judgement day, may be come 7 month got entertained by the getai...hahaha...just joking, I don't really know, and it doesn't really matter to me because I know I will be in God's hand.</p>

              What's the matter? Can't live with the fact that our calendar is dated with reference to Jesu Christ? Even the days of the week are named after Roman deities and we all are living with that.
