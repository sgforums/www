              <p>Alright then. I'm not knowledgeable about theological issues, but I'll give it a go since no one else is keen.</p>
              <p>1. All Christians should be aware, but not many actually are, that the biblical description of the resurrection differs quite significantly between the various gospels. How many people went (one Mary, two Marys w/o Joanna), whether there were angels at the tomb (none, one or two?), when the stone was rolled away -- there were differences for each of these in the different gospels. I've seen efforts to explain away these differences, but these strike me as tenuous. If the gospels are inconsistent and/or omit key details of such an important event, what else can we trust of their account?</p>
              <p>http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/charts/resurrection_accounts.htm</p>
              <p>2. As far as I can gather, the majority of New Testament scholars agree that the gospel of Mark originally ends at 16:8. "Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid." (NIV). In other words, the original ending of Mark had very little about Jesus rising from the dead. The subsequent versus 9-16 were found only in later manuscripts, and had stylistic differences from the rest of the gospel. Some scholars therefore believe that this longer ending of Mark was forged, while even the NIV includes a disclaimer:</p>
              <p>[The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses 9–20.]</p>
              <p>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A9-20&amp;version=NIV</p>
              <p>3. In a debate between prominent Christian apologist William Lane Craig and well-known biblical scholar Bart Ehrman on this very issue, Ehrman made the very compelling point that a miracle is by definition the rarest of events. Therefore, a reasonable person would accept explanation by miracle only as the last resort, in the absence of all other possible explanations. So as unlikely as a tomb theft could be, it would still be more likely than the fact that Jesus rose from the dead. For example, if Ong Teng Cheong's body goes missing, would you automatically accept that he had gone to heaven, body and soul?</p>
              <p><cite class="kvm"></cite>Now, Craig is a formidable opponent, and he wins more than his fair share of debates with atheists, but I thought he was out of his depth, and simply outclassed in his exchange with Ehrman. You can watch the full debate, broken up into 12 parts, here:</p>
              <p><cite class="kvm">www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjOSNj97_gk</cite></p>
              <p>Again, I'm no expert on theological issues, and I've found it hard to find objective information about the bible. In many cases, it simply comes down to "he said, she said", which makes debate difficult for non-specialists. The above three points seem to me some of the more digestible and objective challenges.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In December, 1945, </span><a href="http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc; font-size: x-small;">early Christian writings</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"> containing many secrets of the early Christian religion were found in upper Egypt, a location where many Christians fled during the Roman invasion of Jerusalem.

These writings affirmed the existence of the doctrine of reincarnation being taught among the early Jews and Christians. These Christian mystics, referred to as </span><a href="http://www.gnosis.org/whatisgnostic.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc; font-size: x-small;">Christian Gnostics</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">, were ultimately destroyed by the orthodox Church for being heretics. Their sacred writings were destroyed and hidden with the belief that they would be revealed at an appropriate time in the future. The discovery in 1945 yielded writings that included some long lost gospels, some of which were written earlier than the known gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.<br><br>Brian A. Bain, M.A., has this to say about the 1945 discovery:</span></p>

The Gnostic texts devoted extensive tracts to what readers could expect to encounter when they died. Other passages make numerous allusions to near-death-like experiences that can be realized in this life, most notably the human encounter with a divine light. The Gnostic Christian literature gives us one more example of NDEs and similar experiences in the ancient world."</span></p>

It is an important concept found in the gospel of John:</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Logos is the part of God that acts in the world. It is the perfect unity of the human and the divine. This is affirmed by John when he wrote that "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." When John stated that Jesus is the Logos, he is stating that Jesus became the Logos, the Christ. The Logos is the divine "spark" of God within humans that needs to awakened. Everyone has the "image of the Word (Logos)" within them and it is for this reason that Genesis describes humanity as created "in the image and likeness of God."The Logos is the divine Spirit in humanity. By using the Christian Gnostic idea of the Logos, John is not only affirming the preexistence and divinity of Jesus, but he is affirming that all sons of God created in the "image of the Word" as Jesus was, preexisted in spirit before being born. In other words, every human is an incarnation of the Logos and every human has to potential of becoming like Jesus, a manifestation of the human-divine unity. Every human can be a "Christ" and because of this, every soul will eventually be drawn back to God.<br><br>The Roman Church misunderstood what the Logos was in John and incorrectly concluded from this that only Jesus is divine - the Word made flesh. The orthodox Church either rejected or ignored this Christian Gnostic concept found in John. This may have been a factor when the gospel of John was almost rejected from New Testament canon when it was being put together. This was during a time when Christian Gnosticism became an enemy of the organized Church. Nevertheless, it was the idea of the preexistence of the soul and its corresponding doctrine of reincarnation that the Roman Church had great difficulty with.<br><br>The Christian Gnostics emphasized spiritual knowledge rather blind faith as the road to salvation. They indicated that they possessed <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/welcome.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">secret knowledge</span></a> (i.e., "gnosis" in Greek) concerning the hidden meaning of the "resurrection." This was a part of the secret teachings of Jesus handed down to them by the apostles. This special knowledge was restricted to people who were given the public teachings of Christianity before qualifying to be initiated and receive the secret teachings. In contrast, the very term "Catholic" means "universal", implying that anyone could become a member of the Church by adhering to the public teachings of faith and rituals. The Christian Gnostics were harsh critics of the orthodox Church. The Christian Gnostics accused the Church of watering down the gospel in order to popularize it for the masses. The orthodox Church stressed salvation through faith alone and by the rituals of the Church.<br><br>This secret gnosis emphasized spiritual "resurrection" (i.e,. spiritual rebirth) and physical "resurrection" (i.e., reincarnation) as opposed to a resurrection defined as people <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12792a.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sleeping in their graves</span></a> until it is time their corpses to crawl out of their graves at the last day. Christian Gnostics held the view that if spiritual resurrection was not attained in one lifetime, then the soul would be subjected to as many reincarnations as it takes until spiritual rebirth is attained.<br><br>One of the great Church leaders was <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Clement.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clement of Alexandria</span></a> in Egypt (150-211 A.D.) who indicated that he possessed the secret teaching handed down from the apostles.<br><br>In the Gnostic text entitled <a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/secretmark.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Secret Gospel of Mark</span></a>, one of the Christian Gnostic texts discovered in 1945, describes Jesus performing secret initiation rituals. Before the discovery of this secret gospel, our only knowledge of it came from a letter written by Clement. Clement quotes from this secret gospel and refers to it as, "a more spiritual gospel for the use of those who were being perfected." He also states, "It even yet is most carefully guarded [by the church at Alexandria], being read only to those who are being initiated into the great mysteries." Clement mentions elsewhere that Jesus revealed a secret teaching to those who were "capable of receiving it and being molded by it" He also affirmed that, "The gnosis (secret knowledge) itself is that which has descended by transmission to a few, having been imparted unwritten by the apostles." (<a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/strom6.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miscell. Book VI, Chapter 7</span></a>)<br><br>The existence of a secret teaching can be found in the New Testament:</span></p>

But the Church leader who made the final and greatest attempt to revive the secret teachings of Jesus within the orthodox teachings was the first Church Father named <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Origen.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Origen</span></a> (183-253 A.D.) of Alexandria in Egypt who was a disciple of Clement of Alexandra. Origen was the first person since Paul to develop a system of theology around the teachings of Jesus. His effort was the first within the orthodox church to systematize a theology on so vast a scale. Although Origen defended orthodoxy, he included in his system the wisdom of the Christian Gnostics. His theology was a perfect synthesis of "orthodox" and "gnostic" teachings and came the closest to reviving the "Lost Christianity" of the original sects, communities and schools, at a time when the Christian Gnosticism was falling into disrepute. Unfortunately, hundreds of years later, the Church declared him a heretic and his teachings as heresy mostly because they affirmed preexistence and therefore reincarnation.<br><br>Origen had this to say about the secret teachings of Jesus:</span></p>

After the first "fall", the divine consciousness descended to the level of the divided consciousness; now after another "fall", it has fallen even further, into the depths of the unconscious; it has been "forgotten." It is now humanity's privilege to discover the potential realms of human existence and face the great challenge of the "ascension of consciousness" through the Man-God-Spirit transformation.<br><br>Once souls fell into the lower levels of consciousness, they became enamored of it and burned with the desire to experience the pleasures of matter. The souls then no longer wanted to disengage itself from these lower levels. Thus the world was born. From that moment souls forgot themselves. They forgot they original habitation, their true center and eternal being.<br><br>Gnosticism proceeds from one fundamental insight: this world in which we find ourselves is thoroughly and irretrievably less than holy. The soul is trapped in a prison of flesh, and the flesh is intrinsically less than divine. According to Gnostic theology, the creation of the cosmos came about as the result of a tragicomic mistake: the fall of the soul from God. Thanks to the advent of Christ in the lower realms of consciousness, the power of reconciling the fallen souls has been given to restore the One-ness and usher in the kingdom of light over the kingdom of flesh and matter. The unity of the Godhead is assured thanks to the introduction of the new uniting force, the Logos, the part of God who acts in the flesh and the material. It is important to distinguish the Logos (Christ) from the soul named Jesus. Any person has the potential of becoming a Logos but it was the soul known as Jesus who actually incarnated as a Logos and therefore became a Christ on Earth.<br><br>We, as humans, cannot comprehend the omnipotent power available to us until we utilize the Christ power. When we effectively use the divine "Christ awareness" we have the ability to help in the liberation of the imprisoned "sparks of divinity" from flesh and rejoin them to the Source. The divine plan of creation will become complete as the divine outpouring of Christ gnosis liberates humanity from ignorance. The result of this will be the redemption of all human beings.<br><br>The Christ power can only liberate souls through the call and revelation of Christ gnosis to, "Awake, remember who you are and where you come from!" But since the soul cannot by itself hear the gnosis, the Christ power resorts to elaborate strategies to create the conditions for which all souls will be saved.<br><br>Christian Gnostics felt that initiation into the Cosmic Christ gnosis is inseparable from "<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John+1%3A9-10&amp;x=12&amp;y=10&amp;NIV_version=yes&amp;language=english"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the light which lighteth every person coming into the world.</span></a>" It is this light within, our Higher Self, which each individual must bring to at-one-ment with the divine Source if liberation is to occur.<br><br>As more and more people hear the call to "Wake up!" and attain the Christ gnosis and become liberated, their souls are received back into the bosom of Divine Consciousness. The soul becomes free from unholy flesh and the cycle of birth and rebirth. Christian Gnostics seek to achieve this by cultivating the Higher Self within people to seek reunification with the Godhead. But each soul returning to its divine source must, after death, pass through the various levels of consciousness. Sometimes Christian Gnostics describe seven of these heavenly realms, other times ten.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: medium;"><strong>Christian Gnostic Writings</strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><br><br><img src="http://sgforums.com/forums/1381/images/webmaster/icons/blue_dot.gif" border="0" alt="" width="6" height="6" align="middle">  The quote from Jesus from the Christian Gnostic gospel, the <a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/contender.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Book of Thomas the Contender</span></a>, describes Jesus teaching reincarnation:</span></p>

Some people are able to overcome ignorance by having the life-giving Spirit descend upon them. These souls "will be saved and will become perfect," that is, escape the cycle of birth and rebirth. John asks Jesus what will happen to those who do not attain salvation. They are hurled down "into forgetfulness" and thrown into "prison," the Christian Gnostic symbol for a new body.<br><br>Jesus says the only way for these souls to escape is to acquire knowledge after coming from forgetfulness. A soul can accomplish this by finding a teacher who can lead the soul in the right direction:</span></p>

The book explains the differences in one's fate as a result of past-life actions. A "man who curses" will be given a body that is continually "troubled in heart." A "man who slanders" will be given an "oppressed" body. A thief will be given a "lame, crooked and blind body." A "proud" and "scornful" man will be given "a lame and ugly body" that "everyone continually despises." From this, we can see how this Earth, as well as hell, is a place of education through suffering.<br><br>According to the Pistis Sophia, some souls experience hell as a place of shadows and torture. However, after these souls pass through hell, they return to Earth for further experiences. Only a relatively few extremely evil souls are not permitted to reincarnate. These souls are cast into "outer darkness" until a time when they are "destroyed and dissolved."</span></p>

One of the most interesting aspects of this text is that it corresponds to events found in the New Testament and includes references to reincarnation. Several Christian Gnostic texts combine the ideas of reincarnation and union with God.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">As Paul passes through the fourth heaven, he witnesses a soul being punished for murder. This soul is brought "out of the land of the dead" (i.e., Earth) by angels where three witnesses charge the soul with murder. The soul looks sorrowfully down and is cast down into a body that has been prepared for it. The book describes Paul's journey through the heavens, which is also symbolic for the Gnostic process of union with God.<br><br>The New Testament contains a letter by the apostle Paul to the Christians in the city of Corinth, Greece, where he had founded a church on his first visit there. The Christians at this church were being divided by the teachings of so-called "false teachers" that were infiltrating the church there and Paul wrote a letter telling them to not forget what they were taught by Paul. These "false teachers" were trying to get people to follow their teachings and not Paul's. In order to put these false teachers to shame, Paul rebukes the Corinthians by using false pride and boasting about himself and telling the church why he is more qualified than the false teachers. He tells them of his sufferings and how he was once stoned and left for dead (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2+Cor.+11%3A23-26&amp;x=12&amp;y=6&amp;NIV_version=yes&amp;language=english"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 Cor. 11:23-26</span></a>).

And I know that this person - whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows - was caught up to paradise.

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">In the above passage, Paul continued his "boasting" by telling about visions and revelations he had received from the Lord. "I know a person in Christ" means that he was speaking about himself. He explained that he didn't know if he was taken up in his body or in his spirit, but he was in paradise ("the third heaven"). This incident cannot be positively identified with a recorded event in Paul's career, although some think this may have been when he was stoned and left for dead (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Acts+14%3A19-20&amp;x=17&amp;y=7&amp;NIV_version=yes&amp;language=english"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acts 14:19-20</span></a>). Paul told about this incident to show that he had been uniquely touched by God.<br><br>Many people are unaware of this passage of the Bible and that it is a near-death experience which Paul had. The person who wrote most of the New Testament, the sacred writings of orthodox Christianity, had a near-death experience which he based his authority as an apostle of Christ to the Corinthian church. It can even be argued that his near-death experience directly or indirectly inspired his epistles.<br><br>The Apocalypse of Paul reveals how each soul must rise as best it can after death through a hierarchy of heavens and face the increasingly difficult challenges posed by the guardian angels of each heaven. The journey begins with Paul meeting a child on the mountain of Jericho on the way to heaven (symbolized by Jerusalem). This child turns out to be the Holy Spirit, who takes Paul first to the third heaven.<br><br>The Holy Spirit warns Paul to keep his wits about him for they are about to enter the realm of "principalities ... archangels and powers and the whole race of demons." The Holy Spirit also mentions that they will pass "one that reveals bodies to a soul-seed," that is, the being that takes souls and plants them in new bodies for reincarnation. For the soul who wished to ascend to the highest heaven, reincarnation was to be avoided.<br><br>When Paul reaches the fourth heaven, the Holy Spirit encourages him to look down upon his body which he has left behind on the mountain of Jericho. As Paul ascends, he witnesses in the fourth heaven the judgment and punishment of another soul. He says, "I saw the angels resembling gods ... bringing a soul out of the land of the dead." The soul has been resurrected so that it can be judged, one of the four events promised for the end of the world. The angels were whipping it.<br><br>The soul spoke, saying, "What sin was it that I committed in the world?" The "toll collector" of this heavenly gate accuses the soul. The soul replies, "Bring witnesses! Let them show you in what body I committed lawless deeds." Three bodies rise up as witnesses and accuse the soul of anger and envy, and finally murder. When the soul heard these things, it gazed downwards in sorrow ... It was cast down.<br><br>At this point we expect the soul to be cast into hell, as in later Christian doctrine, but no: "the soul that had been cast down went to a body which had been prepared for it," and was reincarnated.<br><br>Paul, somewhat shaken by this experience, was beckoned forward by the Holy Spirit and allowed to pass through the gate of the fifth heaven. Here he saw his fellow apostles and "a great angel in the fifth heaven holding an iron rod in his hand." This angel and three other angels, with whips in their hands, scourge the souls of the dead and drive them on to judgment. Paul remains with the Holy Spirit and the gates to the sixth heaven swing open effortlessly before him.<br><br>In the sixth heaven, Paul sees a strong light shining down on him from the heaven above. He is motioned by the "toll collector" through the gates of the seventh heaven. Here, he sees "an old man filled with light and whose garment was white. His throne, which is in the seventh heaven, was brighter than the sun by seven times." This old man bears a striking resemblance to Jehovah as he is described in the vision of Ezekiel.<br><br>The old man asks, "Where are you going, Paul?" Only reluctantly, after some encouragement from the Holy Spirit, does Paul speak with him and give the Gnostic sign he has learned. The eighth heaven then opens and Paul ascends. Here he embraces the twelve disciples, most of whom he has not met before, and together they rise to the ninth heaven. Finally, Paul reaches the tenth and highest heaven, where he is transformed.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: medium;"><strong>The Suppression of Christian Gnosticism</strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><br><br>The Christian Gnostics believed in reincarnation and the preexistence of the soul. They refused to believe in a resurrection of corpses at the end of time. They emphasized meeting Jesus on a spiritual level to become liberated and attain permanent citizenship in heaven. The Church of Rome of the second century A.D., on the other hand, declared that those who deny a Last Day resurrection of corpses are heretics.<br><br>Many Christian Gnostics regarded themselves as part of the organized body of Christians of the early church. However, as the organized Church gained political control of the Roman Empire, the Christian Gnostics were persecuted by the organized Church and many were martyred. The Christian Gnostic tradition is one of many branches of early Christianity labeled as heretical by the early Church fathers. The Gnostic influences and writings were cut out of official Church doctrines as heresy. Because of their suspected Christian Gnostic origins, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10521a.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Gospel of John and the Book of Revelation was almost rejected from the New Testament</span></a>. Nevertheless, the organized Church succeeded in hiding its Christian Gnostic doctrines.<br><br>It is not surprising that the orthodox Church bishops edited out the practical spiritual knowledge which was once an integral part of Christianity and was known and practiced by the apostle Paul. For these fathers, it was far more convenient and gratifying for their egos to assert that spiritual grace could only be attained through them as Christ's representatives on Earth. To control the masses, the political organization of the church declared that salvation was attained only through the church rituals and through the priesthood. Salvation through a personal mystical experience with Christ apart from the organized church was cast away. In a move that is very likely to have met with the disapproval of Christ himself, the worldly political aspirations of a few priests won out over the spiritual enlightenment of the many.<br><br>And as it is with any religion or movement, the successors of its founder decided which things to keep and which to throw out. The organized Church discarded the spiritual knowledge of Christian Gnosticism as being too dangerous and kept the concept of blind acceptance of church doctrine.<br><br>Ultimately, the organized Church declared Christian Gnosticism a heresy and began killing those who adhered to its doctrines. Thus the powerful Roman Church began its crusade of eliminating all rivals to its authority. Christian Gnosticism was obliterated and relatively little historical and theological information was left to fully understand early Christian history. This all changed in 1945 with the discovery of the Gnostic Christian scriptures discovered in Egypt. Then in 1947, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls of early Jewish Gnostic writings occurred. Today, with many Christians wondering if the <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/research32.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Coming of Christ</span></a> is soon to happen, it may not be a coincidence that these secret writings have come to surface after two thousand years of being hidden. Finally, after two thousands years, the secret is finally out again.</span></p>

              <p>Alright then. I'm not knowledgeable about theological issues, but I'll give it a go since no one else is keen.</p>
              <p>1. All Christians should be aware, but not many actually are, that the biblical description of the resurrection differs quite significantly between the various gospels. How many people went (one Mary, two Marys w/o Joanna), whether there were angels at the tomb (none, one or two?), when the stone was rolled away -- there were differences for each of these in the different gospels. I've seen efforts to explain away these differences, but these strike me as tenuous. If the gospels are inconsistent and/or omit key details of such an important event, what else can we trust of their account?</p>
              <p>http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/charts/resurrection_accounts.htm</p>
              <p>2. As far as I can gather, the majority of New Testament scholars agree that the gospel of Mark originally ends at 16:8. "Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid." (NIV). In other words, the original ending of Mark had very little about Jesus rising from the dead. The subsequent versus 9-16 were found only in later manuscripts, and had stylistic differences from the rest of the gospel. Some scholars therefore believe that this longer ending of Mark was forged, while even the NIV includes a disclaimer:</p>
              <p>[The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses 9–20.]</p>
              <p>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A9-20&amp;version=NIV</p>
              <p>3. In a debate between prominent Christian apologist William Lane Craig and well-known biblical scholar Bart Ehrman on this very issue, Ehrman made the very compelling point that a miracle is by definition the rarest of events. Therefore, a reasonable person would accept explanation by miracle only as the last resort, in the absence of all other possible explanations. So as unlikely as a tomb theft could be, it would still be more likely than the fact that Jesus rose from the dead. For example, if Ong Teng Cheong's body goes missing, would you automatically accept that he had gone to heaven, body and soul?</p>
              <p>Now, Craig is a formidable opponent, and he wins more than his fair share of debates with atheists, but I thought he was out of his depth, and simply outclassed in his exchange with Ehrman. You can watch the full debate, broken up into 12 parts, here:</p>
              <p><cite>www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjOSNj97_gk</cite></p>
              <p>Again, I'm no expert on theological issues, and I've found it hard to find objective information about the bible. In many cases, it simply comes down to "he said, she said", which makes debate difficult for non-specialists. The above three points seem to me some of the more digestible and objective challenges.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Brief comments:</p>
              <p>1. A difference does not constitute a contradiction. Only when one can show that the differences amounted to a contradition (eg. one Gospel said there was ONLY one woman, but another said there were three). If it is mentioned that "an angel spoke" it does not mean that there was only one angel. There could be two or more, but one of them spoke. Again, one must allow for harmonisation and reconciliations to be done between differing accounts. If they can be shown to be complementary without contradiction, then the objection vanishes. The Christian apologist only needs to show that there is no logical contradiction in the accounts.</p>
              <p>2. Granted that there is controversy about the ending verses of Mark. The Bible translators do not hide this issue, it's a chunk marked out or mentioned in the footnotes. Let's for the sake of argument take that chunk out. What then? Does it mean Mark is contradicting the rest of the Gospels? No record of resurrection in Mark means it never happened? That would be an argument from silence, and arguments from silence are notoriously weak. No essential doctrine of the Christian faith is affected or negated by the ending verses of Mark.</p>
              <p>3. Indeed a miracle is a rare event and is by definition an unlikely event, which is why it is called a miracle! And no Christian is saying that resurrections or miracles are a daily or common experience! But that's just the nature of miracles, they are events that defy natural/regular/expected explanation. Yes, we should not be quick to shout "God did it!" at first instance. It's good to exercise healthy skepticism. Remember even the apostles did not believe the women who first reported it. The early Christians were not dumb, they also knew that dead people stay dead if they are truly dead. There must be good reasons for declaring that Jesus rose from the dead. And so far none of the reasons for the empty tomb, other than resurrection happening, have withstood scrutiny. Was Craig outclassed by Ehrman? I don't think so. But we can set this aside for now. Gary Herbamas and Mike Licona has written much on the historical evidence for the resurrection. You may wish to check them out.</p>
              <p>4. I don't know why you say you cannot find objective information in the Bible. The Bible is mostly narrative history. And many have taken upon themselves the task of setting forth a chronological account of how things have happened. When a few witnesses are reporting on an event it is only expected that there is general agreement on the main things and differences in details. Critics will shout "kelong" if all 4 Gospels are identical, and what's the point of having 4 identical Gospels anyway? And if the Bible was really man-made, wouldn't you think that all these problems would have already been ironed out after 2000 years? Why make things difficult for people to believe you if you wanna con them, ya?</p>
              <p>On hindsight, it seems that my comments were anything but brief! LOL!</p>

              <p>1. Yours is the standard defense of saying that the different gospels focused on different events. It's possible by some stretch of the imagination, but it's certainly not the most likely explanation. If I'm writing a gospel of such import, would I neglect to mention that there was an earthquake just as an angel rolled away the stone? Would I neglect to mention that an angel (an angel!), let alone two angels, spoke to the witnesses? It's far easier to accept the inconsistencies of the account, than to devise some contrived reconciliation.</p>
              <p>2. By admitting that the longer ending of Mark was not by the original author (in essence, a later forgery), we already concede that even the canonical bible is a very human document. This, along with the first point, points out the difficulties in using the bible as the literal truth.</p>
              <p>3. You haven't explained why a resurrection is more likely than a tomb theft. The scenario painted by Ehrman was that Jesus' body was stolen, and that the thieves were stopped and killed by guards who didn't know that the identity of the body. Both Jesus and the thieves were then dumped into a mass grave, never to be found again. As unlikely as this scenario is, he points out, this is still more likely than a resurrection. Or maybe, as the conspiracy theorists will have it, Jesus survived, was rescued and escaped to India. Again, highly unlikely, but still more likely than a resurrection.</p>
              <p>4. To be sure, I was talking about objective information <strong>about</strong> the bible, and not necessarily objective information <strong>in</strong> the bible (although the latter is just as suspect). When it comes to biblical analysis, the apologists are so strident that it is impossible to find a balanced view. Ehrman, by his record, should arguably be balanced, considering his former evangelical background, his brilliant academics at Princeton, and his tutelage under and regard for Bruce Metzger. But for a layperson, it is impossible to ascertain the quality of his scholarship given the ceaseless attacks on him by Christian scholars.</p>

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Nah, the article is clearly slanted to give some measure of credibility to the gnostics (not agnostics which refers to something entirely different). From: <a href="http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/whats-gnosticism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">www.catholic.com/quickquestions/whats-gnosticism</span></span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>"Gnosticism, which gets its name from the Greek word <em>gnosis </em>("knowledge"), was similar in some ways to the modern New Age movement. Like New Agers, gnostics used Christian terminology and symbols, but placed them in an alien religious context that gutted the essential teachings of Christ. It's unclear when gnosticism began. Many Church Fathers thought gnosticism was founded by Simon Magus, the Samaritan sorcerer who converted to Christianity (Acts 8:9-24). Some contemporary scholars think gnosticism started a few centuries before Christianity and then invaded it from the outside through the conversion to Christianity of Jewish and Gentile gnostics. Other scholars believe gnosticism started as a Christian heresy. </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>It seems clear, though, that the apostles themselves had to contend with a form of gnosticism (Col 2:8, 18; 1 Jn 4:1-3; Rv 2:6, 15). Paul said, "Avoid profane babbling and the absurdities of so-called knowledge [<em>gnosis</em>]. By professing it some people have deviated from the faith" (1 Tm 6:20-21)."</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Heresies in the early church were a dime a dozen, and gnosticism was no different from the others in wanting to 'take over' the church by spouting their own ideas and doctrines that were contrary to the teachings of Jesus and his apostles. </span></p>

              <p>1. If you are the author of a history book, it is entirely your prerogative what you choose to report and include in it. And if you knew 3 other authors are also writing on the same series of events, perhaps you may not mention this thing or that thing because you think the other guy has also wrote it. In any case, omission of certain details is not tantamount to denial. So I think the objection of "if so important then why never record it" is weak. Come to think about it, all four Gospels record the crucifixion of Jesus yet there are even people who deny that there is even such a person as Jesus Christ! You see, it is not whether you record this or not, but whether what you recorded was true. One can always think of things that should be in a report and hype it out and say it is important. But that's what you think. You are not him. And he is not obligated to share your views of what's important or not. A historian has to be selective in what he chooses. You can complain about why this not there or not, but such complaints are not an argument against the truth of what's being reported. When it comes to the issue of truth there is no place for sloppy thinking that says "oh it is easier to just say it is wrong than to take the trouble to harmonise differing accounts".</p>
              <p>2.  You are sweating things concerning the ending of Mark, and blowing things out of proportion. The earliest manuscripts may not have that ending, but then there are other extant manuscripts which have. We do not have the autogrpahs but we have an embarassment of riches when it comes to extant manuscripts. Bible scholars and textual critics are simply being honest in handling the thousands of manuscripts by stating their views concerning the ending verses. Again if we wanted to silence Bible critics like you someone could have simply declared what should be the case and made sure it does not become fodder for you to gripe about. But are you forgeting the majority of the text where there is no controversy? Yes, the Bible is a human document. No Christian denies that. But it is not JUST a human document. It also claims to have divine inspiration. And no one less than Jesus Christ said that this is the Word of God.</p>
              <p>3. Perhaps you are unaware that the stolen body theory is already right there in the Gospel accounts? The soldiers has been bought over to give this story, that the disciples stole the body. It's not as if this stolen body theory is some new idea! That Ehrman would similarly buy (how nice also to make money by writing books attacking the Christian faith ya?) this idea IMO shows how sloppy his thinking is. He engages in speculation, admits his view is ad hoc and unlikely, and declare it is better than a resurrection anyway. This reeks of anti-supernatural bias more than anything. He doesn't let the text speaks for himself, but approaches the text by already deciding that miracles are impossible and so only naturalistic explanations can be allowed, even if it is ludicrous and admittedly unlikely!</p>
              <p>4. It is an ASSUMPTION that just because you are a former evangelical that therefore you make a better testimony or that you should be preferred over an evangelical. That is simply an appeal to authority along the lines of "hey I was once like you, so what I say is better than what you say and you should take my word for it". I think this is fallacious thinking at work. You made mention of Ehrman's tutelage under Metzger. I am well aware of that. But even those wuxia stories can tell you that many times the disciple deviate from the right path and went rogue. Did Metzger agree with Bart? Mind you, there have been books written to refute Bart and he has had debates with Daniel Wallace of NET Bible. You should take a look at them. You call these ceaseless attacks on Bart, as if it is poor old Bart being ganged upon. Yet why shouldn't anyone respond to his works that ceaselessly attack the integrity of Scriptures and which has led many to doubt their faith? Bart rode on the good name of his mentor to write books and profit from attacking the faith. Why do you then frown on Bible scholars who are no less qualified and credentialed than Bart to take him on in the public square?</p>

                  away through various theories. But the historical evidence just
                  can't be discounted.</p>
              <p>A student at the University of Uruguay said to me.
                  "Professor McDowell, why can't you refute Christianity?"</p>
              <p>"For a very simple reason," I answered. "I am not able
                  to explain away an event in history--the resurrection of Jesus
                  Christ."</p>
              <p>How can we explain the empty tomb? Can it possibly be
                  accounted for by any natural cause?</p>
              <p><strong><br> A QUESTION OF HISTORY</strong> <br> After more than 700 hours of studying this subject, I have come to
                  the conclusion that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is either one
                  of the most wicked, vicious, heartless hoaxes ever foisted on the
                  minds of human beings--or it is the most remarkable fact of
                  history.</p>
              <p>Here are some of the facts relevant to the
                  resurrection: Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish prophet who claimed to be
                  the Christ prophesied in the Jewish Scriptures, was arrested, was
                  judged a political criminal, and was crucified. Three days after
                  His death and burial, some women who went to His tomb found the
                  body gone. In subsequent weeks, His disciples claimed that God had
                  raised Him from the dead and that He appeared to them various times
                  before ascending into heaven.</p>
              <p>From that foundation, Christianity spread throughout
                  the Roman Empire and has continued to exert great influence down
                  through the centuries.</p>
              <p><strong><br> LIVING WITNESSES</strong> <br> The New Testament accounts of the resurrection were being
                  circulated within the lifetimes of men and women alive at the time
                  of the resurrection. Those people could certainly have confirmed or
                  denied the accuracy of such accounts.</p>
              <p>The writers of the four Gospels either had themselves
                  been witnesses or else were relating the accounts of eyewitnesses
                  of the actual events. In advocating their case for the gospel, a
                  word that means "good news," the apostles appealed (even when
                  confronting their most severe opponents) to common knowledge
                  concerning the facts of the resurrection.</p>
              <p>F. F. Bruce, Rylands professor of biblical criticism
                  and exegesis at the University of Manchester, says concerning the
                  value of the New Testament records as primary sources: "Had there
                  been any tendency to depart from the facts in any material respect,
                  the possible presence of hostile witnesses in the audience would
                  have served as a further corrective."</p>
              <p><strong><br> IS THE NEW TESTAMENT RELIABLE?</strong> <br> Because the New Testament provides the primary historical source
                  for information on the resurrection, many critics during the 19th
                  century attacked the reliability of these biblical documents.</p>
              <p>By the end of the 1 9th century, however,
                  archaeological discoveries had confirmed the accuracy of the New
                  Testament manuscripts. Discoveries of early papyri bridged the gap
                  between the time of Christ and existing manuscripts from a later
                  date.</p>
              <p>Those findings increased scholarly confidence in the
                  reliability of the Bible. William F. Albright, who in his day was
                  the world's foremost biblical archaeologist, said: "We can already
                  say emphatically that there is no longer any solid basis for dating
                  any book of the New Testament after about A.D. 80, two full
                  generations before the date between 130 and 150 given by the more
                  radical New Testament critics of today."</p>
              <p>Coinciding with the papyri discoveries, an abundance of
                  other manuscripts came to light (over 24,000 copies of early New
                  Testament manuscripts are known to be in existence today). The
                  historian Luke wrote of "authentic evidence" concerning the
                  resurrection. Sir William Ramsay, who spent 15 years attempting to
                  undermine Luke credentials as a historian, and to refute the
                  reliability of the New Testament, finally concluded: "Luke is a
                  historian of the first rank . . . This author should be placed
                  along with the very greatest of historians. "</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><br> BACKGROUND</strong> <br> The New Testament witnesses were fully aware of the background
                  against which the resurrection took place. The body of Jesus, in
                  accordance with Jewish burial custom, was wrapped in a linen cloth.
                  About 100 pounds of aromatic spices, mixed together to form a gummy
                  substance, were applied to the wrappings of cloth about the body.
                  After the body was placed in a solid rock tomb, an extremely large
                  stone was rolled against the entrance of the tomb. Large stones
                  weighing approximately two tons were normally rolled (by means of
                  levers) against a tomb entrance.</p>
              <p>A Roman guard of strictly disciplined fighting men was
                  stationed to guard the tomb. This guard affixed on the tomb the
                  Roman seal, which was meant to "prevent any attempt at vandalizing
                  the sepulcher. Anyone trying to move the stone from the tomb's
                  entrance would have broken the seal and thus incurred the wrath of
                  Roman law.</p>
              <p>But three days later the tomb was empty. The followers
                  of Jesus said He had risen from the dead. They reported that He
                  appeared to them during a period of 40 days, showing Himself to
                  them by many "infallible proofs." Paul the apostle recounted that
                  Jesus appeared to more than 500 of His followers at one time, the
                  majority of whom were still alive and who could confirm what Paul
                  wrote. So many security precautions were taken with the trial,
                  crucifixion, burial, entombment, sealing, and guarding of Christ's
                  tomb that it becomes very difficult for critics to defend their
                  position that Christ did not rise from the dead. Consider these
                  facts:</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 2em">
              <p><strong>FACT #1: BROKEN ROMAN SEAL</strong> <br> As we have said, the first obvious fact was the breaking of the
                  seal that stood for the power and authority of the Roman Empire.
                  The consequences of breaking the seal were extremely severe. The
                  FBI and CIA of the Roman Empire were called into action to find the
                  man or men who were responsible. If they were apprehended, it meant
                  automatic execution by crucifixion upside down. People feared the
                  breaking of the seal. Jesus' disciples displayed signs of cowardice
                  when they hid themselves. Peter, one of these disciples, went out
                  and denied Christ three times.</p>
              <p><strong>FACT #2: EMPTY TOMB</strong> <br> As we have already discussed, another obvious fact after the
                  resurrection was the empty tomb. The disciples of Christ did not go
                  off to Athens or Rome to preach that Christ was raised from the
                  dead. Rather, they went right back to the city of Jerusalem, where,
                  if what they were teaching was false, the falsity would be evident.
                  The empty tomb was "too notorious to be denied." Paul Althaus
                  states that the resurrection "could have not been maintained in
                  Jerusalem for a single day, for a single hour, if the emptiness of
                  the tomb had not been established as a fact for all concerned."</p>
              <p>Both Jewish and Roman sources and traditions admit an empty
                  tomb. Those resources range from Josephus to a compilation of
                  fifth-century Jewish writings called the "Toledoth Jeshu." Dr. Paul
                  Maier calls this "positive evidence from a hostile source, which is
                  the strongest kind of historical evidence. In essence, this means
                  that if a source admits a fact decidedly not in its favor, then
                  that fact is genuine."</p>
              <p>Gamaliel, who was a member of the Jewish high court, the
                  Sanhedrin, put forth the suggestion that the rise of the Christian
                  movement was God's doing; he could not have done that if the tomb
                  were still occupied, or if the Sanhedrin knew the whereabouts of
                  Christ's body.</p>
              <p>Paul Maier observes that " . . . if all the evidence is weighed
                  carefully and fairly, it is indeed justifiable, according to the
                  canons of historical research, to conclude that the sepulcher of
                  Joseph of Arimathea, in which Jesus was buried, was actually empty
                  on the morning of the first Easter. And no shred of evidence has
                  yet been discovered in literary sources, epigraphy, or archaeology
                  that would disprove this statement."</p>
              <p><strong><br> FACT #3: LARGE STONE MOVED</strong> <br> On that Sunday morning the first thing that impressed the people
                  who approached the tomb was the unusual position of the one and a
                  half to two ton stone that had been lodged in front of the doorway.
                  All the Gospel writers mention it.</p>
              <p>Those who observed the stone after the resurrection describe its
                  position as having been rolled up a slope away not just from the
                  entrance of the tomb, but from the entire massive sepulcher. It was
                  in such a position that it looked as if it had been picked up and
                  carried away. Now, I ask you, if the disciples had wanted to come
                  in, tiptoe around the sleeping guards, and then roll the stone over
                  and steal Jesus' body, how could they have done that without the
                  guards' awareness?</p>
              <p><strong><br> FACT #4: ROMAN GUARD GOES AWOL</strong> <br> The Roman guards fled. They left their place of responsibility. How
                  can their attrition he explained, when Roman military discipline
                  was so exceptional? Justin, in Digest #49, mentions all the
                  offenses that required the death penalty. The fear of their
                  superiors' wrath and the possibility of death meant that they paid
                  close attention to the minutest details of their jobs. One way a
                  guard was put to death was by being stripped of his clothes and
                  then burned alive in a fire started with his garments. If it was
                  not apparent which soldier had failed in his duty, then lots were
                  drawn to see which one would be punished with death for the guard
                  unit's failure. Certainly the entire unit would not have fallen
                  asleep with that kind of threat over their heads. Dr. George
                  Currie, a student of Roman military discipline, wrote that fear of
                  punishment "produced flawless attention to duty, especially in the
                  night watches."</p>
              <p><strong><br> FACT #5: GRAVECLOTHES TELL A TALE</strong> <br> In a literal sense, against all statements to the contrary, the
                  tomb was not totally empty--because of an amazing phenomenon. John,
                  a disciple of Jesus, looked over to the place where the body of
                  Jesus had lain, and there were the grave clothes, in the form of
                  the body, slightly caved in and empty--like the empty chrysalis of
                  a caterpillar's cocoon. That's enough to make a believer out of
                  anybody. John never did get over it. The first thing that stuck in
                  the minds of the disciples was not the empty tomb, but rather the
                  empty grave clothes--undisturbed in form and position.</p>
              <p><strong><br> FACT #6: JESUS' APPEARANCES CONFIRMED</strong> <br> Christ appeared alive on several occasions after the cataclysmic
                  events of that first Easter . When studying an event in history, it
                  is important to know whether enough people who were participants or
                  eyewitnesses to the event were alive when the facts about the event
                  were published. To know this is obviously helpful in ascertaining
                  the accuracy of the published report. If the number of eyewitnesses
                  is substantial, the event can he regarded as fairly well
                  established. For instance, if we all witness a murder, and a later
                  police report turns out to he a fabrication of lies, we as
                  eyewitnesses can refute it.</p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><br> OVER 500 WITNESSES</strong> <br> Several very important factors arc often overlooked when
                  considering Christ's post-resurrection appearances to individuals.
                  The first is the large number of witnesses of Christ after that
                  resurrection morning. One of the earliest records of Christ's
                  appearing after the resurrection is by Paul. The apostle appealed
                  to his audience's knowledge of the fact that Christ had been seen
                  by more than 500 people at one time. Paul reminded them that the
                  majority of those people were still alive and could be questioned.
                  Dr. Edwin M. Yamauchi, associate professor of history at Miami
                  University in Oxford, Ohio, emphasizes: "What gives a special
                  authority to the list (of witnesses) as historical evidence is the
                  reference to most of the five hundred brethren being still alive.
                  St. Paul says in effect, 'If you do not believe me, you can ask
                  them.' Such a statement in an admittedly genuine letter written
                  within thirty years of the event is almost as strong evidence as
                  one could hope to get for something that happened nearly two
                  thousand years ago." Let's take the more than 500 witnesses who saw
                  Jesus alive after His death and burial, and place them in a
                  courtroom. Do you realize that if each of those 500 people were to
                  testify for only six minutes, including cross-examination, you
                  would have an amazing 50 hours of firsthand testimony? Add to this
                  the testimony of many other eyewitnesses and you would well have
                  the largest and most lopsided trial in history.</p>
              <p><strong><br> HOSTILE WITNESSES</strong> <br> Another factor crucial to interpreting Christ's appearances is that
                  He also appeared to those who were hostile or unconvinced.</p>
              <p>Over and over again, I have read or heard people
                  comment that Jesus was seen alive after His death and burial only
                  by His friends and followers. Using that argument, they attempt to
                  water down the overwhelming impact of the multiple eyewitness
                  accounts. But that line of reasoning is so pathetic it hardly
                  deserves comment. No author or informed individual would regard
                  Saul of Tarsus as being a follower of Christ. The facts show the
                  exact opposite. Saul despised Christ and persecuted Christ's
                  followers. It was a life-shattering experience when Christ appeared
                  to him. Although he was at the time not a disciple, he later became
                  the apostle Paul, one of the greatest witnesses for the truth of
                  the resurrection.</p>
              <p>The argument that Christ's appearances were only to
                  followers is an argument for the most part from silence, and
                  arguments from silence can be dangerous. It is equally possible
                  that all to whom Jesus appeared became followers. No one acquainted
                  with the facts can accurately say that Jesus appeared to just "an
                  insignificant few."</p>
              <p>Christians believe that Jesus was bodily resurrected in
                  time and space by the supernatural power of God. The difficulties
                  of belief may be great, but the problems inherent in unbelief
                  present even greater difficulties.</p>
              <p>The theories advanced to explain the resurrection by
                  "natural causes" are weak; they actually help to build confidence
                  in the truth of the resurrection.</p>
              <p><strong><br> THE WRONG TOMB?</strong> <br> A theory propounded by Kirsopp Lake assumes that the women who
                  reported that the body was missing had mistakenly gone to the wrong
                  tomb. If so, then the disciples who went to check up on the women's
                  statement must have also gone to the wrong tomb. We may be certain,
                  however, that Jewish authorities, who asked for a Roman guard to be
                  stationed at the tomb to prevent Jesus' body from being stolen,
                  would not have been mistaken about the location. Nor would the
                  Roman guards, for they were there!</p>
              <p>If the resurrection-claim was merely because of a
                  geographical mistake, the Jewish authorities would have lost no
                  time in producing the body from the proper tomb, thus effectively
                  quenching for all time any rumor resurrection.</p>
              <p><strong><br> HALLUCINATIONS?</strong> <br> Another attempted explanation claims that the appearances of Jesus
                  after the resurrection were either illusions or hallucinations.
                  Unsupported by the psychological principles governing the
                  appearances of hallucinations, this theory also does not coincide
                  with the historical situation. Again, where was the actual body,
                  and why wasn't it produced?</p>
              <p><strong><br> DID JESUS SWOON?</strong> <br> Another theory, popularized by Venturini several centuries ago, is
                  often quoted today. This is the swoon theory, which says that Jesus
                  didn't die; he merely fainted from exhaustion and loss of blood.
                  Everyone thought Him dead, but later He resuscitated and the
                  disciples thought it to be a resurrection. Skeptic David Friedrich
                  Strauss--certainly no believer in the resurrection--gave the
                  deathblow to any thought that Jesus revived from a swoon: "It is
                  impossible that a being who had stolen half-dead out of the
                  sepulchre, who crept about weak and ill, wanting medical treatment,
                  who required bandaging, strengthening and indulgence, and who still
                  at last yielded to His sufferings, could have given to the
                  disciples the impression that He was a Conqueror over death and the
                  grave, the Prince of Life,</p>
              <p>an impression which lay at the bottom of their future
                  ministry. Such a resuscitation could only have weakened the
                  impression which He had made upon them in life and in death, at the
                  most could only have given it an elegiac voice, but could by no
                  possibility have changed their sorrow into enthusiasm, have
                  elevated their reverence into worship."</p>
              <p><strong><br> THE BODY STOLEN?</strong> <br> Then consider the theory that the body was stolen by the disciples
                  while the guards slept. The depression and cowardice of the
                  disciples provide a hard-hitting argument against their suddenly
                  becoming so brave and daring as to face a detachment of soldiers at
                  the tomb and steal the body. They were in no mood to attempt
                  anything like that.</p>
              <p>The theory that the Jewish or Roman authorities moved
                  Christ's body is no more reasonable an explanation for the empty
                  tomb than theft by the disciples. If the authorities had the body
                  in their possession or knew where it was, why, when the disciples
                  were preaching the resurrection in Jerusalem, didn't they explain:
                  "Wait! We moved the body, see, He didn't rise from the grave"?</p>
              <p>And if such a rebuttal failed, why didn't they explain
                  exactly where Jesus' body lay? If this failed, why didn't they
                  recover the corpse, put it on a cart, and wheel it through the
                  center of Jerusalem? Such an action would have destroyed
                  Christianity--not in the cradle, but in the womb!</p>
              <p><strong><br> THE RESURRECTION IS A FACT</strong> <br> Professor Thomas Arnold, for 14 years a headmaster of Rugby, author
                  of the famous, <em>History of Rome,</em> and appointed to
                  the chair of modern history at Oxford, was well acquainted with the
                  value of evidence in determining historical facts. This great
                  scholar said: "I have been used for many years to study the
                  histories of other times, and to examine and weigh the evidence of
                  those who have written about them, and I know of no one fact in the
                  history of mankind which is proved by better and fuller evidence of
                  every sort, to the understanding of a fair inquirer, than the great
                  sign which God hath given us that Christ died and rose again from
                  the dead." Brooke Foss Westcott, an English scholar, said: "raking
                  all the evidence together, it is not too much to say that there is
                  no historic incident better or more variously supported than the
                  resurrection of Christ. Nothing but the antecedent assumption that
                  it must be false could have suggested the idea of deficiency in the
                  proof of it."</p>
              <p><strong><br> REAL PROOF: THE DISCIPLES' LIVES</strong> <br> But the most telling testimony of all must be the lives of those
                  early Christians. We must ask ourselves: What caused them to go
                  everywhere telling the message of the risen Christ?</p>
              <p>Had there been any visible benefits accrued to them
                  from their efforts--prestige, wealth, increased social status or
                  material benefits--we might logically attempt to account for their
                  actions, for their whole-hearted and total allegiance to this
                  "risen Christ ."</p>
              <p>As a reward for their efforts, however, those early
                  Christians were beaten, stoned to death, thrown to the lions,
                  tortured and crucified. Every conceivable method was used to stop
                  them from talking.</p>
              <p>Yet, they laid down their lives as the ultimate proof
                  of their complete confidence in the truth of their message.</p>
              <p><strong><br> WHERE DO YOU STAND?</strong> <br> How do you evaluate this overwhelming historical evidence? What is
                  your decision about the fact of Christ's empty tomb? What do you
                  think of Christ?</p>
              <p>When I was confronted with the overwhelming evidence
                  for Christ's resurrection, I had to ask the logical question: "What
                  difference does all this evidence make to me? What difference does
                  it make whether or not I believe Christ rose again and died on the
                  cross for my sins!' The answer is put best by something Jesus said
                  to a man who doubted--Thomas. Jesus told him: "I am the way, and
                  the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me"
                  (John 14:6).</p>
              <p>On the basis of all the evidence for Christ's
                  resurrection, and considering the fact that Jesus offers
                  forgiveness of sin and an eternal relationship with God, who would
                  be so foolhardy as to reject Him? Christ is alive! He is living
                  today.</p>
              <p>You can trust God right now by faith through prayer.
                  Prayer is talking with God. God knows your heart and is not so
                  concerned with your words as He is with the attitude of your heart.
                  If you have never trusted Christ, you can do so right now.</p>
              <p>The prayer I prayed is: "Lord Jesus, I need You. Thank
                  You for dying on the cross for my sins. I open the door of my life
                  and trust You as my Savior. Thank You for forgiving my sins and
                  giving me eternal life. Make me the kind of person You want me to
                  be. Thank You that I can trust You."</p>

              <p>1. Well, it is your prerogative to decide whether the omission of such key events as two talking angels and an earthquake is acceptable. Your argument about having three other gospels on backup is also suspect, unless you are telling me that the authors knew which other gospels would be canonized a couple of hundred years later. If I were narrating such a vital piece of history, I might conceivably leave out what the tomb visitors were carrying. I might even conveniently leave out who the full group of visitors were. Maybe if earthquakes were common in the area, I might even leave out the mention of a "great" earthquake. <strong>But I would never, ever leave out the fact that there were two angels, not only rolling away the tombstone, but also having a chat with the visitors.</strong></p>
              <p>2. The longer ending of Mark as a fabricated addition is only the tip of the iceberg. What about the <strong>Pericope Adulterae</strong>, another important story now widely believed to be an addition by an overzealous copyist? What about First and Second Thessalonians, which some believe to be forgeries by an author claiming to be Paul? What about the letters by Peter, who was likely to have been illiterate in Aramaic, let alone Greek? The reality is that once you accept that the longer ending of Mark was a later addition by some unknown author, then you have to concede that the bible is flawed. <strong>And once you concede that the bible has issues, you have to ask yourself: What other pieces of the bible have problems?</strong></p>
              <p>3. Your point about the soldiers being bought over to say that the disciples stole the body (Matthew 28:12?) says nothing about Ehrman's scenario. It could be that a sympathetic member of the guards stole the body, and they were happy to take the money to accuse someone else. It could be that the disciples did steal the body, but the guards had no evidence and therefore had to be bribed to say so. Your objection doesn't hold against Ehrman's scenario.</p>
              <p>4. As I said, it is impossible for a layperson to determine the quality of Ehrman's scholarship, precisely due to attacks like yours. Which is why I've evaluated his arguments critically and tried to verify some of his comments with alternative sources.</p>

              <p>1. You seem to be on a monologue. You did not answer my question. if you can use the bible to prove itself, then can a muslim or sikh also show their scriptures are unchanged and go on to quote muslim/sikh theologians who use the quran/sikh book to prove the quran/sikh book?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. No surprise that all the "historians" and "professors" quoted in this mcdowell study are all christians or christian theologians. From EM Blaik to <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px;">Kirsopp Lake, all are christians. </span>When most of these quoted professors are christian, then there is a certain bias and an inclination to commit confirmation bias. Most of the quoted professors are OUTSIDE of the bibleno doubt but they were not from jesus' time. Whatever they claim about jesus' miracles can only be as good as opinion and not facts.</p>

              <p>Also, Most of these christian historians do their research based on a huge assumption that jesus is god. It is flawed from the start. If one wants to do a serious research about the historicity of jesus, then one must view him as neutrally as possible and also consider all possibilities (e.g jesus did exist, jesus did not exist, jesus was not divine, jesus was divine etc) But christian historians start their research with their bias belief that jesus is divine.  These christian historians claim they are doing a research of the historicity of jesus but in fact they are just doing theology.Why dont i see these christian historians doing a deep and sound research from an "agnostic perspective" or from a "jesus was a human" perspective?</p>

Why do christian historians make a big jump from "unchanging scripture" to conclude that "jesus' miracles are real"? HOW do they do this big leap of conclusion?</p>

              <p>You said that Christians cannot use the Bible to prove the
              Bible. In effect you are charging Christians with circular
              reasoning. Before we go further please read and interact with the
              contents of a couple of articles here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://creation.com/not-circular-reasoning">http://creation.com/not-circular-reasoning</a> and

              <p>1. You seem to continually blatently commit the error of confirmation bias by quoting from websites that are deeply religious. I wonder why you are not heeding my advice. Maybe you dont care.</p>
              <p>2. The first website is riddled with questionable content...</p>
              <p>a) Self consistency - Yes bible is consistent in SOME areas but not all areas. Historians and scholars all agree on this. There are christian scholars who also admit that there are scribal errors and catholic church has also agreed that the bible is not 100% scientific (pls dont go into the "catholic are not christians" argument because it is very offending)</p>
              <p>b) Consistent with the real world - I dont see how the "miracles" of "walking on water", "living in a fish tummy", "bird-bat" and "coming back to life from death" are consistent with the real world. Yes they are miracles claimed by the bible, but definitely not consistent with the real natural world.</p>
              <p>Second website </p>
              <p>a) You cant see the circular reasoning because you are in it. Maybe I should show you what you are doing -</p>
              <p>Why is Sleeping Beauty a real and true account --&gt; Because in the book it says that Sleeping Beauty ate, slept and kissed a prince. ---&gt; Therefore the Sleeping Beauty story is a real and true account... and so on and so forth.</p>

              <p>1. You seem to be on a monologue. You did not answer my question. if you can use the bible to prove itself, then can a muslim or sikh also show their scriptures are unchanged and go on to quote muslim/sikh theologians who use the quran/sikh book to prove the quran/sikh book?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. No surprise that all the "historians" and "professors" quoted in this mcdowell study are all christians or christian theologians. From EM Blaik to <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Kirsopp Lake, all are christians. </span>When most of these quoted professors are christian, then there is a certain bias and an inclination to commit confirmation bias. Most of the quoted professors are OUTSIDE of the bibleno doubt but they were not from jesus' time. Whatever they claim about jesus' miracles can only be as good as opinion and not facts.</p>

              <p>I'm very curious. If more than a half a dozen accomplished
                  historians and scholars mentioned in this article admit to the
                  historical origins of the Bible and the real occurence of its
                  mentioned events, and they do this after many years of
                  in-depth research and access to historical data and artifacts
                  (which you clearly don't), why should anyone here take
                  your position over their's?   </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The difficulty with the bible is that aside from fundamentalist Christians, very few scholars regard the bible as completely accurate.To this day, there is still no corroborating evidence for key events like the "Slaughter of the Innnocents" and Exodus.</p>
              <p>One striking aspect of the Dennett/LaScola interviews with non-believing clergy was their accounts of seminary life. This is how the authors summarise the comments:</p>
              <p><em>In seminary they were introduced to many of the details that have been gleaned by centuries of painstaking research about how various ancient texts came to be written, copied, translated, and, after considerable jockeying and logrolling, <br>eventually assembled into the Bible we read today. <strong>It is hard if not impossible to square these new facts with the idea that the Bible is in all its particulars a true account of actual events, let alone the inerrant word of God. </strong> It is interesting that all our pastors report the same pattern of response among their fellow students: some were fascinated, but others angrily rejected what their professors tried to teach them. Whatever their initial response to these unsettling revelations, the cat was out of the bag and both liberals and literals discerned the need to conceal their knowledge about the history of Christianity from their congregations.</em></p>
              <p>[Edit: Emphasis mine]</p>
              <p>If you distrust the summary, some direct quotes from the clergy are also available here:<br>http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/Non-Believing-Clergy.pdf</p>
              <p>That said, as far as I can see, no serious scholar regards the bible as complete falsehood either. In other words, each incident has to be evaluated on its merits and evidence.This is where the difficulty lies, and where the debate needs to be.</p>
              <p>Still even if the majority of the biblical accounts are correct (and I don't know if it is), it ultimately has to be seen as a fallible book.</p>
