              <p>In essence you are correct and I do agree with you.</p>
              <p>We take christian sources only if they are sound, just like how I took christian sources about the age of the dead sea scrolls. But if a christian source says that the earth is 6000 years old because it uses another christian text (the bible) to prove its claims, then that source is committing a fallacy and I will not take it.</p>
              <p>So I do take religious sources into consideration, only if they are sound.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>It's the same with atheists. For atheists, faith in naturalism is more important than facts. Example? The fact that the universe has a beginning and begs for an ADEQUATE cause, a cause that must be able to account for the existence of the universe and its properties. So how do atheist account for it? They usually don't, simply because they tend to deflect attention away from the poverty of their own worldview by focusing on attacking the Christian worldview. But once in a while those who bother to read and find out can read about how atheists BELIEVE that the universe made itself (see <a href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2007/04/19/4350284-the-self-made-universe">http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2007/04/19/4350284-the-self-made-universe</a>) or else continue to believe in the debunked idea that the universe is eternal (see <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-stenger/did-the-universe-come-fro_b_739909.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-stenger/did-the-universe-come-fro_b_739909.html</a>).</p>
              <p>And atheists rant about Christians being irrational? It's a classic case of special pleading.</p>

              <p>Is it pride for atheists to say "No one knows about the origin of the universe. Atheists don't know what caused the universe. But atheists KNOW that it cannot be God"? How does the atheist know that? By what fact or reasoning does he conclude that it cannot be God? Answer, not be reasoning, but by holding on to BELIEF in naturalism as a faith worldview. Of course, it is the same pride that would lead the atheist to violently deny that he has any faith in anything.</p>

              <p>It's the same with atheists. For atheists, faith in naturalism is more important than facts. Example? The fact that the universe has a beginning and begs for an ADEQUATE cause, a cause that must be able to account for the existence of the universe and its properties. So how do atheist account for it? They usually don't, simply because they tend to deflect attention away from the poverty of their own worldview by focusing on attacking the Christian worldview. But once in a while those who bother to read and find out can read about how atheists BELIEVE that the universe made itself (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2007/04/19/4350284-the-self-made-universe">http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2007/04/19/4350284-the-self-made-universe</a>) or else continue to believe in the debunked idea that the universe is eternal (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-stenger/did-the-universe-come-fro_b_739909.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-stenger/did-the-universe-come-fro_b_739909.html</a>).</p>
              <p>And atheists rant about Christians being irrational? It's a classic case of special pleading.</p>

              <p>1. No. TO say that we do not know is more humble that claiming to know when you really dont. Your morals are really.....mixed up.</p>
              <p>2. I have mentioned to you before. Many atheists do not believe in the existence of the current Gods claimed by modern religions. But many of us do not rule out the possibility of a supreme being beyond the universe, IF evidence surfaces one day. This is not being prideful. This is being logical and at  the same time acknowledging that we might be wrong. Let me ask you. Do you have leave some space for yourself to wonder if you might be wrong about your beliefs?</p>
              <p>3. I mentioned in another thread that you should take 20 minutes to seriously read through naturalism and evolution before saying they are "faith subjects". Because apparently you seem to know very little about what evidence is.</p>

              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>It's always intriguing to entertain ideas that the church had some kind of secrets about Jesus that has been hidden from believers everywhere, or that the whole church is just being deluded for 2000 years whereas the real truth is to be found in some obscure places and believed by some obscure minority who has been censured or banned by the church. It makes for a fantastic cool story brother scenario, but that's just what it is, a CSB.</p>
              <p>The Bible is silent and did not document what happened between the age of 12-30, and it was pretty silent between the age of infancy and 12 too, but atheists don't make noise about where Jesus was during those years before He turned 12! But the careful reader of the Bible will know that there are some indicators. For example, in Matthew 15:53 we read, <em>"When Jesus had finished telling these stories and illustrations, he left that part of the country. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He returned to Nazareth, his hometown.</span></strong> When he taught there in the synagogue, everyone was amazed and said, “Where does he get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?” Then they scoffed, “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He’s just the carpenter’s son, and we know Mary, his mother, and his brothers—James, Joseph,<sup class="footnote"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[</span><a title="See footnote a" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/#fen-NLT-23570a"><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #651300;">a</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">]</span></sup> Simon, and Judas. All his sisters live right here among us.</span></strong> Where did he learn all these things?” And they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him."</em></p>
              <p>What can we gather from this brief passage? Jesus returned to his HOMETOWN, in short, we went home to Nazareth. Not His birth-town of Bethlehem, mind you, but His hometown. Note also the familiarity of the people to Jesus' family members. They KNEW who His family was and His background. Did anyone say, "Ai ya, He got all these ideas from India lah!"? No, they were questioning how come He could speak so authoritatively because they KNEW He had no special training or teaching from the rabbis of the day. You can of course choose to say that this does not prove that Jesus did not went to India. Well, I think that's not for me to prove, but for those who entertain this story to prove that, while allowing Christians to point out the flaws and problems with such an idea. <em> <br></em></p>

              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>It's always intriguing to entertain ideas that the church had
              some kind of secrets about Jesus that has been hidden from
              believers everywhere, or that the whole church is just being
              deluded for 2000 years whereas the real truth is to be found in
              some obscure places and believed by some obscure minority who has
              been censured or banned by the church. It makes for a fantastic
              cool story brother scenario, but that's just what it is, a CSB.</p>
              <p>The Bible is silent and did not document what happened between
              the age of 12-30, and it was pretty silent between the age of
              infancy and 12 too, but atheists don't make noise about where Jesus
              was during those years before He turned 12! But the careful reader
              of the Bible will know that there are some indicators. For example,
              in Matthew 15:53 we read, <em>"When Jesus had finished telling
              these stories and illustrations, he left that part of the
              country. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He
              returned to Nazareth, his hometown.</span></strong> When he taught
              there in the synagogue, everyone was amazed and said, “Where does
              he get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?” Then they
              scoffed, “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He’s
              just the carpenter’s son, and we know Mary, his mother, and his
              brothers—James, Joseph,<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">[</span><a title="See footnote a" rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/#fen-NLT-23570a"><span style="color: #651300; font-size: x-small;">a</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">]</span></sup> Simon, and Judas. All his
              sisters live right here among us.</span></strong> Where did he
              learn all these things?” And they were deeply offended and
              refused to believe in him."</em></p>
              <p>What can we gather from this brief passage? Jesus returned
              to his HOMETOWN, in short, we went home to Nazareth. Not His
              birth-town of Bethlehem, mind you, but His hometown. Note also
              the familiarity of the people to Jesus' family members. They
              KNEW who His family was and His background. Did anyone
              say, "Ai ya, He got all these ideas from India lah!"? No, they
              were questioning how come He could speak so authoritatively
              because they KNEW He had no special training or teaching
              from the rabbis of the day. You can of course choose
              to say that this does not prove that Jesus did not went
              to India. Well, I think that's not for me to prove, but for those
              who entertain this story to prove that, while allowing
              Christians to point out the flaws and problems with such an idea.
