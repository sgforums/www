            <div class='col-md body'>1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (NIV): "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters, nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor <strong>homosexual offenders </strong>nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."<br><br>Lev 18:22 (NIV): <strong>" 'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable. "</strong><br><br>Lev 20:13 (NIV):  <strong>'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."</strong><br><br>Rom 1:24-32 (NIV):<br>"Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the CreatorÂ—who is forever praised. Amen.<br><br>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. <strong>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. </strong><br><br>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <strong>Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them</strong>"<br><br></div>

Im surprise to see that u consider transgendered people gay because psychologically speaking, they are every bit the opposite sex of their physical genders. If you had a son who wanted to be a girl, but still liked girls, then I can tell you your son is lesbian! And then u can worry. If he wants to be a girl and likes guys, u can comfort yourself that at least he is a straight girl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>U mentioned earlier dat its not mentioned by Jesus in NT dat homosexuality is  a sin.<br><br>Then i ask u this.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that this being a Christian forum and that most Christians here would agree that God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit would consider that homosexuality is a sin, i think that we have quoted enough verses to support this stand.<br><br>In the eyes of the Lord, homosexuality is a sin. It may not be stated as clearly as the ten commandments, but it is stated by how God regards homosexuality, it is called unnatural, depraved, etc.<br><br>For one to say that the OT is not applicable, in my opinion is wrong, the OT gives us a very clear guide as to the very nature and character of God, this will never change, yes we have grace under the NT, but Jesus himself said, I come not to abolish the law but to fulfill it on our behalf. That we who once had no chance of gaining entry into heaven, may not have that chance by the acceptance of Jesus as our saviour.<br><br>My two cents...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">Frankly, that post from Heng is valid.<br><br>None could have answer that post till date.<br><br>None.<br></div></blockquote>Dear Heng &amp; MÂ©+square &amp; all the rest who are still on this forum,<br><br>I just got back from a 3-day health conference and learned some new insights into the root of diseases; whether it's physical, mental, emotional or spiritual.<br><br>Before I go into what I really want to say, I'd like to make this statement, which was what the conference speaker enlightened me with. <strong>Genesis 3:1</strong> - Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "<span style="color: blue;">DID GOD REALLY SAY</span>, "You must not eat from any tree in the garden?"<br><br>So yup, to shade343 and Heng, you both have the same statement which I won't say is from you but from the old, crafty serpent. You both have this in mind "So, <span style="color: blue;">did God really say that</span>..? <span style="color: blue;">Did Jesus really say that</span>..? No what.. Homosexual is not a sin because God never exactly say that... The OT is what it is...old and passed away... these Christians are just trying to interpret the bible to accuse the gay community... these Christians don't have the slightest idea how a gay truly feels.."<br><br>I think those who are gay or lesbians themselves will be the ones to justify that they are NOT sinning &amp; they are NOT abnormal.. and so they get very defensive with Christians who condemn them and start to bark back at us, "For goodness sake, stop calling homosexuality a sin. It is not. Jesus or God never said... You people are too judging.."<br><br>Let me share what I learn from the conference speaker: Sin is a spiritual parasite, an extremely intelligent &amp; invisible being who can speak lies to your mind (even if you're very young at age). The reason satan concoct lies that are in contrary to God's will is because he knows that <span style="color: red;">our bodies have a remarkable way of becoming what we believe about ourselves. After some time, the suggestions not only go into our mind, but into our very bloodstream and every part of our organs. So after awhile, we no longer believe it's anyone else's suggestion, we start to believe it's our very selves! The devil can create a belief or thought which we start to think is our very own.</span> A person will start to believe that indeed, he/she is homosexual and nothing in this world can change that fact.<br><br>That explains why people who have had an organ transplant from a deceased person could have emotions and memories belonging to the organ donor. Because every suggestions and beliefs we hold about ourselves will become one with our bodies, like it or not. It becomes inseparable and the vicious cycle begins : We believe a false statement to be the absolute truth, then our body will start to change into that very nature of our beliefs, and then all the more it begins to reinforce our belief.<br><br>E.g. if you accept a lie that says "C'mon, nobody in this world understand how you feel, you're just a woman trapped in a man's body, that's the way it is... people can never understand so they don't accept you, they don't love you.." then it's not surprising if one's body begin to produce hormones and emotions of an opposite gender and then the person will proclaim "See! I told you so. What I'm experiencing in my body is a proof that I was indeed supposed to be of another gender." As a result of this iniquity, it is not surprising then, that along the way down the generation, a child may be born with the same genetic defect.<br><br>According to the speaker, Satan is a damn good matchmaker. He usually pairs up 2 people who are carriers of some ancestral genetic disorder or 2 people carrying the curse of a spiritual disobedience to produce offspring who are also sick or abnormal in one way or another, to continue his contamination of the human race as act of retaliation towards God. You can't blame God for this because if you plant a banana tree, what you get are bananas, not lemons! We reap what we sow. But that doesn't mean that God cannot heal the person who were victims of their parents' or ancestral iniquity or REVERSE the genetic disorder. Nothing is impossible with God in Jesus Christ. The only thing that is stopping God from intervening is the people themselves. Most do not want to be set free.<br><br>Our soul is the bridge between the physical and spiritual realm. Another interesting thing is that the devil knows our bodies much more than the medical professionals or scientist. He knows which button to press to manipulate us and change the way our bodies is suppose to function, especially through theta brainwave activity, where our perception of reality can be engineered by him. That explains why some people can see into the spirit world or communicate with spirits. It's all satan's manouvering of the theta brainwave activity. It's like he's the one projecting whatever images he wants and we look at the screen thinking this is so real. So you can't help but believe his lies.<br><br>But it doesn't change the fact that a sin is a sin. Period. Call it what you like: psychological problem, negative emotions, denial, depression, bipolar, reincarnation or woman trapped in a man's body, etc. It is still not God's original intention for us. We took it in because we are simply ignorant about our own iniquity.<br><br>I read a true story once from a book called "Love Broke Through" about this Christian man whose father was a pastor but his dad was extremely male-chauvinist. His dad, though was very much present in his life, never once express his love for him, never cuddled him since he was a baby, never spent play time with him. His dad was just so "distant". Every time his dad is home from work, would just read the papers and will not interact with him. His dad thought that's the way a man of the house should be. Just be strict and don't show any emotional connection because it's a sign of weakness. So this guy's need for love and acceptance came mostly from his mum and because he was the only son surrounded by his sisters, he started to love playing "girlie" games and girlie stuff. He was introverted in school and never mix much with the boys. When he was in his puberty, a gay indecently touched and brushed/stroke him, causing him to feel aroused because he never felt what it was like to have another man this close to him. It felt good and he was hungry for love. But he married a woman hoping that these feelings would away and it didn't. He contrated AIDS in the end but alas, he found forgiveness, love and deliverance in Jesus Christ. His wife and children forgave him, love him despite who and what he has become and took care of him the remaining years of his life.<br><br>Another thing about Pastor Sy Rogers, he did mention last time that the reason he wanted so much to be a woman was because whether on screen (i.e. in most romantic movies) or real life, the woman seems to be the one getting all the attention and love from the guy. It's the guy who does all that chasing. Or the hero was the one always willing to profess his love for the gal or willing to do anything to win her. Ps. Sy Rogers said naturally, his great desire of being a woman was the result of his hunger for love and acceptance. He never felt loved, so he hated his own "maleness". He felt that as a man, he never experiences love the way he envision it to be. A woman gets more attention, especially if she's attractive or seductive. That's why he believed he was a woman trapped in man's body.<br><br>Think about it...</div>
