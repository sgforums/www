Why God didn't prevent all these mutations? Well, God gave human beings a free will. He didn't make robots.

He passed down the curse to mankind due to his disobedience to His Creator. Now we all have to suffer one way or another. Only in Jesus Christ can we find healing, restoration and hope, if not in the present age, then in the age to come. That's why Jesus have to pay the penalty for our sins by being whipped countless times and suffered a painful death on the cross.

Someone up in the family tree must have done something so detestable in God's sight to have passed down such abnormalities in his/her genes to the generations down the line. Maybe the ancestors practised incest, or had sex with an animal or practised high level of witchcraft.. or was a Satan-worshipper, or was a serial killer or anything that was simply too evil to even mention. But that doesn't mean that the child born with double gender is beyond hope. With God in Jesus Christ, all things are possible. God says in Jeremiah 32:27 "I am the LORD, the GOD of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?" (We're talking about the CREATOR who created mankind and all species of flora and fauna and who runs the universe). But the condition for healing, reversal and removal of the curse or genetic defect is that a confession of the sins of the forefathers, repentance and renounciation must be made in the name of Jesus Christ and the person must never turn back from God to follow his/her forefather's evil ways.<br><br>Anyway, in the first place, you wouldn't want to change your sex unless you hate being either a male or a female. Then again, that means something is wrong with you and you need counseling.</div>

Anything that we allow to dwell in our thoughts, emotion or in our very actions which is not of God can be disastrous to our body because our body (which means our every cell, genes and organs) DO actually manifest into what we believe or do. Sinful and hideous acts like incest, sex with animal, homosexuality, witchcraft, hatred and murder not only alters our mind and emotion but our physical bodies as well.<br><br>Simple equation: When we're angry, our hearts beat faster &amp; our adrenaline rise. What more if we commit sinful acts as result of our own self-hatred, hatred against God (our very Creator), bitterness &amp; rage againts others, lust, etc. etc. Wouldn't it be worse of what is going to happen to our body?</div>

Read God's reply at the end of the book.<br><br>2 and 3. The causes are numerous and depend on the underlying disease. Probably the most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia, due to an abnormality of the endocrine system. The baby is a girl with penis because of a hormonal defect. Doctors correct the hormonal defect and the child can be raised normally as a girl. Other rare, chromosomal abnormalities can cause ambiguous genitalia but doctors can and will decide on the sex assignment based on the case. Plastic surgery may be required but the parents will be told of the child's sex with no ambiguity at all.<br><br>There are two other 'intersexual' conditions but both cases DO NOT have ambiguous genitalia.<br><br>Turner syndrome (XO) is a condition in which the child has gonadal dysgenesis. She looks like a normal girl with normal female genitalia but she will be infertile.<br><br>Testicular feminisation syndrome is a condition where there is an abnormality of the male hormone receptor. The child looks like a normal girl and nobody suspects anything until she grows up (usually tall and often pretty) but does not have menses nor axillary or pubic hair. They have XY chromosome but are usually brought up as girls because nobody suspect the problem until puberty. The testes are small and not developed. Doctors often remove them to prevent the risk of cancer. They often marry and are well adjusted women but they will not have children.<br><br>Where did you hear about injecting the genitals with male and female hormones?

Especially since the religion is claimed as the oldest in the world and is supposed to have contained many wisdom from sages or gurus from ancient times. Its teaching is supposed to bring many blessings with it, shouldn't it?<br><br>Hey, I'm not saying that Christianity is the perfect religion. In fact, only Jesus Christ is perfect because He is God himself! Christianity as a religion is not. And not all Christians apply the laws and commands of the bible into their lives, so it's not surprising that some "so-called Christians" do fall into sin and are as corrupt as other non-Christians. That is because their hearts have grown cold or hardened and have slowly lost their knowledge of God and of His ways. For all who have put their faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, we all know where we're heading for even if the world has become a nut case and suffering abounds.<br><br>By the way, Jerusalem practices Judaism, it is not a Christian nation. Many Jews do not recognize or acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Messiah.<br><br>What you said in your last paragraph is indeed correct. You are so absolutely right! Indeed we reap what we sow. I think most religions teaches that. That's why don't blame God for children born with genetic defects like transexuals, Autism, Down's syndrome and many other diseases. Humans being have been so filled with sin from the beginning of time, that this is the result of the mess we've made. Blame it on Adam. He passed down the curse to mankind due to his disobedience to His Creator. Now we all have to suffer one way or another. Only in Jesus Christ can we find healing, restoration and hope, if not in the present age, then in the age to come. That's why Jesus have to pay the penalty for our sins by being whipped countless times and suffered a painful death on the cross. Through Jesus Christ, God was trying to tell us that He cared and He wants to reverse the curse.<br><br>The bible says "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive"<br></div></blockquote>COrrect. The oldest religion is filled with much wisdom and blessings. But what good is that if people choose not to follow it?<br><br>You are arrogant to think that there is only 1 God which you may find healing and hope. The other gods bestow that also. Thats the problem with christians. They are arrogant. They think theirs is the only one. I wonder what makes them think so? It is through Jesus christ that mankind has learned how to be good an do good.<br><br>That is the mission for most Gods who come down to this world and preach. They have always advocated doing good and being good.<br><br>Did jesus christ advocated going around telling people that christianity is the one and only religion and the one and only way to reach god??<br><br>And Jesus christ paid for our sins. Doest this shows the exisistence of karma? If he hadnt die for us, perhaps we would be suffering even more badly.</div>
