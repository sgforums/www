The child suffers from a disease. Since the Fall of Man disease has been with mankind. Are you surprised? Go and read tyhe book of Job. He asked why he had to suffer although he was righteous, something most cannot say of themselves. Read God's reply at the end of the book.<br><br>2 and 3. The causes are numerous and depend on the underlying disease. Probably the most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia, due to an abnormality of the endocrine system. The baby is a girl with penis because of a hormonal defect. Doctors correct the hormonal defect and the child can be raised normally as a girl. Other rare, chromosomal abnormalities can cause ambiguous genitalia but doctors can and will decide on the sex assignment based on the case. Plastic surgery may be required but the parents will be told of the child's sex with no ambiguity at all.<br><br>There are two other 'intersexual' conditions but both cases DO NOT have ambiguous genitalia.<br><br>Turner syndrome (XO) is a condition in which the child has gonadal dysgenesis. She looks like a normal girl with normal female genitalia but she will be infertile.<br><br>Testicular feminisation syndrome is a condition where there is an abnormality of the male hormone receptor. The child looks like a normal girl and nobody suspects anything until she grows up (usually tall and often pretty) but does not have menses nor axillary or pubic hair. They have XY chromosome but are usually brought up as girls because nobody suspect the problem until puberty. The testes are small and not developed. Doctors often remove them to prevent the risk of cancer. They often marry and are well adjusted women but they will not have children.<br><br>Where did you hear about injecting the genitals with male and female hormones? It's certainly not acceptable medical practice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> In any case, I can assure you both your two versions will not happen.<br><br></div>
