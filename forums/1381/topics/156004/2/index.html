Unless u're actually Jew of course.<br><br>2ndly, all thats said in Romans is said by Paul, not Jesus. So shade343 never say wrongly when he said Jesus never condemned homosexuality as a sin.</div></blockquote>1stly, Yes, the NT is the fulfilment of the OT through Jesus Christ because all the rules and regulations outlined in the Jewish Law was God's way of showing us that man and God could never come together just like that because God is holy while man is a wretched sinner who always needed to be made clean through sacrificial blood of animals and through observance of many purification rites, incl. not eating unclean meat.<br><br>The purpose of the OT is to show that man can only come near to God on God's terms, not on man's terms. It is the King who determines how you should approach him, thus the protocols and formalities. There's no way you can simply enter a Prime Minister's or a King's chamber just like that unless he is your dad!<br><br>You must know that <span style="color: red;">the OT with all its rules and regulations was not without God's good intention and purposes for His people</span>. But above all, the OT was a foreshadow of the coming Messiah. In other words, you can say that <span style="color: blue;">the OT was the prophecy, while the NT the fulfilment</span>. As Jesus said in Matthew 5:17-20: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everythying is accomplished. Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven..."<br><br><strong>As much as we no longer subject ourselves to OT laws like circumcision, or this cannot touch, that cannot do; this can eat, that cannot eat; this can wear, that cannot wear (no cross-dressing), can have sex with this person, but not with that person, etc. with all that countless rules and regulations, that doesn't mean that we can lead a life that runs contrary to God's moral law.</strong> <span style="color: blue;">All that God has created is given to us for us to enjoy, incl. sex but it must be with an understanding of His ORIGINAL purpose &amp; intention</span>, i.e. the marriage covenant between a man and a woman. You can abuse it and use it for your own homosexual orientation but it will not be one without consequences and damage to your personal well-being.<br><br>2ndly, 2 Timothy 3:16 says "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness" Moses talked with God face to face (Numbers 12:6-8 ) and he wrote most of the OT, while <span style="color: red;">the Apostle Paul</span> himself was brought up in very strict Jewish ways and he was a very well-trained Pharisee. Read what he said in <span style="color: red;">Galatians 1:14 - I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers</span>." In other words, Paul probably could recite the whole OT word for word and put many other Pharisees to shame. He was such an expert in the Law and so highly trained that no one during his time possessed such keenness of mind like he did. So mind you, the Apostle Paul was a very brilliant man, equivalent to today's Ph.d or doctorate. In various passages of the NT, he did say that he could take pride and boasts about his background but because ever since he had a personal encounter with Jesus, he was humbled and he walked very closely to the Lord. That's why Christians revere the teachings of the Apostle Paul because his life was one that reflected a man so in tune with God. We believe what he says and teaches is in line with God's purpose and will for us, i.e. no homosexuality in the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>Well, since you don't take what Paul says as God-breathed and God-inspired, you might as well just keep the very words of Jesus' written in red in the book of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and burn the rest of your bible.</div>

I laughed so hard my stomach hurts. ARE u still misguided into thinking that freud's theories are all right? More and more gays are finding it easier to come out now, and guess what? They're not from families where the father is missing. In the past this illusion appeared to be true because it was probably easier for gay people with only a female parent to come out to his/her mother. Mothers tend to be able to accept their child better for who they are. But now, more and more people are coming out, and their families aren't missing a father. All that nonsense about not having dad's touch? Thats nonsense. Homosexuality is decided by genes and hormones. WHETHER one stays in denial or comes out, is decided by upbringing.<br><br>Finally I will point out that homosexual people can be as upright as any of us and maybe even more so, because they see beyond judging people by their gender and sexuality. They certainly aren't harbouring "holier than thou" attitudes, whether they're christians or not.</div>

Im surprise to see that u consider transgendered people gay because psychologically speaking, they are every bit the opposite sex of their physical genders. If you had a son who wanted to be a girl, but still liked girls, then I can tell you your son is lesbian! And then u can worry. If he wants to be a girl and likes guys, u can comfort yourself that at least he is a straight girl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
