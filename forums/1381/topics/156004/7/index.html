            <div class='col-md body'>Icemoon seems to kep mentioning me in tis thread... I think i will just give a short reply<br><br><strong>Lev 18:22 (NIV): " 'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable. "<br><br>Lev 20:13 (NIV): 'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads." </strong><br><br>Talking about Lev and the OT, if u treat them as valid and guidelines god has set, then in these passages it was also said<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">LV 11:3You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.<br>4 " 'There are some that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you. 5 The coney, [a] though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you. 6 The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you. 7 <strong>And the pig, though it has a split hoof completely divided, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you.</strong> <strong>8 You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses;</strong> they are unclean for you.<br><br>9 " 'Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams, you may eat any that have fins and scales. 10 <strong>But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scalesÂ—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the waterÂ—you are to detest. 11 And since you are to detest them, you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses.</strong> 12 Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you. </span><br><br>So christians can not eat prawns, clams, oysters and pork ?<br><br><strong>Rom 1:24-32 (NIV):<br>"Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the CreatorÂ—who is forever praised. Amen. </strong><br><br><strong>1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (NIV): "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters, nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God." </strong><br><br>Ahh... from Paul... So if the words he said r laws, then he also said the followings<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1 Corinthians 11  5And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her headÂ—it is just as though her head were shaved. 6If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1 Corinthians 14  33As in all the congregations of the saints, 34women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. 35If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; <strong>for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church</strong>. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1 Timothy 2:11 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. <strong>12I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man</strong>; she must be silent</span><br><br>So if u wanna follow paul's word, then ban all woman who has a supervision role ! Woman have to cover their head when they go to church otherwise they have to be bald ! Woman can't say anything in the church !<br><br>Since u felt the bible is infallible and watever it said has to be followed, then I offer this challenge to the christians out there who condemn homo,<br><br><strong>Follow the rules and laws in totality, not pick and choose the rules and laws u like.</strong><br></div>
