              <p>So u think all Christians all have the same innate ability to
              commune to God directly ? Not suprised that you hold such high

              <p>Ok. So u now say that dying for a belief... IN RELIGION.... is
              bad. Ok. So I accept that. And your reasoning is, it will be

              <p>Fair enough. Again I am not saying u are wrong. This world pretty much  is split into two kinds of people. The realist... and the idealist. One believes and trusts in humanity, the other is wary and suspicious.</p>
              <p>Sometimes the consequences is not immedaite, and we are unable to see what effects it has after the ripple.</p>
              <p>For example: Missionary Dr goes to some 3rd world country believing in his religious belief of love and kindness and helping those in need. Goes over, helps the village but got killed by some rival village people. Is his death worth it ?  From different dimensions, sure from a realist point of view, he was being selfish... but on an idealist pov, he died helping because he believed in helping. How about the villagers point of view ? Mainly the people he managed to save.</p>
              <p>Equally, a person who drove on with his family in the car will no stop to help the person on the road side because he fears for his family's safety. That is not wrong too. More importantly I believe is the consequences of an omission that will be more important.</p>

              <p>These are just very vague, general and loose examples. There is no need to get pedantic and open up a whole lot of irrelevant considerations in this discussion.</p>
              <p>He can just be killed while crossing the road innocently by someone who just happen to hate his skin colour. How about that ?</p>
              <p>Anyways,  i never said killing him is correct.  Was he being insensitive for example to treat the sick and dying children that lack any kidn of developed medicinal and hygiene care ? Come on...  really ? We going to discuss about his "insensitiviness"?Havent u thought that perhaps.. just maybe perhaps they went willingly not necessarly to spread religions right ? Why confine yourself to a very narrow and strict analogy that even you cannot accout from every conceivable dimension possible ?</p>
              <p>Whether or not the family agree's is between him and his family. Just because they disagree does not mean they do not feel proud of what he has done. Equally a family may not feel proud for him for staying with the family when everyone else have gone to answer the call.</p>
              <p>Whether or not being self-centered is not for us to decide.Everyone can have thier "reasons". Thier family will decide. History will decide. The far reaching consequences will decide whether close or afar, wide or narrow. Not you not me not anyone. We only know how to point fingers and say negative things.</p>

              <p>So what kind of discussion are we going to get out of this ? Are
              we going to now argue about whether religoins are tools of
              oppresion ?</p>
              <p>I hope u know what I am trying to say. But if you still believe
              that no good has come out of it. Then I accept your reasoning.

              <p>Anyways,  i never said killing him is correct.  Was he
              being insensitive for example to treat the sick and dying children
              that lack any kidn of developed medicinal and hygiene care ? Come
              on...  really ? We going to discuss about his
              "insensitiviness"?Havent u thought that perhaps.. just maybe
              perhaps they went willingly not necessarly to spread religions
              right ? Why confine yourself to a very narrow and strict analogy
              that even you cannot accout from every conceivable dimension
              possible ?</p>
              <p>Whether or not the family agree's is between him and his family.
              Just because they disagree does not mean they do not feel proud of
              what he has done. Equally a family may not feel proud for him for
              staying with the family when everyone else have gone to answer the
              call.</p>
              <p>Whether or not being self-centered is not for us to
              decide.Everyone can have thier "reasons". Thier family will decide.
              History will decide. The far reaching consequences will decide
              whether close or afar, wide or narrow. Not you not me not anyone.

              <p>I know u think Uniquely Singapore is unique, but there are many
              other driving factors than just merely commercial.</p>
              <p>You talk as if missionaries are all military agents devoid of
              any human feelings and emotions to do good, love and help those in
              need.</p>
              <p>While I appreciate the good, I also acknoledge the bad. Thats
              all.</p>
              <p>If you think missionaries have no positive impact whatsoever in
              the entire Asia continent,  I respect your stand.</p>

              <p>For correction, I am not a believer in Singapore being exceptional or unique.</p>
              <p>I believe that for reasons of importance to the colonizing power, Singapore benefitted from more development in the colonial era than its neighbours.</p>
              <p>This is not to imply that Singapore is special or specially deserving for any other reason, nor does it imply any special affection for Singapore.</p>

              <p> would rather trust God to take care of my family than trust
                      the guy holding a gun to my head. What makes you think he won't
                      pull the trigger and kill off everyone despite a denial? You would
                      trust the man who points a gun at your head to keep his promise to
                      you? How gullible you are. Next he ask you to list down all the
                      believers you know so that he can kill them or else he kills you.
                      So you gonna give in too for the sake of your baby and wife?</p>
              <p>Jesus taught that the man who saves his life will lose it.
                      But he that loses his life for God will gain it. Those who want to
                      follow Jesus must carry their own cross, which basically means
                      being willing to forfeit his life to follow Jesus all the way.
                      Remember, Jesus is the source of life. He is the Life!</p>

              <p>BIC, you don't get it. The discussion is on whether you would deny your religion to save yourself, not whether you will depend on someone's honesty.</p>
              <p>Your example of a terrorist not keeping his word is not definitive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's get back on track:</p>
              <p>If for instance a terrorist hijacked your plane and asked for all the believers in XX because he would execute one passenger every hour beginning with them, would you raise your hand?</p>
              <p>A biblical counter-example to your decision can be found in God stopping Abraham at the last moment, knife in hand, from sacrificing his son to God.</p>

              <p>And I believe I have already given the answer from the Bible.</p>
              <p>My example of the gunman not keeping his word is to tell Tcmc not to be so naive.</p>
              <p>As
               for your two examples, I shall dismiss the first since it is 
              hypothetical and has no reality behind it. Like I said, such speculative
               scenarios can be multiplied endlessly and really not productive to 
              haggle over them. As for your second example, it is hardly a 
              counter-example. The case of Abraham has nothing to do with denying 
              one's faith. On the contrary it was an affirmation of faith in God.</p>
