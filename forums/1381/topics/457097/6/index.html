              <p>So you are saying that terrorists are no different from martyrs? Then you are sorely mistaken.</p>
              <p>Terrorists demand that others die for their beliefs.</p>
              <p>Martyrs are those who choose to die for their beliefs.</p>
              <p>Again I will speak from the Bible, no where in the NT do we have any example of a believer who acted like a terrorist. The people who complained about the Christians were NOT complaining that Christians were killing people or blowing others up at marketplaces. Rather they were complaining that the Christians were preaching that Jesus Christ was killed and raised from the dead according to the Scriptures and that He would come again to judge the world. If anything it were the Christians who were the ones being terrorised for their beliefs!</p>

              <p>Ok let's share a story, </p>
              <p>A man fell into a shallow river off the cliff, there was little way he could get up and the river was flooding soon. Just then, at the side of the cliff was a man with a rope to get up the cliff and asked the man, 'do you need my help?' He replied, 'I have faith in God and God will save me.' So the man ignored him and left. After a while, the water rose from his knee length to his waist length. A fisherman, paddling on the boat, passed by and saw him. He asked the same question, but the man replied that he has faith in God and God will save him. So the fisherman left. Sometime later, the water was at the height of his neck and he was still standing there. Just then, a helicopter passing by, the pilot saw him and quickly threw a rope, the water was gushing and rising by the seconds. The pilot shouted, 'QUICK, GET THE ROPE!' But he replied the same, he did not grab the rope. Soon, the water swallowed him and he was drowned. He saw God and he asked God,' why have you not saved me? I have faith.' God replied, ' you have declined my help, I have sent three people to help you but you choose not to help.'</p>
