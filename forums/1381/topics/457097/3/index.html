              <p>My example of the gunman not keeping his word is to tell Tcmc

              <p>As for your two examples, I shall dismiss the first since it is
              hypothetical and has no reality behind it. Like I said, such
              speculative scenarios can be multiplied endlessly and really not
              productive to haggle over them. As for your second example, it is
              hardly a counter-example. The case of Abraham has nothing to do
              with denying one's faith. On the contrary it was an affirmation of
              faith in God.</p>

              <p>Don't read Bible much?</p>
              <p>It was by faith that Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">God was testing him</span></strong>. Abraham, who had received God’s promises, was ready to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, <span id="en-NLT-30151" class="text Heb-11-18">even though God had told him, “Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted.”</span><span id="en-NLT-30152" class="text Heb-11-19"><sup class="versenum"> </sup>Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life again. And in a sense, Abraham did receive his son back from the dead. - Hebrews 11:17</span></p>
              <p>The Bible has many other verses about God testing His people to see if they would obey Him and walk in His ways.</p>

              <p>Fatal demonstrations of your faith are NOT unique to Abraham and not a moot point. Even if god does not organise a test for you, others may. Religious persecution is a fact of life. Have you heard of Saint Barbara?</p>
              <p>Barbara, the daughter of a rich pagan
               named Dioscorus ... acknowledged herself to be a Christian; upon this her father drew 
              his sword to kill her, but her prayers created an opening in the wall and she was miraculously transported to a mountain gorge ... Dragged before the prefect of the province, who had her cruelly tortured, Barbara held true to her faith. Finally she was condemned to death by beheading. Her father himself carried out the death-sentence. However, he was struck by lightning on the way home and his body was consumed by flame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't tell us such things will never happen, or not to go looking for martyrdom. Those are moot.</p>
              <p>Instead tell us what you would do, and what god's guidance is, in such a situation.</p>

              <p>Fatal demonstrations of your faith are NOT unique to Abraham and not a moot point. Even if god does not organise a test for you, others may. Religious persecution is a fact of life. Have you heard of Saint Barbara?</p>
              <p>Barbara, the daughter of a rich pagan named Dioscorus ... acknowledged herself to be a Christian; upon this her father drew his sword to kill her, but her prayers created an opening in the wall and she was miraculously transported to a mountain gorge ... Dragged before the prefect of the province, who had her cruelly tortured, Barbara held true to her faith. Finally she was condemned to death by beheading. Her father himself carried out the death-sentence. However, he was struck by lightning on the way home and his body was consumed by flame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't tell us such things will never happen, or not to go looking for martyrdom. Those are moot.</p>
              <p>Instead tell us what you would do, and what god's guidance is, in such a situation.</p>

              <p>Perhaps it just your choice of word "fatal demonstration" that I find uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the Bible teaches that Christians will be persecuted or even killed for their testimony. Rev 20 talks about those who died for upholding their testimony. I know this is easier said than done, but if any believer is caught in such a situation, he should remain steadfast, counting it worthy to suffer or even die for Jesus' Name. The book of Acts have examples of saints who were killed. So I am NOT saying that such things will never happen, I am simply saying that you don't go round with a death wish. </p>
