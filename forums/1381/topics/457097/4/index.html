              <p>God is not pleased by blood sacrifice. Not even of animals. Does he expect them? What makes you think he would expect you to die at the hands of a persecutor?</p>
              <p>There are so many Biblical instances that you say should not be interpreted in dangerous ways eg OT tracts. What makes you think your interpretation of this matter is correct?</p>

              <p>Re the giver of life issue, OK sorry that was my misunderstanding, my point was that God sustains all of life and is the Giver of life. Yes, what He gives He can also take.</p>

              <p>So tell me, what do you do with the teaching of Jesus then, about not denying Him before men? Obey or disobey? Yes, life is precious. But Jesus also taught that a man can save his life and yet loses his soul. So what do you do with that teaching as well? Dump it?</p>

              <p>In response to your false accusation, I am NOT ignoring the Bible commands. There's a world of difference between ignoring the Bible's commands and properly interpreting it and having a Biblical justification that the command was not meant to be universally held across time and space.</p>
              <p>Were your reasons valid? I have showed how they were anything but valid!</p>
              <p>Why would you say I am a gnostic? In what ways are my beliefs similar to the gnostics? Do you even know what gnosticism is?</p>

              <p>Actually you are right on this. People who are ignorant of Christianity should not even be trying to argue against it. Or at least they should take the time to REALLY find out what the Bible teaches. But most of the time they prefer to shoot first then talk later. Some just shoot first then take cover, talk also don't have.</p>
