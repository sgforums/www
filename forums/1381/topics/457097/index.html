              <p>If a terrorist asks you to deny your god, you should think of your family first. If denying your god can save your life, then deny your god and go back to your loved ones safely.</p>
              <p>I am sure if your god loves your family, he/she will understand.</p>

              <p>I think if you are talking about dying to save other human beings
               yes. But if you are dying for just a belief, where there is no one 
              "tangible" to save, then it's better to go back to your tangible family 
              members safely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mean, your god won't understand that your family needs you home safely in one piece and not two pieces?</p>

              <p>I think Tcmc is not so much looking at in prematurely as looking at the whole religion thing as irrational and delusional. An atheist sees religion as ultimately a form of delusion since there is no reality behind it. To the atheist any divine being or deity in a religion is just an imaginary being invented by man to cope with the unknown, the mysterious, and other fears. So why die for a false belief?</p>

              <p>Many famous people dying for beliefs does not make it right universally....Appeal to authority fallacy.</p>
              <p>Tell me, there's No harm denying your god first then go back to your family safely, right?</p>
              <p>You mean your god will insist you dont deny him and die for him? You mean if you deny him for your loved ones' sake, he cannot understand your situation and will send you to hell?</p>

              <p>Ghandi.. if u ever did read his bibiography, is a man of faith. He practices Hinduisim, and from his religion he believed in compassion, non-violence and the Golden Rule of treat others how u want them to treat you.</p>
              <p>However, Ghandi did once say he is Christian, Hindu and Muslim all in once. </p>
              <p>But you can see where he got his belief and conviction from. He didnt just wake up one day and decided to throw away his legal career and becoming a proponent of civil disobedience.</p>

              <p>Saying no positive effect at all is making a bold statement. And if I were to use TCMC's "appeal to authority", we will end up comparing data. Theological, philosophical and sociological comparisons with numbers and journals and what nots/</p>
              <p>Are u willing to go down that path ? You are pretty much saying that all the religions are tools to pacify the indiegnous people full stop. </p>
              <p>So what kind of discussion are we going to get out of this ? Are we going to now argue about whether religoins are tools of oppresion ?</p>
              <p>I hope u know what I am trying to say. But if you still believe that no good has come out of it. Then I accept your reasoning. Simple.</p>
