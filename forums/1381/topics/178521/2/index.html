Wake up middle of the night is to look at the fish, every week must go fish shop 2 - 3 times or more, (church only every Sunday, prayer also for the fish). What occupied those ppl mind &amp; heart ? Still got place for God ? i doubt so, i once are in that state.<br>Bible say, you must love you God with all your mind, your soul, your heart &amp; your strength...<br>Ya, paediatrician also said kids at that age are full of imagination, but we are not sure those encounter she has is due to her imagination or she really saw something, even I ask her now (she just turn 5 this month), she can't remember those things happenened when she was only 2 - 3 years old.</div></blockquote>Normally kids at that age are quite sensitive. Some of them are able to see things which normal people cant see. As kids grow up, most of them lose that attribute due to cynism from the peopl around them.</div>

Let me share my story, i do believed in fengshui before i accepted Christ. Of course now i renounced &amp; confessed those i praticed previously.<br>As I mentioned earlier, I start keeping arowana before i am a Christian, the original intention of keeping arowana is to bring good luck ( i generally a fish lover, i do keep other fishes &amp; marine coral) but now i do believe luck won't come from fish, i also started to admire the beauty of arowana.<br>Those strange stories i personally encounter is once i was busy &amp; didn't take care of the fish for days, suddenly i got an infection on my left eye (red &amp; itch) and my wife noticed &amp; told me my fish's eye blur, cover by fungus, then I realised is same side as mine, coincident ?<br>I had a gold arowana that kept for 5 years, there once i went US to visit my wife (she temp posted there a year), so i asked a favour from my relative to come to my house 2 times per week to feed the fish. After a week in US, i dream of my fish died of suffocate &amp; true enough on the very next day, i received a sms from my relative that all my fish died, because they accidently switch off the main power, no air &amp; water circulation in the tank.<br>Some other stories i heard, owner engaged in accident but unhurt, fish died at same time with no obvious reason. Owner speak wanted to let go the fish &amp; it died next day without obvious reason, there is lot of others that need few pages to list down.<br>I do have weird ticklish feeling at my back occasionlly when I standing in front to view my fish. I do see shadow flying around especially in my house, sometime is a human form. My daughter when she was 2 years old ever pointed at window &amp; cry with fear (like she saw something), run back to us with fear by looking at the wall (as those she saw something frighten her) when she 3 years, she once scared of night, she told us she don't want to sleep, keep trying to stay awake. ever wake up middle of night &amp; talking "you go away, don't want you to stay here etc etc".<br>Some of my church members suggested it could be the fish i kept, i am willing to let go but somehow still trying to find hard proved that is due to the fish.</div></blockquote>There is already occultic influence from the fishes. So get rid of them once for all &amp; pray for cleansing by your pastor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Share another story of God answer on the arowana...<br>This happenened in 2004, I used to keep more than 1 arowana, after hearing some advises from church members, i decided to let go.<br>I pray that God help me to let go the arowana if I am not suppose or not good to keep it... after a week, the shop owner who sold me this fish 1 year ago called me &amp; asked me am i still keeping it ? they willing to buy back from me. I was shocked as i pray &amp; someone approached me that are not within my expectation, ok we fixed an appointment &amp; the shop owner came to view the fish... after some negotiation, he is not willing to pay the price i asked. So, i got some excuses for myself, is not i don't want to let go, is they not willing to pay. Another surprise a week later, the same person called me again &amp; they willing to offer a higher price for the fish but still about a hundred short from what i asked. I let go the fish at that price as God may test your obedience...<br>Now I still left one arowana....</div>

YOu mean like last birth a christian and then this birth christian?</div></blockquote>A born-again Christian is a person who has made a conscious decision to commit his life to God.<br><br>As oppose to one who is born into a Christian family.<br><br>Being born into a Christian family doesn't really count. Each individual is to make his own commitment to God. The phrase "born again" came from a passage from the gospels where Jesus was having a conversation with a famous teacher of the Hebrew law. When asked by this teacher on how one can enter heaven. Jesus' reply was "You must be born again".</div>

I believe that this is the part of your old self that is bothering you.<br><br>I believe, I am certain and I have experienced that when Christ is in me, no other spirit can come near me.<br><br>Hold a family thanks-giving in your house, invite your cell group to come to your house for group prayer. Pray for faith.<br><br>are all aquariums haunted with spirit?? don think so.<br><br>After a hard day's work, it is very soothing to watch how a arowana moves. It sorts of sober you down, very peaceful and calm. But it is expensive to keep, and your whole family got to enjoy it to keep it alive, or when it would have die when you go on a busiess trip. But if you don't enjoy the fun of keeping fish, or any pet, why keep? got spirit or no spirit.</div>
