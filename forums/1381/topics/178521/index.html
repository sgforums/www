Let me share my story, i do believed in fengshui before i accepted Christ. Of course now i renounced &amp; confessed those i praticed previously.<br>As I mentioned earlier, I start keeping arowana before i am a Christian, the original intention of keeping arowana is to bring good luck ( i generally a fish lover, i do keep other fishes &amp; marine coral) but now i do believe luck won't come from fish, i also started to admire the beauty of arowana.<br>Those strange stories i personally encounter is once i was busy &amp; didn't take care of the fish for days, suddenly i got an infection on my left eye (red &amp; itch) and my wife noticed &amp; told me my fish's eye blur, cover by fungus, then I realised is same side as mine, coincident ?<br>I had a gold arowana that kept for 5 years, there once i went US to visit my wife (she temp posted there a year), so i asked a favour from my relative to come to my house 2 times per week to feed the fish. After a week in US, i dream of my fish died of suffocate &amp; true enough on the very next day, i received a sms from my relative that all my fish died, because they accidently switch off the main power, no air &amp; water circulation in the tank.<br>Some other stories i heard, owner engaged in accident but unhurt, fish died at same time with no obvious reason. Owner speak wanted to let go the fish &amp; it died next day without obvious reason, there is lot of others that need few pages to list down.<br>I do have weird ticklish feeling at my back occasionlly when I standing in front to view my fish. I do see shadow flying around especially in my house, sometime is a human form. My daughter when she was 2 years old ever pointed at window &amp; cry with fear (like she saw something), run back to us with fear by looking at the wall (as those she saw something frighten her) when she 3 years, she once scared of night, she told us she don't want to sleep, keep trying to stay awake. ever wake up middle of night &amp; talking "you go away, don't want you to stay here etc etc".<br>Some of my church members suggested it could be the fish i kept, i am willing to let go but somehow still trying to find hard proved that is due to the fish.</div></blockquote>Whoa! what a story.... I'd encourage you to speak to your pastor and have some church leaders come and pray in your house. The fish may only be a channel, getting rid of it may not help.</div>

Wake up middle of the night is to look at the fish, every week must go fish shop 2 - 3 times or more, (church only every Sunday, prayer also for the fish). What occupied those ppl mind &amp; heart ? Still got place for God ? i doubt so, i once are in that state.<br>Bible say, you must love you God with all your mind, your soul, your heart &amp; your strength...<br>Ya, paediatrician also said kids at that age are full of imagination, but we are not sure those encounter she has is due to her imagination or she really saw something, even I ask her now (she just turn 5 this month), she can't remember those things happenened when she was only 2 - 3 years old.</div>
