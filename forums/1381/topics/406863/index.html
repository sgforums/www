            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Answer: </strong>The most frequent objection to the doctrine of eternal security is that it supposedly allows people to live any way that they want and still be saved. While this may be "technically" true, it is not true in reality. A person who has truly been redeemed by Jesus Christ will not live a life characterized by continuous, willful sin. We must draw a distinction between how a Christian should live and what a person must do in order to receive salvation.<br><br>The Bible is clear that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/John%203.16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 3:16</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%202.8-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 2:8-9</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/John%2014.6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 14:6</span></span></a>). The moment a person truly believes in Jesus Christ, he or she is saved and secure in that salvation. Salvation is not gained by faith, but then maintained by works. The apostle Paul addresses this issue in <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Galatians%203.3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Galatians 3:3</span></span></a> when he asks, "Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort?" If we are saved by faith, our salvation is also maintained and secured by faith. We cannot earn our own salvation. Therefore, neither can we earn the maintenance of our salvation. It is God who maintains our salvation (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Jude%2024"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Jude 24</span></span></a>). It is God's hand that holds us firmly in His grasp (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/John%2010.28-29"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 10:28-29</span></span></a>). It is God's love that nothing can separate us from (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%208.38-39"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 8:38-39</span></span></a>).<br><br>Any denial of eternal security is, in its essence, a belief that we must maintain our own salvation by our own good works and efforts. This is completely antithetical to salvation by grace. We are saved because of Christ's merits, not our own (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%204.3-8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 4:3-8</span></span></a>). To claim that we must obey God's Word or live a godly life to maintain our salvation is saying that Jesus' death was not sufficient to pay the penalty for our sins. Jesus' death was absolutely sufficient to pay for all of our sins—past, present, and future, pre-salvation and post-salvation (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%205.8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 5:8</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Corinthians%2015.3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Corinthians 15:3</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/2%20Corinthians%205.21"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">2 Corinthians 5:21</span></span></a>).<br><br>Does this mean that a Christian can live any way he wants to and still be saved? This is essentially a hypothetical question, because the Bible makes it clear that a true Christian will not live "any way he wants to." Christians are new creations (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/2%20Corinthians%205.17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">2 Corinthians 5:17</span></span></a>). Christians demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Galatians%205.22-23"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Galatians 5:22-23</span></span></a>), not the acts of the flesh (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Galatians%205.19-21"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Galatians 5:19-21</span></span></a>). <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/First%20John%203.6-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">First John 3:6-9</span></span></a> clearly states that a true Christian will not live in continual sin. In response to the accusation that grace promotes sin, the apostle Paul declared, "What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%206.1-2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 6:1-2</span></span></a>).<br><br>Eternal security is not a license to sin. Rather, it is the security of knowing that God's love is guaranteed for those who trust in Christ. Knowing and understanding God's tremendous gift of salvation accomplishes the opposite of giving a license to sin. How could anyone, knowing the price Jesus Christ paid for us, go on to live a life of sin (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%206.15-23"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 6:15-23</span></span></a>)? How could anyone who understands God's unconditional and guaranteed love for those who believe, take that love and throw it back in God's face? Such a person is demonstrating not that eternal security has given him a license to sin, but rather that he or she has not truly experienced salvation through Jesus Christ. "No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20John%203.6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 John 3:6</span></span></a>).</p></div>

              <p>Catholics fully recognize that Jesus Christ died on the Cross for their sins and thus "opened the gates of Heaven," and that salvation is a free gift which no amount of human good deeds could ever earn. Catholics receive Christ's saving sanctifying grace, and Christ himself, into their souls when they are baptized. Yet they also know that Christ has established certain conditions for entry into eternal happiness in Heaven, for example, receiving His true Flesh and Blood (John 6:54) and keeping the commandments (Matt. 19:17). If a Christian refuses or neglects to obey Our Lord's commands in a grave matter (that is, if he commits a mortal sin), Our Lord will not remain dwelling in his soul; and if a Christian dies in that state, having driven his Lord from his soul by serious sin, he will not be saved. As St. Paul warned the Galatians with regard to certain sins: "They who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God." (Gal. 5:21). It must be added that Christ will always forgive and turn to a sinner who approaches Him with sincerity in the Sacrament of Penance.<br><br>Catholics follow St. Paul, who did not think that his salvation was guaranteed once and for all at the moment he first received Christ into his soul; for he wrote: "I chastise my body, and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway." (1 Cor. 9:27). Also: "With fear and trembling work our your salvation. For it is God who worketh in you..." (Phil. 2:12-13). "He that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved." (Matt. 10:22). Nevertheless, Catholics realize that even the fulfilling of Our Lord's requirements for salvation is impossible without the free gift of His grace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are good works necessary for salvation? Does not Paul say in Romans 3:28 that faith alone justifies?</p>
              <p><br>Catholics believe that faith and good works are both necessary for salvation, because such is the teaching of Jesus Christ. What our Lord demands is "faith that worketh by charity." (Gal. 5:6). Read Matthew 25:31-46, which describes the Last Judgment as being based on works of charity. The first and greatest commandment, as given by Our Lord Himself, is to love the Lord God with all one's heart, mind, soul, and strength; and the second great commandment is to love one's neighbor as oneself. (Mark 12:30-31). When the rich young man asked Our Lord what he must do to gain eternal life, our Lord answered: "Keep the commandments." (Matt. 19:17). Thus, although faith is the beginning, it is not the complete fulfilment of the will of God. Nowhere in the Bible is it written that faith alone justifies. When St. Paul wrote, "For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law," he was referring to works peculiar to the old Jewish Law, and he cited circumcision as an example.<br><br>The Catholic Church does not teach that purely human good works are meritorious for salvation; such works are not meritorious for salvation, according to her teaching. Only those good works performed when a person is in the state of grace, that is, as a branch drawing its spiritual life from the Vine which is Christ (John 15:4-6), only these good deeds work toward our salvation, and they do so only by the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ. These good works, offered to God by a soul in the state of grace (i.e., free of mortal sin, with the Blessed Trinity dwelling in the soul), are thereby supernaturally meritorious because they share in the work and in the merits of Christ. Such supernatural good works will not only be rewarded by God, but are necessary for salvation.<br><br>St. Paul shows how the neglect of certain good works will send even a Christian believer to damnation: "But if any man have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel." (1 Tim. 5:8 ). Our Lord tells us that if the Master (God) returns and finds His servant sinning, rather than performing works of obedience, He "shall separate him, and shall appoint him his portion with unbelievers." (Luke 12:46).<br><br>Furthermore, Catholics know they will be rewarded in Heaven for their good works. Our Lord Himself said: "For the Son of man...will render to every man according to his works." (Matt. 16:27). "And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward." (Matt. 10:42). Catholics believe, following the Apostle Paul, that "every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour." (1 Cor. 3:8 ). "For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shown in his name, you who have ministered, and do minister to the saints." (Heb. 6:10). "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day; and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming." (2 Tim. 4:7-8 ).<br><br>Still, Catholics know that, strictly speaking, God never owes us anything. Even after obeying all God's commandments, we must still say: "We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do." (Luke 17:10). As St. Augustine (5th century) stated: All our good merits are wrought through grace, so that God, in crowning our merits, is crowning nothing but His gifts."<br><br><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Had St. Paul meant that faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, he would not have written: "...and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." (1 Cor. 13:2).</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the Apostle James would not have written: "Do you see by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?</span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">...</span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead." (James 2:24-26).</span></strong> Or: "What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?" (James 2:14). <strong><span style="color: #800080;">If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the Apostle Peter would not have written: "Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make sure you calling and election. For doing these things, you shall not sin at any time. For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." (2 Peter 1:10-11).</span></strong> If faith ruled out the necessity of good works for salvation, the primitive Christian Fathers would not have advocated good works in such powerful words. Wrote St. Irenaeus, one of the most illustrious of the primitive Christian Fathers: "For what is the use of knowing the truth in word, while defiling the body and accomplishing the works of evil? Or what real good at all can bodily holiness do, if truth be not in the soul? For these two, faith and good works, rejoice in each other's company, and agree together and fight side by side to sen man in the Presence of God." (Proof of the Apostolic Preaching).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Justification by <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">faith alone is a new doctrine; it was unheard of</span></em> in the Christian community before the sixteenth century.</p>
