I asked myself, is that how you go promoting your religion to people by offending and insulting their religion as the way forward? I mean, to promote your religion to people, wouldnt it better for you to preach love and peace instead of satanic and idols made of wood, afterall first impression lasts.</p></div>

When you say likewise that the cross or Jesus/Mary at churches are also made of wood/clay/whatever, they will retort back they are merely symbolic, but they failed to realise it is also symbolic in other religions.

              <p>Well I'm a christian, and a happy one at that.  I guess what really matters is the way that people go about trying to spread their views, I've been approached by other christians (who didnt know i was a christian) and asked if i would like to do a "survey". Then turns out they are trying to get me to go to their church ...</p>
              <p>Deceit as a means to invite somebody to church? Do a rethink people =) Lead via example, be morally upstanding and walk the talk. If a person is in need, reach out a helping hand. The last thing one should be doing is puting down other people's religions.  The worst you can do is to go around trying to tell people that they are wrong without even understanding their point of view or beliefs first.</p>

              <p>oh u dun have christian colleagues or boss in office who tell you the idol you pray to is made of wood? maybe not yet. I used to have a senior manager and out of a sudden, she uttered this to me for no rhyme and reason. I had another christian colleague, who, thank goodness, only told me the name of the church she was from, thats all.</p>

              <p>I don't have the above experience but I did have experience from a christian who condemned other churches are not true church.   She kept harassing me to attend her church which she claimed was started in Boston and is the true church.   That time I was a christian and I told her I have a church to attend but she refused to give up and kept harassing me. </p>

              <p>Well I'm a christian, and a happy one at that.  I guess
              what really matters is the way that people go about trying to
              spread their views, I've been approached by other christians (who
              didnt know i was a christian) and asked if i would like to do a
              "survey". Then turns out they are trying to get me to go to their
              church ...</p>
              <p>Deceit as a means to invite somebody to church? Do a rethink
              people =) Lead via example, be morally upstanding and walk the
              talk. If a person is in need, reach out a helping hand. The last
              thing one should be doing is puting down other people's
              religions.  The worst you can do is to go around trying to
              tell people that they are wrong without even understanding their
              point of view or beliefs first.</p>
