I can't believe someone still believes in the geocentric theory in today's world.<br><br>Regarding your second point, let me give you an example. Single gene mutation resulting in heterogeneous sickle cell anaemia is supposed to be non-beneficial to humans cos' of the lack of durability in the red blood cells created. However, heterogeneous status enables protection against malaria. That's why we see a greater proportion of people with sickle cell disease in malaria infested areas.<br><br>Therefore, mutations can be beneficial in the rigth environment.

How was the calculation done? How did he tell if the expansion was uniformly around Earth? I want to find out so if anyone knows please tell me.<br><br>You don't get "beneficial happenings" in evolution. You get changing environments that selects out advantageous configurations from the diversity. If you take a deck of cards and put them in an environment where all spades are burnt, what you get are surviving clubs, diamonds and hearts. You don't do it by random shuffling but you do it card by card. The environment is like a person that selects out the good cards from the bad ones. Evolution is far from chance.</div>

It can also help calculate the rate of recession of the universe from one viewpoint.<br><br>Here's a great explanation of how Redshift works:<br><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/hubble.html" rel="nofollow">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/hubble.html</a><br><br>Sloan Digital Sky Survey kinda maps out the universe from Earth's viewpoint, but I still can't find Hartnett's papers.
