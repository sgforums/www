            <div class='col-md body'>I went.<br><br>Since it was targeted at a layman audience, he didn't really go into the mechanics. I took some notes but I seem to have misplaced them...intended to do some research on it when my school term ends.<br><br>Okay this is all that I remember:<br><br>1. Creation in 6 (?) days as stated in the bible. Basically there are theories that say that the 6 days is metaphorical, right? Hartnett takes for a zero-compromise position instead. i.e. 6 days is REALLY 6 days on earth. The question is how come the universe can be billions of years old when creation takes place over 6 days.<br><br>He uses relativity to explain that...the rest of the universe was created while 6 days passed on earth. I guess it might be possible, time "slows down" for an object moving at a faster relative speed compared to another. Personally I'm not convinced yet, I have to try to work out the physics of it myself.<br><br>2. Big Bang theory. He states that the source of cosmic radiation is one of the problems that Big Bang cannot explain. Again given my lack of physics knowledge, I cannot comment further. I guess you can read it here:<br><a href="http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/4643/" rel="nofollow">http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/4643/</a><br><br>3. First Cause. Big Bang has no first cause (i.e. what came before the big bang?) thus it is not an acceptable theory--it doesn't explain the meaning of our existence. Christianity has no problems as such. (I disagree with this logic, and would rather examine the big bang from other angles.)<br><br>4. Dark matter. Hmm. I always thought that the idea of dark matter / anti-matter was more or less accepted by scientists. Hartnett rejects dark matter.<br><a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/media/statements/media_statements_2006/february/uwa_physicist_challenges_dark_matter_theories_(10_february)" rel="nofollow">http://www.uwa.edu.au/media/statements/media_statements_2006/february/uwa_physicist_challenges_dark_matter_theories_(10_february)</a><br><br>5. Evolution: Natural selection only reduces genetic information in total gene pool and never adds to it. Hmm. I'm not sure why either.<br><br>Aa x Aa = AA Aa Aa aa. I don't see any loss of information there. Oops I forgot what was the convincing point he made.<br><br>He added that empirically genetic mutations result in loss of information almost all of the time. Again have to verify this.<br>---------------------------------------------<br>Well I guess point number 1 would interest most Christians. Okay, so I have given you the facts. Now as a free-thinker who attended the talk...honestly, the talk was fairly interesting and informative. But without jumping to conclusions, I need to work out the details myself.<br><br>The second thing (my opinion) I don't really respect this John Hartnett after hearing him speak. The truth is I felt he was pushy and arrogant. If he believes in the truth of what he says, I don't see the need to use a tone of ridicule when addressing other theories. If his logic is good I would be convinced. Childish is the word. The tone of his presentation was like "I am right and everyone else is wrong and dumb, so there." Really hard for me to stomach.<br><br>Anyway not important. Doesn't make any of his theories more wrong or right. If anyone knows anything extra about those 5 main points I made above, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!</div>

If his logic is good I would be convinced. Childish is the word. The tone of his presentation was like "I am right and everyone else is wrong and dumb, so there." Really hard for me to stomach.<br><br>Anyway not important. Doesn't make any of his theories more wrong or right. If anyone knows anything extra about those 5 main points I made above, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!</div></blockquote>Actually alarm bells rung a few times during the talk.<br><br>if you remember, during the Q&amp;A session, he spoke about biology. He was like so confident about it.<br><br>This is a no no for a scientist. The true scientist is one who is uncomfortable about speaking outside his expertise.<br><br>I did a bit of research after the talk. The problems he spoke are real, but they do not seriously undermine the big bang theory.</div>

The genetic information can be combined differently from the parents but you won't get new genetic information from this.<br><br>OT: where did you sit that day?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Creation in 6 (?) days as stated in the bible. Basically there are theories that say that the 6 days is metaphorical, right?

I guess it might be possible, time "slows down" for an object moving at a faster relative speed compared to another.
