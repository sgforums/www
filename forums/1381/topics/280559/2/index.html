            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sillyme:</div><div class="quote_body">Years back, I visited NCC.  Halfway into the sermon, "supernatural pregnancy" was preached, i.e. a pregnancy without pain/suffering. I have also heard about it through a friend whose wife was pregnant. They attended another church (not CHC), but also read a book on the same subject.<br><br>As some of you know, my wife is pregnant. For a few weeks up till now, she is nauseous almost everyday.  Each time she vomited, I can only watch helplessly.  Out of desperation, remembering what I have heard before, I prayed that God to take away all this discomfort but she continued to vomit every other day.<br><br>Just last evening, she told me she was feeling very down because of all this.  I told her not to worry.  I continued that God sees her agony and He will comfort her.  I asked her not to struggle by herself but struggle with God.  When she fully depended on God, she will find comfort.<br><br>Indeed, as she was doing her quiet time today, the passage she read comforted her deeply.   She began to accept that these discomforts are part and parcel of being pregnant.  She now understands that in spite of her discomfort, she has to persevere so that this life in her can continue.<br><br>Though my wife's situation is not exactly an illness, but I think we can draw some parallels.  I think it's the attitude towards our condition that is important.  Of course, we go to a healing rally eager for God's healing.  But it is important to fully depend on God in spite of our feelings or situation.  It is in these times that we struggle with Him, then we can be transformed.</div></blockquote>Boss, you are doing well, continue to encourage her and pray with her lah, she will need all the encouragement and love from you hor ... ;-)<br><br>oh... is there a trigger thingy that may trigger her to vomit/nausea ? I remember when my wife was preg with our daughter, the trigger was the fume from cooking oil, so needless to say, no cooking for those first three months...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Why did God allow lazraus remain dead?<br>But God did not allow Lazarus to remain dead? no, Christ did come and revive him, did he? (ok... even if its not instant).<br>Actually, the sister is not expecting Lazarus to be brought back to live after being dead, she sort of blame Jesus for not getting there when he  was still alive.<br><br>Most people who talk about this issue, normally uses the example of the one on the blind man who was born blind... and Jesus replied that its neither him nor his parent's sin that he is born blind, but for the glory of God... then Jesus restored his sight...<br>so, where is this glory to God about, in this man being born blind? or him being given sight?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>last post for the night... need sleep <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
