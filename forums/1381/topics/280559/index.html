            <div class='col-md body'>Years back, I visited NCC.  Halfway into the sermon, "supernatural pregnancy" was preached, i.e. a pregnancy without pain/suffering. I have also heard about it through a friend whose wife was pregnant. They attended another church (not CHC), but also read a book on the same subject.<br><br>As some of you know, my wife is pregnant. For a few weeks up till now, she is nauseous almost everyday.  Each time she vomited, I can only watch helplessly.  Out of desperation, remembering what I have heard before, I prayed that God to take away all this discomfort but she continued to vomit every other day.<br><br>Just last evening, she told me she was feeling very down because of all this.  I told her not to worry.  I continued that God sees her agony and He will comfort her.  I asked her not to struggle by herself but struggle with God.  When she fully depended on God, she will find comfort.<br><br>Indeed, as she was doing her quiet time today, the passage she read comforted her deeply.   She began to accept that these discomforts are part and parcel of being pregnant.  She now understands that in spite of her discomfort, she has to persevere so that this life in her can continue.<br><br>Though my wife's situation is not exactly an illness, but I think we can draw some parallels.  I think it's the attitude towards our condition that is important.  Of course, we go to a healing rally eager for God's healing.  But it is important to fully depend on God in spite of our feelings or situation.  It is in these times that we struggle with Him, then we can be transformed.</div>

Its not about thinking in His shoe, but rather asking if this statement is inline with the characters of God and who is God to you.<br><br>*quote Davidche:<br>my common sense tells me that healing and being healed are something good, therefore God would want to do a good thing and thus, he is willing to heal.<br><br>what do you mean by this statement?<br><br>also<br>your this statement : "Sick christians experience/ encounter God comparatively easier, due to their inabilities, most of them are humble and look towards God."<br><br>There also those who due to their inabilities, blamed God for wanting them to remain like this and became negative in everything and turn others away from God.<br><br>anyway.... do ponder a bit more on God's character, also in the mean time, spend more time studing, exam coming soon, right? we can always continue after your exam.<br><br></div>
