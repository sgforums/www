Give way to what the Holy Spirit wants you to do as directed in His Word. Do not give in to what the sinful nature dictates. Before, when a sinner is not yet a Christian [when he has not yet being indwelt by the Holy Spirit], true and genuine godliness, righteousness and holiness is an impossibility. Any semblance of righteousness and godliness he does is but dead works.<br><br>But since he became indwelt by the Holy Spirit through faith in Christ Jesus the Lord, true and genuine holiness and righteousness and godliness is possible through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit in him. But this is not automatic. To avail of that power residing in him, he must cooperate with that Â‘powerÂ’ residing in him.<br><br>For example: I am in a situation where the devil presents me with a temptation to lust. I can feel the pull of my desires [sinful desires] within me as I still have within me my sinful nature. But I know that I have the Holy Spirit within me also ever ready to empower and enable me to resist this temptation and do the right thing instead. With much resistance from the sinful nature within me, I resist it and do contrary to what my sinful desire wants. I know I can do it because of the Holy Spirit is within me enabling me. I only have to cooperate with Him.<br><br>The Holy Spirit prompts us through His Word. It could be through a verse that we have just memorized and other things. The Holy Spirit is the one who empowers us and enables us to do the things written in His Word. Without Him, His commands we cannot do truly and genuinely from the inside out.<br><br>The verse could actually be translated in two ways: Walk BY the Spirit and Walk IN the Spirit.<br><br>Walking BY the Spirit means relying on His enabling power to do what He wants.<br><br>Walking IN the Spirit means behaving or conducting ourselves [inside and out] in the ways and desires of the Spirit. Being in His will, in short.<br><br>What happens if you walk BY and walk IN the Spirit?<br><br>Ga 5:16 I say then: Walk in [or by] the Spirit, <strong>and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh [sinful nature]. </strong><br><br>So what do you do in order for you to be indwelt by the Holy Spirit?<br><br>Well, do you trust in the Lord Jesus Christ <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>alone</strong></span> [not in your good works not in anything and anyone else], Do you trust in what He did on the cross <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>alone</strong></span> for salvation? If yes, you have the Holy Spirit my friend. <strong>YIELD.</strong><br><br>True freedom from sin is in the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. True <strong>transfromation</strong> is possible through HIm only.<br><br>It is possible to be changed by rehabilitation [if you are a drug addict] or  be a different person [for example if you embrace communist ideology or if you become a muslim] <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but the change is REFORMATION only not TRANSFORMATION.  </strong></span><br><br></div>
