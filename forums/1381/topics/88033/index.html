Usually only Bible college students receive training in exegetical and hermeneutical skills, while the laity in many churches have little exposure to such disciplines.<br><br>These workshops are structured for the typical church goer, providing Christians with techniques of understanding the Bible and comprehending seemingly difficult portion of Scripture, such as the Old Testament prophets.<br><br>In addition, the Bible Society is also offering a four-session workshop to train facilitators who would then be equipped to conduct RUB sessions for their own members and small groups in their respective churches.<br><br>This FacilitatorsÂ’ Training workshop would be ideally suited for leaders of small groups and ministries, who regularly lead in Bible studies. To qualify for the Facilitators' Training workshop, participants must first complete the RUB Workshop. Upon completion of the Facilitators' Training workshop, each participant would be awarded a certificate that would qualify them to teach the RUB Workshop, if they were to purchase the workbooks." The Scripture Use Facilitator for these workshops is Dr Peggy Yeo.<br><br>About the Facilitator:<br>Dr PEGGY YEO, has worked in a variety of Christian ministries: teaching in a church pre-school and childcare centre (USA); among economically disadvantaged communities (Singapore); teaching in Bible colleges (Singapore and throughout the Asia-Pacific region); doing field research in evangelism and revival movements (Southeast Asia). Most recently, she was with the United Bible Societies as a consultant for training and research in the Asia-Pacific region, and a faculty member with the Biblical Graduate School of Theology in Singapore.<br><br>Peggy currently works with the Bible Society in Australia (Victoria), conducting Â“The Bible from ScratchÂ” (Scratch) and Â“Reading and Understanding your BibleÂ” (RUB) workshops with various churches and groups at their invitation.<br><br>Tentative schedule:<br>Fri 19 Nov - 7.30pm - 9.30pm: RUB Workshop (Session 1)<br><br>Sat 20 Nov - 1.30pm - 7.30pm: RUB Workshop (Session 2-4)<br><br>Fri 26 Nov - 1.00pm - 6.30pm: RUB Facilitators' Training Course (Session 1-2)<br><br>Sat 27 Nov - 1.00pm - 6.30pm: RUB Facilitators' Training Course (Session 3-4)<br><br>For inquiries, please contact Angie Eu at:<br>Tel: 6337 3222 ext 30<br>Fax: 6337 3036<br>Email: news@bible.org.sg<br><br><a href="http://www.bible.org.sg/what/domestic/rub%20flyer.pdf" rel="nofollow"> REGISTRATION FORMS, pls click here.</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Organised by: The Bible Society of Singapore<br><br>Co-organised by:<br><br>Orchard Road Presbyterian Church &amp;<br><br>St. Andrew's Cathedral.</span></div>
