            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there are clues that we should not take the account literally. Let me share with you why.<br><br><blockquote>18 The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him." </blockquote>Let me test the audience - what happens after verse 18?<br><br>Is the following verse 19?<br><br><blockquote>So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs [i] and closed up the place with flesh.</blockquote>Warning: DO NOT CHEAT!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It is called the fruit of knowledge of good and evil.<br><br>2) The snake had explicitly said tat after eating the fruit, they will be like god who have the knowledge of good and evil.
