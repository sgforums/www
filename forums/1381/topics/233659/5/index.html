            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, if u want to put an adjective to it, then it is "knowledgeable". In fact from a definition of "wisdom" from dictionary .com<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The ability to discern or judge what is true, right, or lasting; insight</span><br><br>Since we r given the ability to know wat is good and evil, then we had indeed gained some wisdom in tis field<br><br>About the account, it comes to the original question why doesn't men appear to have tat knowledge and why does god prevent them from having tis knowledge. Isn't tat making adam and eve unconsciously commit evil and sin ? Since he can't tell wat is good or evil, how do u expect adam not to eat the fruit since he do not know it is not good to eat it.<br><br>According to genesis 3:22<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">And the LORD God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever." </span><br><br>Why do god want to prevent adam from real eternal life ? It seems to be as easy as eating another fruit from the tree of life. The way it is written suggest a constant guard of god to men, which is evident from the tower of babel as well.<br></div>
