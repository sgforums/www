Let's say you religiously follow this teaching, then one day you contemplate .. why cannot piak? Then you start giving all the excuses. And you finally piak! A precedence is set.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think tat is forced because in the bible itself it already described it a sudden miraculous event as decribed by their "eyes opened". Furthermore the name of the fruit is performing the function is described. I don't see why the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil (I just described it as fruit from now on... so long to type !) is not one tat give the knowledge of good and evil. It is like saying cough medicine is not used for cough but used for watering plants ! And there is nowhere in the passage tat says the fruit is not giving wisdom nor the snake is lying.<br><br>For your piak piak example. u already stated yourself tat u won't suddenly go and piak piak every girl immediately after u piak piak one. It will be a slow gradual process where u will piak piak more often. The fruit, after eating give a sudden effect. Tis is different from your example</div>
