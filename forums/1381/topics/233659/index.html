Cain then killed Abel.<br><br>So in the world, only got Adam, Eve and Cain right?<br><br>But in...<br><br>chapter 4 verse 14<br><br>13 Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear. 14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."<br><br>and God replied<br><br>15 But the LORD said to him, "Not so [e] ; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. 16 So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, [f] east of Eden.<br><br>So who else apart from them 3 would kill Cain? Is there anyone else?<br><br>And<br><br>verse 17<br><br>17 Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.<br><br>Where did the wife came from?

            <div class='col-md body'>One school of thought is that the Genesis 1 account of creation is different from Genesis 2 account.<br><br>In Genesis 1:27-28<br><span style="font-style: italic;">So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.<br>God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground." </span><br>This group of human just went out to the earth and populate it.<br><br>In Genesis 2:7-8<br><span style="font-style: italic;">the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. </span><br>This man is Adam and the account that follows is about Eve, Cain, Abel and Seth.<br><br>It is quite obvious that in Genesis 4:14 that there are other humans in the vicinity.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me." </span><br>It is unlikely, from the implication of this verse, that these people mentioned by Cain are other offsprings of Adam and Eve.<br><br>There are many opinions as to HOW Genesis is to be read:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Literal?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Figurative?<br><br>My personal opinion is that there are two groups of people, one the general population of earth, and the other, a special chosen group tasked to look after the gardenof eden who did not do a good job. It is also my opinion that this special group is written figuratively, ie, representing the people of God who has chosen to disobeyed Him.<br><br>...but as someone else has said, go talk to your pastor (assuming you attend church), and I don't believe any pastor worth his salt will turn you away.</div>
