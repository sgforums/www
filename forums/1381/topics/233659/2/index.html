            <div class='col-md body'>A word of note .. Catholics actually have pretty good understanding of Genesis. I have this impression from the exchange with Catholics here.<br><br>Anyway the Catholic understanding of Genesis has always been allegorical. Which is why you don't see the Pope rallying against evolution and big bang.<br><br>In fact, the theory of evolution wasn't exactly new in 1859 (publication of Origin of Species). The Catholic Church actually tolerated evolutionistic thinking before Darwin.</div>

U can try to make it right but if in the end it is wrong despite efforts then do we still carry on ?

If I do not have knowledge of good and evil doesn't mean I do not do evil. I may still create a lot of evil and sin but without caring and knowing it is wrong. Just like the snake is evil into making eve eat the fruit when it itself does not know wat is good end evil. When we know wat is good and evil, we try to prevent ourselves from committing evil and sin, (such as covering themselves with leaves when they thought being naked is "bad" ) tis in a way is good for "goodness".
