            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Question: "What does the Bible say about tattoos / body piercings?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>The Old Testament law commanded the Israelites, “Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Leviticus%2019.28"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Leviticus 19:28</span></span></a>). So, even though believers today are not under the Old Testament law (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%2010.4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 10:4</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Galatians%203.23-25"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Galatians 3:23-25</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%202.15"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 2:15</span></span></a>), the fact that there was a command against tattoos should raise some questions. The New Testament does not say anything about whether or not a believer should get a tattoo.<br><br>In relation to tattoos and body piercings, a good test is to determine whether we can honestly, in good conscience, ask God to bless and use that particular activity for His own good purposes. “So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Corinthians%2010.31"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Corinthians 10:31</span></span></a>). The New Testament does not command against tattoos or body piercings, but it also does not give us any reason to believe God would have us get tattoos or body piercings.<br><br>An important scriptural principle on issues the Bible does not specifically address is if there is room for doubt whether it pleases God, then it is best not to engage in that activity. <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%2014.23"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 14:23</span></span></a> reminds us that anything that does not come from faith is sin. We need to remember that our bodies, as well as our souls, have been redeemed and belong to God. Although <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Corinthians%206.19-20"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</span></span></a> does not directly apply to tattoos or body piercings, it does give us a principle: “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.” This great truth should have a real bearing on what we do and where we go with our bodies. If our bodies belong to God, we should make sure we have His clear “permission” before we “mark them up” with tattoos or body piercings.<br><br><strong>Recommended Resource: </strong><a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?event=AFF&amp;p=1011693&amp;item_no=457646"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">How to Make Choices You Won't Regret by Arthur, Lawson, &amp; Lawson</span></span></a>.</p></div>

              <p>Depends on how you argue it.</p>
              <p>I used to be in the strident anti-tattoo camp but of late have soften my stance quite a bit.</p>
              <p>The way I understand it, the original context of the verse was that the practice of branding and tattooing in the old days had a lot of religious significance to the pagan practices and religions, ala. not unlike a traditional tribal tattoo in some places. Tattooing nowadays is done for rather different purposes.</p>
              <p>So tough call. </p>
              <p>Personally I think God is more interested in if a person is honest and has integrity and all that then if he has tattoos, just my humble opinion.</p>

              <p>That argument has been used before.</p>
              <p>The problem is that how far do you take it? Some people believe that to put any kind of makeup, hair colour, or anything that even alters the body a bit is bad.</p>
              <p>No braces for your teeth, because that would often involve removing perfectly healthy teeth to make just straight teeth. Is that really necessary?</p>
              <p>My point is not to argue for pro-or-anti tattoos, but to point out that the issue is not so simple to put down in black and white.</p>
              <p>My take? Everyone should be truly convinced in their own mind what they are doing is the right thing, and stick to that conviction. We should learn to live with each other even if we do not fully agree. That would be a more powerful witness then being worried about what is on somebody's skin. </p>
