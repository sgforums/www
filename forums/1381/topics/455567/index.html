              <p>In the first place, is it true that Christians must preach about tithing? The answer is NO.</p>
              <p>The church, and even some Christians, may require you to tithe, but the Bible does not. Man may say you must tithe, but God did not lay down such a requirement. At the end of the day, we must obey God rather than man.</p>

              <p>TCMC,</p>
              <p>Yea but most churches in singapore do preach into people's face that god wants them to tithe to show obedience.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the tithing thing is in the bible, so it makes it very easy for pastors to say "OBEY GOD'S WORD"</p>

              The point is that believers need to know how to discern what man says from what God says. Unfortunately the average churchgoer is not well equipped to exegete Scripture.

              <p>Well, fact is the bible does say to give 10% of possessions/fruits.</p>
              <p>So probably this verse should be removed if it isnt applicable anymore? What exactly in the OT isnt applicable, may I ask? Everything? Or some parts?</p>

                  have you spoken or seen god before? no right?  coz no one ever did.  at least no one can prove he did.
                  
                  you believe in the bible.  how did you know the bible is from god?  coz a man from the past said so and the thing just pass down until you heard it.  
                  
                  so can you discern what a man says from what god says?
                  
                  all religions start with a man who claimed it is from god.
              
              P.S. that doesnt mean i think there is no god.

              A contradiction means holding A and non-A to be true at the same time in the same sense. Please show how what I said constituted a contradiction.
              
              No I have not heard God speak audibly. But God has spoken through the Bible. You may not believe that but I do. I can share with you why but I doubt you are interested.
              
              BTW, if you are thinking that there may be a God, then why is it not possible for God to communicate to us through men aka prophets or other chosen people?
