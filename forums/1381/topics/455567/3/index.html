              Religion and govt do not mix? Are all those in government positions atheists? Of course not. It is as absurd as saying that science and religion do not mix. Not all scientists are atheists. 
              
              <p>And who says religion has no right at all? The Singapore Constitution protects those rights. And should the govt make requests that goes against God or one's religious rights or convictions, there is always the avenue of civil disobedience, not to be confused with militant rebellion.</p>

              <p>I just observe that it's very rare for 
              Christians to possess great reasoning skills because there is a tendency
               to use scripture, even (!), to justify certain behavior as faith acts 
              when they are clearly out of the realm of sound common sense.</p>
              <p>The Bible is perfect, but our interpretation and our reading of it may not.</p>
              <p>Church history has shown that some applications of the Word (or lack of
               understanding) create more problems than the good it intended. Despite 
              good intentions, they fail. Good example? Alcohol and The Prohibition in
               the USA. It resulted in more bad than good.</p>
              <p>You know... I suspect you are very much in the organic church movement, which I'll come back to, later.</p>
              <p>I guess my question IS very much related to the thread at hand 
              where a church like CHC definitely practice some sort of top-down 
              authority structure where submission is a big deal. Nobody wants to 
              report on a potentially boo-boo. And they can't, unless they are willing
               to be ridiculed in the open and risk losing the support group and 
              friends you have made over a span of time.</p>
              <p>I previously come from another megachurch, and I have a big 
              problem with submission there. I never thought it was a problem, until I
               started serving and started being considered for leadership. In this 
              church I was formerly in, there are 2 standards - 1 for the common 
              congregation where there is abundant grace and no "legal" standards or 
              any expectations are meted out on you. But when you become a leader and 
              serving, everything changes.</p>
              <p>It brought out the worst in me.</p>
              <p>It was also a culture shock for me and it made me doubt 
              everything about the church, because I couldn't accept an unconditional 
              submission. Not only that, there were plenty of opportunities for abuse, 
              mis-guidance and unaccountable things like running your life and 
              hijacking your decision making-process in matters such as (career 
              choice, which company to join, who to date in church, etc.). It was messy!</p>
              <p>And so began my journey - with the current news about CHC, it 
              made me think about this even more. While the verdict isn't out yet on 
              KH and the others, controversy has a way of getting our attention and 
              creating a situation where we need to ask questions what we previously 
              took for granted.</p>
              <p>I even attended an organic church, but instead I
               found that there might be some things about submission to authority 
              that might be legit. I found out that despite having a lack of named 
              authority structure in organic churches, there IS still an unspoken 
              respect for the "cell leader"/"senior pastor" of that group. There are 
              clear unspoken rules of conduct and a very distinct and clear 
              recognition of the "leader of the group / "alpha male" of the "pack" / 
              "captain of the ship". It was no different from the previous situation. 
              It doesn't matter if there are titles or not, but the fact remains that 
              the structure still exist in an organic church setting - hence, like 
              certain unchangeable things explained in the Bible, I find by 
              observation, that authority and structure do exist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The
               issue of the "curse" from non-compliance to submission to elders in 
              church and being outside the covering... Well, let's just say: I'm not 
              doing too hot right now. but I wonder if it was a self-fulfilled 
              prophecy arising from pre-programmed expectation/conditioning of my 
              sub-conscious to self-sabotage. I find it VERY difficult to reconcile it
               all.</p>
              <p>At the moment, I am at another church, trying to get a second 
              opinion. But I am PRETTY SURE that this church also practices submission
               one way or another just by observation. So, as an added precaution, I 
              am avoiding close contact with the leaders there and only mixing around 
              with 1 or 2 folks who aren't too "on fire" with God. If I'm not serving 
              or too involved in a group, I cannot have any chance of trangressing 
              "submission". It's the safest option.</p>
              <p>As you can see, it didn't produce the right fruit of Christian Submission in its true spirit.
               I'm just messing around with the legal loopholes (if I'm not serving or
               fully involvde in a small group, I'm not legally obliged to submit; and
               there are PLENTY of "lukewarm" church goers. If I should be penalized, 
              they shall also be penalized and I doubt any leader will come out and 
              make a sweeping expectation on them to "submit". They can only 
              "encourage" participation and "encourage" certain behavior, but NOT 
              ENFORCE it.)</p>
              <p>And with a thing like submission - it gives a person tremendous power - and so the opportunity for power struggles, envy and jealousy.
               (am reminded of the arugment of "who is the greatest?" among the 
              disciples in the Gospels. Servant-leadership preached by churches are 
              only a theory rarely an application I observed. Only on the lower rungs 
              of the church ladder or some leader in some obscure ministry within the 
              church who is truly free from encumbrances of self-congratulatory 
              servanthood.)</p>
              <p>It sucks, because it seems like any little 
              thing is liable for other to be rubbed the wrong way and cause one to be
               cast out and isolated in a small group. There's always a few who

               experience.</p>
              <p>What are your thoughts? And what do you think the wise thing to do for a person in my current situation.</p>
              <p>I know you have a high

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just observe that it's very rare for Christians to possess
              great reasoning skills because there is a tendency to use
              scripture, even (!), to justify certain behavior as faith acts when
              they are clearly out of the realm of sound common sense.</p>
              <p>The Bible is perfect, but our interpretation and our reading of
              it may not.</p>
              <p>Church history has shown that some applications of the Word (or
              lack of understanding) create more problems than the good it
              intended. Despite good intentions, they fail. Good example? Alcohol
              and The Prohibition in the USA. It resulted in more bad than
              good.</p>
              <p>You know... I suspect you are very much in the organic church
              movement, which I'll come back to, later.</p>
              <p>I guess my question IS very much related to the thread at hand
              where a church like CHC definitely practice some sort of top-down
              authority structure where submission is a big deal. Nobody wants to
              report on a potentially boo-boo. And they can't, unless they are
              willing to be ridiculed in the open and risk losing the support
              group and friends you have made over a span of time.</p>
              <p>I previously come from another megachurch, and I have a big
              problem with submission there. I never thought it was a problem,
              until I started serving and started being considered for
              leadership. In this church I was formerly in, there are 2 standards
              - 1 for the common congregation where there is abundant grace and
              no "legal" standards or any expectations are meted out on you. But
              when you become a leader and serving, everything changes.</p>
              <p>It brought out the worst in me.</p>
              <p>It was also a culture shock for me and it made me doubt
              everything about the church, because I couldn't accept an
              unconditional submission. Not only that, there were plenty of
              opportunities for abuse, mis-guidance and unaccountable things like
              running your life and hijacking your decision making-process in
              matters such as (career choice, which company to join, who to date
              in church, etc.). It was messy!</p>
              <p>And so began my journey - with the current news about CHC, it
              made me think about this even more. While the verdict isn't out yet
              on KH and the others, controversy has a way of getting our
              attention and creating a situation where we need to ask questions
              what we previously took for granted.</p>
              <p>I even attended an organic church, but instead I found that
              there might be some things about submission to authority that might
              be legit. I found out that despite having a lack of named authority
              structure in organic churches, there IS still an unspoken respect
              for the "cell leader"/"senior pastor" of that group. There are
              clear unspoken rules of conduct and a very distinct and clear
              recognition of the "leader of the group / "alpha male" of the
              "pack" / "captain of the ship". It was no different from the
              previous situation. It doesn't matter if there are titles or not,
              but the fact remains that the structure still exist in an organic
              church setting - hence, like certain unchangeable things explained
              in the Bible, I find by observation, that authority and structure
              do exist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The issue of the "curse" from non-compliance to submission to
              elders in church and being outside the covering... Well, let's just
              say: I'm not doing too hot right now. but I wonder if it was a
              self-fulfilled prophecy arising from pre-programmed
              expectation/conditioning of my sub-conscious to self-sabotage. I
              find it VERY difficult to reconcile it all.</p>
              <p>At the moment, I am at another church, trying to get a second
              opinion. But I am PRETTY SURE that this church also practices
              submission one way or another just by observation. So, as an added
              precaution, I am avoiding close contact with the leaders there and
              only mixing around with 1 or 2 folks who aren't too "on fire" with
              God. If I'm not serving or too involved in a group, I cannot have
              any chance of trangressing "submission". It's the safest
              option.</p>
              <p>As you can see, it didn't produce the right fruit of Christian
              Submission in its true spirit. I'm just messing around with the
              legal loopholes (if I'm not serving or fully involvde in a small
              group, I'm not legally obliged to submit; and there are PLENTY of
              "lukewarm" church goers. If I should be penalized, they shall also
              be penalized and I doubt any leader will come out and make a
              sweeping expectation on them to "submit". They can only "encourage"
              participation and "encourage" certain behavior, but NOT ENFORCE
              it.)</p>
              <p>And with a thing like submission - it gives a person tremendous
              power - and so the opportunity for power struggles, envy and
              jealousy. (am reminded of the arugment of "who is the greatest?"
              among the disciples in the Gospels. Servant-leadership preached by
              churches are only a theory rarely an application I observed. Only
              on the lower rungs of the church ladder or some leader in some
              obscure ministry within the church who is truly free from
              encumbrances of self-congratulatory servanthood.)</p>
              <p>It sucks, because it seems like any little thing is liable for
              other to be rubbed the wrong way and cause one to be cast out and
              isolated in a small group. There's always a few who dominate and I
              let them do it. It's simply too risky to come out and participate
              in the things of God in a deeper way, because there is always a

              or non-grace based church, it doesn't matter. At least this is my

              <p>Thank you for sharing so much so freely.</p>
              <p>I
               agree with you that once you are in leadership position, things can be 
              very different. We can see things that we know should not be so. Somehow
               the pecking order so accepted in the corporate world does not seem to 
              fit into the church, but nevertheless many are of the view that there is
               simply no other way to do things, since the church today is very much 
              modeled after the corporate world.</p>
              <p>Unconditional submission to 
              church leaders is certainly foreign to the teaching of the New 
              Testament. Many feel uncomfortable with it yet they somehow lack the 
              information to counter proof texts like Heb 13:7 which are often used to
               silence any internal critic. Of course there is the much touted "Who is
               your covering?" that has guilt-tripped many believers into thinking 
              that if they do not have a leader lording over them then they are fodder
               for the devil's minions and out of protection and favour with God.</p>
              <p>Whether
               one is in an institutional church or an organic church, authority, 
              submission, leadership and structure are terms that one will come into 
              contact, but I submit that the concepts can be rather different. The 
              point is to recapture the NT meaning of these words and flesh them out 
              in our church life, something perhaps easier said then done. Leaders 
              exist in the organic churches but they are, and should be, functional, 
              not positional. One leads by example and maturity and faithfulness to 
              the teaching of the Word. The "structure" that exists in an organic 
              church is likened after the human body, and not that of the business 
              corporation. But so long as you find yourself in an institutional church
               setting, the corporate idea of bottom-up submission along the chain of 
              command is inevitable, and uncomfortable. I am of the view that when one
               tries to follow the Scripture and encounters problems, there are 
              Scriptural solutions to Scriptural "problems". But it is difficult to 
              solve modern church problems caused by adherence to a corporate model 
              using the solutions in the Scripture, simply because church in the NT 
              was never intended to be institutional and patterned after the corporate
               world.</p>
              <p>What should you do then? But if I may suggest this, that you take
               time to "rethink the wineskin" and form Biblical convictions about what
               church is. This would involve much reading (and I suspect you are 
              already doing that) and reflection. And let the Holy Spirit guide your 
              thoughts from there.</p>

              <p>What's even worse is when church like these are
               not only content to have spiritual/religious authority, but aspire to 
              gain civil/political influence in national politics and governance.</p>
              <p>In America, it's very obvious. In Singapore, such intentions are more subtly suggested.</p>
              <p>If
               you look around us, we aren't that much different from the Middle Ages 
              (aka the Dark Ages). The only mainstream form of Christianity available 
              at that time were also very much into making a big prosperity statement 
              with large buildings and gold-foiled sculptures/art. Wars in the name of
               God were made - the "greater good" the "net gain" was justified. There 
              were big frienships/alliances with governments (kings, monarchs and 
              nobles rather) so much that only oppression, tyranny and serfdom were 
              the result.</p>
              <p>I do think we are not that much different from those 
              times considering the structure and organization of religious group and 
              society in general.</p>
              <p>And if Solomon's words "That which has been, is that which will 
              be" is anything to go by, there is a VERY big chance that Islam will 
              rise again - a "new Ottomon" empire so to speak. In my personal opinion, it isn't necessarily a bad thing, since in the OT that was God's way of calling leaders into accountability who failed to lead people well, but pursued their own agenda instead.</p>
              <p>And in history, only 
              after the Ottomon's rise and fall, would a new Renaissance and a new Reformation
               happen, where someone like Luther would radically preach that 
              submission to the clergy is unnecessary in a relationship to God 
              (particularly  Salvation, in Luther's context - "the just by faith shall 
              live").</p>

              a big prosperity statement with large buildings and gold-foiled
              sculptures/art. Wars in the name of God were made - the "greater
              good" the "net gain" was justified. There were big
              frienships/alliances with governments (kings, monarchs and nobles
              rather) so much that only oppression, tyranny and serfdom were the
              result.</p>
              <p>I do think we are not that much different from those times
              considering the structure and organization of religious group and
              society in general.</p>
              <p>And if Solomon's words "That which has been, is that which will
              be" is anything to go by, there is a VERY big chance that Islam
              will rise again - a "new Ottomon" empire so to speak. In my
              personal opinion, it isn't necessarily a bad thing, since in the OT
              that was God's way of calling leaders into accountability who
              failed to lead people well, but pursued their own agenda
              instead.</p>
              <p>And in history, only after the Ottomon's rise and fall, would a
              new Renaissance and a new Reformation happen, where someone like
              Luther would radically preach that submission to the clergy is
              unnecessary in a relationship to God (particularly  Salvation,
              in Luther's context - "the just by faith shall live").</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thank you for sharing so much so freely.</p>
              <p>I agree with you that once you are in leadership position,
              things can be very different. We can see things that we know should
              not be so. Somehow the pecking order so accepted in the corporate
              world does not seem to fit into the church, but nevertheless many
              are of the view that there is simply no other way to do things,
              since the church today is very much modeled after the corporate
              world.</p>
              <p>Unconditional submission to church leaders is certainly foreign
              to the teaching of the New Testament. Many feel uncomfortable with
              it yet they somehow lack the information to counter proof texts
              like Heb 13:7 which are often used to silence any internal critic.
              Of course there is the much touted "Who is your covering?" that has
              guilt-tripped many believers into thinking that if they do not have
              a leader lording over them then they are fodder for the devil's
              minions and out of protection and favour with God.</p>
              <p>Whether one is in an institutional church or an organic church,
              authority, submission, leadership and structure are terms that one
              will come into contact, but I submit that the concepts can be
              rather different. The point is to recapture the NT meaning of these
              words and flesh them out in our church life, something perhaps
              easier said then done. Leaders exist in the organic churches but
              they are, and should be, functional, not positional. One leads by
              example and maturity and faithfulness to the teaching of the Word.
              The "structure" that exists in an organic church is likened after
              the human body, and not that of the business corporation. But so
              long as you find yourself in an institutional church setting, the
              corporate idea of bottom-up submission along the chain of command
              is inevitable, and uncomfortable. I am of the view that when one
              tries to follow the Scripture and encounters problems, there are
              Scriptural solutions to Scriptural "problems". But it is difficult
              to solve modern church problems caused by adherence to a corporate
              model using the solutions in the Scripture, simply because church
              in the NT was never intended to be institutional and patterned
              after the corporate world.</p>
              <p>What should you do then? But if I may suggest this, that you
              take time to "rethink the wineskin" and form Biblical convictions
              about what church is. This would involve much reading (and I
              suspect you are already doing that) and reflection. And let the
              Holy Spirit guide your thoughts from there.</p>

              <p>George Barna. I was thinking about his book... Based on the reviews 
              and some synopsis found online, he seems to know something about the 
              current phenomenon. The fact that many people think that those who leave
               church are "backsliders" could not be further from the truth. Many of 
              them who leave are those who have been around (many served as leaders 
              and pastors).</p>
              <p>These days, I spend more time reading secular books on Political Science than anything.</p>
              <p>The
               origins of America being founded on Christianity has 2 different 
              opposing arguments. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson weren't 
              Christians at all. Many of these historical people have links to 
              FreeMasonry - a cult and in my opinion something you run from as far as 
              you can. (You can see Freemasonry symbols on American dollar bills in 
              the form of the pyramid and "the all seeing eye") George Washington's 
              faith is still a matter of debate. Only Abe Lincoln was a Christian 
              (only after his son had died) and even then his views are opposed to the
               mainstream church *in his time* - e.g. slavery. As Lincoln fought 
              against the Confederate Army - the Confederates claimed God's will were 
              on their side, while the Union did too also.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, America being founded on Christian principles 
              happened NOT in the way most people thought how (or the way most 
              preachers said how). It happened precisely in the conditions as I 
              described in my previous post where Serfdom was rife in medieval Europe.</p>
              <p>Because of the monopolising of lands and privileges occured only
               within the monarchs and religious authorities (and these 2 were pretty 
              much "friends" - the church and the king was one big gentleman's club), 
              the ONLY way a person, ANY person, can break out of the poverty cycle 
              was to be "free". Free in the sense, he was free buy and own land and 
              run a business without having to lobby and be friends with the 
              nobles/monarchs and the religious elite. He was free to innovate and be 
              inventive and eat off the fruits of his labor without having new laws 
              being arbitrary meted out to cancel his economic advantage due to his 
              enterprising spirit.</p>
              <p>Because the idea that all men are created 
              equal under the eyes of God in Reformation Theology, they are liberated 
              (not just from the 10 commandment and the OT, but also liberated from 
              hierarchical systems where a human mediator is needed - none of those 
              things matter. Jesus is the Mediator and the whole notion of the 
              "Mandate of Heaven" being given to a ruling class is nullified), these 
              new Reformed believers went to America and started a new life, AWAY from
               the previous system.</p>
              <p>Hence, the whole idea of the free market 
              system. A (true) capitalist society was born, where each man was free to
               do trade and exchange as equals (rather than needing the privilege of a
               social standing to do so); and if any man was not happy with the price,
               he could well choose an alternative, thereby allowing the the free 
              market economic equilibrium to work its magic. I.e. Prices correct 
              itself without any intervention.</p>
              <p>The Constitution of America 
              provided such an environment where each man is no longer viewed and 
              given privileges because of his social class and family background, but 
              is free to pursue his "own happiness" - i.e. to pursue a trade or a 
              business and be responsible for all the risks in his undertaking that he
               chooses. Because of this, if a man was inventive and made scientific 
              discoveries he could very well make money and prosper without the fear 
              that the rich and powerful is going to come and take it unfairly from 
              him.</p>
              <p>Contrast that to Medieval Europe, you could not do that. People 
              were afraid to be inventive and independent, they were afraid to have 
              contrarian views (for invention and discoveries are all about having a 
              different view of the status quo - Gallileo couldn't openly publish his 
              views since the church told him to shut up). Hence the idea of "freedom"
               and "libery" are big champions of American prosperity, and to say it 
              caused America's initial prosperity is correct. In those days "freedom" 
              didn't really mean "I could mouth off someone's mother because it is my 
              'freedom'".</p>
              <p>Given the econo-political context, freedom was a 
              different idea then compared to today. It was a big idea.. It was also a 
              Christian one. " Whom the Son sets free, is free indeed" - John 8:36, 
              "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" - 2 Corinthians 3:17</p>

              <p>My previous megachurch pastor argued with the  "Paul got smart" argument (Paul later used the "I am a Roman citizen" privilege escape persecution and lived to spread the Word).</p>
              <p>He argues that just because the early church was persecuted and the early church was very simple, it didn't mean that the contemporary church had to be. The church (like Paul) as it "progressed" got smart. We used certain privileges to "escape". For Paul, it was Roman Citizenship, for the contemporary church - being big and prosperous and having a lot of supporting amenities that isn't too far from secular life - No ascetism.</p>
              <p>For me, my idea of church is much simpler and it's based mainly on 2 scriptures.</p>
              <p>1. "Where 2 or more are gathered IN MY NAME, there I am in the midst of them"</p>
              <p>2. "Jacob called that place Bethel"</p>
              <p>Jacob encountered God's presence and called the place Bethel , which means House of God. 2 things must be present - 1. God's presence and 2. Two believers coming together in love and *consciously* acknowledging/seeking God is already a church - Building or no building. (Two believers coming together to socialize to talk about movies doesn't count. Two believers coming to church but can't wait for the service to be over and have a can't be bothered attitude about the things of God, also doesn't count).</p>

              of the poverty cycle was to be "free". Free in the sense, he was
              free buy and own land and run a business without having to lobby
              and be friends with the nobles/monarchs and the religious elite. He
              was free to innovate and be inventive and eat off the fruits of his
              labor without having new laws being arbitrary meted out to cancel
              his economic advantage due to his enterprising spirit.</p>
              <p>Because the idea that all men are created equal under the eyes
              of God in Reformation Theology, they are liberated (not just from
              the 10 commandment and the OT, but also liberated from hierarchical
              systems where a human mediator is needed - none of those things
              matter. Jesus is the Mediator and the whole notion of the "Mandate
              of Heaven" being given to a ruling class is nullified), these new
              Reformed believers went to America and started a new life, AWAY
              from the previous system.</p>
              <p>Hence, the whole idea of the free market system. A (true)
              capitalist society was born, where each man was free to do trade
              and exchange as equals (rather than needing the privilege of a
              social standing to do so); and if any man was not happy with the
              price, he could well choose an alternative, thereby allowing the
              the free market economic equilibrium to work its magic. I.e. Prices
              correct itself without any intervention.</p>
              <p>The Constitution of America provided such an environment where
              each man is no longer viewed and given privileges because of his
              social class and family background, but is free to pursue his "own
              happiness" - i.e. to pursue a trade or a business and be
              responsible for all the risks in his undertaking that he chooses.
              Because of this, if a man was inventive and made scientific
              discoveries he could very well make money and prosper without the
              fear that the rich and powerful is going to come and take it
              unfairly from him.</p>
              <p>Contrast that to Medieval Europe, you could not do that. People
              were afraid to be inventive and independent, they were afraid to
              have contrarian views (for invention and discoveries are all about
              having a different view of the status quo - Gallileo couldn't
              openly publish his views since the church told him to shut up).
              Hence the idea of "freedom" and "libery" are big champions of
              American prosperity, and to say it caused America's initial
              prosperity is correct. In those days "freedom" didn't really mean
              "I could mouth off someone's mother because it is my
              'freedom'".</p>
              <p>Given the econo-political context, freedom was a different idea
              then compared to today. It was a big idea.. It was also a Christian
              one. " Whom the Son sets free, is free indeed" - John 8:36, "Where
              the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" - 2 Corinthians
              3:17</p>

              towards the former. But I suppose this is a topic for another forum.</p>

              <p>My previous megachurch pastor argued with the  "Paul got
              smart" argument (Paul later used the "I am a Roman citizen"
              privilege escape persecution and lived to spread the Word).</p>
              <p>He argues that just because the early church was persecuted and
              the early church was very simple, it didn't mean that the
              contemporary church had to be. The church (like Paul) as it
              "progressed" got smart. We used certain privileges to "escape". For
              Paul, it was Roman Citizenship, for the contemporary church - being
              big and prosperous and having a lot of supporting amenities that
              isn't too far from secular life - No ascetism.</p>
              <p>For me, my idea of church is much simpler and it's based mainly
              on 2 scriptures.</p>
              <p>1. "Where 2 or more are gathered IN MY NAME, there I am in the
              midst of them"</p>
              <p>2. "Jacob called that place Bethel"</p>
              <p>Jacob encountered God's presence and called the place Bethel ,
              which means House of God. 2 things must be present - 1. God's
              presence and 2. Two believers coming together in love and
              *consciously* acknowledging/seeking God is already a church -
              Building or no building. (Two believers coming together to
              socialize to talk about movies doesn't count. Two believers coming
              to church but can't wait for the service to be over and have a
              can't be bothered attitude about the things of God, also doesn't
              count).</p>

              <p>Persecution in the early church was largely sporadic and localised and due mainly to Jewish leaders' instigation but one must noticed that even before severe imperial persecution arose many decades later the church was already "organised" as simple functioning house churches for at least the first 300 years.

              <p>Personally I avoid using the label "House of God" for a church. Problem is that it conveys the idea that the church is a place, a venue, a building. Such a notion is foreign to the NT even though the NT teaches that the church is a living temple (or spiritual house) made up of living stones. I also avoid using the phrase "go to church" for the same reason.</p>
