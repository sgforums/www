              <p>This is a logical question. If God made his wishes so hard to

              I do not deny that there are Bible passages that are difficult, but these are in the minority and are not centred around the core tenets of the faith. The Bible is written for our instruction so it is not out of reach to believers, but then diligence is required in order to rightly divide the Word of God.

              <p>Then the obvious problem is that you think you are authoritative
              enough to interpret the bible, and someone will claim the same and
              interpret it differently. If God truly means for us to receive his
              word without contradiction, let him speak directly.</p>

              I claim no authority of my own, but as children of God believers have the right to access God's Word amd read them and interpret them. God's Word is the authority, not man. God has spoken through His Word. Jesus told the unrepentent rich man that if his brothers would not listen to Moses i.e. the OT, then they will not listen even if someone comes back from the dead. God has come in the flesh and directly taught man to man, that is as direct as you can get. The teachings He gave were to be passed down to faithful men who would in turn teach others. These teachings can be found in the Bible.

              <p><br>doesnt it dawn on you that the bible, old and new testament, were illogic and incoherent?</p>
              <p>quote you an example, scapegoating and sacrifises. think of the 10 commandments, thou shall not kill? it is ok to sacrifise, but not ok to kill? contradictory and inconsistent? u bet.</p>

              <p>Tithing is part of Old testament law that was done away  with when Jesus fulfilled the Law and on the cross He said "It is finished". Jesus did not tithe. Jesus gave no commandment to tithe. The 12 disciples did not tithe. The New Testament writers, apostles and early Church Christians did not tithe. They gave no command to tithe.</p>
              <p>Tithing came into being at the time of Constantine, the Roman Emperor and is based on Catholic indulgences. It operates by fear. IF you don't tithe the pulpit pimps say God will curse you.</p>
              <p>Friends, God does not give a rats about your money. He ain't interested! It's only con men like Phil Pringle, Kong Hee's mentor and advisor, and KH who twist scriptures and rip money off their pew warmers.Effectively they are not pastors but cult leaders.</p>
              <p>God is more interested in you believing on His slavation for you and you loving Him with your heart.</p>

              <p>The church, and even some Christians, may require you to tithe, but the Bible does not. Man may say you must tithe, but God did not lay down such a requirement. At the end of the day, we must obey God rather than man.</p>

              <p>Sorry I don't get your point, how did I contradict?</p>
              <p>Why do you find fault with my statements? Isn't it true that there is no must to preach tithing? Fact is that there are believers who do not believe that tithing is mandatory at all.  People misinterpret God's Word for a host of reasons, there is no inevitableness or must about it. While it is a fact that man can and has misinterpret God's Word, it is not true that man must misinterpret Gods Wprd</p>

              <p>Is the Bible really silent on tax? No. Jesus said to give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And Paul said that we must obey the govt, so long as obedience does not require us to go against God. Neither is the Bible silent on being faithful stewards or dealing honestly with each other. The Bible does not address every life circumstance but it provides moral guidance that can address every life circumstance.</p>
