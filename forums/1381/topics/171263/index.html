Doubt is not the opposite of faith. ItÂ’s opposite is unbelief.<br><br>Mt 14:31 And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, "<strong>O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"</strong><br><br>They had faith alright but they had doubts. Doubts can be sinful or just due to ignorance and lack of knowledge. Moral doubt is due to unbelief while intellectual doubt is due to our limited minds that canÂ’t seem to grasp and comprehend.<br><br><strong>Signs of faith:</strong><br><br>1)	it manifests in our motives<br><br>The Lord Jesus Christ brought salvation and forgiveness of sins on the cross. Having trusted in Him and what He did on the cross, I do good works and obey His commandments not with the motive that I would be saved and forgiven but to show my gratitude and love to Him for saving me.<br><br>2)	it shows in your perspectives<br><br>There are times that we feel alone and scared. Our feelings says: Â‘you are aloneÂ…..panic!!!!!!!!!!!Â’ Faith says: Â‘stay calmÂ…Â…Â….stay focusedÂ…Â…..keep your composureÂ…Â…Â….God will never leave you nor forsake you He promised.Â’ With His promise on my mind [having faith in it], I get a new perspective: Â“Ah yesÂ…Â…Â…..i am not alone though my feelings says other wise.Â’ [peace]<br><br>3)	it shows in your works<br><br>Noah built the ark even though the seeming improbability of  a world wide flood from happening [at least to the human point of view]. He made the ark, trusting, having faith in what God had said than on his own understandin<br></div>
