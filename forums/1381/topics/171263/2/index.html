            <div class='col-md body'><br>Actaully, there are two kinds of faith:<br><br>1) Natural faith and  2) Divine faith<br><br>natural faith --everybody has it. We hail a taxi cab and we board in trusting, having faith that the driver would take us to our destination. We are diagnosed with an ailment that entails surgery........we submit ourselves to the surgeon's skillful hand trusting that he will do well.<br><br>We take medications prescribed by the doctor believing and trusting in him that he means well and wants us to get well.<br><br>Divine faith-- on the other hand is a faith not found in unregenerated man. It is a gift from God. True faith means that we have seen our helplessness with regards to salvation and convicts us of our sin and makes us embrace what Christ has done.<br><br>True faith is just an enlightened eye. 1) it sees our helplessnes 2) it sees our depravity 3) it sees Christ as Savior. The reason why true faith endures to the end and keeps on seeing Christ [number 3] is because it keeps on seeing 1 and 2.<br><br>True faith says: "i will never let go of Christ because ever before me i see my helplessness with regards to salvation and the sin that is in me."<br><br></div>

That is, if they really sought God.<br><br>There are testimonies of missionaries going out on a mission for the aborigines [tribal primitive people] who know nothing about the Lord Jesus but have sought out God. They claim that they eagerly recieved the gospel when they first heard it....claiming that they knew something of a God like they preached long before.<br><br>if you are a muslim doing with all sincerity the things that are good in your religion........ sincerely and ignorantly believing that Allah is the one true God, God in time will respond by sending you the gospel that you will be saved and know the truth, just like in Cornelius' case.</div>

I brought this up but ppl didnt understand what i was saying but that's all in the past. Pls forget what i said. Thanks &amp; God bless.<br><br>In revelations, many books were opened besides the book of life at the great white throne judgement. See for yourself in rev. But for those who have heard gospel, no chance unless God intervenes in some way or other. Anyway, we arent saved by good works so some ppl might be saved &amp; they know it inside them but they never say.</div>
