              <p>read the gospels, then read Romans. then genesis</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">read about Jesus' divine birth,</span> How God loved us so much, He rather give up His precious only begotten Son than to be seperated from us for eternity.</p>
              <p>Read about how Jesus, leaving the glory of heaven, and becoming a small cell in a woman's womb. How Jesus leaving the splendor of heaven, and becoming a human baby in a cold, damp, smelly manger in a stable.</p>
              <p>From needing absolutely nothing, to needing air, food, water, warm clothes, and salts for his tired feet.</p>
              <p>From being everywhere, going anywhere, at anytime, to being limited in movement, going only where his feet and stamina can take him.</p>
              <p>From being the ultimate authority of the universe, to submiting to human authority, meeting the demands of cranky customers at his carpentry shop who wanted everything yesterday, but can't pay for anything until tomorrow.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read about Jesus' life and ministry</span>, His passion, His grace, His love to all sinners. Read about his declaration about himself, how he condemned the hypocricy of religious leaders and reached out a loving hand to a woman who lived a life of sin whom they were about to stone and kill.</p>
              <p>Read about how he searches the hearts of those who seek him, affirms the discouraged, heal the sick, comfort the sorrowful, and protect the shamed.</p>
              <p>Read about how he delivered his messages of love and peace, and watch how he delivered those who are demonically oppressed.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">While you're reading about his divinity, read about his humanity,</span> he suffered hunger, loss, sadness, joy, fear, abandonment, and death.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read about his death</span>, every painful stroke of the whip tearing into his flesh, tearing apart his back. The crown of thorns crueling shoved into his face, before the roman soldiers forced him to drag the crushing weight of the cross on his torned back. Read about how the soldiers abused Jesus, despite only being given the order to whip him. How they played games with Jesus, punching him and asking him to guess who did it, spitting on his face, an act not to injure the body, but injure the soul.</p>
              <p>and then finally, hear the thud of each stroke of the heavy hammer driving the coarse nail into God's hand.</p>
              <p>Read about how Jesus, hanging from the cross at the top of the mountain surrounded by demons all around, choose to stay silent, while legions of angels were begging to Christ to just speak the word, and they would immediately be at his side, to save him and destroy all who laid a hand on him.</p>
              <p>And hear the resounding verdict in the hallowed halls of heaven, pronouncing the sins of every slut and sailor since Adam and Eve, and hear the cry of Jesus, weak, but victorious, proclaiming that "It is finished".</p>
              <p>Read about what happened to the temple at the point where Jesus finally died, the cloth seperating the tabanacle in the holy of holies (where God's presence resides) was torn into 2, from top to bottom, symbolizing that now, everyone who puts their faith in Jesus can come into the holy of holies without worrying about being slain for their sins.</p>
              <p>After reading about His death, go ahead and <span style="font-weight: bold;">read about His ressurection</span>, how death is trumphed. We have every reason to believe, to have hope, is because of Jesus' ressurrection.</p>
              <p>In the ancient times, a priest stands before God on behalf of the people, representing the people. If the priest was clean, the people are blessed, if the priest screwed up, the people miss out on God's blessings, as accordance to the old covenant, do good, get good, do bad, get beat.</p>
              <p>Read about how Jesus is now the high priest for all of us, forever perfect, forever holy, representing us. He understands all our problems, how exactly we feel when things go bad, and intercedes for us.</p>
              <p>essentially it's good to <span style="font-weight: bold;">read about the past in the old testament</span> also,</p>
              <p>from genesis, since Jesus fulfilled the laws, so u must understand how sin and the law came about, etc. and the bible says we inherit the blessings of abraham, so what was the covenant of abraham, why is he called a man of faith, despite him doing so many faithless things etc.</p>
              <p>read how the earth was created, how everything that God made was good. Remember that everything that God created is good. </p>
              <p>Read how satan fooled adam and eve into sinning against God, introducing sin into the world, and turned everything that God created to be good, to become bad.</p>
              <p>read and understand what does a covenant mean, why must the animal be slain, why must there be shedding of blood?</p>
              <p>read how moses led the israelites out of eygpt, reflecting how Jesus lead us out of bondage.</p>
              <p>read how God slowly, but surely prepared for Jesus' arrival all the way from genesis to matthew.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read how powerful God i</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">s</span>, with His mighty hand, toppling the tower of babel, splitting the red sea, ushering in the 10 plagues on eygpt, providing manna and quail, and with the same hand, opening up for the nail of the cross for our redemption because of his love which matches His power.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read about king david,</span> the man after God's heart, how his faith in God toppelled the giant goliath, how a sling and 5 stones rivaled against the babylonians who monopolized metal swords and weapons.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read about the wisdom of king solomo</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span>, the king who wrote the book of proverbs</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read psalms</span>, my current fav book.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read the epistles,</span> the book of letters by all the apostles to the growing churches.</p>
              <p>and when you're up for it, <span style="font-weight: bold;">read revelations</span>, how God is going to end it all and finally we will live with Him. We will be His people, and He will be our God.</p>
              <p>haha basically <span style="font-weight: bold;">read everything.</span> =)</p>
              <p>don't just read intellectually, read and pray, because God speaks to His children in a personal way. The bible is His love story for you.</p>

              <p>Lol @ the prosperity gospel thing..  all this person is asking is which to start with.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my opinion, Galations is a ideal starting ground. It builds the foundation for new believers. After htat, moving on to the four Gospels and then Romans , Corinthians, etc. First find out what belongs to you as a New Creation in Christ in the New Covenant before looking for the secrets in the Old Covenant.. Always read everything in context to Jesus and His finished work, and what other people might see as useless or cruel is actually God saying exactly how much He loves YOU. Imagine a magnifying glass over you and God's love is the sun. Yes, He loves everyone, even the atheist( infact he doesnt believe in atheists.. since there are no atheists on a sinking ship or a crashing plane..) , but as a Christian, God especially loves YOU.. </p>
              <p>Also, dont just simply read a bible, attend a church that preaches Jesus and Jesus and did i mention Jesus? For faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of Christ, but how shall they hear without a preacher? Therefore, attend a church and listen. The more you listen, the more faith grows. All Christians have faith, just like all humans have muscles..  Just how we grow them. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope i helped! ^^</p>

                                Welcome to Christianity. Don't worry about your past sins. Be true to what you believe so that you can see what you believe. It's only a matter of time when you are true to yourself and to God to see God involvement in your life and God doesn't wait until you're perfectly holy to be involved in your life. Try to ask for spiritual gifts not to make you feel special but to testify God in other people.
              
              Don't be afraid of anyone here sometimes the anti religion or should I say anti Christianity post their posts here to babble whatever things they want to babble about. 
              
              My God rocks this world how bout yours? lol

              <p>On the contrary . . . if I said to you there's a forumer with the username of AaHDKJASHDF7T46T7632T6TUBSADCSXC47\=`  and I gave to you his supposed posts would you believe me? even if I suceeded in convincing you, your confidence in it may waver easily since you really don't know such forumer yourself. You don't know AaHDKJASHDF7T46T7632T6TUBSADCSXC47\=` and you think the name is too long to be allowed.</p>
