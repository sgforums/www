              <p>you are born to read and undrstand plain english and hebrew explanation if necessary, so G-d is knd and explained His test to you, YES HE IS TESTING US, HE HAS ALREADY DECLARED. Just because someone pass you the "ROMANtic someone die for you sweet story doesnt even come near to the seriousness of G-d's words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Deuteronomy 18:15 </strong>A prophet from your
                                      midst, from your brethren, like me, shall HASHEM, your G-d,
                                      establish for you to him shall you hearken. [16] According to all
                                      that you asked of HASHEM, your G-d, in Horeb on the day of the
                                      congregation, saying, "I can no longer hear the voice of HASHEM, my
                                      G-d, and this great fire I can no longer see, so that I shall not
                                      die." [17] Then HASHEM said to me: They have done well in what they
                                      have said. [18] I will establish a prophet for them from among
                                      their brethren, like you, and I will place My words in his mouth;
                                      He shall speak to them everything that I will command him. [19] And
                                      it shall be that the man who will not hearken to My words that he
                                      shall speak in My name, I will exact from him, [20] But the prophet
                                      who willfully shall speak a word in My name, <span style="color: teal;"><strong>that which I have not commanded him to
                                      speak, or who shall speak in the name of the gods of
                                      others</strong></span> that prophet shall die. [21] When you
                                      say in your heart,<span style="color: teal;"><strong>":How can we
                                      know the word that HASHEM has not
                                      spoken?"</strong></span><strong> </strong>[22] If the prophet
                                      will speak in the Name of HASHEM and <span style="color: teal;"><strong>that thing will not occur and not come
                                      about</strong></span><strong> </strong>that is the word that
                                      HASHEM has not spoken; with willfulness has the prophet spoken it,
                                      you should not fear him. (Artscroll)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED CLEARLY, MAKE YOUR CHOICE. G-D DONT CONTRADICT IN SUCH SERIOUS MATTERS LIKE PROPHECY EVER. WHO ARE YOU TO DARE SAY HE IS NOT? Think about this verse carefully before jumping to sunday church mode. I was ex christian, I know the leaders always never bring this up. Now I fully know why.</p>

              <p>To the threadstarter....the fact and truth is that the bible
              confirms Jesus' identity as the Son of God. All the scriptures you
              quoted are either irrelevant or out of context from your
              topic...and you merely added your own meaning when its talking
              about other things.</p>
              <p><br> For example, you said: Jesus wasn’t G-d. The worship of Jesus is
              precisely what G-d warned us against.</p>
              <p>Tell me from where you gather that from? From where did God warn
              against worshipping Jesus?</p>
              <p>Contrary to that...God approved of Him at his baptism and said
              He is His beloved Son, in whom He is well pleased...In the book of
              Revelations, all nations will be made to bow before Him in
              worship....so how did you gather that?</p>
              <p>Just about everything you have said are nonsensical and
              illogical...in fact, I think most likely you're from a certain
              anti-christian religion....your arguments seem lifted from a
              certain website I found....which is from a certain extremist
              religion...</p>
              <p>How condescending, so like the olden cruscade you gonna slaughter us all again who clearly see what the scripture speaks in simple language. Christianity is the religion using old testament as text proof, meaning "hijacking" the jews belief as their own and also robbing the word of g-d. All the text is there for you to see. If you have proof, then prove it. Why the need to slander me. Have I not used the scripture and not my own theology. At least judaism dont catch youngesters unaware and try to make them speak in tongues? Evilness!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>you call dat religion??!!!!! you try to lure youngsters who cant think for themselves and force them to speak in spiritual unknowns. the govt give the attority and then u can shit on those who bring up the scripture and plainly show the error. AND YOU CALL ME EXTREMISTS....?????!!! WHO IS THE CULT TANG KI HERE.</p>
              <p>CAN YOU GUARANTEE SPEAKING IN TONGUES WONT INVOKE OTHER DIRTY SPIRIT?! WHO CAN JUSTIFY?  SO IF YOU CANT WHY MUST YOU ASK PPL TO JUSTIFY. AT TLEAST THE LAW OF GOD IS OF THE NATURAL WORLD AND DOING GOOD THINGS.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>you are right, and with the internet and reference to the original scriptures I found the concrete proof as to why christianity is what i feared it is. The actual pagan other g-ds that g-d of israel warned us about. They literally changed almost everthing the law and prophets tried to warn us about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thats why the mega-rich church can only convert the young as they are innocent. These wicked people will have their day of reckoning.</p>

              <p>Although I do not believe in any religion (a.k.a Free-Thinker), but I do notice something interesting (or amusing).</p>
              <p>TS mentioned "Make up your mind on whether jesus is a god or son of god" but isn't a son of god a god? For example, a dog gave birth, it's child is still a dog, there's no way its gonna be a cat, isn't it? You mother gave birth to you, there's no way you will be something else other than what your mother are, which is a human.</p>
              <p>Don't say god is omnipotent or something that god have the power to make jesus human, therefore jesus is not a god. I'm not buying that crap.</p>

              <p>Although I do not believe in any religion (a.k.a Free-Thinker),
              but I do notice something interesting (or amusing).</p>
              <p>TS mentioned "Make up your mind on whether jesus is a god or son
              of god" but isn't a son of god a god? For example, a dog gave
              birth, it's child is still a dog, there's no way its gonna be a
              cat, isn't it? You mother gave birth to you, there's no way you
              will be something else other than what your mother are, which is a
              human.</p>
              <p>Don't say god is omnipotent or something that god have the power
              to make jesus human, therefore jesus is not a god. I'm not buying
              that crap.</p>

              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">furb - if you are not interested why are you here in the first place? are you a walking contradiction. Normally, if you dont know you ask, if you want to assume dont be sarcastic. Who respects people with such a behaviour. perhaps only your mother. Hence you never understood your father let alone god your father in heaven.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">if you are interested in finding the truth, read the bible as its the most accurate amongst other religions as most religion are mystical by nature (meaning bullshit).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The bible mentions that we are all sons of god (children) many instances as He created us in the first human kind (first born Adam was earth created). God is unique and not like men is mentioned by Him various times in the scripture too. Jesus claims to be a son in terms of god-like power meaning, transcending time and space. And that Mary had sex with god. (sinisterly implied by the new testament but without saying it directly, again mystery is bullshit)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">However, this claim of son-god wasn't even prophecised in the old testament which is the final stance guarded by prophets of the chosen race and ppl. Only the pagans have son-god theories. Egyptians and Greek gods mythos to name a few</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">New testament wants to claim that god is 3 in one like some dandruff shampoo solution and that jesus is god in equality. Given this stance, you either choose to believe god's word or Jesus.</p>

              <p> It’s obvious that these verses contradict <strong>Jesus
              being equal and of the same substance as G-d Almighty.</strong> Christians say he’s G-d, and then they say he’s the Son of G-d.
              Make up your mind. Which one is he? Is he G-d or is he the Messiah?
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He can’t be both</span>,
              and closer examination will show he is neither.</p>
              <p><strong>"Nowhere even in the New Testament is it taught that
              Jesus is part of a triune godhead"</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"He can’t be
              both</span>," Why not? Whereever from the Bible did you get
              this notion? He is GOD, because He created this world and us, and
              He is the Messiah, as He died on the cross for our sins. And what
              is this "Closer examination" you talk about? Please tell me what
              you are examining, thank you! ^^</p>
              <p>And another version of Mark 13:32 can be found in Matthew
              24:36,- "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the
              angels of heaven, but my Father only." If you look at the context
              in which Jesus said this, it was because he was explaining to his
              disciples about the Day of the Lord's coming. Later
              after verse 36, we see that Jesus tells them that, in verse
              37, -"But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the
              Son of man be." And reading the whole of chapter 24 tells us that
              Jesus not only knew when the Lord's coming would be, but he also
              knew what was going to happen in those days, and for that read the
              prohecies in Revelations and the Major and Minor prophets in the
              Bible. Realise this: God is a triune God, and that He is the
              Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit ALTOGETHER!!! We know this for
              in Luke 12:29b, Jesus says that :"The Lord our God is one Lord:" We
              know that Jesus is the Son as he called God the father
              as "my Father", as noted in Matthew 24:36 earlier. Luke 6:5
              states that "the Son of  Man (or Jesus) is Lord also of the
              sabbath". In John 8: 19, we see that Jesus states that :" if ye had
              known me, ye should have known my Father also." Giving us more
              proof that God the Father and God the Son (Jesus) are one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dod not really have time to cover the rest of your
              argument, but do realise this: GOD is GOD. DO NOT TRY TO USE A
              HUMAN BRIAN TO TRY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND YOUR CREATOR. THE
              CREATOR IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CREATION, AND IT TAKES MORE THAN
              OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING TO KNOW GOD, WHO IS FAR MMORE SUPREME THAN US
              HUMANS. HE IS GOD AFTER ALL.</p>
