              <p>i just thought of 3 ''little'' problems about the concept of heaven.................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>smallest problem &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
              <p>say modern people go to heaven and meet up with people from hundreds of years ago, how the heck would they get along.................how to even communicate properly...........i'm not talking about language barriers (another problem.......LOL).................rather it's the generationS gap...............a modern woman would be considered a slut by the ancients due to dressing and behaviour................</p>
              <p>anyway, far far far too many problems to even mention here..................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>medium problem &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
              <p>say a woman's beloved 1st hubby died................she then remarried another man she loved as well............so now all 3 are in heaven..............they'll be asking : ''are threesomes frowned upon up here?''..............LOL...............so who's the woman gonna stay with?</p>
              <p>also the 1st hubby still looks young, the woman is now old...................(another problem.........LOL)</p>
              <p>what about those parents that died young while their children lived to old age...................so now you see old people calling young people ''pa'' and ''ma''......................the children are also now wiser than the parents that died young................so who listen to who now..............LOL....................</p>
              <p>again, far far far too many other problems to mention here..................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Biggest problem &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
              <p>ok, so good people go to heaven................but they still have their human desires, cravings, anger, jealousy and other negative traits.....................seems that even GOD has these HUMAN traits............LOL.........</p>
              <p>and so many such people are supposed to stay together FOREVER..................they can't even stand each other after a short time................anyway, as long as humans are not MENTALLY PURIFIED, they'll always have desires that they can't attain................they'll be jealous of someone else's beautiful wife/hubby.......etc etc..........IS THIS HEAVEN AT ALL ????????</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>again, far far far too many things/problems to even start mentioning here..............you can think for yourself....................instinctively, you'll know that i'm right.....................</p>

              <p>one biggest problem is your enemy or the person you hate most also go to heaven. i have a friend who is a christian told me that she will not believe in god if she sees her colleague (an evil christian) also in heaven.</p>
              <p>another problem is if your loved ones did not go to heaven, you will miss them eternally, feel sad and unhappy eternally.</p>
              <p>singer eric clapton sang a very nice song "TEARS IN HEAVEN", if i did not remember wrongly, he sang for his child who died at young age. in this song, there are valid questions :</p>
              <p>would you know my name if i saw you in heaven, would you be the same if i saw you in heaven.</p>

              <p>Nope. Even if Christians stop bashing, people of other religion will

              <p>Haha. Even if these are the case, when will they wake up to their idea that Christianity is not the only religion that is around, and no mattar how you think your religion is the "true" and "only" religion, is pratically useless. Certain things we just can't change, like the exsistence of other religon, but we can only tolerate, at least. Being a real christian, you should love even the most difficult person, which is to them the non-belivers and other religon, not shooting them like there is no tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to the topic on heaven. Your answer can only be answered when you get there assuming there is heaven. Those people who gone there, assuming it exsisted, can't come back and tell us... So you can just do some usefull stuff while waiting for the day your time is up. =)</p>

              <p>However, I can say one thing, which may help open your doors: upon death, Man no longer are Man, and return to their original form to where they came from, prior to birth, so these 'problems' won't exist. These 'problems' only exist because we think as Man.</p>
              <p>Perhaps for a change, why not forumers try to ponder as deeply as possible over the real fundamental reasons for the 'religion bashing' in this forum? :) It'll have a much more meaningful effect.</p>

              <p>This sentence only happen when the day when all the good guys are
              christians and all the bad guys are non-christians. In an other meaning, that sentence is a
              big big lie. Something like a trademark to attract people in. Really. If you are evil once, as long as you repent, and
              admit and understand your mistake, I belive you can go heaven cause God
              is forgiving. Same thing to non-christians. If non-christians died, and saw Jesus and God, they will most likely be converted if they are good, or evil and repent. And when I mean repent, is not say repent, then go do evil again.</p>
