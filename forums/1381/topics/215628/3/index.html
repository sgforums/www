Though father doesn't know how the other fathers handle their child. But he sure know what his kid needs even without little toddler saying anything. There is a certain connection which only he knows.<br>When toddler crys, he's afraid, or he falls, he's hungry, he's lost.<br>This father always knows.<br><br>Though this earthly father doesn't know what's the best for little toddler.<br>He doesn't guarantee to know exactly what his baby is thinking.<br>But he knows enough to provide for the toddler.<br><br>Some of you cannot relate this a father - child relationship.<br>You're free to see it as mother - child relationship.<br><br>I'm not a father myself. I do not come from a home with strong fatherly figure.<br>I looked at children and their parents, sometimes i wonder.<br>Then i realise, God uses earthly figure(parents) to teach us His nature and showed us how much He understands us even without us saying a single word.<br><br>Does God understand english? the topic ask.<br><br><strong>My opinion.<br>When God sees the very intent, your thoughts and desire of your heart, even before you speak. Do you think he needs to hear it from you?<br>He don't need, he wants to hear His child talk to him. Is the talk important? Yes.<br>Is the phrasing of words and correct pronunciation important? No.<br>Because He went pass the language and listen to the heart. </strong><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

Though father doesn't know how the other fathers handle their child. But he sure know what his kid needs even without little toddler saying anything.

I do not come from a home with strong fatherly figure.<br>I looked at children and their parents, sometimes i wonder.<br>Then i realise, God uses earthly figure(parents) to teach us His nature and showed us how much He understands us even without us saying a single word.<br><br>Does God understand english? the topic ask.<br><br>[b]My opinion.<br>When God sees the very intent, your thoughts and desire of your heart, even before you speak. Do you think he needs to hear it from you?<br>He don't need, he wants to hear His child talk to him. Is the talk important? Yes.<br>Is the phrasing of words and correct pronunciation important? No.<br>Because He went pass the language and listen to the heart. </strong><br><br>Cheers<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>i was thinking silent prayer is also considered prayer.</div>
