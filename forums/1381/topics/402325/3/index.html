              <p>What this pastor do not know is many Christians are very fearful of 7th month. May be he knows but did not announce. My colleague who is a Christian ask me where to buy bagua for her children, she wants her children to wear during the 7th month. My friends who are Christians dare not to stay at home alone during the 7th month.</p>
              <p>My elderly relatives who used to go to taoist temples told me many Christians always ask their relatives who are taoists to ask medium on their behalf whenever they see ghosts or have ghosts related problems because  Christianity can't solve their ghosts problem. The medium usually gets very angry when they know the persons who have problem are Christian and refuse to help initially but after some persuasion, they will eventually help.</p>
              <p>My neighbour's child saw ghosts and cried non stop from evening till next morning. They are Christians so they get their mother-in-law to help to ask taoist medium. After the child took the talisman, the child stop crying and they continue with their Christianity belief but I have heard Christians who become Taoists because of some ghosts related problems.</p>

              <p><br>I have heard about christians encountering spirits.  When I was a christian I encountered spirits, the only way christianity can help was when I played christian music and the spirit stop coming and when music was stopped the spirit appear again.  Even through prayer or so called deliverance Christianity, god and jesus fail to get rid of the spirit.   Strange, it can help only when a person is possessed by spirit.   If the spirit is not taking possession in the body , it cannot help.    Strange!</p>

              <p>Actually no. Without an answer now doesnt mean it is superstition. There are a lot of things in religion without answers too. So is religion also a superstition ? Afterall there are many overlapping areas concerning religion and superstition.</p>
              <p>But in that video, that guy is obviously uttering blasphemy concerning taoism and buddism.  He is mocking guan yu, a guy rumoured to have the strength of 10000 men where hong kong police and traids pray to.That is intolerance</p>
