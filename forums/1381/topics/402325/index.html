              <p>Several <strong>STOMPers</strong> came across an audio-video posted online, apparently showing Pastor Mark Ng from New Creation Church poking fun at Chinese beliefs..<br><br>The STOMPers are concerned about how the pastor's insulting comments may create societal disharmony.<br><br>Earlier this year, Pastor Rony Tan made headlines when videos of him belittling Buddhist precepts such as rebirth, karma and nirvana were circulated on the Internet, creating an outroar.<br><br>This led to the authorities warning him, after which he apologised.<br><br>Now, despite the authorities having taken action against Pastor Rony Tan, Pastor Mark Ng has apparently made insensitive comments on traditional Chinese beliefs, as seen in this video. Annotations are inserted by the anonymous person who uploaded the audio-video up on YouTube.<br><br>One of the STOMPers who came across the latest video of Pastor Mark Ng, said:<br><br>"I came across this video online about a pastor from a mega church poking fun of other religions' rituals and traditions.<br><br>"I have no problem with people preaching their religious beliefs but, living in multi-cultural Singapore, we should learn to respect others' religions.<br><br>"I think the pastor owes a public apology to all those he had insulted.<br><br>Another STOMPer said:<br><br>"Pastor Mark Ng of New Creation Church insults Chinese beliefs and Taoists in sermon.<br><br>"I was aghast to hear that this pastor has made numerous comments that were not sensitive to Chinese beliefs and were particularly insulting to Taoists.<br><br>"It is very sad to note that despite the public outrage surrounding pastor Rony Tan earlier this year for his insensitive comments and misconceptions about other religions, this pastor has chosen to ignore the government's call for a multi-religious society in harmony and continued to insult other faiths in order to spread his own faith."</p>

              <p>THE Internal Security Department (ISD) has looked into an incident involving the New Creation Church over a 2008 sermon being circulated online that mocks Taoist beliefs.</p>
              <p>The 10-minute audio clip was posted on YouTube last Friday. In it, a church pastor, Mr Mark Ng, can be heard joking with the congregation about Chinese rituals; in one instance, he compared praying to Taoist deities to 'seeking protection from secret society gangsters'.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs said yesterday in a response to queries from The Straits Times that the church had, on its own accord, contacted YouTube to remove the clip. It has also apologised.</p>
              <p>'We are aware of the case. ISD has looked into it and taken up the matter with the New Creation Church.'</p>
              <p>In a six-paragraph letter posted on its website on Sunday, New Creation said that Mr Ng, who heads the church's Chinese ministry, did not intend for his comments to be disrespectful to other faiths.</p>
              <p>It added that earlier this year, the church had reviewed its archive of sermons and had stopped reproducing that particular sermon and other insensitive content that had been previously sold in the church bookstore.</p>
              <p>'We recognise our responsibility in this major oversight in allowing this sermon not only to be preached, but also, as a usual practice, to be made available as a resource for sale,' the 20,000-strong independent church said.</p>
              <p>'It is unfortunate that while we have endeavoured in every way to stop the circulation of this sermon, its recent appearance on the Internet continues to possibly cause offence.</p>
              <p>'We would like to express our deepest apologies to any person who may have been offended by the remarks made by Pastor Mark Ng.'</p>
              <p>The user who uploaded the New Creation clip declined to identify himself, but told The Straits Times in an e-mail interview that he hoped to raise public awareness on preaching styles that were disrespectful to other faiths.</p>
              <p>'If such preaching continues unabated, it would definitely be trouble for multiracial and multi-religious Singapore,' said the 37-year-old Singaporean man, who uses the nickname 'happyman4072' on YouTube.</p>
              <p>The clip has since been re-posted on more than a dozen websites, including Stomp!, tech forum hardwarezone.com and social networking site Facebook.</p>
              <p>On YouTube, it has been viewed about 4,000 times.</p>
              <p>In February, the founder and senior pastor of another independent church, Lighthouse Evangelism, was censured for making comments that were insensitive to Buddhist and Taoist believers.</p>
              <p>Mr Rony Tan, 64, mocked the religious precepts, such as reincarnation and nirvana. His remarks were recorded on video and uploaded on the church's website.</p>
              <p>In days, the video clips were re-posted on YouTube and online forums.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan was interviewed by the ISD and has since recanted and apologised for his remarks.</p>
              <p>Mr Ng, who is 48 and married, could not be reached for comment.</p>
              <p>The church, however, said on his behalf: 'Pastor Mark offers his unreserved and unmitigated apology to the public for his insensitive comments... He humbly appeals to those whom he has offended to forgive him for this serious indiscretion.'</p>
              <p>The user who uploaded the clip said he had received CDs containing the sermon last month from a church-goer, presumably from New Creation.</p>
              <p>'I am pretty sure that he didn't realise that these kind of recordings could give offence to others. Perhaps that could be the problem in our society right now?'</p>
              <p>He added that he was not religious and did not subscribe to any faith.</p>
              <p>Taoist Federation chairman Tan Thiam Lye yesterday called on religious leaders to start paying more attention to what they say during services.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Such comments do not promote religious harmony - that is obvious. There is just no need to criticise other religions when promoting your own faith.'</p>

              <p>I do noe that you want to bash the Chrisitians. While I am not a chrisitan, but Islam / Muslims are also have such "if i'm right you must be wrong" mentality as well. If not where got  the ****** terrorism extemist thing exist and sabo those transport fans cannot freely take their photos / videos as a souvenir / memories of it and mistaken as a suspected terrorist instead!.</p>

              <p>In other words, Atheism is the best and others are plain wrong.</p>
