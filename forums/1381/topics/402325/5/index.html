              <p>Before we are quite to blame someone for what he/her said, we must know from what context and what background he came from. Pastor Mark is my Pastor (&amp; mind you, I’m not trying to defend what he had said over the Pulpit) and he used to have a Taoist belief. What he shared (i feel) came from his own experiences and what he felt about his previous religious acts and ritual.</p>
              <p>Please make no comparison among different religions cause let’s see a Taoist priet of Buddhist-monk comment badly about Christians… (i know they wouldn’t. All religions teach us to do good rite?)</p>
              <p>See if we (CHRISTians) would even bat an eyelid.</p>
              <p>For the rest of the mockers out there (now obviously ANTI-CHRISTians), IF those of you who have NEVER said anything wrong or done anything wrong before, please cast the first stone.</p>
              <p>(why be so quick to judge and condemn??? relax lah people…)</p>

              <p>As race and religion are extremely sensitive issues in our country, I hope ISD will come down real hard on such religious leaders. Such people should be taken to task and not just let off with a stern warning. The fact that this particular sermon was even made for sale to their members indicated that this religious leader(pastor) has every intention to poke fun,ridicule, mock and humuliate another religion/faith/beliefs. This is a very serious matter and the culprit should be punished according to the law.</p>

              <p>I am a christian, a stonge christian.</p>
              <p>But I am disgusted by the news that christian pastors critising other religions and making a joke out of it. It is not that I believe in other religion. But it is the fact that what has other religion got to do with these pastors? Why are they so kaypo and try to create joke about what other pray at.</p>
              <p>I think it is high time that the authority to look into passing a law. A law that convicts criminals like these pastors who critise and make fun of other people’s religion.</p>
              <p>Any person who is found to make fun of other religion in a public place where more than 2 gathers, should be first put to jail for one month and a criminal records be made against him. After the month, he will be release from prision and shall await schedule for his hearing. If upon hearing, he is found guilty, he shall be jailed and fine further.</p>
              <p>This should put a stop at errant religious people from being trigger happy. Else they just criticise and then say sorry. What is so sorry about sorry? They just paying lips services!</p>

              <p>We got a double standard in protecting the elite..</p>
              <p>On September 16 2005, a 17 year old youth, Gan Huai Shi, was charged with the Sedition Act for making racist remarks on his blog site titled “The Second Holocaust”.<br>The 17-year-old San Yu Adventist School student faced seven charges of sedition. He caused a furore when between April and July 2005 he posted a series of offensive comments about Malays – even admitting in one April 4 entry that he was ‘extremely racist’.<br>Over the next three months, Gan made more inflammatory remarks mocking the Malay community and ridiculing their religion, which were deemed by the court to promote ‘ill will and hostility’ between races, an offence under the Sedition Act.<br>Gan Huai Shi pleaded guilty to 2 counts of sedition and was sentenced to 24 months supervised probation that includes counseling sessions and community service in the Malay community.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; So should Mark Ng be sentenced to 24 months supervised probation that includes counseling sessions and community service in the Buddhists and Taoist community? Perhaps can make him sweep the burned paper ashes on the lunar seventh month, it will help our country save a bit too.</p>

              <p class="comm-meta">Stories we live by</p>
              <div class="comm-text">
              <p>You name your God, I name mine. This has been going on since we first wondered why the sun rises, why there are stars in the night sky, why the wind blows and water flows, why we are here, why we die. It was a time long before science and human awakening. When people could not find the right answers for such things, they tell stories about it.</p>
              <p>Some thinkers say that the kind of God that a tribe or group worships reflects their common struggles and hopes, and this story holds them together. But now our various communities throughout the world are becoming more globalized. We keep bumping into one other’s Gods.</p>
              <p>In our global community, we can see a few interesting reactions to the God stories. Firstly, there are those who claim “my God” is better than yours: they are like selfish children; it is best to leave them alone. One great weakness of such a story-group is that their lives are moulded and guided by differences rather than by similarities. They live in a black-and-white world where “friends” are those who think and live like them; those who are different are “enemies”; those who fit into neither category are “strangers” to be converted, appropriated. There is a lot of measuring of humanity here, as if it is a measurable commodity.</p>
              <p>Then, there are some God story tellers who see a commonalty in our need for a higher purpose: it does not really matter which God, they are wont to say. The story matters more than the story-teller, even the story-maker. Let us walk humbly with our God, they preach. This is a more empowering approach, as it allows everyone of us to be truly friendly to everyone else. There is much less measuring of humanity here. The main problem, however, is that there can be a lot of superficiality here, like a nicely packaged box, or one with layers of nice wrappings, but the content is really paltry, or nothing really.</p>
              <p>The third group simply says, hey, these are just stories, great stories, but please look for their meanings. Stories may divide us, their spirit brings our hearts closer together. Let us live by the spirit, what the stories are really trying to tell us. The fact is that we cannot live by stories alone: we must live life as it comes. Stories may be about what the world can be or should be, but life is what things really are. So we need a reality check.</p>
              <p>If we are truly honest with ourselves, we are likely to notice that no matter how “perfect” the story we live by may be, the ending is not always what we expect it to be. The thing about stories is that once we know their ending, it becomes boring; we then forget what the story is really about. Or we invent our own ending to the story; in which case, we don’t really need the story, after all.<br>There is something much better than any story, even better than all the stories that can ever be told. That is, to look deep into ourselves. What do we notice? We might notice, if we look deeply enough, that we have a lot of thoughts rushing through our minds — these are our great story tellers.</p>
              <p>Our minds are the greatest story tellers. They are often very self-centred story tellers, for the simple reason our minds are, as a rule, unaware of other minds. If we look even deeper, we will see that our minds or hearts have lives of their own. We really have no control over them, and this is what the stories are about. They are our attempts at harnessing the wildness and wilderness that are our hearts. The God story seems the best story to do so.</p>
              <p>But let us look deeper into ourselves. While our minds differentiate us with our stories, there is something that is intimately “us” from day one, something that runs the same way in all of us, whether we are human, beast, or alien. No matter which universe or multiverse we are in: we breathe, and we all breathe the same way. To breathe is to live, to live is to breathe.<br>Our perspective of life is inextricably and essentially linked to the way we breathe. The more violent we are, the heavier we tend to breathe. To breathe is also to slow-burn ourselves up, as it were. As such, the more violently we breathe, the faster is the burning, the more violent our lives become.</p>
              <p>Even in physical exercise, there comes a time when our breathing flows harmoniously with our bodies. Then body and mind act as one. Yet, there are times when we need to simply sit comfortably still and forget about the body for a while. There is just the breath, getting ever more peaceful. It comes to such still point, a radiant stillness, that the joy is unspeakable.</p>
              <p>This is the well-spring of religion: it is the realizing of our true selves. We seem to be just a blink in the vast moonless cloudless night sky, amongst billions of other twinkling stars. What beautiful stars, what blissful space! This is the religion that needs no converts, that can never have followers. For we have come to the journey’s joyful end. We’re truly home.</p>

              <p>It is about a religious group getting too powerful in a multi racial country like Singapore. If you carefully analyse the various sectors leaders, they are predominantly of a certain group of religion. Even by carefully observing our social welfare system, the systems used are predominantly of a certain kind of genre. Just look at the AWARE saga and you will know what I mean. That is why these pastors are blatantly testing the system as they know they are well supported by it and that they can get away with it.</p>
              <p>I am a Christian too but I so believe in an ecumenical system where it is inclusive and not exclusive to different segments of people. No doubt Christainity is a more modern, westernised and a up to date religion. However, lets not criticise other religions as there are much to learn from them too. Meditation for one existed much earlier then Jesus Christ. It is the Christians who borrowed it. Much of the celebration of Christmas and even the sacred Mass originated from pagans’ beliefs too. In fact, Christ was not even born on 25th Dec!!!!</p>
              <p>Hence the point I would like to reiterate is look at our own flaws first before we compare to others. You will probably see a resemblance there more that you think:)</p>

              <p>Standard preaching styles they have. During my church pri &amp; sec school, My bible teacher always use Taoism example by making fun of it. so quite common to me, that is their way to make people believe in christian and they hope these example can help Taoism believe Jesus.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Pastor Mark Ng’s quoting gangster and police worshiped Guan-Gong doesn’t make sense to me.</p>

              <div class="comm-text">
              <p>Be fair on June 15, 2010 at 3:42 pm<br>Christianity has always been loud in alot of stuff – preach, convert more people to become Christian, even loitering at Suntec for the session to start.<br>Other religions have done nothing against any religion, why should Christians? As non-Christians, we are often bothered, pestered as if the amount of Christians you “recruit” will get comission in return.<br>Pastors and Chritians – STOP ALL THE APOLOGIES, IT’S TOO LATE! How about you physically slapped by people on your face and get apologized?<br>BTW, the pastors should also apologize to the followers in their sessions for this mistake too.</p>
              <p>AGREED WITH YOU! I was once told by some Chritians that they were told Adam and Eve are their Daddy and Mummy??? In this case if it is true, aren’t all Chritians committed an offence called incest??another words, they are simply sleeping with their own sisters who are their wivies now??. What on earth these people are thinking???Crazy right? Hey, i urge those people,please come back to earth la!</p>

              <p>Well I have personally overheard people from other religions/beliefs making fun of Christianity, and being a believer of Christ, i admit that i, too, had giggled for i do find it hilarious. But hey, don’t get me wrong, that does not mean i do not love God. Let’s be honest here, I’m sure we all have ever heard of sarcastic jokes about different races, culture, gender, and religions at some point or so, it is very common in our society. So why make such a big fuss over this, again? After listening to this clip, one thing which i noticed is that the congregation was indeed enjoying his sermon. And I believe Pastor Mark was just being candid and preaching the sermon message in a lighthearted manner. Let us be less critical and picky on what some pastors say, shall we? Sometimes life can be rosier if we can learn to see things more positively… with a pinch of humor. Chill, people. =)</p>

              <p>I think you guys are just quick to jump on the bandwagon and go witch hunting. For those who find this the opportune time to spout comments with crude insults against the christian faith, it seems that you are worse than this pastor.</p>
              <p>The fact of the matter is, the pastor spoke his mind in a closed setting, and I guess his videos were meant for New Creation Christians and with his lack of tact and eloquence , upset many.</p>
              <p>To those who talk about extreme religious tolerance, I find it ironic to debate this as most religions , no matter how to butter it, claims to be superior/more enlightened/more awesome compared with other religions. And that is why we have different religions in the first place.The difference is, the core of Christianity is very evangelical, meaning, spreading its gospel to unbelievers.And that means trudging on toes along the way. Its the same as telling your mechanic what your previous mechanic said about your car and asking his opinion on that in the privacy of his workshop.</p>
              <p>Also, it seems that it’s always the same old story of the Christians Vs Muslims Vs Buddhists Vs whatver that gets the headlines from the media. If they want to provoke public sentiment regarding religious harmony, how about clamping down on the atheistic opinions who have their share in mainstream media/ publications available to Singaporeans ridiculing religious beliefs?They can’t, because they are within their rights to express their opinion. Which is ironic.</p>

              <p>Pastor Mark is only talking to his own congre, own members.. Why are ppl not involve talking so much? Is like, do u go and knock ur neighbour’s door and say ‘Hey, how can u talk to ur children such things??’ Anyway what he have said REALLY make sense..</p>
              <p>it seen to me that, all this troubler maker are PASTOR!<br>they just cant shut up and stop comparing with others religion!!<br>i know YOUR GOD IS GREAT! and YOUR GOD SAVE! as you guyz have been placing it all over your car, but….

              <p>As a Christian myself, I personally felt disgusted at what my fellow christian communities are doing to the world. I have friends of other religions and we are all following the teachings of our own GOD. This is perfectly fine as long as we are doing good for the spirtual well being of all living kinds. It is very sad to see that we are slowly drifting away from the teaching of GOD and this is definitely not what he want to see. Be truthful to your soul.</p>

              <p>The problem is the respective church councils agree with what their pastors said. Have you heard of any call on restraint by churches before the complaint is lodged? Another problem is our society does not have deep roots in culture. We are being easily sway by popular trend including religious trend.</p>
