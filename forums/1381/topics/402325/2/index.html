              <p><strong>Sorry but the "sermon" was not made in a private setting. Further in
                  audio, he was telling the audience to go out and spread his word and
                  "show others his DVDs" and bring them to the truth of Christ. And this
                  audio was madeï»¿ for public distribution. Anyway, "sermons" are always
                  meant for others to view as well.</strong></p>

              <p>Idiots such as this Mark Ng should be banned from ever talking about religious belief.</p>
              <p>I listened to about halfway through the youtube recording and really can't bear to listened anymore.  If not for Youtube's signing up procedures, I would have left my comments there as well.</p>
              <p>If you're christian and don't like what I'm gonna say, please ignore my post.</p>
              <p>Damn! His ridicule about Guan Yu and how both the police and gangsters in HKG pray to him, asking for protection.  He's saying... what if both sides have a clash? Then Guan Yu has a problem lah, since he will not know who to protect!</p>
              <p>Well, listen Moron Ng, police and gangsters don't clash everyday.  How about... You Christian people have service every Sunday.  Well, this is a known fact.  Then, what if among all churches in Sg (not to mention other parts of the world) have believers who needs healing, then how??? Your God / Jesus / Holy Ghost cannot be at every churches at one time mah... Then how? Only 1 church (or give you 3 lah...) have their believers healed and the rest?  Are they seeking help form lucifer then? After all, he is the brightest angel mah... Take note that I'm using Capital Letters when referring to your God / Jesus / Holy Ghost <strong>BECAUSE </strong>I do RESPECT your religion.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Look, Moron Ng, think about what you say before you stand before your church, delivering your sermon.  How would you like it if I were to say.... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>"<span style="color: #ffffff;">There is no virgin Mary.  I fucked her and that's why she gave birth to Jesus. So, you gonna call me the God now, since you say Jesus is God's son????</span>"<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note: The above is truly offensive to Christians.  So, if you're likely to feel offended, please do not read.  I've purposely use WHITE as the font colour so that you will not read it accidentally. If you still want to read it despite my warning, just highlight that portion by dragging your mouse and you should read my message.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Do you like it? I bet you don't, and I don't like what you say as well... So, if you can't deliver a responsible sermon, get off that stage.</span>  Likewise, those who goes around preaching (or what you call "evangalising"), please don't ever ridicule the people you're speaking to by saying they're just praying to wood blocks.</p>
              <p>Personal experience here... I've got a friend who encounter such "simple-minded" christian trying to preach to him.  When he learnt that my friend's religion is Taosim, he proceeds to say that my friend is just praying to wooden block.  Now, my friend is not a nice bloke and upon hearing this, fire is literarry burning in his stomach.  He drag the poor fellow into his house nad challenge him to a fight, saying... "let's see my wooden block or your metal (refer to the cross) is better now" and gave the person a bashing.</p>
              <p>Please... Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religion country.  Be sensitive to others when you try to speak about religions...</p>

              <p>the government seemed to be unwilling or unable to prosecute public religious figures. but if he is prosecuted and go to jail for this, he can argue that Rony Tan was given a warning only. same issue, double standards.</p>

              <p>What this pastor do not know is many Christians are very fearful of 7th month. May be he knows but did not announce. My colleague who is a Christian ask me where to buy bagua for her children, she wants her children to wear during the 7th month. My friends who are Christians dare not to stay at home alone during the 7th month.</p>
              <p>My elderly relatives who used to go to taoist temples told me many Christians always ask their relatives who are taoists to ask medium on their behalf whenever they see ghosts or have ghosts related problems because  Christianity can't solve their ghosts problem. The medium usually gets very angry when they know the persons who have problem are Christian and refuse to help initially but after some persuasion, they will eventually help.</p>
              <p>My neighbour's child saw ghosts and cried non stop from evening till next morning. They are Christians so they get their mother-in-law to help to ask taoist medium. After the child took the talisman, the child stop crying and they continue with their Christianity belief but I have heard Christians who become Taoists because of some ghosts related problems.</p>

              <p>Ghosts are same like human. Sometimes when you scold human, they will choose to ignore. U think every single ghost are out there to seek revenge or to harm people meh?</p>
