              <p>THE Internal Security Department (ISD) has looked into an incident involving the New Creation Church over a 2008 sermon being circulated online that mocks Taoist beliefs.</p>
              <p>The 10-minute audio clip was posted on YouTube last Friday. In it, a church pastor, Mr Mark Ng, can be heard joking with the congregation about Chinese rituals; in one instance, he compared praying to Taoist deities to 'seeking protection from secret society gangsters'.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs said yesterday in a response to queries from The Straits Times that the church had, on its own accord, contacted YouTube to remove the clip. It has also apologised.</p>
              <p>'We are aware of the case. ISD has looked into it and taken up the matter with the New Creation Church.'</p>
              <p>In a six-paragraph letter posted on its website on Sunday, New Creation said that Mr Ng, who heads the church's Chinese ministry, did not intend for his comments to be disrespectful to other faiths.</p>
              <p>It added that earlier this year, the church had reviewed its archive of sermons and had stopped reproducing that particular sermon and other insensitive content that had been previously sold in the church bookstore.</p>
              <p>'We recognise our responsibility in this major oversight in allowing this sermon not only to be preached, but also, as a usual practice, to be made available as a resource for sale,' the 20,000-strong independent church said.</p>
              <p>'It is unfortunate that while we have endeavoured in every way to stop the circulation of this sermon, its recent appearance on the Internet continues to possibly cause offence.</p>
              <p>'We would like to express our deepest apologies to any person who may have been offended by the remarks made by Pastor Mark Ng.'</p>
              <p>The user who uploaded the New Creation clip declined to identify himself, but told The Straits Times in an e-mail interview that he hoped to raise public awareness on preaching styles that were disrespectful to other faiths.</p>
              <p>'If such preaching continues unabated, it would definitely be trouble for multiracial and multi-religious Singapore,' said the 37-year-old Singaporean man, who uses the nickname 'happyman4072' on YouTube.</p>
              <p>The clip has since been re-posted on more than a dozen websites, including Stomp!, tech forum hardwarezone.com and social networking site Facebook.</p>
              <p>On YouTube, it has been viewed about 4,000 times.</p>
              <p>In February, the founder and senior pastor of another independent church, Lighthouse Evangelism, was censured for making comments that were insensitive to Buddhist and Taoist believers.</p>
              <p>Mr Rony Tan, 64, mocked the religious precepts, such as reincarnation and nirvana. His remarks were recorded on video and uploaded on the church's website.</p>
              <p>In days, the video clips were re-posted on YouTube and online forums.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan was interviewed by the ISD and has since recanted and apologised for his remarks.</p>
              <p>Mr Ng, who is 48 and married, could not be reached for comment.</p>
              <p>The church, however, said on his behalf: 'Pastor Mark offers his unreserved and unmitigated apology to the public for his insensitive comments... He humbly appeals to those whom he has offended to forgive him for this serious indiscretion.'</p>
              <p>The user who uploaded the clip said he had received CDs containing the sermon last month from a church-goer, presumably from New Creation.</p>
              <p>'I am pretty sure that he didn't realise that these kind of recordings could give offence to others. Perhaps that could be the problem in our society right now?'</p>
              <p>He added that he was not religious and did not subscribe to any faith.</p>
              <p>Taoist Federation chairman Tan Thiam Lye yesterday called on religious leaders to start paying more attention to what they say during services.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Such comments do not promote religious harmony - that is obvious. There is just no need to criticise other religions when promoting your own faith.'</p>

              <p>This fellow has been marked!   He is a leader and for a leader to say such a thing as his comments are not intended to be disrespectful to other faiths is bullshit and irresponsible.    If he is a 3 year old, we can understand.   He is 48 year old and married with kids.   cbkia really!! </p>
              <p>If his apology is sincere he would apology upfront, why shun away from media to apologise???</p>

              <p>another warning given to this pasta by ISD, just like Rony Tan's warning?</p>
              <p>if this is not seditious, I dunno what is man, esp a religious leader of a well known church in Spore. How can NCC dunno what their pastors were preaching to the followers on sunday service. they must have think there is nothing wrong in it.

              <p>you see lar, if you dun come down hard on these pastors, a few months down the road, you will hear another pastor with the same comments. you need to punish these people so hard that in future, they will think twice before uttering such irresponsible comments.</p>

              <p>They are not sincere in apologising.    In all these shit, it is also arrogance that motivated them to act this way.  Arrogance is a sin in christanity and God does not like arrogance.    This is mentioned lots of times in the bible.</p>
              <p>Unless I remember wrongly, there was no mention about Jesus did the same like these pastors when he met with other religious leaders.</p>

              <p><br>I have no chance to do as you say - she does not have any of the images of the mentioned names.    Moreover, I have dumped her as a friend due to a couple of reasons.   She is typical of those nasty christians who acts a bully.    Out of concern, I called her to find out how she was getting on, when she heard my voice she just yelled and shouted.  She is another bastardic frustrated woman, at that time cannot get bf to marry her and vent frustration on me.   one of the reasons she did this is that she has been harhouring jealousy against me.</p>

              <p><br>I have no chance to do as you say - she does not have any of the images of the mentioned names.    Moreover, I have dumped her as a friend due to a couple of reasons.   She is typical of those nasty christians who acts a bully.    Out of concern, I called her to find out how she was getting on, when she heard my voice she just yelled and shouted.  She is another bastardic frustrated woman, at that time cannot get bf to marry her and vent frustration on me.   </p>
