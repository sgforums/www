              <p>Latest update</p>
              <p><em>The Straits Times</em> reports that the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Internal+Security+Department&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Internal Security Department (ISD)</a> is probing 
              Pastor Mark Ng, 48, for a sermon he gave in 2008 in 
              which he mocked Taoist beliefs. In a 10-minute audio clip posted 
              on YouTube, Ng is heard joking with the congregation about Chinese 
              rituals and in one instance, compared praying to Taoist deities to 
              “seeking protection from secret society gangsters”.</p>
              <p>This is not the first time a pastor has mocked practices of other 
              religions.</p>
              <p>In February this year, founder of <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Lighthouse+Evangelism&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Lighthouse Evangelism</a> Rony Tan, 64,  was also 
              hauled up and censured by the ISD for making insensitive comments 
              about Buddhist and Taoist beliefs such as re-incarnation and 
              nirvana. The senior Pastor later apologised for his remarks, but not 
              before the issue sparked massive debate in multi-faith, multi-religious 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>Freelance designer Mohd. Mokhtar, 45, told Yahoo! Singapore that he 
              now hopes the government will intervene and put a stop to religious 
              leaders criticising or mocking other faiths.</p>
              <p>“It’s already the second time and I won’t be surprised it will happen
               again so it’s time for them to step in and give them a final warning,” 
              he said.</p>
              <p>Aircraft technician Danny Lim, 30, agreed.</p>
              <p>“Such comments can harm religious harmony and it’s not right to be 
              criticising other religions.”</p>
              <p>Engineer K. Dinesh, 29, added that religious leaders must realise 
              they are constantly under the spotlight and as such, must refrain 
              from talking about other faiths they have little knowledge of.</p>
              <p>“I think they should just speak on their own religion and there will 
              not be any issues. It will cause a lot of unrest if they start 
              criticising others.”</p>
              <p>Pastor Ng, who heads New Creation’s Chinese ministry, has so far 
              remained silent over the latest issue but a statement posted on the <a href="http://www.newcreation.org.sg/announcements/response-to-recent-circulation-of-audio-clips-of-a-sermon-preached-by-pastor-mark-ng-in-august-2008">church’s website</a> said that Ng did not intend for 
              his comments to be disrespectful to other races or religions.</p>
              <p>It also admitted that the particular sermon has been available for 
              sale at the church bookstore since 2008 until early this year, 
              presumably when Rony Tan was censured.</p>
              <p>“We would like to express our deepest apologies to any person who may
               have been offended by the remarks made by Pastor Mark Ng during a 
              sermon delivered in August 2008,” said the church on its website.</p>
              <p>“Pastor Mark offers his unreserved and unmitigated apology to the 
              public for his insensitive comments… He humbly appeals to those whom he 
              has offended to forgive him of this serious indiscretion.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Ministry+of+Home+Affairs+Singapore&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ministry of Home Affairs</a> has also waded into the 
              issue and said that New Creation had, on its own accord, contacted 
              YouTube to remove the clip. It has also apologised and the ISD are 
              looking into the matter.</p>
              <p>The original clip was uploaded by an anonymous user who said that he 
              hoped to raise public awareness of different preaching styles.</p>
              <p>Mega-churches New Creation and City Harvest have both come under the 
              public spotlight in recent weeks after it was revealed that City Harvest
               founder Kong Hee and 16 other church members are being investigated for
               misuse of church funds.</p>

              </span></p><p>SINGING THE PRAISE OF AN AMAZING TAOIST-BUDDHIST</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know whether he was a Taoist or a Buddhist, so I better use a hyphenated religion to describe his faith. Generally in Singapore, a Taoist would say he's a Buddhist ("Bai Poot") when in fact he is a Taoist, &amp; I intend to refresh our collective memory of a very inspiring Taoist-Buddhist Singaporean who died some five years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <strong><span lang="EN">
              <p>On that fateful afternoon 20/4/04, tunnelling work for the Circle LRT Line led to a massive cave-in at the Nicoll Highway Station. Instead of running away to ensure the safety for his own life first, as many of us would reflexively do in similar situations, a Taoist-Buddhist site foreman rushed into it to alert his workers toiling away underground, oblivious of the mortal danger to himself, &amp; yelling at the top of his voice for all of his workers to evacuate quickly. Going deeper to continue his yelling to make sure, alas! he ended up being the only casualty of that disastrous collapse &amp; was interred in-situ forever, as frantic efforts to locate &amp; retrieve his body were unsuccessful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who was he? Well, he was the late Mr Heng Yeow Peow, the 40-year-old site foreman then. As a Christian, I was so amazed with such a marvelous &amp; ultimate act of heroism of this Taoist-Buddhist Singaporean. Many were, and I joined in the fund-raising campaign started by his caring and quick-reacting MP Ms Irene Ng (Tampines GRC), as Mr Heng was the sole breadwinner of his family.</p>
              </span><strong><span lang="EN">
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my 28/4/04 letter of encouragement to his grief-stricken wife Mrs Sally Heng, sent through their MP (who is a Christian), I enclosed a POSB cheque for a small donation of $50. I also wrote: "He will always be remembered for his amazing selflessness. And <span style="font-size: medium; color: #ff0000;">I will suggest to our Prime Minister [Goh Chok Tong then] to set up a scheme to award and remember heroes like [her] husband." I was so pleased Mr Wong Kan Seng then came up with the posthumous "Award for Valour" for the late Mr Heng. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Evidently, the kind Ms Irene Ng liked my suggestion, and had transmitted it higher up.
              </span></p><p> </p>
              
              <p>However, I am not sure whether I was the only one who wrote to suggest to the authorities for the memorialising of Mr Heng Yeow Peow's amazing and tragic gallantry.</p>
              </span><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium; color: #ff0000;"><strong>
              </strong></span></p><p><strong>I would be very sad if I was indeed the only one who thought and wrote to suggest it.</strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span lang="EN">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Had Mr Heng been born in ancient Athen 2,400 years ago, odes would have been composed for him too. The brainy columnist of the Straits Times Mr Andy Ho wrote that "In laying down his life [for others], Yeow Peow exemplified an ideal that the ancient Greco-Roman philosophers had extolled for such noble deaths as the ultimate act of friendship." Sadly, no ode had been written by any of our Singapura bards for Yeow Peow. "How can we excuse ourselves for not memorialising his sacrifice as the highest form of citizenship?", Mr Andy Ho chided. (ST 3/9/09, pg A23).</p>
              </span></strong></span></strong></strong><p></p>
              <span lang="EN">
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">I fully agree. Hence I would suggest that Taoist, Buddhists and others should support my intention to write to Minister of Transport Mr Raymond Lim for a plaque to be properly designed and displayed in Nicoll MRT Station for the story of this amazing MR Heng Yeow Peow to be memorialised, as his self-sacrificing value is one that we greatly cherish, or should cherish in Singapore. <br><br>This is also what my Lord Jesus has said: "Greater love has no man than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends." John 15:13. <br><br>But we don't all need to die for others in a tragic death, like what Mr Heng went through. Singaporeans just need to be imbued with the great spirit of altruism---always wanting to do good to others and to help improve our society. This will be our way to help PM Lee HL build for us a loving, caring and a great and enlightened Singaporean society. Then one day we can proudly proclaim our beloved Singapore to others as "An Island of Miracles!" (re MP Baey Yam Keng). <br><br>Even if we fail to achieve this noble goal, what we would have achieved would be by itself most rewarding and amazing too. <br><br>So "Inspire me, Lord, to be thankful to Thee for Thy favours to me and my loved ones to do good deeds which will please Thee. Admit me, through Thy mercy, to be among Thy righteous. " An-Naml 27:19. "For the noblest in God's sight is he who is the most righteous." Al-Hujurut 49:13. <br><br>Ameen! </span></strong></p>

              me, through Thy mercy, to be among Thy righteous. " An-Naml 27:19.

              <p>   If that so and so pastor say that christians don't fear ghost or ghost do not exist, they are utterly wrong because i have a philipine colleague whom is a staunch christian having the ability to see ghost and is extremely fearful of them . He have told us numerouse stories of ghost following him or chit chatting around him when he was slping in one of our system rooms .And once he couldn't wait to get out of the station ard 3am and had to wait till 5am then he dash out of the station .</p>
              <p>I ever ask him , " i thought christians don't belive in ghost at all but since you can see them then how you explain ? " To this he just keep quiet and walk off .</p>
              <p>   If anyone had played the PS3 or PSP game Dantes Inferno , they would know that the main hero of the game was fooled by their pastor into believing that their pastor had " absolved " them of all their sins and will certanly go to heaven only to find see his comrades whom were " absolved of all sins together with him " suffering in hell . And only then he realised that their pastor had fooled them .</p>
              <p>  Pastor is still a human , and so does the pope .... being in the news for all the wrong reasons . It does not mean just because they are pastor or pope mean they know everything or are angel . The mouth is theirs , they can claim alot of things using their mouth but how true is it , nobody knows cause everyone just believe them blindly .</p>
              <p>  But i really strongly urge the govt to prosecute those pastors to send them to jail or at least remove them of their position . Otherwise they will just do it again and again and again with no end . After all its just a visit to thre ISD with no criminal records . Just some word of apologise and they can carry on behind closed doors insulting other religions .</p>
              <p>  A word to those who do not know buddhist karma for insulting buddhist and taoist doctrines and teachings , it would be suffering in hell for all eternity .</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px;">i was staying in pasir ris for about 6 years,since 1993.......somehow this rumour is quite true.<br><br>i am from a christian family,thus my mum would always put a cross on our main door.somehow in early 1998 when we are moving out after selling the five-room flat away,my mum removed the cross two week before moving out,and strange things start hapening.<br><br>I used to have the habit of watching tv till past midnight.That night happened that my mum was out-stationed,and my dad wasn't back yet.My grandma was sleeping with me in my room because there was air-con in my room.I have a small dog at home,which would also sleep with me in my room when my mum was not in.<br><br>That particular night,my dog just refused to accompany me out to the living room to watch tv.thus i started to feel that the dog might be able to sense something.....but i didn't want to missed that night's programme as there's my favourite artiste.So i opened my room door and when out into the living room.It was about 11.50pm......I can feel my hair stand when i walked out......then i on all the ceiling lights.Even there are 5 large bulbs,but the living room still seems to be so gloomy.Usually we wouldm only on 3 out of the 5 bulbs,the whole living room would be very brightly lighted....<br><br>I on the tv,and went to the toilet in my kitchen.Althought he kitchen was directly beside the living room,but it seems ok there. After that i went back to my living room and sit comfortably in my sofa,hlding my tv and vcr remote control,preparing to record the programme.The first 20 minutes was ok,until about 12.15am,i started to hear knocking on my balcony and living room windows.the balcony windows and living room windows are aligned in one straight line,but we stick those stickers on the windows glass so that nobody could see through.That night all the windows in the house were left closed,and i did not open it when i was watching tv.For the next 30 min,i could see shadows flying right and left,knocking on the windows.I know it isn't human,because my unit wasn't those corridor unit when our neighbours could walk passed.And mine is the 8th floor.Nobody could knock on the windows unless he or she could fly???<br><br>Finally the programme ended at 12.45am.Immediately i off the tv and the fan,dare not look back.I off the lights and rush into my bedroom as fast as i could,and locked my room door.I saw my dog still hiding under my bed,seems to be a little frightened.I did not sleep immediately,still wondering what was outside.<br><br>about 1.30am,i heard my dad opening the main door,then after that i dozed off.Next morning,i almost forgot the whole incident until my grandma mentioned that my dad experienced 'something ' the night before.<br><br>He took a bath after he came back,then when he was about to sleep,he heard a woman crying very loudly.He thought it was my neighbour whom had a quarrel with her husband as sometimes they really did.So he open the window to check,all my neighbours seems aslept.The crying continued the whole night until 5+ in the morning.In the end he couldn't sleep at all.But something was really amiss.my room and just beside the masterbedroom,how come my grandma and i hear nothing at all?<br><br>eversince that incident,the new owner who bought over my house came a few times with their new-born baby,the baby cried everytime they enter the living room,and stopped crying immediately they went out to the corridor.After we moved out,many things happened when they moved in.Their maid even fell down and hurt herself badly while doing house work.....well,nothing could explained,but i guess everyone roughly knew what's that "thing"......to add on,the flat is in pasir ris st 11,and they have just bulid a nkf at the void deck........i don't want to mention the block number,but i assume some of those who stayed around there knows which block has an nkf at the void deck....</span></p>

              <p>My friend told me she and her colleague went oversea for assignment. Her colleague did not wish to share room with her though she suggested. Her colleague is a Christian and does not believe ghosts exist. That night,  she changed hotel room in the middle of the night, telling the hotel staff that her room was haunted, there was something disturbing her.</p>
              <p>For non Christians, we will usually chant and the thing will go away or at least we will sleep through for that night. This lady couldn't even wait till the next morning ha ha ha.........</p>

              <p>   If that so and so pastor say that christians don't fear ghost or ghost do not exist, they are utterly wrong because i have a philipine colleague whom is a staunch christian having the ability to see ghost and is extremely fearful of them . He have told us numerouse stories of ghost following him or chit chatting around him when he was slping in one of our system rooms .And once he couldn't wait to get out of the station ard 3am and had to wait till 5am then he dash out of the station .</p>
              <p>I ever ask him , " i thought christians don't belive in ghost at all but since you can see them then how you explain ? " To this he just keep quiet and walk off .</p>
              <p>   If anyone had played the PS3 or PSP game Dantes Inferno , they would know that the main hero of the game was fooled by their pastor into believing that their pastor had " absolved " them of all their sins and will certanly go to heaven only to find see his comrades whom were " absolved of all sins together with him " suffering in hell . And only then he realised that their pastor had fooled them .</p>
              <p>  Pastor is still a human , and so does the pope .... being in the news for all the wrong reasons . It does not mean just because they are pastor or pope mean they know everything or are angel . The mouth is theirs , they can claim alot of things using their mouth but how true is it , nobody knows cause everyone just believe them blindly .</p>
              <p>  But i really strongly urge the govt to prosecute those pastors to send them to jail or at least remove them of their position . Otherwise they will just do it again and again and again with no end . After all its just a visit to thre ISD with no criminal records . Just some word of apologise and they can carry on behind closed doors insulting other religions .</p>
              <p>  A word to those who do not know buddhist karma for insulting buddhist and taoist doctrines and teachings , it would be suffering in hell for all eternity .</p>

              <p>Other religion followers are afraid because they believe the existence of ghosts and they admit they are afraid. Christians are different, they believe there are no ghosts so it is very funny that they are afraid of ghosts.</p>
              <p>Hasene can be my witness lor, she is like me encounter Christians who are afraid of idols. If Christians are not afraid of idols, why they are not allowed to enter temples ?Unlike followers of other religion, we go everywhere without fear, be it Church, Taoist or Buddhist Temples, Mosque et.c. No fear at all. I have seen Muslims go to Buddhist Lodge to apply for bursaries.</p>

              <p>Rony Tan offered tea and apologised to the abbott of Bright Hill Temple. I think this guy should offer tea and apologise to Kuan Kong ( the deity that he insulted). See I told you guys right, make fun of ghosts or deities will not be let off easily. He gave his sermon in 2008, he would never imagine that he will get into hot soup 2 years later. ä¸�æ˜¯ä¸�æŠ¥ï¼Œå�ªæ˜¯æ—¶è¾°æœªåˆ°ã€‚</p>
