Its because i heard that the bible discourages us to divorce, thus, i thought that it is correct to get married<br><br>Oh ya, and plus the important fact that God created Eve as Adam needed a partner. Therefore, it is natural to think that God has the intention of wanting us to get married. Plus the fact that marriages are mostly held in churches and how solemn the vows are and stuffs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not everybody is called to married life. But those who are should live it well.<br><br>From the Catechism:<br><br>1603 "The intimate community of life and love which constitutes the married state has been established by the Creator and endowed by him with its own proper laws. . . . God himself is the author of marriage."87 The vocation to marriage is written in the very nature of man and woman as they came from the hand of the Creator. Marriage is not a purely human institution despite the many variations it may have undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures, and spiritual attitudes. These differences should not cause us to forget its common and permanent characteristics. Although the dignity of this institution is not transparent everywhere with the same clarity,88 some sense of the greatness of the matrimonial union exists in all cultures. "The well-being of the individual person and of both human and Christian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal and family life."89</div>
