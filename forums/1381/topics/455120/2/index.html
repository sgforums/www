              <p>But they are NOT the same in the sense that their claims are the same or are equally true. So it is misleading to say that all religions are the same, which is why there is a need for me to ask you to qualify what you mean by that.</p>

              <p>Islam is also a faith with an Abrahamic God. Same as Judaism.</p>
              <p>Abraham seems to be a figure of some significance...</p>
              <p>Here's a perspective (from a Christian):</p>
              <p>Muslims
               believe they are the rightful heir to the promise because they are of 
              the stock of the firstborn son - Ishmael (Ismail). But Ishmael was born 
              from a maidservant, not Abraham's rightful wife Sarah. (Ishmael was born
               before Isaac)</p>
              <p>Jews believe they are the rightful heir to the promise because 
              they are of the stock of the true firstborn son - Isaac who was born as a
               miracle and fulfilment of God's miracle to let a 99 year old woman bear
               a child.</p>
              <p>Christians believe that Abraham as the father of faith 
              is an allegory to the coming of Christ and his bride. And only those who
               believe "The just shall live by faith" are true heirs of Abraham. 
              Galatians 3:29 "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, 
              and heirs according to the promise." Those who are born of the flesh are not heirs, but those who are born of the Spirit are.</p>
              <p>How's that for confusion?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, what's 
              the big deal about "the promise"? It seems like the first born has a 
              divine legal right to the claim of "family inheritance". It seems like a
               universal spiritual truth, regardless of cultures. Crown princes are 
              ascended to the throne after the king's death by order of rightful 
              inheritance - the eldest son is usually the first to such claim.</p>
              <p>The
               promise is important I guess because of the claim to God's protection, 
              blessing and inheritance. It makes LEGAL claim of "covenant". If heaven 
              were a court of law, it would then make sense to make that claim.</p>

              <p>I am aware. Hence the difference between all 3 Abrahamic faiths.</p>
              <p>"Jesus" has a VERY insulting name by the Jews. "Yeshua" is often called "Yeshu" by them, which means, "may his name be forgotten".</p>
              <p>Muslims view Jesus as a prophet and no more. No divinity involved. Jesus is known as "Isa" in the Quran.</p>

              Perhaps more interesting is that all atheists, which includes you, claim that all religions are false because they are deluded.
              
              <p>Tcmc, would you care to confirm if the above statement is true or false?
