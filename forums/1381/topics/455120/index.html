              <p>Actually my point is that it is absurd to label as arrogance a claim to truth. It is purely ad hominem in nature. We do not call people who insist that 2+2=4 arrogant, right? The claim to exclusive truth is either right or wrong, and the focus should be on establishing that, rather than attacking the person which actually deflects from the proper consideration of the claim to the claimant. The claimant is not on trial, the claim is. Of course one can be arrogant in the way one proclaims the truth, but truth in itself is not arrogant.</p>

              <p>Truth is truth, and by definition exclusive, regardless whether it is mathematical/analytical truths like 2+2=4 or synthetic propositions/truths like whether there is a God. Moreover the existence of God is not a subjective truth but an objective truth. His existence is INDEPENDENT on what one thinks/feels/believe. There is nothing arrogant about the claim or belief that God exists. Again it is a matter of whether the claim or belief is true. A person can be arrogant, but not a claim or a belief. It is not a matter of being hasty, but whether there are good reasons to back up the claim.</p>

              <p>Wrong. Just because an issue is debatable does not mean there is no truth to be known. Like I said, God's existence is a matter of truth, He either exists or He does not, regardless of whether we debate about it or not.</p>
              <p>There are numerous proofs or lines of evidence that supports theism, to say that only the Bible is proof is wrong.</p>
              <p>Yes, our beliefs are different, opposite and contradictory in fact. But either we are both wrong or one of us is right about the beliefs we hold. This is common sense logic that you cannot deny or challenge.</p>

              <p>The difference may be mere academic. Anyway, if a belief corresponds to reality, that IS the truth. Just because something is debatable does not mean a position taken is not the truth. Whoever defends a view considers it the truth, i.e affirms the existence of objective truth.</p>
