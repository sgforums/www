              <p>Anyway, I really wonder what is really your motive for bringing in the Islam religion here in this forum. Are you trying to stir up a debate between Islam and Christianity while you then sit back and watch the show? As an atheist you should not be focusing on theology per se, but on whether you have a good defence or a good reason for being an atheist and believing that there is no God to whom you are accountable to.</p>

              <p>Don't act so patronising lah, it sounds very fake and hypocritical for you to talk about God watching when you don't even believe God exists.</p>
              <p>You do no justice to both Christianity and Islam by being shoddy and flippant in your treatment of their doctrines and beliefs. Islam's God is unitarian whereas Christianity's God is trinitarian. So what are you talking about being essentially the same God?</p>
              <p>Again why should the Scriptures pander to your personal whims? God has revealed very clearly truths about Himself. It is YOUR failure to put together the truths God has revealed, lacking the initiative to find things out for yourself. The early creeds of the church all teach the doctrine of the triune Godhead.</p>

              <p>Wrong again. There are people who have made up their minds after evaluating the debates. You don't need to know everything to decide on something. Just like in an actual public debate, one can actually vote on who has made the stronger case. You can of course refuse to personally commit to believe in it (faith issue) but you can affirm that the case is stronger on one side than the other. </p>

              <p>You do no justice to both Christianity and Islam by being shoddy
              and flippant in your treatment of their doctrines and beliefs.
              Islam's God is unitarian whereas Christianity's God is trinitarian.
              So what are you talking about being essentially the same God?</p>
              <p>Again why should the Scriptures pander to your personal whims?
              God has revealed very clearly truths about Himself. It is YOUR
              failure to put together the truths God has revealed, lacking the
              initiative to find things out for yourself. The early creeds of the
              church all teach the doctrine of the triune Godhead.</p>

              <p>In Pakistan, a 12 year old christian girl diagnosed with Parkinsons was charged with insulting the islamic god under their blashemy law which has death sentence.</p>

              <p>After all, everybody who belief in god, belief that god is almighty and powerful, isn't it?</p>
              <p>So why does god need the help of jihadist and blashemy law to protect his self-image when he can easily wipe humanity off the surface of earth?</p>

              <p><br>Either God is watching me or He is not. What is your answer? My conscience is clear since I am not denying any doctrine of the faith but your intellectual honesty is in trouble.</p>
              <p>You show me a Christian who believes that Allah in Islam is the same as God in the Bible and I will show you a false believer. Such a believer must deny that Jesus is God incarnate if he wishes to hold on to the Islam notion of God.</p>
              <p>The Bible is very clear in what it teaches. Christians use common sense and logic to conclude that from certain clear and undeniable facts that are presented in the Bible, namely that the Father is God, that the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, that all three Persons are God and yet the Bible teaches that there is only one God. It's a mystery no doubt, but not to be denied simply because it is perplexing. See <a href="http://carm.org/debate-topic-trinity-doctrine-biblical">http://carm.org/debate-topic-trinity-doctrine-biblical</a></p>
              <p>There is debate over the issue of Trinity only because people do not accept the Word of God as it is. They feel offended that God cannot be put into a nice little mental box. Why would anyone want to invent a doctrine that would be the cause of much dissension? If Christianity is really man made then why not remove it to appease people like you?</p>
