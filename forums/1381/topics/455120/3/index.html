              <p>I think i have been more exposed to other religions than you, but of course you can share with me your exposure to other religions too. :)</p>
              <p>I have been a taoist/buddhist (yes separately) and then christian and now irreligious.</p>
              <p>I practiced taoism in its ceremonies, the gods' festivals, teachings, praying etc. Buddhism, I visited temples, meditated on buddha's teachings and even became a vegetarian for some time. For christianity, i worshiipped, prayed to jesus, believed the scriptures and served "god" and "his" people.</p>
              <p>Apart from that, i have visited hindu temples, spoke to hindus in the temple about their gods and worship and read their scriptures. I also visited mosques and almost converted to islam when i read the quran.</p>

              <p>If it all boils down to just matters of belief and not a claim with respect to what is, then why are atheists so averse to admitting that all he has is a matter of belief and faith?</p>
              <p>All beliefs, unless it is mere intellectual assent, requires faith.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you should know that PZ Myers, a very vocal atheist and well-known anti-creationist (I'll forgive you for your ignorance of him as well), did not have nice words for such lame antics. Here's what he wrote:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Boy, I really do hate these guys (<span style="color: #000000;">fellow atheists who are not happy with Myers</span>). You’ve got a discussion going, talking about why you’re an atheist, or what atheism should mean to the community, or some such topic that is dealing with our ideas and society, and some smug wanker comes along and announces that “Atheism means you lack a belief in gods. Nothing more. Quit trying to add meaning to the term.” As if atheism can only be some platonic ideal floating in virtual space with no connections to anything else; as if atheists are people who have attained a zen-like ideal, their minds a void, containing nothing but atheism, which itself is nothing. Dumbasses."</span></p>
