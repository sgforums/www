One is our physical father, the other is our spiritual Father. The reason Christianity is under religion category because it has to be under some category afterall right? So the authory has to put them under religion lo. </blockquote>Aiyoh... u believe in a supernatural being and u believe u can have a relationship with it. This already clearly show u r in a religion. Wat is wrong with the word religion ?<br><br><blockquote>How are you going to nuture your marriage or dating period? By spending time with your lover, right!? We spend time to build up relationship with the One True God, who guard our spirit -- the one who can destroy the body and the spirit. Man can only destroy the body but not the spirit. Who should we be afraid of more?</blockquote>Spending time with lover I can understand because she is there standing in front of me. For god... err...  spending time with it is like spending time with an imaginary friend...<br><br><blockquote>aiya .. denomination is man made lah .. at the end of the day can still worship as one body in Christ - Campus Crusade is one good example.</blockquote>if denomination is man made, then isn't religion man made as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> There r some christ believers which r branded as cults. So u think they worship as one body in christ with u as well ? In a more general sense muslim and jews r also worshipping the same god. So u call them your brothers or start a crusade to kill them ?<br><br></div>

We study the bible not to quote here and there but to try to practice it. The bible is the authority from God and He commands us to practices it. So we defend our faith and teach God's words based on the bible.<br><br>You can't generalize all christians to be like those you have come across. This is an unfair statements and is biased (there is a more proper word, but I forget. Will replace it when I remember. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ). And the opinions of some christians, if that is true, does not represent the opinions of the Church.<br><br>Since neither of us do not know the degree of relationships of fellow christians, it would be unwise to argue further. And since you do not know what is happening, you should not make sweeping statements that christians are not united based on what you heard, seen, and think!<br><br>It is clear to me (in your posts) that you like to quote sources from everywhere to your advantages, even if you may not know how true it is.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Did i generalise? Gee, i re-read my posts and i dont see anything that hint of generalising.<br><br>And you dont get the point. We are talking abt humans. If you want to gloss over the fact humans are a very divisive lot, it doesnt work.<br><br>I think few weeks ago I introduced few terms, like Arianism and Monarchianists. It was surprising hardly any christian know them. Martin Luther isnt the first to break away from RC. 156 years after the death of christ, there were numerous divisions in the christian community, even when the RC was at its infant stage. Some of them dont believe in the holy trinity, and were persecuted for that. Thanks to Constantine and the Council of St Nicea, you guys now strictly believe in the holy trinity. i wonder what would have happen if these other guys fought thru.<br><br>Lets not just mention the Massacre of St Bartholomew Day. the debate in this forum, for example, between the RCs and Protestants already show the very deep fundamental divides. No matter how much you guys want to hug or embrace one another, or whatever,  a significant amt of divide is already a big diivide, or divides if you please.<br><br></div>
