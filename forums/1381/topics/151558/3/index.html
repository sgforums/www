I hope most of you all have seen what is happening in the news around the world but if you haven't or don't have time, pls take some time to read up. Pls read what Jesus said to His disciples regarding the end times in the gospels esp Matthew. Everything said has happened or are happening at an increasing frenzy. Even S'pore isn't spared from earthquakes. Many ppl from my blk ran downstairs during the shaking last yr. I felt the big tremor but went back to sleep anyway bcos I know Christ will keep me safe &amp; if i were to die, i will go up. Nobody knows the hour or time so don't try to calculate bcos u just won't be able to. God is God &amp; He is supreme. He won't share His glory with us. Only God the Father knows the time. &amp; He is very holy. Nothing unholy or sinful can stand in His sight bcos all evil will b burned up. Now is the end of the end times. So take heed how you walk.</div>

The generation in Jesus' time passed away but only the Temple &amp; Israel were destroyed so the end came to them. So only partial fulfillment. So which gen was He referring to for the 2nd Coming?

And one generation is usually 70-80 yrs according to David's lifespan then &amp; according to Psalm 90 by Moses w/c stated man can only live 70-80 y.o. under law. Read it for yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that this prophecy interpretation is quite interesting.<br><br>It takes abt 70 years (roughly) for the Isarel and the temple to be destroyed. Then it take another 70 years (roughly) for Israel to be re-built. Then probably, it takes another 70 years (roughly) for the 3rd temple to be re-built. And so, Jesus is returning in another 70 years (roughly) from the date Isarel is formed. And we have 3 x 70. Oh dear, this remain me of the book Daniel.<br><br>The bottomline is: No one knows the exact date.</div>

After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever" (1Thessalonians 4:16-17).<br><br>The Second Coming of Christ will not occur until after certain other end times events take place (2 Thessalonians 2:4; Matthew 24:15-30; Revelation chapters 6-18 ). The Rapture is imminent, it could take place at any moment (Titus 2:13; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:50-54). The Second Coming would be the second literal return of Christ to earth as King in power and glory to rule for a thousand years. It was Christ who first announced His future return after He told His own of His certain death.  Those who witnessed Christ ascension into heaven after His death heard the angels declare in Acts 1:11, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven."<br><br>The Rapture is the removal of believers from the earth as an act of deliverance (1 Thessalonians 4:13-17; 5:9). The Second Coming includes the removal of unbelievers as an act of judgment (Matthew 24:40-41).<br></div>

God is very holy. We must take care not to call out His name in vain. Just to be safe. U don't know who is in the big audience.
