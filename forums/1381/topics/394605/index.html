              <h3>Born on December 25th</h3>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Prior
              to its celebration as the birthday of Jesus Christ, the 25th of
              December/winter solstice was the birthday for a number of
              other gods including Adonis, Mithra and the Dionysus. So too, this annual
              celebration in Egypt concerning the sun god, which represents the
              "birth" of the "new sun" after the "old sun" "dies" around December
              21st (in the northern hemisphere), lying in his "tomb" or "cave" for
              three days and on December 25th being "born again."...</span></p>

              <h3 dir="ltr">Horus and the Virgin Isis-Mery</h3>
              <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
              assertion that Horus's mother was a virgin can also be found in the
              Book of the Dead, in which the deceased identifies himself
              as Horus and says: "I know that I have been conceived by Sechit and
              that I am born of Neith."...</span></p>
              <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-small;">...in
              this ancient text we possess an identification of the mother of Horus
              as the goddess Neith, who is by all accounts a virgin mother from
              thousands of years prior to the Christian era. In fact, some
              scholarship provides for estimates of the pre-historic Neith's worship
              dating back some 7,000 years.</span></p>
              <p>The list of pre-Christian gods, heroes,
              kings and queens who were said to have been "born of a
              virgin" or miraculously born includes the following:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Krishna</li>

              <h3>Horus of Egypt</h3>
              <p>The Egyptian sun god Horus, who predated the
              Christ character by thousands of years, shares the following in
              common with Jesus:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <div>Horus was born of the virgin
                               Isis-<em>Meri</em> on December 25<sup>th</sup> in a manger with his birth being
                               announced by a star in the East and attended
                               by wise men.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>At age 12, he was a child teacher in the Temple,
                          and at 30, he was baptized, having disappeared for
                          18 years.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>Horus was baptized in the river Eridanus or
                          Iarutana (Jordan) by "Anup the Baptizer" ("John the
                          Baptist"), who was decapitated.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He had 12 disciples, two of whom were his
                          "witnesses" and were named "Anup" and "Aan" (the
                          two "Johns").</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He performed miracles like WALKING ON WATER, exorcised demons.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He was CRUCIFIED, buried for three days in
                          a tomb, and resurrected.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He was also the "Way, the Truth, the Light,"
                          "Messiah," "God's Anointed Son," the "Son of Man,"
                          the "Good Shepherd,"the "Lamb of God," the "Word
                          of Truth," etc.</div>
              </li>
              <li> </li>
              <li>
              <div>He was "the Fisher" and was associated with the
                          Fish ("Ichthys"), Lamb and Lion.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>He came to fulfill the Law.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>Horus was called "the KRST," or "Anointed
                          One."</div>
              </li>
              <li>
              <div>Like Jesus, "Horus was supposed to reign one
                          thousand years."</div>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition, in the catacombs at Rome and
              elsewhere are images of the baby Horus being held by the
              virgin mother Isis--the original "Madonna and Child."
              Furthermore, inscribed about 3,500 years ago on the walls of
              the <a title="Temple of Luxor Nativity Scene" href="http://truthbeknown.com/luxor.html">Temple at Luxor</a> were images of a sort
                 of "Annunciation," "Miraculous Conception," Birth and
                 Adoration of the pharaoh Amenhotep III (Horus), with
                 Thoth announcing to the queen that she will conceive; with
                 the god Amun impregnating the queen; and with the infant
                 being attended by three "kings" bearing gifts.</p>
