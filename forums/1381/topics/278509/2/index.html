And there in Exodus the word "day" means a literal 24-hour day.<br><br>Ex 20:9 Six <strong>days</strong> shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br><br>10 But the seventh <strong>day</strong> is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:<br><br>11 <span style="color: red;">For in six <strong>days</strong> the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh <strong>day</strong>: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</span><br><br><strong>About: </strong><br><br>Joh 5:17  But Jesus answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and I have been working."<br><br>God has always been a worker. God created the universe in six days. And there after rested or ceased from His work of Creation. After that He began the work of Sustaining His creation.<br><br>When man fell, God then began His redemptive work. Soveriegnly controlling Providence for the Son to come into the world. Now He is still working preserving His redeemed, convicting sinners, saving sinners, sustaining His creation, controlling Providence, doing good to all [evil and good alike].<br><br>He is working. A new creation is coming: a new earth, a new heaven where righteousness dwells forever. For one to be a part of that, one must first be a <strong>new creature</strong> in Christ.<br><br>2Co 5:17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<br><br>The word "new" actually means to renew.  And that entails work.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I always enjoy reading your replies. But I'm afraid I have to deviate a little with regards to some of your points.<br><br>Your contention was that the Genesis account was referring to 24-hour days on basis of how the same word was used in Genesis itself.<br><br>I just checked against the Strong's Concordance and found that the word (Yom) that was used for "Day" appears some 2239 times in the Old Testament!<br><br>And the word was used in all possible contexts, referring to both literal and figurative days. It was taken to mean morning, 24-hour days, years, space, etc<br><br>In Deu 4:30 it was taken to mean an "age"<br><br>From that alone thus, I don't think we can conclude that a day constituted a 24-hour day.<br><br>Besides as Icemoon pointed out earlier, the Jewish concept of day and night (sundown and sunrise) could not have existed in the first "3 days" because there was no sun!
