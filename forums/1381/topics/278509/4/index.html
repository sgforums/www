Their translation of verse 1 is in agreement with what we find in a Jewish Bible translated into English. I quote from the Judaica Press Complete Tanach:<br><br><blockquote>1. In the beginning of God's creation of the heavens and the earth.<br>2. Now the earth was astonishingly empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water.</blockquote></div>
