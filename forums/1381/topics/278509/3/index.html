            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa. vince and Ice have said almost everything I wanted to say. Creationists are essentially fundamentalists who wrap themselves thinly in the veil they call "Science" (sarcasm is meant). It's embarrassing to see how some Christians choose to conduct themselves in areas where they should know better. Science in itself is no way to deal with the existence of God, or whether He performed His miracles this way, or another way.<br><br>To be honest, I've been hanging out in the "Religion" section in the library for quite a bit, and there are actually some well-argued and substantial scientific arguments that reconcile Creation (on the scale of the Universe; humans aren't covered in the research paper I read) and science. The whole concept of space-time is really intriguing.</div>
