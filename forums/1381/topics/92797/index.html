            <div class='col-md body'>I will attempt to answer your question with the understanding that yours is a genuine query, not an attempt to draw anyone into a theological debate.<br><br>I came to know Christ through a gospel rally at Orchard Rd Presbyterian Church.<br>I was not in an emotional crisis,<br>I was not in pain,<br>I was not in financial difficult,<br>I was not in need of a miracle.<br><br>Since then,<br>I did not speak in tongues,<br>Healed anyone or was healed of anything<br>Did not become extremely wealthy but lead a comfortable life with my loved ones.<br><br>Is Jesus real to me? Yes. But I cannot make Jesus real to you. Jesus can only be real to you if you let Him.<br><br>I cannot prove to anyone that God exists to them. I am only convinced that God exists for me.<br><br>In the most basic sense, one can either choose to believe that God exist or God does not exist. If at the end of it all, when I die, and that there is no God, it does not matter.<br>However, if God exists and I choose not to acknowledge Him when I am alive, I am in deep shit.<br>Of course, this explanation is really too simple to explain the concept of faith.<br><br>If there is no God, the argument ends here. No issue, when we are alive, we may be living a lie, but who cares, so what!<br><br>If there is a God, how then we know which religion points to the right God. I really have no answer for this. How then can we please God if God exists?<br>By works? What then is good work, and what is inadequate good work? Good work by itself does not acknowledge one's acceptance of the authority of God, it merely points that one is able to be morally correct. So to me, good works is really a poor measure of one's religious affiliation.<br><br>Hence, the Christian faith comes in: the criteria that one must consciously accept the existing of God and the redemptive work of Christ to erase one's sins.<br><br>Then the next sticky question is the one in the other thread: what happens to people who HAS NOT heard the gospel. Theologians have many view to this and while I don't pretend to be a theologian, my opinion is that because an individual DID NOT HAVE THE CHANCE to hear the gospel, God will judge them on a separate yardstick.<br><br>I probably am not able to give you all the answers, because each answer will lead to more questions.<br><br>But personally, as long as I am convinced that my Lord Jesus is real to me is sufficient. His Grace Is Sufficient For Me.</div>

Why ? Because in the chain mail, it would state a curse to u if u do not forward to people and a reward if u did. Going by your theory, if the curse it true, and u follow its instructions, then u will have escape from it and can accept the coming reward. If it is false, u do not lose anything isn't it ? U will be in deep @^#! if it is true right ? So do u forward the dumb spam email to people everytime u receive it ? In fact, if someone just come up with any hocus pocus curse or reward on u, will u follow its instructions ? Lets say an old granny place a curse on the world saying tat those who do not lick their toes will lose ten years of their lives and if u follow it, u will gain an additional 10 years. Will u just follow it "to be safe than sorry" ?<br><br>Sorry  man.. I not the kind of person who will forward any dumb chain letters to people or afraid of nonsensical curses.

Jesus say it himself, the only way for salvation is through he himself and no other way. No seperate yardstick here.

Having said that, I do not deny the possibility of the existence of the supernatural or the paranormal. Do you, in your logic discount the existence of the paranormal? Base from what you have written so far, I am guessing that you would probably not accept the existence of the supernatural and the paranormal. Do they exist? I don't know. Do you think there are spirits? I am not sure, but one time, I saw something that should not be in the place it was in. Did I freaked out? No, Why???<br><br>The context of the Christian faith is that my God is more powerful that all the supernatural that the world has to offer. So the curses, if real, would not matter. IF AT THIS POINT, YOU THINK THAT I AM CONTINUING TO BE STUPID, I REITERATE: IT'S OK WITH ME.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">But now u r alive.

It is difficult to give you a rationale... It is like if you ask me why I love my wife. I can give you a multitude of reasons but you will still not able to understand it. The only way you can understand it if you are in love with the same person as I am in love with.

Wat other benefits could I have gained from tis ?<br></div></blockquote>I can start to assume your motives to be innocent, but you are not making this easy. Please don't take my next remarks personally:<br>1, your style of writing is extremely confrontational, and perhaps if you can improve your grammatically style, it may make understanding your writing easier.<br>2. you have stated many times that you do not understanding why people believe in God. Christians here had in many instances attempted to explain. You either choose to ignore the answers or choose to disagree with the answers. This being which, makes sharing with you extremely difficult. You may have already noticed that you are beginning to be ignored. I wanted to ignore you too, but I cannot. I do enjoy most of your questions, I helps reinforcing my personal belief in God.<br><br>Again, I wish to state that I am not trying to insult you, just a feedback, if you are willing to accept (again, you do not have to agree). Also note from the various comments given to you previously from other forumites that there is some element of truth in my points above.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">I thought tis is a forum ?

From another viewpoint, I am not specifically targetting just at u, but at the other people guilty of the things I had said.<br></div></blockquote>Yes this is a forum, but I think that there are rules, written or unwritten. In a previous topic, in bar, I had defended an individual when another forumite insulted his wife. Some of the golden rules that should exist is: do not use vulgarity on another person, another good one is, if you disagree, you need not be offensive. In a way you were targetting at me, because I had shared my personal testimony. I wasn't giving an official "church" or "Christian" stand. I stated what I had gone through and why I had gone through. It's personal and if you don't agree it's ok, but let's just stop there.<br><br>My testimony was an answer to one individual and I had stated in the first para that I do no wish to enter into any theological debate with anyone, least of all  you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Not really. I understand why these people wanna go around to preach their religion. I do not hate them as wat u described. U do not understand why they do tat ? </div></blockquote>People preach for various reasons. Some preach to prove their strong affiliation to God to satisfy their ego, others preach hoping to gain membership. Still others preach because they believe what they believe in is real. I think you fall in the that last category.<br><br>Like it or not, you ARE AN EVANGELIST, with your own gospel, and in many ways you put me to shame. I am not a person who shares the gospel unless asked. Obviously if a question is asked of me on theology I will answer to the best of my knowledge, but I will never dream of entering into House of Feng Shui and starts quoting verses about occult and sorcery.<br></div>

There r so many religion in this world &amp; wat make u so confidence that this is the right 1?? Any other proof other than wat is written in the Bible?</div></blockquote>Actually, I think that all religions came or emanated from the same divine source. This explains why all religions teach the same things. I believe The reason why people argue about the difference in teachings is because of misinterpretation through the scriptures. There is no such thing as the "one true religion" or the "right religion". All paths lead to God. Its just that different people chooses differnt routes.</div>

Although they r from different denomination, they show me the better side of Christianity.<br><br>I'm still struggling with my faith &amp; at times I want to doubt the existence of God. I envy my Christian bro. &amp; sis who is so successful...while I'm such a failure...&amp; I always say that God is unfair.
