              <p>Just want to share with the believers a great video, featuring Nick Vujicic from Australia, a preacher, a motivational speaker. The Lord has used him greatly not only to minister to the Christian community but Nick is also a blessing to the non Christian community, changing lives everywhere he goes.</p>
              <p>Nick is born without arms &amp; legs but his disability did'nt stop him from achieving success in life, changing people's attitude to life especially ministering to the broken hearted. Please enjoy these videos. There are 4 parts to it. There are supposed to be 13 parts but I cut it short to 4 parts.</p>
              <p>P.S - For the Christian haters, this is good news for you. This is not a Christian inclined video.(Wait kena la kopi with ISD) Hope that this video can be an inspiration to you too.</p>

              <p>Chill bro, some of them definitely adore the period when Church rule over the people of Europe so they play the victim card nothing new.</p>
              <p>These people might even think it will be better than now because of those "churches" preaching or worse want it to be revived in Singapore.</p>
