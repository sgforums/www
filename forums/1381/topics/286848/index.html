            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, i can be considered as a baby christian bah. I was called to the altar call on april 2006. I understand that each church, regardless big or small.. has their own direction of doctrine..in their sermons.(or focus bah).<br><br>for example:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New creation church(NCC) </strong></span>talks about the powerful message of Grace, about not living under the law....But people can criticize it as NCC is merely preaching the good news, or that there is a missing balance of Law and grace<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>City Harvest's</strong></span> is routinely criticized for the music career of Ho Yeow San; and for their over-zealous act of forcifully bringing friends to their services or drama events and then by due peer pressure, force their friends to the altar call..<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FCBC</strong></span> is criticized because the Head Pastor's uses magic performances to deliver the gospel. People feel that .. using magic is somehow bad. and being dis-respectful to God<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LightHouse</strong></span> is criticized for their emphasis on Healing...and there are critics who do not believe in those miracle healing services...<br><br>However, if the above 4 mega churchs are not preaching the right word of God, then how did God allow these 4 churches to grow and prosper into Mega churches?. WHy would God for instance bless Ho Yeow San with such a illustrious music career success in the U.S? Why would God bless NCC with such a Huge cash reserve of S$100million!?!?!<br><br>At the same time, there are also the homely, tradition, closely knit family churches.. where their membership is dwindling, or say the existing flock has gotten too close and cosy together that the clique formed is so strong that new comers find it hard to fit into the family church. Some small church may also do certain rituals for the sake of doing it. Yet does it mean that the messenger of God i.e. the Pastor's of these small/family churches are not preaching the right word of god?<br><br>Is it correct to then say that a church who has the annointing of our daddy God and is preaching the right word of God, will be blessed by daddy God to grow in strength to strength be it in numbers and cash reserves.. while those churches who are dwindling.. i can say its because.. they are not delivering the correct message from our daddy God?<br><br>Hmm i know this thread may offend my brothers and sisters from the family churches. I apologize in advance. I just want to sort this out since im still a baby christian Bah.<br><br>Thanks and i look 4ward to hearing your thoughts on this.</div>

The right belief is just to promote the right things isn't it ? If they have enough resources, then they should ask the members to keep the money and not keep asking them to donate for not good reason.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Originally posted in the thread :issue regarding sex ......</strong><br><br>You are a sexual moralist to a fault. But your thinking are all faulty!<br>Since you believed in Creator God and Creation, then:<br>1) First, God created Adam (man). Then he saw Adam was unhappy despite having all the goods things in the Garden of Eden!<br>2) So God make Eve (woman) out of Adam, and from then Adam was satisfied (by sex!).<br>3) Eve was bored with all the fruits she ate except the Apple. Why was the Apple tree in the Garden? Who planted it there?<br>4) Of course, God like Human, put the blame on somebody else (projection). That's how Satan came into being in the form of a serpent.<br>5) From then on, a disappointed God didn't want to do any work anymore!<br>6) So, the Almighty rested, and the rest of creation was carried on by Adam and Eve - that's call procreation!<br>7) Also, that's the reason why Christians today are told to do God's work since God had stopped working!<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="color: red;">I am surprised there was no response from the usual 'people' who normally do not hesistate to ...... been there since 9 Oct!</span></div>
