              <p><br>There are times evil christians do all these because they cannot stand the truth and word of god being presented to them. The truth hurts, touch on their raw nerve.    I have seen practising christians telling the evildoing christians on the truth and word of God and they kena bashed by these evil christians.  THis is called persecution.   No evildoing christians love to practise the truth and word of God and definitely are offended when the truth and word of God are presented to them, it is like exposing their evil ways.   Just like a thief who do not like to be called a thief lol.   </p>
