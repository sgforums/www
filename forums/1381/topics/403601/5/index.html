              <p><span>Well, it took me 9 flight hours, 5 hours
              in Sg and another 5 hours in Taiwan to brush up. Made it to the
              Music 99 award show in Taipei and did another hour.</span></p>
              <p><span>Oh and by the way ? I have just found
              out some sweet juicy info that even Hasene will be thrilled to
              know. A few information Hasene will find it particularly happy
              regarding his assumption, but its like a fraction.. something very
              minor that supports his claim. However, most of<span> </span> the information will totally crush his credibility. All these info
              are related to Sun Ho, from the producers here in Taiwan all the
              way to L.A.<span> </span> The reasons they pushed for her
              album sales, the “compilations” , the MV’s and to understand the
              view of her NOT being the role of a pastors wife, but an artiste.
              Although I myself was quite shock at some of the revelations by
              those that worked closely with her, I consider these information
              confidential. And unless I can divuldge in a way that does no
              breach that confidence, but by saying this.. I am already
              attempting with intention on that breach.<span> </span> Perhaps I will divuldge the info after the CAD investigation on
              CHC, maybe.. depends if I may be in breach of such
              confidence.</span></p>
              <p>Seriusly.. Hasene, what if ur ASSumptions are wrong ?
              Are u going to lick my balls ? Are u another stupid ass who can
              claim to be absolutely right and be wrong later ? It just pretty
              much means u are just full of shit. U talk shit, cant produce shit,
              and shit where u eat.</p>
              <p><span>Hasene, when and if u start something, u
              better finish it. Or else, like in this case, I will finish it for
              you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">In this thread :</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/400671">why did God kill the
              first born of the Eqyptians?</a></p>
              <p>“It was the King that sent order to kill the first
              born.   I don't remember reading that God was the one.” –
              <span style="color: #00b0f0;">Hasene 28May 2010</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">But as u noticed, the topic was
              talking about the Passover incident where an Angel of the Lord was
              sent to kill the first born of those who did not paint the blood of
              the sacrifice on their front door.. And the way the process of
              acquiring the blood was something to do with not breaking any of
              the animal’s bone. However Hasene seems to have mistaken the
              incident where the King of Egypt went to kill all the first born of
              the Isrealites, that’s why Moses was sent floating on the
              river</span>. <span style="color: red;">Either way , if it was an
              omission, clearly he didn’t rectify it, and if its regarding bible
              knowledge, since Hasene claims to know a lot about the Bible, cant
              seem to get one of the most important facts of the Bible, and that
              is the story of Moses right.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">I wonder if anyone pointed him out,
              would he have claimed it was a personal attack ?</span></p>
              <p>“Go read my reply to Great Heavens.    It is not
              always about faith where healing is concerned.</p>

              31 May 2010</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Come to EH, tell people that their
              faith is crappy. *bravo .. clap clap clap* Its all good with
              opinions and all, but obviously this supposedly self-righteous
              person can call other faiths crappy. But of course he will be fast
              to attack others when they do the same thing as him.</span></p>
              <p>“I hope you will use your intellect to understand and not just
              merely follow blindly to comply to not use intellect to understand
              God.   This is a major mistake which I made in the
              past.   It is easy prey on human beings to not use
              intellect so that they can go on to brainwash and people just
              accept whatever that come along.” – <span> </span><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Hasene 02 June 2010</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Unfortunately, he did not consider a
              possibility that due to these contradictions, that the Bible is
              being truthful ? But again, closed mind. Unable to accept
              possibilities. I decided to bring point this mistake out because I
              chanced upon it during my cross examination and decided to give an
              opinion. I am not here to discuss about the credibility of the
              Bible, <span> </span>I hope he doesn’t react as another form
              of attack. Then again, what am I saying.. lol let me make it clear,
              this overall thread, IS intended to attack Hasene’s credibility and
              pretty much his character. I am a man of my words. I said I will
              crush Hasene, and I am in the process of it. Continuing
              on…</span></p>

              <p>on the contrary it's loving enemies at its best. Calling someone to repentance is the best expression of love, especially if that someone is going down the wrong track (e.g. death and destruction, or in this case, error of his ways). Consider James 5:20, "l<span style="font-family: Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 25px; font-size: 15px; color: #1a1a1a;">et him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering <a class="cf" style="text-decoration: none; color: #9ac1d8; font-weight: bold; font-size: 11px; line-height: 11px; vertical-align: text-top; cursor: pointer; border: 0px initial initial;" href="http://www.esvstudybible.org/search?q=James+5%3A20%2CRom+11%3A14"> </a>will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins." </span></p>

              <p>When Jesus say's turn the other cheek, it doesnt mean one should always let others put u down, and put u off.</p>
              <p>What is right is right. What is wrong is wrong. Maybe some will turn the other cheek, there will be others that insist the other party turn the other cheek.</p>
              <p>Under the context of that verse, we have to understand that given the days when slaves have to march with the legion, means if the legions march 1 mile...  u march 2 mile.</p>
