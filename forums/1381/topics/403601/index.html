              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: red;'>Well, it took me 9 flight hours, 5 hours
                                  in Sg and another 5 hours in Taiwan to brush up. Made it to the Music 99 award
                                  show in Taipei and did another hour.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: red;'>Oh and by the way ? I have just found out
                                  some sweet juicy info that even Hasene will be thrilled to know. A few
                                  information Hasene will find it particularly happy regarding his assumption,
                                  but its like a fraction.. something very minor that supports his claim.
                                  However, most of<span>  </span>the information will
                                  totally crush his credibility. All these info are related to Sun Ho, from the
                                  producers here in Taiwan all the way to L.A.<span>  </span>The reasons they pushed for her album sales, the “compilations” , the
                                  MV’s and to understand the view of her NOT being the role of a pastors wife,
                                  but an artiste. Although I myself was quite shock at some of the revelations by
                                  those that worked closely with her, I consider these information confidential.
                                  And unless I can divuldge in a way that does no breach that confidence, but by
                                  saying this.. I am already attempting with intention on that breach.<span>  </span>Perhaps I will divuldge the info after the
                                  CAD investigation on CHC, maybe.. depends if I may be in breach of such
                                  confidence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Seriusly.. Hasene, what if ur ASSumptions are wrong ? Are u going to lick my balls ? Are u another stupid ass who can claim to be absolutely right and be wrong later ? It just pretty much means u are just full of shit. U talk shit, cant produce shit, and shit where u eat.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: red;'>Hasene, when and if u start something, u
                                  better finish it. Or else, like in this case, I will finish it for you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">In this thread :</span> <a href="/forums/1381/topics/400671">why did God kill the
                                  first born of the Eqyptians?</a></p>
              <p>“It was the King that sent order to kill the first born.   I don't
                                  remember reading that God was the one.” – <span style="color: #00b0f0;">Hasene
                                  28May 2010</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">But as u noticed, the topic was talking about the
                                  Passover incident where an Angel of the Lord was sent to kill the first born of
                                  those who did not paint the blood of the sacrifice on their front door.. And
                                  the way the process of acquiring the blood was something to do with not
                                  breaking any of the animal’s bone. However Hasene seems to have mistaken the
                                  incident where the King of Egypt went to kill all the first born of the Isrealites,
                                  that’s why Moses was sent floating on the river</span>. <span style="color: red;">Either way , if it was an omission, clearly he didn’t rectify it, and if
                                  its regarding bible knowledge, since Hasene claims to know a lot about the
                                  Bible, cant seem to get one of the most important facts of the Bible, and that
                                  is the story of Moses right.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">I wonder if anyone pointed him out, would he have
                                  claimed it was a personal attack ? </span></p>
              <p>“Go read my reply to Great Heavens.    It is not always about
                                  faith where healing is concerned.</p>
              <p>A crappy faith indeed.” <span style="color: #00b0f0;">Hasene - 31 May 2010</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Come to EH, tell people that their faith is crappy.
                                  *bravo .. clap clap clap* Its all good with opinions and all, but obviously
                                  this supposedly self-righteous person can call other faiths crappy. But of
                                  course he will be fast to attack others when they do the same thing as him.</span></p>
              <p>“I hope you will use your intellect to understand and not just merely follow
                                  blindly to comply to not use intellect to understand God.   This is a
                                  major mistake which I made in the past.   It is easy prey on human
                                  beings to not use intellect so that they can go on to brainwash and people just
                                  accept whatever that come along.” – <span> </span><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Hasene 02 June 2010</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Unfortunately, he did not consider a possibility
                                  that due to these contradictions, that the Bible is being truthful ? But again,
                                  closed mind. Unable to accept possibilities. I decided to bring point this
                                  mistake out because I chanced upon it during my cross examination and decided
                                  to give an opinion. I am not here to discuss about the credibility of the Bible,
                                  <span> </span>I hope he doesn’t react as another form
                                  of attack. Then again, what am I saying.. lol let me make it clear, this
                                  overall thread, IS intended to attack Hasene’s credibility and pretty much his
                                  character. I am a man of my words. I said I will crush Hasene, and I am in the
                                  process of it. Continuing on…</span></p>

              <p>To be fair, I used the word "minority" because I did meet very few

                                  criticised nor was the person he was replying to, have an opinion at that

              <p><span style="color: red;">I really don’t know what happened during his time in
                  the Christian faith, but obviously, he was not happy and was extremely
                  disappointed. As usual, contradictions and empty promises. What empty promises
                  ? What promises did he make ? Is he another of those that just want blessings,
                  and when he fulfilled the supposedly “requirements” for it and was not blessed
                  or promised in return, he claims empty promises. I wonder during that time did
                  he think God was his slave ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Or perhaps, promises between members of the church
                  ?<span>  </span>Cheated by the Bible ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">But whatever it is, he obviously didn’t get what he
                  wanted, hence, the way he responds to the faith will become obvious as time
                  goes. Talk about the anger n rage within. Hmm… maybe tried to woo some girl.
                  Prayed damn hard and fasted .. but.. cock blocked. lol! I am making assumptions

                  stupid, a little kid , or a rock. A very dense rock. If he suspects Pepper to
                  be Stardust.. seriously, what does that imply ?</span></p>
                  <p><span style="color: red;">Now, I can also come with presuppositions that he
                  doesn’t know what CLONE means. Perhaps Hasene is confused with the word..
                  CLONE.<span>  </span>OF COURSE he did not LITERALLY
                  SAY “Clone” but, apparently, we MUST take it on face value, without any

                  but Hasene<span>  </span>doesn’t seem to be able to
                  comprehend <span> </span>“another liar like rooney9”
                  and somehow really construes them wrongly AGAIN.<span>  </span>But knowing his mistakes, being pointed out
                  of the misunderstanding,<span>  </span>he does not
                  apologise, does not accept error and omit it. All it takes is to say something
                  like <span> </span>“Oops.. my bad, what I was trying
                  to say.. IS I AM NOT A LIAR like Rooney9!” or something equivelant, hell I
                  don’t know. At least something that kinda resembles admission to a mistake.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="color: red;">He has in his pathetic bag of rhetorical tricks

                                      what fuss you made.    YOu can tell him to take back his sorry

              <p>Thought you are wise to read the sorry post by him is not a sincere
                                      one.  Your meddlesome way has gone overboard.</p>

              <p><span style="color: red;">Hasene is like psychic. Or maybe he THINKS he is. He
                                      knows if u are a clone and knows whether u are sincere or not. Like 24/7
                                      pointed it out, a sociopath. The symptoms exhibited are all well documented. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">I don’t know about u guys, but, someone here is
                                      obviously having some serious issue. I apologised too, but I went further by
                                      acknowledging that he will MOST likely construe my apology as insincere. Which
                                      I was right. =) Again. And of course, everyone else is a hypocrite except him
                                      .Or should I say, everyone that does NOT agree with him are hypocrites.</span></p>
              <p>“doubt the xtians will stop.  Look at it, it will go on and
                                      on.    Badzmaro has already victimized Clive when Clive did not
                                      even voice out anything about him.    This sicko really is
                                      barking up the wrong tree.  AFter that he conveniently said it was a
                                      mistake.”</p>
              <p><span style="color: red;">Watch this … It seems that other people contrary to
                                      his belief and opinion cant make errors, apologise and omit to it, but he can.
                                      Again. The Clive issue again, perhaps I should ask Clive what he really
                                      thinks. Does Clive also have a nut-shell personality like how Hasene seems to
                                      want him to associate as ?</span></p>

              <p>So I say SORRY first.<span></span></p>
              <p>Let me just give u an example. An analogy. But you of course can say my
                                      analogy is crap, shit  and doesnt make sense. Here goes.</p>
              <p>If you were a midget, short and fat, and offended by my remark on you being
                                      fat short and a midget unknowly to me that in reality you are, then you have
                                      all the right to be angry and deserve an apology and I deserve to be brought
                                      down due to my remarks.</p>
              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>If you are NOT a midget, NOT short, and NOT fat, and my remark towards
                                      you as being fat, short and a midget, there is NO reason for you to be
                                      angry. NO reason for u to react strongly to you self-perception of this
                                      captivity of negativty. Because its NOT TRUE. And NO reason for you to
                                      feel insecure, self-depressed and upset over my statement. Thats why the
                                      nutshell personality. Unless you are defending another, I do not see why
                                      one needs to react strongly to it.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So I apologise. I am sorry.</span></strong> <span style="color: red;">(I am sure I apologised like.. a few times in this post
                                      alone to be sincere)</span></p>
              <p>You can accept it as a genuine apology .. or it being sarcastic,
                                      or plain non-thoughtful. It is entirely up to you. Because whatever U
                                      think I mean, I dont think I can use constructive reasoning to persuade you

              so, are you saying the 13 condos are not owned by sun and kong ?
              salute you for spending so much time just to tick hasene off. seems

              <p>What about Sun Ho as  a Christian ?</p>
              <p>Althought I think that some of her methods, she couldve chosen some alternatives, but given the situation, she could equally justify herself, comparing her situation to that of the babylonion period where it is normal for men and women alike to wear make up.</p>
              <p>Doesnt mean u HAVE to wear make up right ? Just because everyone does it ?</p>
              <p>I am not saying that she is NOT a christian.</p>
              <p>DId I say that the 13 condos are not owned by her ? No. I did not. And like I said, I am not here to defend or condone her actions. Because its clear that people like Hasene cant take anything contray to his opinion and belief. So why bother ? I am just here to attack him thats all.</p>
              <p>I never said I condone CHC , the pastor and the wife. Unlike yous all, I am not so quick to judge them. Even with the facts presented in this context in sgf, and the things that I have been personally told here in Taiwan, I can form my own opinion.</p>
              <p>Oh.. i can take the heat. I love the heat. Especially heat from people like Hasene.</p>

              <p>I expected such replies.</p>
              <p>And this is my reply.</p>
              <p>Yes, I am in a position privy on these information. By exposing myself saying I know, is already a risk I am taking.</p>
              <p>And what makes it even more funny is, I happen to also be in Taiwan, at this moment of time. So I can really say its a blessing in disguise.</p>
              <p>Does Sun Ho hail from Mars or Venus ? It depends. Do u mean identify that Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus, or its just  a sarcastic remark ?</p>
              <p>I dont know. But all I can say she is definately from earth. And she is a woman. Unless I am proven otherwise, I am pretty certain. No, wait... I am absolutely certain. lol</p>

              <p>Well, honestly Laurence82 , its up to you whether u believe it or not. If I told u I had dinner with 2 producers , and during the conversation I just chanced upon such conversation and I managed to get a conversation going on.  Would u believe me ?</p>
              <p>If I told u after dinner we went to the Music 99 awards and sat on the left side stage fourth row, would u believe me ?</p>
              <p>If I were to tell u that I will have the chance to meet Li Xin Yuan would u believe me?</p>
              <p>It really doesnt matter if u do. Fact is, it happened, happens and will happen.</p>
              <p>I actually dont give a shit about Sun Ho, Don dude pastor and CHC.</p>
              <p>Its the principal. Unfortunately, I wanted to settle this with an apology with Hasene but he pretty much shoved it in my face. N I cannot retract on my statement now. Doing so will be like eating back my own vomit.</p>
              <p>Informations are always good. First hand juicy sweet informations are better.</p>
              <p>But one must always know when does public information begn and when does private information ends.</p>
              <p>Even if all those information are lies and suspect, I will still trust my dear beloved brother, who knows more then anything.. in the music world here in Taiwan.</p>
