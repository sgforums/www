              <p>And I was wondering how come followers of Christianity seem to
              became less aggressive in the world today than during the medieval
              period when some of them clearly still hold the same beliefs as
              christians and their leaders living back then...just a show for the
              world and misled people?</p>
              <p>To some Christians (especially the fundies), this would be
              persecution but we know how they think: "It's alright to persecute
              non-believers but not alright when we got "persecuted."</p>

              <p>How far would you go to preach the gospel? Pastor Rony's recent
              furore in the papers started me thinking about this. After all, we
              have been told to "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
              baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
              Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded
              you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
              Matt 28:19</p>
              <p>And, him being called up by the ISD would be classified as a
              persecution.</p>
              <p><sup>"</sup>That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in
              weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in
              difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. " 2nd Cor
              12:10</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, how far would you go to preach the gospel?</p>
              <p>Some Christians believe that the more souls they save the more God will be pleased with them. Personally I don't believe in this. God is pleased with the individual when he/she accepts the Finished work of His Son, Jesus Christ. Christians share the gospel because God is a good God &amp; we want to testify His goodness. Unbelievers around you will be curious when they see the inside out transformation in you. The chance in your countenance, your attitude, your spirit. That is when we will invite interested people for church service. You can't force people to attend service if they are uninterested.</p>
