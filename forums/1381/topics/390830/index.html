              <p>How far would you go to preach the gospel? Pastor Rony's recent furore in the papers started me thinking about this. After all, we have been told to "Therefore go and make 
              disciples of all nations, baptizing them in<sup> </sup>the name of the Father and of the 
              Son and of the Holy Spirit, and
               teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am 
              with you always, to the very end of the age." Matt 28:19</p>
              <p>And, him being called up by the ISD would be classified as a persecution.</p>
              <p><sup>"</sup>That is why, for 
              Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in 
              persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. " 2nd Cor 12:10</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>read the verse again carefully, there is a big difference between preaching the gospel and making disciples. Have you ever thought about what it means to be a disciple? What is a disciple as opposed to being a convert which is the main job of christianity. Two very distinct and different things.</p>

              <p>You sure? Cause "Asia" back then considered of modern Turkey to the north-east border of Egypt and the Middle East.</p>
              <p>Why? Because Judaism, the father of Christianity is practiced among the locals there? Or if "Asia" really means Asia, does Jesus knew Buddha?</p>
