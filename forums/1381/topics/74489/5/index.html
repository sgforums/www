            <div class='col-md body'>Listed below are a few eye-opening quotations by prominent scientists and thinkers of our time. They are worthy of consideration. We could list many, many more by palaeontologists, geologists, astronomers, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, cosmologists, zoologists, geneticists and physicians: but the sheer volume of quotations would exhaust the reader. Those listed below should suffice to prove our point that the theory of evolution is not as fool-proof as it is cracked up to be, and hundreds of scientists are distancing themselves from it every year. After all, who wants to be associated with a theory if it's wrong? Driving down the wrong highway will never get you to your destination. Now to the quotations. Bear in mind that they are made by prominent scientists and scholars of our day.<br><br>"I have little hesitation in saying that a sickly pall now hangs over the big bang theory."<br>(Sir Fred Hoyle, astronomer, cosmologist, and mathematician, Cambridge University)<br><br>"The pathetic thing is that we have scientists who are trying to prove evolution, which no scientist can ever prove."<br>(Dr Robert Millikan, Nobel Prize winner and eminent evolutionist)<br><br>"The theory of evolution suffers from grave defects, which are more and more apparent as time advances. It can no longer square with practical scientific knowledge."<br>(Dr A Fleishmann, Zoologist, Erlangen University)<br><br>"It is good to keep in mind ... that nobody has ever succeeded in producing even one new species by the accumulation of micromutations. Darwin's theory of natural selection has never had any proof, yet it has been universally accepted."<br>(Prof. R Goldschmidt PhD, DSc Prof. Zoology, University of Calif. in Material Basis of Evolution Yale Univ. Press)</div>

Believers' writings you say phony, non-believers you say inaccurate. Since until Christianity had spread, no one except Christians would be interested in Jesus.

Here's a cherry, that they'd even lie to the emperor knowing the imperial archives at caesar's disposal, and risk having a go at lions, wolves, sword, stone, fire, cross, mobs.. waging their lives on their declaration. That's easier to buy? These testimonies are not about His existence alone, the accounts are tied to the history of the roman empire and jewish past. If you disregard their authenticity, apply the same validation consistently and consider much of classical literature questionable and general Hannibal a myth.<br><br>Quoting a Rylands professor of biblical criticism and exegesis at the University of Manchester, "Some writers may toy with the fancy of a Christ-myth but they do not do so on the ground of historical evidence. The historicity of Christ is as axiomatic for an unbiased historian as the historicity of Julius Caesar. It is not historians who propagate the Christ-myth theories."<br><br>Oh, i forgot he's biased. An extract of encyclopedia brit concerning the testimony of the many independent secular accounts of Jesus records, "These independent accounts prove that in ancient times even the opponents of Christianity never doubted the historicity of Jesus, which was disputed for the first time and on inadequate grounds by several authors at the end of the 18th, during the 19th, and at the beginning of the 20th centuries."<br><br>Finally, show which scholar by paralleled test of neutrality and impartiality delivered against the above sources, has ventured and successfully postulated the non-historicity of Jesus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>For many years, creationists (e.g., Gish 1993) have referred to the studies on Australopithecus by evolutionists Charles Oxnard and Lord Sully Zuckerman. These evolutionists, having analyzed postcranial (body) material of Australopithecus, contend that Australopithecus was not bipedal and transitional to man, but walked rather like a chimp. </blockquote>http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#morphological_intermediates_ex3<br><br><strong>Gish</strong> was incorrect in stating that there were no transitional fossil forms, and he has been corrected on this gaff numerous times since he wrote these words. However, Gish's statements nicely delineate the morphological conundrum at hand. Let's review the required evolutionary conclusion. During their evolution, two mammalian middle ear bones (the hammer and anvil, aka malleus and incus) were derived from two reptilian jawbones. Thus there was a major evolutionary transition in which several reptilian jawbones (the quadrate, articular, and angular) were extensively reduced and modified gradually to form the modern mammalian middle ear. At the same time, the dentary bone, a part of the reptilian jaw, was expanded to form the major mammalian lower jawbone. During the course of this change, the bones that form the hinge joint of the jaw changed identity. Importantly, the reptilian jaw joint is formed at the intersection of the quadrate and articular whereas the mammalian jaw joint is formed at the intersection of the squamosal and dentary (see Figure 1.4.1).<br><br>How could hearing and jaw articulation be preserved during this transition? As clearly shown from the many transitional fossils that have been found (see Figure 1.4.3), the bones that transfer sound in the reptilian and mammalian ear were in contact with each other throughout the evolution of this transition. In reptiles, the stapes contacts the quadrate, which in turn contacts the articular. In mammals, the stapes contacts the incus, which in turn contacts the malleus (see Figure 1.4.2). Since the quadrate evolved into the incus, and the articular evolved into the malleus, these three bones were in constant contact during this impressive evolutionary change. Furthermore, a functional jaw joint was maintained by redundancyÂ—several of the intermediate fossils have both a reptilian jaw joint (from the quadrate and articular) and a mammalian jaw joint (from the dentary and squamosal). Several late cynodonts and Morganucodon clearly have a double-jointed jaw. In this way, the reptilian-style jaw joint was freed to evolve a new specialized function in the middle ear. It is worthy of note that some modern species of snakes have a double-jointed jaw involving different bones, so such a mechanical arrangement is certainly possible and functional.<br><br>Since Figure 1.4.3 was made, several important intermediate fossils have been discovered that fit between Morganucodon and the earliest mammals. These new discoveries include a complete skull of Hadrocodium wui (Luo et al. 2001) and cranial and jaw material from Repenomamus and Gobiconodon (Wang et al. 2001). These new fossil finds clarify exactly when and how the malleus, incus, and angular completely detached from the lower jaw and became solely auditory ear ossicles.<br><br>Recall that Gish stated: "There are no transitional fossil forms showing, for instance, three or two jawbones, or two ear bones" (Gish 1978, p. 80). Gish simply does not understand how gradual transitions happen (something he should understand, obviously, if he intends to criticize evolutionary theory). These fossil intermediates illustrate why Gish's statement is a gross mischaracterization of how a transitional form should look. In several of the known intermediates, the bones have overlapping functions, and one bone can be called both an ear bone and a jaw bone; these bones serve two functions. Thus, there is no reason to expect transitional forms with intermediate numbers of jaw bones or ear bones. For example, in Morganucodon, the quadrate (anvil) and the articular (hammer) serve as mammalian-style ear bones and reptilian jaw bones simultaneously. In fact, even in modern reptiles the quadrate and articular serve to transmit sound to the stapes and the inner ear (see Figure 1.4.2). The relevant transition, then, is a process where the ear bones, initially located in the lower jaw, become specialized in function by eventually detaching from the lower jaw and moving closer to the inner ear.<br><br><strong>Refer to website for the figures</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>How about this one</strong><br><br>Primarily due to intense medical interest, humans are one of the best characterized species and many developmental anomalies are known. There are several human atavisms that reflect our common genetic heritage with other mammals. One of the most striking is the existence of the rare "true human tail" (also variously known as "coccygeal process," "coccygeal projection," "caudal appendage," and "vestigial tail"). More than 100 cases of human tails have been reported in the medical literature. Less than one third of the well-documented cases are what are medically known as "pseudo-tails" (Dao and Netsky 1984; Dubrow et al. 198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Pseudo-tails are not true tails; they are simply lesions of various types coincidentally found in the caudal region of newborns, often associated with the spinal column, coccyx, and various malformations.<br><br>In contrast, the true atavistic tail of humans results from incomplete regression of the most distal end of the normal embryonic tail found in the developing human fetus (see Figure 2.4.1 and the discussion below on the development of the normal human embryonic tail; Belzberg et al. 1991; Dao and Netsky 1984; Grange et al. 2001; Keith 1921). Though formally a malformation, the true human tail is usually benign in nature (Dubrow et al. 1988; Spiegelmann et al. 1985). The true human tail is characterized by a complex arrangement of adipose and connective tissue, central bundles of longitudinally arranged striated muscle in the core, blood vessels, nerve fibres, nerve ganglion cells, and specialized pressure sensing nerve organs (Vater-Pacini corpuscles). It is covered by normal skin, replete with hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands (Dao and Netsky 1984; Dubrow et al. 1988; Spiegelmann et al. 1985). True human tails range in length from about one inch to over 5 inches long (on a newborn baby), and they can move via voluntary striped muscle contractions in response to various emotional states (Baruchin et al. 1983; Dao and Netsky 1984; Harrison 1901; Keith 1921; Lundberg et al. 1962).<br><br>Although human tails usually lack skeletal structures (some medical articles have claimed that true tails never have vertebrae), several human tails have also been found with cartilage and up to five, well-developed, articulating vertebrae (see Figure 2.2.2; Bar-Maor et al. 1980; Dao and Netsky 1984; Fara 1977; Sugumata et al. 198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. However, caudal vertebrae are not a necessary component of mammalian tails. Contrary to what is frequently reported in the medical literature, there is at least one known example of a primate tail that lacks vertebrae, as found in the rudimentary two-inch-long tail of Macaca sylvanus (the "Barbary ape") (Hill 1974, p. 616; Hooten 1947, p. 23).<br><br>True human tails are rarely inherited, though several familial cases are known (Dao and Netsky 1984; Ikpeze and Onuigbo 1999; Touraine 1955). In one case the tail has been inherited through at least three generations of females (Standfast 1992).<br><br>As with other atavistic structures, human tails are most likely the result of either a somatic mutation, a germline mutation, or an environmental influence that reactivates an underlying developmental pathway which has been retained, if only partially, in the human genome (Dao and Netsky 1984; Hall 1984; Hall 1995). In fact, the genes that control the development of tails in mice and other vertebrates have been identified (the Wnt-3a and Cdx1 genes; Greco et al. 1996; Prinos et al. 2001; Schubert et al. 2001; Shum et al. 1999; Takada et al. 1994). As predicted by common descent from the atavistic evidence, these tail genes have also been discovered in the human genome (Katoh 2002; Roelink et al. 1993). As discussed below in detail, the development of the normal human tail in the early embryo has been investigated extensively, and apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a significant role in removing the tail of a human embryo after it has formed. It is now known that down-regulation of the Wnt-3a gene induces apoptosis of tail cells during mouse development (Greco et al. 1996; Shum et al. 1999; Takada et al. 1994), and similar effects are observed in humans (Chan et al. 2002). Additionally, researchers have identified a mutant mouse that does not develop a tail, and this phenotype is due to a regulatory mutation that decreases the Wnt-3a gene dosage (Greco et al. 1996; Gruneberg and Wickramaratne 1974; Heston 1951). Thus, current evidence indicates that the genetic cause of tail loss in the evolution of apes was likely a simple regulatory mutation(s) that slightly decreased Wnt-3a gene dosage. Conversely, a mutation or environmental factor that increased dosage of the Wnt-3a gene would reduce apoptosis of the human tail during development and would result in its retention, as an atavism, in a newborn.<br><br>Criticisms:<br>The existence of true human tails is unfortunately quite shocking for many religiously motivated anti-evolutionists, such as Duane Gish, who has written an often-quoted article entitled "Evolution and the human tail" (Gish 1983; see also Menton 1994; ReMine 1982). Solely based on the particulars of a single case study (Ledley 1982), these authors have erroneously concluded that atavistic human tails are "nothing more than anomalous malformations not traceable to any imaginary ancestral state" (Gish 1983). However, their arguments are clearly directed against pseudo-tails, not true tails. Gish claims these structures are not true tails for several reasons: (1) they lack vertebrae, (2) they are not inherited, and (3) the resemblance to tails is "highly superficial" and simply an "anomalous malformation." Menton further claims that (4) all true tails have muscles and can move, whereas human tails cannot. Each of these arguments are factually false, as explained above and as well-documented in the medical literature. Vertebrae and cartilage have occasionally been found in human tails. However, contrary to the claims of Gish, Menton, and ReMine, vertebrae are not a requirement for tails. M. sylvanus is a prime example of a primate whose fleshy tail lacks vertebrae (Hill 1974, p. 616; Hooten 1947, p. 23). Several cases are known where human tails have been inherited. Furthermore, we now know the genes responsible for the development of tails in mammals, and all humans have them. Inheritance of the tail structure per se is unnecessary since the developmental system has been inherited but is normally inactivated in humans. The "resemblance" to non-human tails is far from superficial, since all true human tails are complex structures composed of symmetrical layers of voluntary muscle, blood vessels, specialized nerves and sensing organs, and they can indeed move and contract.<br><br>For the skeptical reader, probably the best evidence that these structures are true tails is visual inspection. Photographic images of a newborn's atavistic tail can be found at the University of Iowa's Virtual Hospital site, complete with the voluntary contractory movement of the tail documented.<br><br></div>

So I guess they have a stand different from yours. </strong><br><br>Albert Einstein<br><br>Einstein often used the word "God" as a metaphor for nature. An often repeated Einstein quote is "God does not play dice with the universe." However, Einstein did not believe in a conscious god. Here is Einstein in his own words:<br><br>"I cannot accept any concept of God based on the fear of life or the fear of death or blind faith. I cannot prove to you that there is no personal God, but if I were to speak of him I would be a liar."<br><br>"I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."<br><br>"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot. But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. For a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself. This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task..."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Robert Ingersoll<br><br>"A believer is a bird in a cage. A freethinker is an eagle parting the clouds with tireless wing."<br><br>"The star that shines above the dawn, the herald of the day, is Science, not superstition; Reason, not religion."<br><br>"When I became convinced that the Universe is natural - that all the ghosts and gods are myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul, into every drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, of the joy of freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled and fell, the dungeon was flooded with light and all the bolts, and bars, and manacles became dust."<br><br>"Infidels in all ages have battled for the rights of man, and have at all times been the fearless advocates of liberty and justice."<br><br>"My objection to Christianity is that it is infinitely cruel, infinitely selfish, and, I might add, infinitely absurd."<br><br>"This crime called blasphemy was invented by priests for the purpose of defending doctrines not able to take care of themselves."<br><br>"Hands that help are far better than lips that pray."<br><br>"The notion that faith in Christ is to be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason, observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for refutation, and can be relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity and ignorance called 'faith'."<br><br>"If a man would follow today, the teachings of the Old Testament, he would be a criminal. If he would follow strictly, the teachings of the new, he would be insane."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Bertrand Russell<br><br>"What makes a free thinker is not his beliefs, but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought, he finds a balance of evidence in their favor, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem."<br><br>"Religion prevents our children from having a rational education; religion prevents us from removing the fundamental causes of war; religion prevents us from teaching the ethic of scientific cooperation in place of the old fierce doctrines of sin and punishment. It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so, it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door, and this dragon is religion."<br><br>"The Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is, the principal enemy of moral progress in the world"<br><br>"Many people would rather die than think; in fact, most do."<br><br>"If you think your belief is based upon reason, you will support it by argument rather than by persecution, and will abandon it if the argument goes against you. But if your belief is based upon faith, you will realize that argument is useless, and will therefore resort to force either in the form of persecution or by stunting or distorting the minds of the young in what is called 'education'."<br><br>"Religion is something left over from the infancy of our intelligence, it will fade away as we adopt reason and science as our guidelines."<br><br>"The splendour of human life, I feel sure, is greater to those who are not dazzled by the divine radiance."<br><br>"We may define "faith" as the firm belief in something for which there is no evidence. Where there is evidence, no one speaks of "faith." We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round. We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence. The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to lead to strife, since different groups, substitute different emotions."<br><br>"There is something feeble and a little contemptible about a man who cannot face the perils of life without the help of comfortable myths. Almost inevitably some part of him is aware that they are myths and that he believes them only because they are comforting. But he dare not face this thought! Moreover, since he is aware, however dimly, that his opinions are not real, he becomes furious when they are disputed."<br><br>"I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Thomas Jefferson<br><br>"Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a god; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear. Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences.... If it end in a belief that there is no god, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise and in the love of others it will procure for you."<br><br>"I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world, and do not find in our particular superstition [Christianity] one redeeming feature. They are all alike, founded on fables and mythology."<br><br>"The Christian god is a three headed monster, cruel, vengeful and capricious. If one wishes to know more of this raging, three headed beast-like god, one only needs to look at the caliber of people who say they serve him. They are always of two classes: fools and hypocrites."<br><br>"And the day will come, when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as His Father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva, in the brain of Jupiter."<br><br>"Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br></div>

This is an unmistakable fact; nobody could seriously deny it. Yet people with full knowledge of the arbitrary nature of this heredity, somehow manage to go on believing in their religion, often with such fanaticism that they are prepared to murder people who follow a different one."<br><br>"Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence."<br><br>"Blind faith can justify anything. In a man believes in a different god, or even if he uses a different ritual for worshipping the same god, blind faith can decree that he should die - on the cross, at the stake, skewered on a Crusader's sword, shot in a Beirut street, or blown up in a bar in Belfast. Memes for blind faith have their own ruthless ways of propagating themselves. This is true of patriotic and political as well as religious blind faith."<br><br>"Faith is powerful enough to immunize people against all appeals to pity, to forgiveness, to decent human feelings. It even immunizes them against fear, if they honestly believe that a martyr's death will send them straight to heaven. What a weapon!

How r u going to explain tat ?<br><br>Anyway u have not answer me on something like "why isn't anyone hearing anything about wat happend to the dead tat become the living " of the earthquake tat torn a temple or any other miracles tat were performed ?<br><br><blockquote>The list of governors, theologians, historians, writers, philosophers, satirists were all deluded into marking history for a vacant santa persona. Here's a cherry, that they'd even lie to the emperor knowing the imperial archives at caesar's disposal, and risk having a go at lions, wolves, sword, stone, fire, cross, mobs.. waging their lives on their declaration. That's easier to buy? These testimonies are not about His existence alone, the accounts are tied to the history of the roman empire and jewish past. If you disregard their authenticity, apply the same validation consistently and consider much of classical literature questionable and general Hannibal a myth</blockquote>These people may be "great" but it has not answer me why do u quote report from people tat are never born when Jesus had gone ? They can only at best hear from hearsay isn't it ?<br><br>U can find me 100 "extracts" and I can do tat to u too. Instead of trying to find quotes or extracts or comments, can u find me some proof ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stupidissmart, you do really take effort in surfing for answers to put down Christianity. I am convinced that you disapprove of Christianity. I shan't try you to convince you otherwise.<br><br>I do hope you keep to the topic and address issue of relevancy of religion as a whole.<br><br>Faith is a matter of belief.  If faith in something must be proven, then it is not faith.  You love something because you want to, not because they have proven worthy of your love.<br><br>Why have faith in something not proven?  It has made a difference in my life.  It has transformed me in the way I deal with problems and people.  It has given me strength to walk through life. These are enough for me to keep my faith. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is one of the songs my church sang last week. as i sing....my heart weeps. So often we argue and debate over issues of faith when it is clear that nothing can be fully explained or known. The author of this song is not ashame to be called His child simply because many things 'he cannot tell'...all he knows is about a Saviour who loves and gave His life up for him.<br>------------------------------------<br><br>I cannot tell how he whom angels worship<br>should stoop to love the peoples of the earth,<br>or why as shepherd he should seek the wanderer<br>with his mysterious promise of new birth.<br>But this I know, that he was born of Mary,<br>when Bethlehem's manger was his only home,<br>and that he lived at Nazareth and labored,<br>and so the Savior, Savior of the world, is come.<br><br>I cannot tell how silently he suffered,<br>as with his peace he graced this place of tears,<br>or how his heart upon the cross was broken,<br>the crown of pain to three and thirty years.<br>But this I know, he heals the broken-hearted,<br>and stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear,<br>and lifts the burden from the heavy laden,<br>for yet the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.<br><br>I cannot tell how he will win the nations,<br>how he will claim his earthly heritage,<br>how satisfy the needs and aspirations<br>of east and west, of sinner and of sage.<br>But this I know, all flesh shall see his glory,<br>and he shall reap the harvest he has sown,<br>and some glad day his sun shall shine in splendor<br>when he the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.<br><br>I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,<br>when, at his bidding, every storm is stilled,<br>or who can say how great the jubilation<br>when every heart with perfect love is filled.<br>But this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,<br>and myriad, myriad human voices sing,<br>and earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:<br>'At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King!'<br><br># to hear how this hymn sounds like<br><a href="http://www.oremus.org/hymnal/i/i029.html" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE</a></div>
