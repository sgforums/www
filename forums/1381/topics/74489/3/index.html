            <div class='col-md body'>Lucian of Samosata and  is too young again (c. A.D. 115-200)<br><br>Celsus, a pagan philosopher of the <strong>second century </strong> A.D<br><br>They couldn't have seen him thus their accounts r at most, influence read from christians.<br><br><blockquote>While people can wax a lot of lyrical and say plenty of stuff about the "historic" nature of Jesus, I have yet to see them produce any plausible theories on what really happened, they all still seem pretty wild to me. </blockquote>U want to know wat had really happened ?<br><br>I tell u<br><br>NOTHING<br><br>There is either NO jesus christ or there is such person but he is a swindler. Believe in something like Jesus is suppose to be "pretty wild"<br><br><blockquote>About this time there was Jesus, a wise man, [if indeed one ought to call him a man]. For he was one who performed surprising works, (and) a teacher of people who with pleasure received the unusual. He stirred up both many Jews and also many of the Greeks. [He was the Christ.] And when Pilate condemned him to the cross, since he was accused by the first-rate men among us, those who had been loving (him from) the first did not cease (to cause trouble), [for he appeared to them on the third day, having life again, as the prophets of God had foretold these and countless other marvelous things about him]. And until now the tribe of Christians, so named from him, is not (yet?) extinct. </blockquote>The problem is not wat this passage is written. Is whether tis passage is <span style="font-style: italic;">altered</span><br><br>The early Christian writer Origen claims that Josephus did NOT recognize Jesus as the Messiah, in direct contradiction to the above passage, where Josephus says, "He was the Messiah." Thus, we may conclude that this particular phrase at least was a later insertion. (The version given above was, however, known to Jerome and in the time of Eusebius. Jerome's Latin version, however, renders "He was the Messiah" by "He was believed to be the Christ.") Furthermore, other early Christian writers fail to cite this passage, even though it would have suited their purposes to do so. There is thus firm evidence that this passage was tampered with at some point, even if parts of it do date back to Josephus.<br><br>Many Biblical scholars reject the entire Testimonium Flavianum as a later Christian insertion. However, some maintain that Josephus's work originally did refer to Jesus, but that Christian copyists later expanded and made the text more favorable to Jesus. These scholars cite such phrases as "tribe of Christians" and "wise man" as being atypical Christian usages, but plausible if coming from a first century Palestinian Jew. Of course, a suitably clever Christian wishing to "dress up" Josephus would not have much trouble imitating his style.<br><br>apostle paul converted to christanity. This is as good as singaporetyrannosaur converting into christainity. He has prove nothing, if at all tat he convert and he is a believer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I don't understand why people like to use this pink unicorn argument to evaluate the faith as a whole. Sure, a comparison between God and the pink unicorn is fun to discuss about, in a purely philosophical discussion. But now, if you're to evaluate a faith system, it is how well the worldview can explain reality that matters. The christian worldview has pretty good explanation on issues like suffering, problem of evil, purpose and other human conditions. May I know how does your worldview with the Invisible Pink Unicorn explain such issues? </blockquote>U see, there is NO proof to show tat God or Jesus existed. One can believe tat life is created by God, as in christian sense, and another people can have easily believe in Nu Wa, chinese folkstory of a Deity making man. If there is no further proof, and all else being equal, people can have a 50-50 chance of believing in either. How does the people diiferentiate which is right or wrong ? There r tons of other religions too tat do not prove their existence. Why do u believe in the religion in the first place ? <strong>why</strong> ? Unless there is a solid reason for your believing, why do u have faith in something tat cannot be seen and cannot be proved ?<br><br>All religion give a good explanation on suffering, evil purpose etc. Why don't u believe in the other religion ?<br><br>BTW, wat is the explanation of suffering ? God punish us because we r disobedient (eat fruit of wisdom). Is tat a good explanation at all ?!!? We r created imperfect + the snake effect, should we be blamed so harshly ? Why must he be so egoistic to punish people JUST because they do not obey him ? Seems like PAP punishing opposition.<br><br>Wat is your purpose in life for christainity ? People have been telling me they seems to have a better purpose in life. WHY ? Does believing in being a mere toy or being under control of a superior being and realising tat no matter wat u do, u r forever under his power seems to be a "purpose" ? To me tat sounds to have rob me of my purpose in life !<br><br>For why human have to give birth, the 10 months of labour, tat is again illogical. God punish Man ONLY for eating the fruit. Does the birds, the animals, the mammals eat the fruit too ? Why punish them to have a labour period ? Does tat sound logical to u ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> After reading this whole thingy, what SIS wants to bring out is the fact that since religion cannot be proven scientifically (evidence and proof), therefore whatever claims made by any religion is ambigious and cast doubts in them and because there is no way to prove whether the statement made by religion is true or not - it is not relevant because people of the past could have say the untruth, words passed through generation and people think something did happened and such............<br><br>There are many things that science cannot prove yet in the spiritual world. Ghost cannot be proven that they exist - only theories and suspected proof - but everyone knows that spirit/ghost does exist.<br><br>In ancient days, how on earth did the Maya Civilization calulated the distance between other planets and earth? They had NONE of the superior technology we had now. Answer: They communicated with the spirits, using rituals, etc. <strong>All that has been recorded down historically, but the fact is that such spirit communicating CANNOT be proven scientifically, YET the result of the distance is surprisingly accurate when science came into the picture and did the scientific way of calulating.</strong><br><br>I am a free thinker. People like you believe in what you can prove in either of the five sense, excluding the six sense - is like believing a body is a body and there is no soul in a body <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because soul cannot be proven.</span> Try selling your soul to deep cults employing unorthodox demonic methods to have them take it away.<br><br>Cannot be proven? I agree. Then why not see the result? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Purpose of the post?

            <div class='col-md body'>The point here is not to claim that there was no historical Jesus, but to point out that the historical evidence does not even come close to justifying the Christians' claims of unambiguous proof of an historical Jesus.<br><br>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence<br><br>The fact that there is no valid reason to believe that a god exists justifies weak atheism (lack of belief in gods), but not strong atheism (belief that there are no gods). Lack of evidence for a proposition ("God exists" in this case) is, in and of itself, not evidence that the proposition is false. However, lack of evidence for a proposition combined with the expectation that if that proposition were true that evidence would be available does constitute evidence that the proposition is false. As an example of this reasoning, suppose someone claimed that there is a herd of invisible two-ton elephants stampeding through your living room. If such a claim were true there would be plenty of evidence in the form of broken furniture for example. Now you examine your living room and find no evidence for stampeding elephants. It is, of course, rational to believe that the elephant claim was false. Now lets consider the gods of the dominate theistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Each of these religions postulate a god that is concerned with human welfare and that performs miracles. If such a god exists, there should be ample evidence of the miracles that he works whenever human suffering is present. But human suffering certainly exists and there is no evidence of the theists' god. This constitutes evidence that this god does not exist.<br><br>Let me ask a question,<br><br>Matthew 27:50-54 describes an earthquake at the moment of Jesus' death. If this had actually happened, surely many of the historians would have mentioned it. Yet this event is conspicuously absent from the secular histories.

When such an extraordinary events had occur, why is there so little evidence towards it ?

Often, He only produced miracles only after people showed faith in Him.<br><br>Anyway, miracles are by defination supernatural, they are beyond natural laws (such as Pythagoras Theorem) and hence cannot be manipulated by man, they happen for a purpose and reason. And apparently Jesus' purpose for doing such things was hardly to spread fame for Himself, if I recall, He was killed for entirely different reasons, such as claims of Kingship that offended the Jews and was considered fatal under Roman law.<br><br>Kings and emperors did pay some attention to Jesus, however, when He was about to be born, a paranoid ruler ordered the massacre of any baby boy under two in his domain as he considered the prophecy a threat to his reign.</div>

Now u r telling me actually people in the past don't really give a damn about it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> I think tat is a wrong fact and a lousy reason<br><br><blockquote>Jesus himself avoided sensationalism when He could, and certainly didn't produce miracles for the sake of it, or do so that people would believe in Him. Often, He only produced miracles only after people showed faith in Him. </blockquote>Tat is crap. If he avoided sensationalism, then he will just keep quiet and live a normal life. To fulfil his objectives of coming over, he need to be sensational.<br><br>BTW, the fact is I am talking about are the people tat were dead and went back living. R these people same as Jesus ? Surely such a miracle will gather a lot of attention. Even Ramases in the bible release the people from egypt after seeing the miracles performed by moses. Why there isn't any word or any news about this ?<br><br><blockquote>Anyway, miracles are by defination supernatural, they are beyond natural laws (such as Pythagoras Theorem) and hence cannot be manipulated by man, they happen for a purpose and reason</blockquote>I am not asking people to learn the art of resurrection, I am just asking them wat had happeend after they die. If they really die and come back, surely they can give an account of wat death is like, whether they go to heaven or hell etc. Their account can be powerful and can convince people tat when Men die they go to heaven etc, thus pursuading more people to believe in Jesus. However there is virtually no news of them after they r resurrected.<br><br><blockquote>And apparently Jesus' purpose for doing such things was hardly to spread fame for Himself, if I recall, He was killed for entirely different reasons, such as claims of Kingship that offended the Jews and was considered fatal under Roman law</blockquote>Again I am talking about the people resurected, not Jesus. Refer to above<br><br><blockquote>Kings and emperors did pay some attention to Jesus, however, when He was about to be born, a paranoid ruler ordered the massacre of any baby boy under two in his domain as he considered the prophecy a threat to his reign</blockquote>Why don't they pay attention when they hear he can heal leprosy and make the death resurrected ? Isn't tat fishy ? They will give a king ransom for any clue about life after death etc.<br><br><blockquote>You also totally miss some of our earlier points. I paste it here for your convenience.<br><br>SingaporeTyrannosaur : No, Jesus almost certainly existed, the real question is not if He walked this earth, but if He was really who He said He was.<br><br>Icemoon: You are right. I have no problem with him existing. The real mystery is whether he is God as the New Testament seems to claim and later christians affirm.<br><br>Now, tell me, who is the one who misses it? Heh. </blockquote>Well, me stand is he never existed, or at least never perform any miracles. Wat is wrong with my answer ? Must my answer according to u be "Jesus must be around" or wat ? Wat kind of answer u want ?!?! Give an example lah !<br><br><blockquote>I challenged him to evaluate the worldview presented by a belief in such beings, but where is his reply? </blockquote>Again I do not understand wat u want. Give me an example wat u expect me to reply.<br><br>Anyway regardless of whether I have answer your questions or not, why don't u answer for my illustration on tooth fairies and santa claus ? Isn't the comparison relevant ?<br><br></div>
