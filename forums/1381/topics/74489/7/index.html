            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1. What is the last of the Ten Commandments?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	Don't steal.<br>b.	Don't covet your neighbor's wife and property. --This is the final commandment as listed in Exodus 20:2-17, the version often used by Protestants and Catholics. However, these are not the "ten commandments." (See below.) Notice the biblical sexism: women are the property of men.<br>c.	Don't boil a young goat in the milk of its mother. --Believe it or not, this prohibition in Exodus 34:26 is the official tenth commandment, from the only set of stone tablets that were called "the ten commandments." There were three sets of commandments:<br>1) The first time Moses came down from Mount Sinai with commandments, he merely recited a list (Exodus 20:2-17), which is the version most churches today erroneously call the "Ten Commandments," although they were not engraved on stone tablets and not called "the ten commandments."<br>2) The first set of stone tablets was given to Moses at a subsequent trip up the mountain (Exodus 31:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. In this farcical story, Moses petulantly destroyed those tablets when he saw the people worshipping the golden calf (Exodus 32:19).<br>3) So he went back for a replacement. God told Moses: "Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest." (Exodus 34:1) Here is what was on the replacement tablets (from Exodus 34:14-26):<br>1) Thou shalt worship no other God. 2) Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 3) The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. 4) Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest. 5) Thou shalt observe the feast of weeks. 6) Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the Lord God. 7) Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning. 9) The first of the firstfruits of thy land shalt thou bring unto the house of the Lord thy God. 10) Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.<br>Keep this in mind next time you are tempted to boil a goat. This list differs, obviously, from the one in Exodus 20 (was God's memory faulty?), but it is only this list that is called the "Ten Commandments": "And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments." (Exodus 34:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>d.	Love your neighbor as yourself. --Even Jesus was unclear about the exact set of commandments. In Matthew 19:18-19 he listed them as: 1) Thou shalt do no murder 2) Thou shalt not commit adultery 3) Thou shalt not steal 4) Thou shalt not bear false witness 5) Honour thy father and thy mother 6) Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. For the Jews, loving your "neighbor" meant loving your Jewish neighbors: it did not mean loving the neighboring tribes or other outsiders, as the intolerant and bloody Old Testament (and Christian) history proves.<br><br><strong>2. What is the penalty for working on the Sabbath?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	You will be stoned to death. --Isn't this an excessively violent punishment from a supposedly "Good Book?" What is the harm in working on the Sabbath? It seems the only harm is to the ego of the Sovereign, who demands respect with no respect to human needs.<br>"Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the Lord: whoseoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day." (Exodus 35:2) For the chilling application of this law, see Numbers 15:32-36, where a man who picked up sticks on the sabbath was stoned, "and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses."<br>b.	Neither you nor your offspring to the 5th generation can enter the tabernacle.<br>c.	You should sacrifice two unblemished she goats.<br>d.	You will be disinherited from the kingdom.<br><br><strong>3. What is God's name?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	Jealous. --This is a petty self-described insecurity from a supposedly all-wise leader.<br>"For thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God." (Exodus 34:14)<br>b.	Righteous.<br>c.	Holy. --Sometimes the name of God is described as "holy" (see Psalm 99:3), but the name itself is not "Holy." In Isaiah 29:23, the name of God is given as "The Holy One of Jacob."<br>d.	Jehovah. --The name "Jehovah" is a Christian mistake. It was forbidden to pronounce the name "YHWH" (Yahweh), and readers of the Hebrew scriptures were supposed to say "Adonai" in its place. "In written texts the vowels of Adonai were combined with the consonants YHWH to remind readers to pronounce Adonai instead of Yahweh. The incorrect hybrid, 'Jehovah,' arose from Christian misunderstanding in the late Middle Ages."(Harper's Bible Dictionary)<br><br><strong>4. How should parents treat a stubborn and rebellious son?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	He should be beaten seven times with a whip made of horsehair.<br>b.	He should be stripped and humiliated at the gate of the city.<br>c.	He should be expelled from the family.<br>d.	He should be stoned to death. --This cruelly excessive Mosaic law was actually enforced at one time by the Massachusetts colony and has been used to justify child abuse and murder.<br>"If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them; Then shall his father and mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of the city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear." (Deuteronomy 21:18-21)<br>"And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death." (Exodus 21:17) "For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he that cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him." (Leviticus 20:9)<br><br><strong>5. What happens if you are not a virgin on your wedding night?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	Your father must pay 100 shekels of silver to your husband.<br>b.	You can never approach the altar.<br>c.	You must dress in black and leave your husband for one year.<br>d.	You will be stoned to death. --This barbaric punishment is still being followed in some parts of the Moslem world, which share some of the teachings of the Hebrew bible. There is no such penalty, needless to say, for a groom who is not a virgin. The fact that Christian women who have engaged in premarital sex are not being stoned to death today shows that even believers recognize cruelty and absurdity in their own "Good Book."<br>"If any man take a wife, and go in unto her . . . and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid . . . and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die . . ." (Deuteronomy 22:13-21)<br><br><strong>6. What does the bible say about witches?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	Witches should be killed. --Tragically, tens of thousands, if not millions, of innocent women in Europe and the American colonies were cruelly accused, tortured and executed because of one single bible verse:<br>"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." (Exodus 22:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>"A man or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them." (Leviticus 20:27)<br>b.	Witches are people possessed by demons and they are forever damned.<br>c.	Witches can be saved if they are exorcised.<br>d.	Witches are part of the mythology of idolatrous tribes.<br><br><strong>7. Which of these foods does the bible expressly permit you to eat? (The others are "abominations.")</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	Pork. --"And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you." (Leviticus 11:7)<br>b.	Shellfish. --"And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you . . . ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcasses in abomination." (Leviticus 11:10-11)<br>c.	Locusts. --Since ham and lobster are verboten to bible believers, how about some barbecued grasshopper or steamed locust for dinner?<br>"Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind." (Leviticus 11:22) "And the same John [the Baptist] had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey." (Matthew 3:4)<br>d.	Rabbit. --"And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the hare . . . he is unclean unto you." (Leviticus 11:5-6) Notice that the biblical writers erroneously thought rabbits chew the cud.<br><br><strong>8. When the Israelites conquered the Midianites, what part of the spoils of war was given to the priest as "the Lord's tribute"?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	50 sheep. --It was actually 675 of the 675,000 sheep. (See Numbers 31:37)<br>b.	30,000 asses. --It was actually 61 of the 61,000 asses. (See Numbers 31:39)<br>c.	32,000 cows. --It was actually 72 of the 72,000 beeves. (See Numbers 31:3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>d.	32 virgins. --Of the 32,000 virgins that were kept alive as "booty" for God's warriors, 32 young captives were handed to the priest. The bible brutally sanctifies war crimes against girls and women that continue to this day. Who could possibly respect a dictator who behaves like this?<br>"And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was 675,000 sheep, And 72,000 beeves, And 61,000 asses, And 32,000 persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him . . . of which the Lord's tribute was 32 persons. And Moses gave the tribute, which was the Lord's heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses." (Numbers 31:32-41)<br><br><strong>9. What is the origin of the "mighty men" giants known as nephilim?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	They were the offspring of God's angels and young women. --Can't God maintain better control over his libidinous troops? This is scandal in high places.<br>"And it came to pass . . . That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. . . . There were giants [nephilim] in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came into the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown." (Genesis 6:1-4)<br>This is obviously mythical. The "sons of God" were angels: "the expression clearly refers to divine beings." (Harper's Bible Dictionary) The word nephilim "could mean 'fallen ones' and allude to stories in related cultures of rebellious giants defeated by the gods in olden times (cf. Isa. 14:12)." (Harper's)<br>Some suggest this is why Paul admonished Christian women to keep their heads covered in church, so as not to sexually tempt the angels: "For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels." (I Corinthians 11:10)<br>b.	They were the result of an earlier, botched creation.<br>c.	They were monsters from the evil nation of Nephi.<br>d.	They were part of the "blessing of Abraham" that ensured military victory to God's chosen people.<br><br><strong>10. What happened to Korah and his family, Israelites who thought they could talk directly with God without a human intermediary?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	They became priests.<br>b.	They were expelled from the nation of Israel.<br>c.	The earth opened and swallowed them up. --See Numbers 16:1-50 for the whole story, in context, of God killing 15,000 of his own people for daring to question the authority of Moses:<br>"And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment . . ." (Numbers 16:20-21) ". . . And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation . . . and there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. . . ." (Numbers 16:31-35)<br>But it gets worse! Some who thought this was pretty harsh treatment were killed by a plague:<br>"But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord. . . . And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces . . . for there is wrath gone out from the Lord; the plague is begun. . . . Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah." (Numbers 16:41-49)<br>Is this kind of leadership worthy of admiration? For documentation of numerous mass murders commanded, condoned, and committed by the god of the bible, see the reading list at the end of this quiz.<br>d.	They were stripped of all their belongings, houses, and livestock.<br><br><strong>11. According to the bible, who created evil?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	Adam.<br>b.	Eve.<br>c.	God. --Now we know who is to blame.<br>"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things." (Isaiah 45:7)<br>The word "create" above is bara, the same word used in Genesis 1:1. The word "evil" is ra, such as in Genesis 2:9, "the tree of knowledge of good and evil." Some versions, such as the NIV, have unjustifiably softened the implications of this verse by translating ra as "disaster" or "calamity," although ra is used repeatedly throughout scripture to refer to moral evil. (See Isaiah 7:14-15: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil [ra], and choose the good.") But even if the "disaster" interpretation were allowable, the verse still depicts God as a troublemaker.<br>d.	Satan.<br><br><strong>12. According to the bible, what is God not able to do?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	Save the very worst sinners from hell.<br>b.	Make a rock so huge he can't lift it.<br>c.	Repel chariots of iron. So much for omnipotence.<br>"And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron." (Judges 1:19)<br>d.	Make people tell lies. --"Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee." (I Kings 22:23) "And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie." (II Thessalonians 2:11)<br><br><strong>13. According to the bible, where does God live?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	On a throne in the seventh heaven.<br>b.	In darkness. --How can the "God of light" live in darkness?<br>"Then spake Solomon, the Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness." (I Kings 8:12. Repeated in II Chronicles 6:1) "And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies." (II Samuel 22:12) "He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies." (Psalm 18:11) "The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice . . . clouds and darkness are round about him." (Psalm 97:1-2)<br>This contradicts I John 1:5: "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all . . . If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another."<br>c.	Above the clouds.<br>d.	On a planet between the sun and the stars. --The Mormon religion, in fact, considers God to be a natural being living on a planet.<br><br><strong>14. According to biblical biology, what is a bat?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	A bird. --Biblical biology rates an 'F.' Bats are mammals, not birds. This is another good reason to keep bibles out of science classes.<br>"And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, And the vulture . . . And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat." (Leviticus 11:13-19, where "fowl" is oph. Repeated in Deuteronomy 14:11-20, calling the same list "birds" [tsippor] and "fowls" [oph])<br>b.	A mammal. --The biblical writers did not understand the classification of animals, and the concept of "mammal" is absent from their writings. The bible was clearly not inspired by an all-knowing god.<br>c.	An insect.<br>d.	A mythical creature.<br><br><strong>15. According to biblical anatomy, where does thinking happen?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	In the heart. --Biblical anatomy also rates an 'F.' The heart is an organ that pumps blood--it does not process thoughts, although the biblical writers erroneously thought it did. The word "brain" appears nowhere in the bible.<br>"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." (Genesis 6:5) "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he." (Proverbs 23:7) "And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him." (Luke 9:47) "For the word of God is quick, and powerful . . . and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." (Hebrews 4:12) See also Deuteronomy 15:9, Judges 5:15, I Chronicles 29:18, Esther 6:6, Job 17:11, Psalm 10:6, Psalm 33:11, Jeremiah 23:20, Isaiah 10:7, Daniel 2:30, Acts 8:22.<br>The word "heart" in the bible was not used in the modern sense of "emotion" because it is depicted as having thoughts, intentions, and imaginations. The emotions were usually considered to be in the kidneys (see below).<br>b.	In the brain. --Tellingly, the word "brain" appears nowhere in the Bible. The bible was clearly not inspired by an all-knowing god.<br>c.	In the kidneys. --In biblical times, the kidneys ("reins") were the seat of the emotions. "Reins" was used roughly then as "heart" is sometimes used today: "Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins." (Psalm 73:21) "Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. Let not my heart envy sinners." (Proverbs 23:16-17) "I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways." (Jeremiah 17:10) "All the churches will know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts." (Revelation 2:23)<br>d.	In the lungs.<br><br><strong>16. How did Gideon demonstrate his family values?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	He lived with a young boy named Jether.<br>b.	He and his wife Ophrah had three sons who became spiritual leaders.<br>c.	He fathered 71 sons through many wives plus a mistress in Shechem. --So much for monogamy and fidelity. Is this how the hotel-bible Gideon Society expects us to demonstrate family values?<br>"And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech." (Judges 8:30-31)<br>Did Gideon not have any daughters? Perhaps daughters were just too insignificant to mention.<br>d.	He remained single, becoming the inspiration for St. Paul.<br><br><strong>17. After Jephthah was victorious in battle, what sacrifice did he burn on the altar, as he had vowed to the Lord?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	Himself.<br>b.	His livestock.<br>c.	Two unspotted lambs.<br>d.	His virgin daughter. --Another example of family values from the "Good Book." Jephthah's nameless daughter is burned as a sacrifice in order to appease the wrath and flatter the vanity of God, who tacitly accepts and never denounces this horrible practice.<br>"And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. . . . And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; . . . And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed." (Judges 11:30-39)<br>The bible sanctions child sacrifice here. Notice how everyone assumed the correctness of Jephthah's actions: there is no denunciation of this pointless murder from God, or from anyone in Jephthah's community, or from the biblical writers. It was the right thing to do.<br>The ultimate child sacrifice, of course, is the story of Jesus being put to death to appease the wrath of his offended father. Ruth Green, author of The Born Again Skeptic's Guide to the Bible, puts it this way: "If the concept of a father who plots to have his own son put to death is presented to children as beautiful and worthy of society's admiration, what types of human behavior can be presented to them as reprehensible?"<br>The biblical god often requested and accepted human sacrifice: "And he [God] said [to Abraham], Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of." (Genesis 22:2) "For thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors; the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me." (Exodus 22:29) "But the king [David] took the two sons of Rizpah . . . and the five sons of Michal . . . and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the Lord: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest . . . And after that God was intreated for the land." (II Samuel 21:8-14) "We are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ . . . But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God." (Hebrews 10:10-12)<br><br><strong>18. What price did David pay King Saul for his first wife?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	500 cattle.<br>b.	The heads of 100 Philistines.<br>c.	The foreskins of 200 Philistines. --David is supposed to be a biblical role model; but how does massacre and mutilation show moral leadership? What would Saul want with 200 foreskins? Possibly proof that his new son-in-law was a truly macho man for his daughter. (More likely, this reflects the pagan practice of offering foreskins as a rain/fertility ritual.)<br>"Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife." (I Samuel 18:27)<br>d.	The swords, shields and horses of 300 Philistines.<br><br><strong>19. How many regular sexual partners did King Solomon have?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	One wife and 300 concubines.<br>b.	One wife. (The concubines were servants.)<br>c.	300 wives.<br>d.	One thousand sexual partners. --At least one thousand. Another fine example of family values from one of God's favorites.<br>"But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites . . . And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines." (I Kings 11:1-3)<br>Notice that this lifestyle is never denounced by God, Jesus, or the biblical writers. Solomon, supposedly an ancestor of Jesus, was praised by Jesus: "all his glory" (Matthew 6:29), "wisdom of Solomon" (Matthew 12:42). Jesus compared himself (not so humbly) to Solomon's greatness: "a greater than Solomon is here." (Luke 11:31)<br><br><strong>20. What happened to 42 little children who teased God's prophet Elisha for being bald and he cursed them in the name of the Lord?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	They were whipped by their parents.<br>b.	They and their descendants to five generations were forbidden to enter the tabernacle.<br>c.	Two bears came out of the forest and killed them all. --Note that this bloody execution for a childish prank is the work of the God of the bible. Is a person like this worthy of worship? Is this "pro-life"?<br>"And he [Elisha] went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them." (II Kings 2:23-24)<br>d.	They were forced to work seven years for the Levites, as child slaves.<br><br><strong>21. What reason did God give for tormenting Job?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	"Job was a sinner. He deserved it." --Job was not a sinner: "There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil." (Job 1:1) "And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?" (Job 1:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> "In all this Job sinned not." (Job 1:22)<br>b.	"I didn't torment Job. Satan did it."<br>c.	"Satan dared me, so I destroyed Job for no reason at all." --This is a damning confession. In a court of law, this would be enough to convict God of the highest reckless crimes against humanity. In addition to ruining Job's livelihood and inflicting him with a debilitating illness, God murdered his 10 children and his servants--"without cause."<br>"And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause." (Job 2:3)<br>d.	"I wanted to see how far a man would bend before breaking."<br><br><strong>22. According to the bible, what does Satan look like?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	A skinny red man with horns and a pointed tail.<br>b.	A red dragon with 7 heads and 10 horns. --Are there still adults in the 21st century who believe in the existence of Satan? If they do, they are forced to picture him as a mythical 7-headed dragon, the only physical description of Satan given in the bible:<br>"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth . . . And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." (Revelation 12:3-9)<br>c.	A garden snake. --The talking serpent that tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:1-16) is not identified as "Satan" in the Old Testament, nor does Paul make such a connection (II Corinthians 11:3). Talking animals, by the way, are the stuff of fables (see fable in the dictionary). See documentation at the end for a deeper analysis.<br>d.	An angel in a black robe.<br><br><strong>23. How does the biblical god treat haughty women?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	He makes them barren.<br>b.	He puts scabs on their heads and uncovers their private parts. --This is sexual harassment and molestation. "Secret parts" (below) is poth, which means "hinged opening" (vagina). This is just one of many biblical instances in which women are debased, immorally or cavalierly treated as male property, subject to purchase, sale, abduction, and even sexual assault. No wonder the biblical writers never disapprove of such crimes when they are committed by God himself. How can anyone possibly pretend to love a god who would say such a thing?<br>"Moreover the Lord saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover [lay bare-ASV] their secret parts." (Isaiah 3:16-17)<br>c.	He takes away their gold and expensive clothing.<br>d.	The Holy Spirit causes them to feel shame for their arrogance.<br><br><strong>24. In dollars (shekels), how much is a woman worth?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	Half a male. --Modern sexism and inequality have their roots in the Bible. Depending on age, a female is worth approximately half as much as a male:<br>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. And if it be a female,then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels." (Leviticus 27:1-7)<br>This devaluation of women is reflected in the "double uncleanness" of giving birth to a daughter:<br>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. . . . But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks . . ." (Leviticus 12:1-5)<br>More documentation of the bible's treatment of women at the end of this quiz.<br>b.

What happens if a man rapes an engaged virgin in the city, and no one hears anything?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	The man should pay her father 100 shekels of silver.<br>b.	The man is stoned to death.<br>c.	The woman is stoned to death.<br>d.	They are both stoned to death. --What if she was gagged, or had laryngitis, or the neighbors were out of town? Is it fair to punish the victim of a crime, much less mete out the death penalty to a victim of violence?! The bible primitively and unfairly frames rape as a crime committed by a man against another man's property.<br>"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of the city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you." (Deuteronomy 22:23-24)<br>And if the woman is not engaged, she is forced to marry her rapist! The rapist simply pays a fine:<br>"If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days." (Deuteronomy 22:28-29)<br><br><strong>26. What is the Mosaic Law punishment for being handicapped?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	You will be stoned to death.<br>b.	You must sacrifice two additional doves on the altar.<br>c.	You are not allowed in church. --This is an ancient, unenlightened view, treating the disabled as inferior people. Shouldn't an all-loving God be bigger than this?<br>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. . . . a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous. Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, Or crookbacked, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire . . . he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the Lord do sanctify them." (Leviticus 21:16-23)<br>d.	You must bathe for two months before entering the tabernacle.<br><br><strong>27. According to the Bible, when may a husband have sex with his wife?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	As often as he likes. She is his property.<br>b.	Not during her menstrual period. --Another example of biblical sexism: women are "unclean." This is also an example of disproportionate punishment, as being "cut off" from the tribe for this "crime" (see below) was likely a death sentence in a nomadic culture.<br>"And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days . . . and if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers [impurity] be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean." (Leviticus 15:19-24) "And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among the people."

As often as the wife allows it.<br><br><strong>28. How should you feel when you dash babies against the rocks?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	Happy. -- Is this "pro-life"? This is one of numerous examples of god-ordained genocide. Even if you coldly feel there is justice in killing the innocent infants of people deemed "evil" by your religion, would you be happy to do it, as the bible declares? If this is not evil, then what is?<br>"O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones." (Psalm 137:8-9)<br>b.	Ashamed.<br>c.	It depends if the babies were guilty or innocent.<br>d.	Nothing. It is all in God's hands.<br><br><strong>29. How many human generations were there before Jesus?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	"More numerous than the stars."<br>b.	144,000.<br>c.	412.<br>d.	62. --The bible got it wrong by two orders of magnitude. History and archaeology prove that there were more than a mere 62 generations before Christianity. The species Homo sapiens has existed for 100,000 - 200,000 years, which would be at least 5,000 generations.<br>Luke 3:34-38 lists 20 generations between Adam and Abraham: Abraham, Thara, Nachor, Saruch, Ragau, Phalec, Heber, Sala, Cainan, Arphaxad, Sem, Noe, Lamech, Mathusala, Enoch, Jared, Maleleel, Cainan, Enos, Seth, Adam. Then Matthew 1:17 gives 42 generations between Abraham and Jesus: "So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations."<br>Matthew and Luke also contradict each other: both genealogies claim to go through Joseph, the father of Jesus (Matthew 1:16; Luke 3:23. Why Joseph? Wasn't God the father?), yet their lists disagree in length and in names--except for Shealtiel and Zerubbabel, an intersection that proves they were not intended to be separate lines. They also contradict the Old Testament genealogies, conveniently deleting and adding in order to make the numbers fit a pattern.<br><br><strong>30. What Christmas tradition is expressly forbidden in the bible?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	Singing carols house-to-house.<br>b.	Exchanging gifts.<br>c.	Christmas trees. --Many other Christmas traditions have their roots in pagan practices, such as the holly wreath, a fertility symbol. Even the date of Christmas, near the winter solstice, is linked to sun worship. Modern Christians have stolen Christmas from the pagans.<br>"Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. . . . They are altogether brutish and foolish." (Jeremiah 10:2-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>d.	Kissing under the mistletoe.<br><br><strong>31. According to Jesus, what must you do to have eternal life?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	Obey the law and keep all the sacraments.<br>b.	Sell everything you have and give all the money to the poor. --Heaven will be very empty, it seems. How many Christians take seriously this direct command of Jesus?<br>"And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? . . . Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me." (Matthew 19:16-21. See also Luke 12:33)<br>c.	Attend church regularly and tithe ten percent of your income to God. --Christian tithing is difficult to support biblically. In Old Testament times, when church and government were united, the tithe was the state tax, often used to support the non-working Levites (priests). But there is no consistent explanation of tithing in Hebrew scripture or in other nations. Babylonians used the tithe as a secular tax for royal purposes. In America, where state and church are separated, Christians should not tithe--unless they want to be doubly taxed! There is nothing in the New Testament to support tithing. Jesus mocked the scribes and Pharisees who tithed (Matthew 23:23). The writer of Hebrews affirmed that the tithe was to be paid to the Levites, admitting that times are different now: "For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law." (Hebrews 7:5,12)<br>d.	Confess your sins and ask Jesus to come into your heart.<br><br><strong>32. According to Jesus, how should Christian disciples treat their parents?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	Parents should be loved, honored and cared for.<br>b.	Parents should be taken care of by the church community.<br>c.	Parents should be hated. --More family values from the "Good Book."<br>"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." (Luke 14:26) The word "hate" here is miseo, the Greek word for "hate," from which we get the prefix in "misanthropy" and "misogyny." The same writer uses miseo in such verses as: "Blessed are ye when men shall hate you." (Luke 6:22)<br>The concept of devaluing your family is reflected by Matthew: "And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me." (Matthew 10:37-3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Why not love your family first? This sounds like something an uneasy dictator would say.<br>d.	Parents should be ignored--"Let the dead bury the dead"--because when you are born again, God becomes your true parent.<br><br><strong>33. According to Jesus, how should slaves be treated?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	They should be beaten daily to keep them in line.<br>b.	They should be beaten for disobedience, but not more severely then they deserve. --Jesus never denounced slavery: he endorsed it! He incorporated it into his teachings as if it were the most natural order (which it was for the biblical writers who didn't know any better). Why doesn't the bible--supposedly inspired by an all-loving deity--ever hint that there is something wrong with such a brutal social institution? If it were not for the influence of the bible (see answer 'd' below), the appalling American slave trade might have been curtailed, along with the bloody Civil War.<br>"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes." (Luke 12:47-4<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> The entire context (Luke 12:41-4<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> shows that this is not part of a parable--it is the explanation of a parable, after Peter asked a question. But even if it were a parable, it would carry the same weight as a teaching of Jesus.<br>The word "servant" above is doulos, which means "slave" in Greek, and is correctly rendered "slave" by the NRSV, NAS, Scholar's Version, and others. "Shall" meant "should," as Jesus adds: "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required." (Luke 12:4<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>c.	They should be treated humanely, as members of the family. --Paul did urge Philemon to treat his slave Onesimus as a brother (Philemon 15-16), but he was not speaking for Jesus, and Onesimus was a special case, a personal friend. Paul never denounced slavery.<br>d.	They should be set free because slavery is wrong. --The Bible nowhere states that slavery is wrong. Slavery is ordained by the Bible: "Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, . . . and they shall be your possession . . . they shall be your bondmen forever." (Leviticus 25:45-46) "If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing . . . And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do." (Exodus 21:2,7) "Servants [slaves], obey in all things your masters." (Colossians 3:22)<br><br><strong>34. What did Jesus say about peace?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	"Peace on earth, good will toward men." --This Christmas message from Luke 2:14 contradicts Jesus himself.<br>b.	"Don't think that I came for peace on earth. I came to start wars." --Are these the words of a good man?<br>"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34) "I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division." (Luke 12:49-51) These words, by the way, come immediately after Jesus talked about beating slaves. (See Question 33)<br>c.	"Each person makes their own peace, according to their faith and how they treat others."<br>d.	"There is no peace apart from God." --Paul sometimes wrote about peace (see Romans 15:33), but this also contradicts Jesus.<br><br><strong>35. Which one of these phrases did Jesus not say about witnessing?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	"Thou shalt not bear false witness." (Matthew 19:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>b.	"God is my witness." --Paul wrote: "For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son." (Romans 1:9) Notice that Jesus contradicts himself below.<br>c.	"If I bear witness of myself, it is true." --"Jesus answered and said unto them, though I bear record [martyria] of myself, yet my record [martyria] is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and wither I go." (John 8:14) Martyria means "bear witness" (NAS) or "testify" (NIV, NRSV), the same word used in the contradictory John 5:31 (below).<br>d.	"If I bear witness of myself, it is not true." --"If I bear witness [martyria] of myself, my witness [martyria] is not true." (John 5:31) Martyria means "bear witness" (NAS) or "testify" (NIV, NRSV), the same word used in the contradictory John 8:14 (above).<br>Needless to say, Jesus was not very reliable, nor was he very clear.<br><br><strong>36. What personal sacrifice for "the kingdom of heaven" was Jesus talking about when he told his disciples, "He that is able to receive it, let him receive it"?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	Leave your family. --Yes, Jesus did encourage followers to leave their families (Mark 10:29-30), but not using that phrase.<br>b.	Pluck out your eyes. --Yes, Jesus did talk gruesomely about plucking out eyes and cutting off hands (Matthew 5:29), but not using that phrase.<br>c.	Become poor. --Yes, Jesus did encourage poverty (see Question 31), but not using that phrase.<br>d.	Castrate yourself. --No wonder we don't hear sermons from the entire New Testament--how many preachers actually take this ghastly advice seriously?! Although some have prudently tried to interpret this as celibacy rather than castration, the early church father Origen read it literally and took a knife to himself. There were entire monastic orders, and church choirs in need of sopranos known as "castrati" based on this teaching of Jesus. Literal or not, the face value of this verse is physical mutilation:<br>"But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs from the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it." (Matthew 19:11-12) The Scholar's Version has: "There are castrated men who castrated themselves because of Heaven's imperial rule. If you are able to accept this (advice), do so."<br>Tragically, every year there are reported cases of Christian followers mutilating themselves because "the bible tells me so."<br><br><strong>37. According to New Testament medical advice, what should you do if you are sick?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	Seek medical help from doctors ordained by God.<br>b.	Ask the church elders to apply oil to your skin and pray for you. --Verses like these have resulted in the needless deaths of adults and criminal-neglect deaths of children from treatable illnesses that were left untreated because of prayer. Why couldn't the biblical deity have dispensed some useful medical advice to the human race instead of placebo prescriptions for prayer?<br>"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up." (James 5:14-15)<br>c.	Ask Jesus or the elders to exorcise the evil spirits from your body.<br>d.	Kneel down before a brass serpent wrapped around a pole. --The Old Testament contains this absurd alternative medicine remedy for snake bite: "And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived." (Numbers 21:9)<br><br><strong>38. What does Paul prohibit a woman from wearing in church?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	A hat, or any head covering. --(See Question 9)<br>b.	Gold. --How many Christian women know they are breaking God's law by wearing gold wedding rings to church? Or pearls or braids or expensive clothing? This is all part of the biblical plan to keep women in their place (see Question 39).<br>"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shame-facedness and sobriety; not with broided [braided] hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array." (I Timothy 2:9) Paul was not simply giving his own personal advice here; he introduced these verses with: "Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity." (I Timothy 2:7)<br>c.	Necklaces, bracelets or anklets.<br>d.	Men's clothing. --The Old Testament indeed prohibits cross dressing: "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all who do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God." (Deuteronomy 22:5) Are women's pantsuits and men's earrings an abomination?<br><br><strong>39. According to Paul, what is the role of women in the church?</strong><br>Answer: C<br>a.	Women are equal to men in all respects.<br>b.	Women do the praying, singing and testifying, while men handle the preaching and finances.<br>c.	Women must keep silent. They should learn from their husbands at home. --This sexist admonition continues to be invoked by Catholics and patriarchal Protestant denominations to turn women into second-class citizens.<br>"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church." (I Corinthians 14:34-35) "I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God." (I Corinthians 11:3) "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord." (Colossians 3:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> "Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

Women are not allowed in church except on high holidays.<br><br><strong>40. What does Paul say about marriage?</strong><br>Answer: A<br>a.	"I wish everyone were single like me." --As author Ruth Green put it, the "Christian family" is a "Christian fantasy." Paul's belief that "it is good for a man not to touch a woman" (I Corinthians 7:1) led to the doctrine of celibacy and other warped teachings on sexuality. Nineteenth-century feminist author Matilda Joslyn Gage pointed out that this teaching directly led to such woman-hating abuses as the witch-hunts.<br>"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I." (I Corinthians 7:7-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>b.	"Celibacy is a pagan practice."<br>c.	"Elders and deacons may have more than one wife." --Paul seemed to acknowledge that some Christian men below the rank of Bishop or Elder had more than one wife: "A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife." (I Timothy 3:2) "Ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children." (Titus 1:5-6) But he did not prohibit or permit polygamy.<br>d.	"If your feelings are only sexual, then don't get married." --On the contrary! According to Paul, if you can't contain your sexual urges, you are better off getting married: "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn." (I Corinthians 7:8-9) Is this what parents should teach their children?<br><br><strong>41. Paul forbids divorce, but Jesus allows it under one</strong> circumstance. What is that circumstance?<br>Answer: B<br>a.	If the husband has sex outside of marriage.<br>b.	If the wife has sex outside of marriage. --Sexism illustrated: in Christianity, only a male can divorce a cheating spouse.<br>"It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery." (Matthew 5:31-32) Not only did Jesus contradict Paul (I Corinthians 7:10), he admittedly contradicted the Mosaic law (Deuteronomy 24:1), which allowed divorce on much broader grounds.<br>c.	If either has sex outside of marriage.<br>d.	If the wife fails to produce a son.<br><br><strong>42. What group of people will make it into the heavenly choir?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	Those who are "poor in spirit."<br>b.	Those who confess their sins and accept Jesus as their savior.<br>c.	God's chosen people, the Jews.<br>d.	144,000 male virgins who have not been defiled with women. --No women allowed! Notice the sexism: women "defile" men.<br>"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. . . . And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb withersoever he goeth." (Revelation 14:1-4)<br>No Christians allowed! These singers are made up of 12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel (Revelation 7:4-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br><strong>43. Which one of these words is in the bible?</strong><br>Answer: B<br>a.	Trinity. --Although the word "trinity" is used by most Christian groups, it appears nowhere in the bible, and the concept is difficult to support biblically. It was first used by Christians more than a century after the birth of Christianity, probably by Tertullian (145-220). The current doctrine of "one God in three persons" is not found in the bible, although some think they find it in verses where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are mentioned together. (See II Corinthians 13:14).<br>b.	Liberal. --In the King James version of the bible, "liberal" is a good word. The word "conservative" appears nowhere in the bible.<br>"The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself." (Proverbs 11:25) "The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful." (Isaiah 32:5) "But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand." (Isaiah 32:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> "Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men . . . Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift." (II Corinthians 9:13-15)<br>c.	Christmas.<br>d.	Rapture. --"Rapture" is a term used by some Christians to refer to what will happen to believers when they are "caught up" to heaven: "The dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord." (I Thessalonians 4:16-17. See also I Corinthians 15:52.) The word "rapture" does not appear in bible. Notice also the primitive flat-earth cosmology: heaven is "up in the clouds."<br><br><strong>44. Where does the bible say that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights?</strong><br>Answer: D<br>a.	The laws of Moses.<br>b.	Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.<br>c.	The Book of Revelation.<br>d.	Nowhere. --Nowhere in the bible will you find an acknowledgement that human beings have inherent rights to life, liberty, happiness, dignity, fairness, or self-government. In the bible, humans are sinners, worms, and slaves--God has all the rights.<br>"There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." (Proverbs 14:12) "Lean not unto thine own understanding." (Proverbs 3:5) "Bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." (II Corinthians 10:5) "Captivity" is not freedom. The U.S. Declaration of Independence is a humanistic, anti-biblical document.<br><br><strong>45. Should Christians allow nonbelievers into their homes?</strong><br>Answer: No<br>Yes.<br>No. --Acting inhospitably is the Christian thing to do. Notice how this verse unfairly equates unbelief and diversity with evil: "If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds." (II John 10-11)<br><br><strong>46. Should Christian men kiss each other?</strong><br>Answer: Yes<br>Yes. --Why do we not see men kissing in church, then? "Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss." (I Thessalonians 5:26. See also Romans 16:16; I Corinthians 16:20; II Corinthians 13:12; I Peter 5:14)<br>No.<br><br><strong>47. Should Christians always give what they have to anyone who asks for it?</strong><br>Answer: Yes<br>Yes. --In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said: "Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again." (Luke 6:30, repeated in Matthew 5:42) Try asking Christians for their houses and possessions, and see how faithful they are to the teachings of Jesus. Borrow a Christian's car and see if they ever ask for it back. Modern believers know that Jesus was wrong and the bible is not to be taken literally.<br>No.<br><br><strong>48. Do the Ten Commandments prohibit incest or rape?</strong><br>Answer: No<br>Yes.<br>No. --The "ten commandments" (see Question 1) do not condemn any sexual acts. The only sexual practice prohibited by the list in Exodus 20 is adultery, which, although a valid marital concern, is a legal act between consenting adults. The violent and degrading crimes of rape and incest surely should have rated a "top ten" list, but they do not appear. Adultery in the Old Testament was considered a crime that could only be committed by a wife. Harper's Bible Dictionary explains: "The law was probably intended to ensure that any child born to the wife was really the husband's child, since it was considered crucial for the husband to have offspring, so that the family name could be perpetuated." Adultery had bearing on the patriarchy, while more violent crimes did not.<br><br><strong>49. If you lose a lawsuit, should you pay exactly what the court decides?</strong><br>Answer: No<br>Yes.<br>No. --You should pay twice as much! In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus commands: "And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain." (Matthew 5:40-41) Are bible-believing Christians really paying double court-ordered child support? Or are they wiser than Jesus?<br><br><strong>50. Can Christians ask their boss for a raise?</strong><br>Answer: No<br>Yes.<br>No. --It is unChristian to ask for a raise: "And [John the Baptist] said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? and he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages." (Luke 3:13-14) Modern Christians who love their families know better than this: it is not responsible to deny yourself a fair market wage, especially if you have children to support. Real family values transcend the bible. [John the Baptist was "preparing the way" for Jesus when he supposedly spoke these words.]<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>that is what we mean by faith.. we believe the bible is inspired by God.</blockquote>Then they should be correct in saying tat the heart is not the center of thinking but the brain is. So the currect science development then is not an issue<br><br><blockquote>but anyway, to answer your question.<br>life is given in Christian context. it is not for us to end it. we're commanded to live life to the fullest.</blockquote>Okie, this is written in bible or by the priest ? They have differences u see.<br><br>BTW wat is the point of living ? I mean in the end all goes to heaven or hell. Why don't might as well lead us there in the first place ? Why ask us to go through here, in the human world first ?<br><br><blockquote>True...the Bible is God's Word has been believed by many in faith but the Scriptures has over the centuries proved itself to be what it says through several archaeological and historical testings. It is able to stand firm in the face of critics. The prophecies fufilled and many other biblical contents has been observed to be more than just mere human writings. </blockquote>I am interested in knwoing the several archaeological and historical testings. Wat prophecies had been fulfilled ?<br><br>IMO, prophecies r mainly... rubbish.... firstly, there r many prophecies by other religions and non religious people tat had came through too. So who is correct or wrong ?<br><br>Secondly, I too can make some prophecies for the future now. I can say there will be a great war in future, people can go to Mars or live in deep seas. Man can colonise the moon and we discover something tat will be smaller than electrons.<br><br>The problem of prophecies is tat I can just talk cock here. When it never occcurs yet, I can say it is correct, but the time isn't now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright alright, dun quarrel dun quarrel.  I would agree that SILLYME has a point that this whole discussion should be religion as a whole and not just on CHRISTIANITY and STUPIDISSMART, I also understand you have many questions about religion and maybe particularly on CHRISTIANITY.<br><br>While I can say that I enjoy an intellectual discussion, I am humbled to say that not all discussions about CHRISTIANITY or the BIBLE or CHRIST or GOD can be done on intellect alone.  Discussions on the issue of religion and discussing it intellectually or in a scholaristic way is quite a contradiction.  Why religion still exists nowadays cannot be explained using merely numbers, words or facts.  Religion is largely something people hold close to their hearts.  It is not something someone can explain easily.  A old provision shop uses the pail instead of the cash register. A old medical hall uses the old scale instead of a new weighing scale.  To some people, using such things is not moving with times, not up to date, not being practical but yet these people just wanna use them. Do they not know there are better weighing scales? Do they not know there are cash registers? More often than not, these people would tell you, feelings, they have feelings for it.  Have you ever had something you like, a behaviour you displayed that you cant explained but you just like it.  I like green colour but i just cant explain it.  Maybe it was when I was young, i see alot of grass, maybe.<br><br>Asking whether religion is relevant after science is like comparing apple to orange.  They are 2 different things.  Science thrive on facts.  They work on the basis that everything must be proven by physical proof before it can be consider 'stamped and approved by science.'.  But is this world all about science? Can science tell us everything?  Science can tell us that generally when the heart stops beating, the person is dead but can science tell us why should the heart be the "control centre" and not the liver, not the lungs or the kidneys?  Why are we made this way?  Will we say that something is fake just because science cannot prove it?  Can science show me physical proof why i like green colour?  There are many things about the human mind and heart that science do not know.  Religion appeals to the human mind, the "irrational" part of it (i prefer to call it the faith part, haha).  Just as there are PHYSICAL LAWS that GOVERN the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, so are ther SPIRITUAL LAWS that GOVERN the SPIRITUAL SIDE of us.<br><br>The fact is that SCIENCE is important to us, it answers many questions that we have but it doesnt have an answer to everything.  And until SCIENCE can claim to be all knowing, religion is still as important as science in many peoples' lives.</div>

A story book of myth ? A holy text where everyone must believe it to be absolute truth ? A history textbook where it tells people wat had happened in the past ?<br><br>If u ask me, a real believer should treat the bible as something like a "history" book. Because inside it wrote events tat had occured and expect everyone to believe in it. I mean, they wrote on God tat create the world and adam and eve. Do they want u to believe in them seriously or believe just to... well.. be spiritually satisfied.<br><br>And there are many other holy text in the world. Quran and buddhist and taoist etc. They r completely different, surely some of them r wrong or right. How to tell ? Since they all had predict the past, wat better way to prove it other than reviewing the past to see if it is accurate. In tis sense, science has to be involved to verify it.<br><br><blockquote>Can science tell us everything? </blockquote>Science cannot tell us everything so we should work more on it.  Did religion tell u everything in the first place ? Why ask such an unfair question ?<br><br><blockquote>Science can tell us that generally when the heart stops beating, the person is dead but can science tell us why should the heart be the "control centre" and not the liver, not the lungs or the kidneys? Why are we made this way?</blockquote>Why should there be a "why ? Why should there be a reason for why things r created the things they r ? Can't they just occur naturally ?<br><br>BTW, did religion tell u why liver can't work like a lung or why pigs oink ? Religion doesn't have the answer about it either.<br><br><blockquote>Will we say that something is fake just because science cannot prove it?</blockquote>In certain context, the answer is yes. Take note I do not say ALL must be fake.<br><br>If science cannot proves it, and nothing proves it, and there r so many different religions out there claiming different version of creations and etc etc, why make such a big commitment ?<br><br><blockquote>Can science show me physical proof why i like green colour? </blockquote>About colours, there is no proof, u r correct. However in religion, past events had claimed to be performed.

Just as there are PHYSICAL LAWS that GOVERN the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, so are ther SPIRITUAL LAWS that GOVERN the SPIRITUAL SIDE of us. </blockquote>I got a question. Why need something to filled out the spritual side ? Freethinker surely lack in this aspect yet still leads fulfilling lives. Is tat necessary ?<br><br>No hard feelings but... to me it seems like "I know I am cheated here, but I still want to do it". It is like escapism, self delusion....<br><br><blockquote>And until SCIENCE can claim to be all knowing, religion is still as important as science in many peoples' lives.</blockquote>there is one thing in science, tat is it is never possible to know everything.
