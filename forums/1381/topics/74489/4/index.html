Thallus, a Samaritan historian, wrote ca. 52 A.D. attempting to give a natural explanation for the darkness which occurred at the crucifixion of Jesus. He tried to rationalise the darkness as an eclipse but found that was impossible because he knew the Jews celebrated the passover during a full moon and Jesus died before the day of the passover(Luke 22:13-15). A full moon is only possible when the earth is between the sun and the moon. A solar eclipse is only possible when the moon is between the sun and earth. So the darkness was a miracle.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>When I said perfect, I meant to say "without sin"</blockquote>And u claims tat "perfect" should only include "sins" etc. In tat case, only human r imperfect. Why ? all the animals and beast r without sins too. They r perfect. All the non living things tat u see r perfect too. Can the chair have sin ? Can the food u eat have sin ? They r all perfect too. The only thing tat is imperfect now is human. I feel this use of the term "perfect" is a bit obtuse. Wat is the Dictionary interpretation of perfect ? Flawless, no room for further improvement.<br><br>Tat shows a problem of religion again. Someone in the other forum claims tat God is perfect, and his meaning is to take the word perfect, literally. If u get 100 people to read the bible, they will have 100 different interpretation of it. Even wise men do not agree with the interpretation of bible too, wat is more normal people. This may result in adverse effect like people commiting sins like murder etc, then believe it can be washed clean by confessing. This may also result in some peopel commiting sucide because they interprete going to heaven beats staying in human world. This is anopther problem of believing in religion<br><br><blockquote>Come on la, truth exists independently of your belief. You think if you don't believe in Him, you're not under His control</blockquote>Wat I am trying to argue is why should people have more purpose when they believe in religion as some people suggested. I am glad u realise this point too, that the truth exists irregardless of whether u believe or not.<br><br><blockquote>Anyway, I am always reminded of Pascal's wager. In the end, what do we have but nothing to lose and everything to gain</blockquote>Wrong. U have lost your time, your effort and your money. They r quite substantial if u take notice. Here people r complaining they do nto have enough money yet give big donation to church regardless of it.<br><br>Second, u r already at the losing end of pascal wager because believing in a faith ultimately means u had occur the wrath of the other religion. Their God r no less merciful either. They claims tta if u refuse to believe them, u will also suffer hell or in th very least, treated as "second class citizens". No matter wat, u lose ! SO wat people shoud do is to find the truth.<br><br><blockquote>you can try christian sources</blockquote>Christian sources r by its own biase. I have heard of muslim sources or Hindu sources claiming their religion is real and the other fake. Is it possible to believe in all of them ? Wat we need is a neutral 3rd party<br><br><blockquote>how bout non-biblical sources like suetonius, lucian of samosata, justin martyr, tertullian, jewish talmuds, etc even encyclopedia britannica</blockquote>The problem with tis, as I said earlier, is they r too young. Their grandfather isn't born yet, how can they be witness to his being ? Wat they can only gather is from hearsay.<br><br>And most of these accounts only mention a "person" being cruxified. They never talk about their miracles tat they have performed or things they have done. Won't tat be strange ?<br><br><blockquote>Of course, that and besides, athiesm as a worldview to me seems greatly myopic as well, seeming to focus an inordinate amount of energy on disproving God rather the asking questions about where we are going or how we got here, I wonder if they know the implications of their beliefs</blockquote>If we give an answer where or how we get there, then tat will be a religion by itself. Wat I am trying to say here is believe in a religion only when it can be proved. Otherwise I do not see the point of believing something blindly.<br><br><blockquote>Consider the following, one guy once said how "I marvel at the way athiests tell me with such joy and smugness that the faith I hold to be dear, that my human soul, was nothing more then a puff of smoke, mere vapour. And that they do with much relish. But if that was true, why would they be speaking of it with such joy, would it not be, in fact? The saddest thing in the world?" </blockquote>Sad or not, the truth exists regardless of wat u believe. Suppose there isn't any soul etc. WHen freethinker die, they go out in a "puff of smoke". When believer, who believe tat they will be going to heaven or hell dies, he too go out in a "puff of smoke". It is not a choice. Whether it is sad or dissappointing, it is not a choice. The aim is to find the truth, or the thing tat seems to be more true and believe in it. NOT to find the favourite ending or religion tat promises the most benefit and believing them.<br><br><blockquote>Ultimately all the house of cards we build will be blown down and trampled on by others. That is fine if you are fortunate enough to live a life in which your comfortable illusionary constructs are not always shattered by harsh reality, but then again, if your constructs do not really hold out to reality, of which a belief in them is more of a convience, rather then truth, would it not be not worth believing in? </blockquote>Not really understanding wat u r saying here but my asnwer is<br><br>Be strong, wake up. Truth exists no matter wat u believe in. Don't live in self delusion.<br><br><blockquote>Are not all our intellectual pursuits, our relationships, our wealth, our political views... are they not meaningless in the end after we perish? The same grave awaits the rich and the poor, the wise and the foolish. If there are no absolutes to base our world on, then truly we are playing the game for nothing. </blockquote>Tat is wat Buddhist teach isn't it ?<br><br>Isn't wat the things u have been doing to improve your life or the lives of other a meaning of its own ? Isn't trying to be happy a good objective in your life ? Tat is why we should cherish our lives and live it to the fullest. There isn't another chance, another try. Live a life wihout regrets.<br><br><blockquote>Hence if anybody should be an athiest, I suggest that they be so to the extent that they don't even believe in believing in God, much less meander in shallow basal arguments which hardly shake anything</blockquote>Sorry man, truth hurts. Don't believe in something just because they promise u the best things or your prefer way of "ending". Believe in something more rational. Believe in the truth, or wat u preceive as truth.<br><br><blockquote>Eh, are you agreeing in micro evolution? 'cause I've no problem with that. True there are many species of dogs, still they are dogs right? Hell, dogs and wolfs can interbreed. However, no one has seen a dog give birth to a fish or vice versa right? And what do you mean by single source? The first dog and fish? Yeah I can accept that too. However I cannot accept that dogs and fish come from the same source. What source is that? And where's the transitional specie?<br>All in all, you still have not explained the origins of life. Neither has any scientist been able to explain it too.</blockquote>We both agree on micro evolution, tat is cool. However have u ever wonder why micro evolution won't end up in macro evolution ?

Why is it difficult to visualise tat some of these mudfish evolve into crawling with their fins, which evolved into legs.

Micro evolution, after such a long time may turn out to be macro evolution after a long period of time.<br><br><blockquote>From all your past post stupidissmart, I gather you won't believe in anything unless you are 100% convinced right?</blockquote>Is tat something wrong ? I believe in science because it leaves me no room for doubt. I am 100% convinced about it.<br><br></div>

Hmm, maybe you're right, fish became frogs and then dogs. Being a man of science I believe you have some evidence to show these transition from fish to frog to dog, since you must be convinced 100% before believing, I would like to view these evidences so that I can be conivinced too.<br><br></div>

If u want me to compare religion, I think u should ask the other believers, not a non believer like me. Wat I can give is perhap a worldview, on the issues such as problem of evil, our purpose in life, morality by a freethinker<br><br>There r 7 sins of mankind. Wrath, greed, glutton, vain, envy, lust, sloth. These r skills needed for survival, or skills man pick up when they evolve.<br><br><strong>Wrath</strong>: If there is no wrath, then Man cannot protect itself. When people is being bullied, being attacked or being hit, wrath is usually the mechanism tat make people fight back. Such action will ensure they will less likely be the source of being attack or bullied, thus such people survive<br><br><strong>Greed</strong>: If man has no greed, he has no moltivation. Without greed, will Man study or work ? In society without greed, everybody will live off from the state welfare and not strive to make money. People who r more greedy will survive better than peopel who have none since they will work harder and have more resources at their disposal<br><br><strong>Glutton</strong>: If Man has no glutton, he will have an eat disorder. No glutton means they will not deprive any sense of enjoyment in eating food. Eating became a torture which is never good for human. Man who r glutton tend to eat more and thus establish a better physical body and is more likely to survive<br><br><strong>Vain</strong>: If Man is not vain, he has no pride. He will not have pride in his work and he will not be "professional". Everything he do, he just aims for a "pass", not an "A". People who have pride tend to display better result, thus have more rersources and survive better<br><br><strong>Envy</strong>: If Man has no envy, he too has lost a motlivation factor. People will not compare wat they had done to the other people and thus their progress is stagnant and society never improve much. Again people who is envious will work hard and thus have more resources, making them better survivals<br><br><strong>Lust</strong> : This is important too. If Man has no lust, they will not have sex thus do not reproduce. This make them bad survivals and their population will dies off soon<br><br><strong>Sloth</strong>: This is an indication for Man whether has he worked too hard. Man has its limitation, Man need rest. If they do not have sloth, they probably worked past their limit which make them worse survivals.<br><br>As such, the evil in the world is necessary for Survival, which is in form with evolution. Too little, and u will face problems like unable to protect itself, unable to improve, unable to eat, unable to reproduce, unable to excel and unable to rest. Everybody has such qualities to a certain extent. Such qualities, if in small qualities will work well for survival. Otherwise, they will become sins as indicated above. It is like sugar in the body. Too high a level people will have diabetes and face a lot of problems. If the sugar level is too low, the brain will eb starved off and will die immediately.<br></div>

There r of course people tat choose to be happy with their love ones, to live life together happily. Aren't these purpose in lives ? U r free to choose wat u want to be in future.<br><br>For morality refer to tis artical from<br><br>http://freethought.freeservers.com/reason/morals.html<br><br>Theists often claim that their religion is necessary for morality. Obviously this is not the case as most people are good, decent people whether they believe in gods or not. Actually, nontheists get their morals from the same place as theists: human compassion and empathy. Christians, for example, do not get decent morals from the Bible. How do I know this? Because the god of the Bible is one of the most evil creatures in all of mythology. He ordered the wholesale slaughter of many innocent people, often singling out women and children to be murdered (see just about anywhere in the Old Testament); he punished people who worshipped the wrong god by ordering "their little ones" to be "dashed to the ground" and their pregnant women to be "ripped open"; he ordered his warriors to commit genocide, and they murdered every Midianite man, women, and child except for the 32,000 female virgins that the warriors were told to "save for yourselves"; and he created a place called hell which he uses to torture people who he dislikes for all eternity. (For more information on the Bible god, see Bible Atrocities, Murder Most High, and Is the Bible God Good?.) Most Christians, at least in this era, do not do these types of things. Instead, they have applied their own moral standards to weed out and ignore those parts of the Bible that don't fit in with their values. The claim that the Bible can serve as the ultimate moral guide is patently absurd.<br><br>Does organized religion help society? Well, organized religion does some good. For example, it can help foster a sense of community among its believers. Unfortunately, it can also create conflict between different groups of believers. Organized religion can sometimes inspire people to be kinder, to be more charitable, and to help others. But not always; consider the following: Protestants and Catholics are murdering each other in Northern Ireland. Adolf Hitler was a professed Christian whose actions were consistent with the evil Old Testament god (see Hitler's Christianity). More recently, Christians have carried out a genocidal campaign against Muslims in Kosovo. Islamic terrorists have murdered many innocent people in order to further their goals. Christian terrorists have attacked abortion clinics in the name of their god (these hypocrites call themselves pro-life; they may be pro-fetus-life, but their actions prove that they are very anti-human-life). In addition to starting wars and inspiring fanatics to commit murder, religion can damage its believers sense of personal responsibility by allowing them to shift their responsibility onto God or Satan, and this can have adverse effects on the believers' morality.<br><br>Religionists often point out that some atheists, particularly communists, have also committed evil acts. This is true enough. There is, however, an important distinction to be made: Theists have been inspired by their religion to commit atrocities, while communists have been inspired to commit atrocities, not by their lack of belief in gods, but by their political beliefs and desires.<br><br>Many theists would argue that even if some people have done evil things in the name of religion, most religious people are good, moral people, and that religion on the average provides a positive moral benefit. It is true that most religious people are good, moral people, but so are most nontheists. The theists' claim that religion is morally beneficial on the average is completely without merit. Not only is there no evidence indicating a positive correlation between religion and morality, there is evidence of a negative correlation:<br><br>"The United States is the most religious of all the industrialized nations. Forty-four percent of Americans attend church once a week, compared with 27 percent in Britain, 21 percent in France, 16 percent in Australia, and 4 percent in Sweden. Yet violent crime is not less common in the United States--it's more common. The murder rate here is six times higher than the rate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, five times higher than in Australia, and five times higher than in Sweden. Japan, where Christianity has almost no adherents, has less violent crime than almost any country....Within the 50 states, there is no evidence that a God-fearing populace equals a law-abiding populace. The Bible Belt has more than its share of both praying and killing. Louisiana has the highest churchgoing rate in the country, but its murder rate is more than twice the national average. The same pattern generally holds in the rest of the South..." - Steve Chapman in Praise the Lord, Pass the Ammo.<br><br>Another source of data on religion and morality is statistics on religious beliefs of prisoners compared with beliefs of the general population. This data indicates that theists are more than 40 times more likely than atheists to end up in prison. We should not read too much into this large number, however, since it is influenced by many factors. One consideration is that atheism is positively correlated to such things as educational attainment, higher scores on intelligence and achievement tests, and higher income, while crime is negatively correlated with these things.<br><br>Religion, on the average, is apparently not a positive moral force. A vastly superior moral framework is provided by secular humanism which uses human reason and empathy to construct moral values. Humanists believe that morality should be based on human values, not arbitrary edicts from an imaginary god.<br><br>For pascal wager<br><br>http://freethought.freeservers.com/reason/pascal.html<br><br>Blaise Pascal did not believe that reason alone could justify belief in a god. He came up with the following wager as an attempt to decide whether or not we should believe based on the possible outcomes for the afterlife.<br><br>Say that God exists. This god created the universe and everything in it including us. When we die, God selects some of us for eternal paradise and others for eternal torture. Of all the creatures on Earth, humans are the only ones that God gave intelligence, so obviously God wants us to use our intellect and to be freethinkers. So when we die, God will reward freethinkers with eternal paradise and punish the people who through away their reason by sending them to hell.<br><br>The wager is this: If you abandon reason and believe in God and it turns out that she exists, you are sent to hell in the next life. However, if you apply your intellect and withhold belief, and God actually exists, you get to go to heaven in the next life. Furthermore, if God does not exist and you spent your life believing in her, you have sacrificed your integrity and your self-respect and you have spent a lifetime helping to hold back human progress. So if God exists and you believe in her, you lose. And if God does not exist and you believe in her, you lose. Therefore we should all disbelieve.<br><br>Christians have more to worry about here than theists who do not believe in the Bible. By claiming that the Bible is the word of God, Christians accuse God of ordering mass murder and approving of rape and slavery. This may deeply offend God and she may punish Christians more harshly than others.<br><br>Wait a minute. Pascal didn't conclude that we should all disbelieve; somehow he concluded that people were better off if they did believe. Oh yes, now I remember. Pascal postulated the existence of a perverse god that sent freethinkers to hell and rewarded irrational believers with eternal paradise. That's why he got the conclusion backwards.<br><br>The problem with the above arguments are that they use a false dichotomy. That is, they incorrectly restrict the large number of possible situations to just two. A particular god exists or it doesn't. This ignores the fact that we could have just as easily postulated the existence of any number of gods each with her own criteria for salvation and damnation. Say that the possibilities in Pascal's wager are that the "freethought god" described above exists or that the god of Christian mythology exists. What is the conclusion of Pascal's wager now?<br></div>

Ok, maybe you think spend 10% every month on KTV and pub is more worthy than giving it to God</blockquote>Simple, on something meaningful u shouldn't save a single cent. Or something meaningless, u shouldn't spend a single cent. 10% is A LOT. And tis is just the bottom as people also spend on things like church building funds etc.<br><br>Lets say a 3 room HDB flat for 99 years is 250,000, your pay is $1800. This is average condition for singaporean<br><br>For one day u spend about $7 for your house, and people r complaining like sh!t. But one day u also spend $6 for your religion. So u guage how bad 10% is.<br><br>Wat is time for ? Tis time can spend on family too. I think a lot of people aren't spending enough time with their children etc. Why don't u use this time for them ? U r not depriving your sleep time, u r depriving your children time. The time spend in church could have been used for breakfast.<br><br><blockquote>No offense, Christianity never promises its believers virgins in <strong>heave</strong>n also </blockquote>Well they promise heaven isn't it ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Beats just being dead...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys.. just to contribute my ides on evolution:<br><br>Unlike all other primates, humans ordinarily walk upright, carnival rides notwithstanding. This posture makes "particular demands on the vestibular apparatus" because humans balance a large body mass "on very small areas of support" (Spoor et al., 1994, p. 645). Although chimpanzees may walk upright for brief periods--using what is called facultative bipedalism--only humans always walk that way. Our obligatory bipedalism is, in part, maintained by the distinctive arrangement of the semicircular canals in our vestibular system.<br><br>But what about the vestibular systems of so-called transitional forms between humans and other primates? Are those systems more ape-like, or more human-like? Recently, using a CT scanner, anthropologist Fred Spoor and his coworkers analyzed the inner ears of extinct hominids (in particular, Australopithecus africanus) and compared them with the inner ears seen in living primates and modern humans. Spoor's analysis confirms many creationist arguments about the nontransitional status of these hominids, and maintains the distance between hominids and modern man.<br><br>For many years, creationists (e.g., Gish 1993) have referred to the studies on Australopithecus by evolutionists Charles Oxnard and Lord Sully Zuckerman. These evolutionists, having analyzed postcranial (body) material of Australopithecus, contend that Australopithecus was not bipedal and transitional to man, but walked rather like a chimp.<br><br>Using a completely different approach from that of Oxnard and Zuckerman, and examining a different anatomical complex (the inner ear), Spoor and his coworkers support Oxnard and Zuckerman's conclusions. The "semi-circular canal dimensions" of Australopithecus, they write, resemble "those of the extant [living] great apes" (p. 645).<br><br>Once again, Australopithecus is shown to be very ape-like, not a transitional ape-man. The human condition is first found in the inner ear of Homo erectus, but insofar as Homo erectus has a modern human-like vestibular system, it offers no support for evolution. In a careful study, the creationist Martin Lubenow (1992) has demonstrated that Homo erectus does not differ sufficiently from modern man (Homo sapiens) to warrant the status of a distinct species. Rather, the differences between the two forms should be regarded as racial. A gulf exists, therefore, between humans and Australopithecus.<br><br>Evolutionists have tried to fill the gulf between by devising a "wastebasket" species, Homo habilis. But Lubenow (1992, pp. 157-166) has convincingly argued that Homo habilis is an artificial species because it combines disparate human and australopithecine remains (akin, perhaps, to mixing dog and cat bones together, giving the result a species name, and proclaiming it a transition between dogs and cats).<br><br>The Spoor study provides support for Lubenow's argument about the artificial status of Homo habilis. Two specimens, SK 847 and Stw 53, were long held to belong to the same species, with the former independently assigned to either Homo erectus or Homo habilis, and the latter to Homo habilis. Spoor and his coworkers show that the vestibular systems of the two specimens are so different that they could not have come from the same species. Specimen SK 847 should definitely be assigned to Homo erectus (and, if Lubenow is right, to human beings generally). Specimen Stw 53, on the other hand, has unique semicircular canals, although their proportions tend to resemble those of modern large primates. Spoor et al. argue that Stw 53 (which they believe should be assigned to Homo habilis) probably relied less on bipedal locomotion than did Australopithecus! Clearly, this is a step in the wrong direction (pardon the pun), evolutionarily speaking. As Spoor et al. note (p. 64<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">:<br><br>. . . the unique labyrinth of Stw 53 represents an unlikely intermediate between the morphologies seen in the australopithecines and Homo erectus.<br><br></div>
