It is called Gehenom. It's not forever. If it is God's judgment that a person has to enter Gehenom, the maximum amount of time spent there would be one Jewish year.

I think he has a big problem with comprehension. Nevertheless I will try my best to enlighten him on the reverent of the 'Oral Tradition' to the written Torah.<br><br>Jude wrote in the NT. "But Micheal the archangel disputed with the devil(Satan) and argured about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgement, but said 'The LORD rebuke you'" Jude 1:9 NASB<br><br>Let us also examine the scriptures about the death and burial of Moses.<br><br>"So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial place to this day." Deuteronomy 34:5-6 NASB<br><br>How did Jude know that Satan disputed with archangel Micheal over the body of Moses? The bible only say the 'He buried Moses'. There is such a thingy called 'Oral Tradition'; Stories handed down from the generations. These traditions are reflected in the customs and culture of the Jewish people.<br><br>Let us also consider these scriptures regarding the death of Aaron and Moses.<br><br>"Take Aaron and hs son Eleazer and bring them up mount Hor.........So Aaron will be gathered to his people, and he will die there........When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Isreal wept for Aaron thirty days." Number 20:25-29 NASB<br><br>"So the sons of Isreal wept for Moses in the plain of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end." Deuteronomy 34:8 NASB<br><br>The children of Isreal mourn for both Moses and Aaron 30 days. Why 30 days? Why not 40 or 60 days? Let us look at the Jewish Tradition on mourning the dead, we may know our answer.<br><br>In Jewish tradition the dead are mourned in 3 stages.<br><br>Stage 1. Shiva. The first 7 days.<br><br>Stage 2. Shloshim. The first 30 days. After the completion of Shloshim, offical mourning ends for mourners who are mourning anyone except their parent.<br><br>Stage 3. 1 year period. For those mourning their parent.<br><br>From the 'Oral Traditions', we understand that the children of Isreal observed 'Shloshim' after the death of Aaron and Moses. This Jewish customs explained the 30 days mourning period after the death of Moses and Aaron.<br><br>So, if we want to discuss the Jewish concept of 'Hell' and afterlife, it must be discussed in the context of the 'Oral Traditions' or 'Oral Torah'.<br><br>Shalom</div>
