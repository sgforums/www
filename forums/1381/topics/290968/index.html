Thus He has given us so many examples of great men and women of Yahweh who have responded to His love and lived their lives accordingly. But it does also tell us of the consequences should we choose our own way...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
