              <p class="MsoNormal">For awhile I didn’t know for sure what is going to happen
                                                  when people die according to the Bible. I always thought that when I died, my
                                                  spirit would depart my body and I would perhaps after spending sometime
                                                  wandering on earth, be judged according to what I did in my life by God and
                                                  either receive eternal life or be shamed and tormented in hell.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I refused to see the whole of what the Bible teaches.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">And now I’d like to share you on what I know from what the
                                                  bible teaches us. In my opinion it is important to have the correct
                                                  understanding on what would happen to us Christians after we died.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">I begin at verse 13</p>

                                                  answered, “I see a spirit rising up out of the ground.”</p>

                                                  it look like?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“It looks like an old man wearing a
                                                  robe.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Saul knew it was Samuel, so he
                                                  bowed down low.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>“<strong>Why are you bothering me by bringing me up
                                                  like this</strong>?” Samuel asked.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Note that Samuel said that Saul has bothered him by bringing
                                                  him up(not down) suggesting that Samuel was called from the Kingdom of death
                                                  instead of heaven.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The words bothering me means that Saul has disrupted
                                                  Samuel’s sleep in the Kingdom of death.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Let me quote Luke 8:40-54 or Matthew 9:18-26 or Mark 5:21-43</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It’s the story of Jesus who was begged by a man called
                                                  Jairus to come to his home because his 12 year old child was dying. She was his
                                                  only daughter.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Begin at verse 49(to make it short)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">[read the bible if you want to read the whole story]</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">While Jesus was speaking, someone
                                                  came from Jairus’s home and said, “<strong>Your
                                                  daughter has died!</strong> Why bother the teacher any more?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">When Jesus heard this, he told
                                                  Jairus, “Don’t worry! Have faith, and your daughter will get well.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Jesus went into the house, but he
                                                  didn’t let anyone else go with him, except Peter, John, James, and the girls
                                                  father and mother. Everyone was crying and weeping for the girl. But Jesus
                                                  said, “The child isn’t dead. <strong>She’s just
                                                  asleep</strong>.” The people laughed at him because they knew she was dead.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Jesus took hold of the girl’s hand
                                                  and said, “Child, get up!” She came back to life and got straight up. Jesus
                                                  told them to give her something to eat. Her parents were surprised, but Jesus
                                                  ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</p>

                                                  Lazarus was dead, but they thought he was talking only about sleep.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Then Jesus
                                                  told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead! I’m glad that I wasn’t there, because now

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Jesus then
                                                  said, “I am the one who raises the dead to life! Everyone who has faith in me

                                                  will never really die. Do you believe this?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There are actually more verses from the bible that gives us
                                                  insight as to what would happen once we died. I hope what I wrote here can
                                                  serve a purpose on your life.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The Lord who is able to bring us back to life as in Lazarus and the only daughter of Jairus is also able to raise us and give us eternal life. Lazarus and Jairus's only daughter  would die  again but whoever shares the Kingdom of God would no longer die.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Jesus also spoke that He would raise all the people who believe in Him on the last day so that whoever eat His flesh and drink His blood would not die but be risen on the last day. I let you find which verse this is ;). My hands are cramped already.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Summary:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">All the dead would descend to the
                                                  Kingdom of death, a place where all the dead are gathered. There they would
                                                  lose all form of awareness, of themselves, of time, of God and of faith. They
                                                  would cease to be aware of anything and becoming nothing. In a way this is to
                                                  be likened with sleeping. But there is one big difference that in sleep there’s
                                                  always perpetual life while in death there is no life at all.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I guess it's too late now to say "Damn don't eat the bloody fruit!"</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">or asked "Why did you eat the bloody fruit?"</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>            </span>Knowing and
                                                  believing this, I suggest for you fellow Christians out there to make full use
                                                  of this life. Let’s not let a moment to lose. If you work hard present them to
                                                  the Lord for you shall rest in the Kingdom of death until the Lord rises you to
                                                  life, when you do kindness present them to the Lord for you can no longer do any
                                                  kindness or after God's own heart in the Kingdom of death, <span> </span>when you worship the Lord,
                                                  worship Him with all your heart for your awareness of God would cease in the
                                                  Kingdom of death. Enjoy life for you will no longer enjoy anything in the
                                                  Kingdom of death. Treasure your relationships for you will have none in the
                                                  Kingdom of death. Pursue your salvation for you can no longer pursue it in the
                                                  Kingdom of death.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">May Jesus Christ our savior and our Lord rise we all from
                                                  our sleep in the end of time. May we share His kingdom and glory to have the

              <p>im so happy for u to finally see that death is always likened to the state of being asleep throughout the bible.</p>
              <p>that is what death really is to God. only he has the power to raise the dead back to live. only those who WERE(meaning no such thing now) given the authority to raise dead will be able to do so too.</p>
              <p>most who have died frm last time till the last days will be resurrected to learn about God for those who did not have the chance. those who already is pleasing to God will live forever. those who denied God's authority will go back to sleep forever..never was there anything written in the bible of a eternal tormenting hell. your kingdom of death is used as a metaphor ya? so in the end, even fallen angels a.k.a demons will jalan there where they too will sleep.(these is after the 1000 years of rulership by JC).</p>
              <p>being tormented eternally in "hell" is not a bible teaching. being asleep in death,being ceased in existence knowing nothing at all (conscious of nothing) is a bible truth.</p>
              <p>i congrats u again for seeing and acknowledging this simple truth that so many "christians" even leader class dont see or know.</p>

              <p>im so happy for u to finally see that death is always likened to
              the state of being asleep throughout the bible.</p>
              <p>that is what death really is to God. only he has the power to
              raise the dead back to live. only those who WERE(meaning no such
              thing now) given the authority to raise dead will be able to do so
              too.</p>
              <p>most who have died frm last time till the last days will be
              resurrected to learn about God for those who did not have the
              chance. those who already is pleasing to God will live forever.
              those who denied God's authority will go back to sleep
              forever..never was there anything written in the bible of a eternal
              tormenting hell. your kingdom of death is used as a metaphor ya? so
              in the end, even fallen angels a.k.a demons will jalan there where
              they too will sleep.(these is after the 1000 years of rulership by
              JC).</p>
              <p>being tormented eternally in "hell" is not a bible teaching.
              being asleep in death,being ceased in existence knowing nothing at
              all (conscious of nothing) is a bible truth.</p>
              <p>i congrats u again for seeing and acknowledging this simple
              truth that so many "christians" even leader class dont see or
              know.</p>

              <p>yes in Saul and the Witch of Endor what they really saw is just a familiar spirit.</p>
              <p>go read the rich man and lazarus. Luke16:26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed,
              so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone
              cross over from there to us.</p>
              <p>when we die as a believer we'll go straight to heaven. those who do not believe goes to a place call hades UNTIL the day of judgement. you can safetly say that hell now is empty.</p>
              <h3>Revelation 20:13</h3>
              <p>The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up
              the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to
              what he had done.</p>
              <p>and then what happens?</p>
              <h3>Revelation 20:14</h3>
              <p>Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">And whosoever was not found in the book of life was also cast into the lake of fire.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and to <a href="/users/226739">domonkassyu</a> yes the bible do teach of an eternally tormenting hell.</p>
              <p>Jesus spent much time warning us about the "the fire that shall never be quenched" -- a place of "weeping and gnashing of teeth". in fact he talks more about the fires of hell then the joys in heaven. it is an eternal punishment meaning you can't get out of there forever if you are there.</p>
              <p>hell is originally created for Satan and his minions for their eternal punishment for going against God. but understand that Satan wants you to join him. so on the day of judgement Jesus will come down a second time and judge. Satan and his followers including unbelievers will be cast down to hell forever.</p>
              <p>so hell is empty now and the unbelievers who are dead before the day of judgement goes to a place call Hades then where then is Satan and his minions?</p>
              <p>they are roaming the earth right down ruling over this world. Satan is prince of this world</p>
              <h3>John 16:11 and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.</h3>
              <p>he is seeking people to join him in hell and even Christians too! don't be fooled!</p>
              <h3>John 12:31 Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.</h3>
              <p>I pray to for all brothers and sisters in Christ. STAND STRONG! FOR VICTORY BELONGS TO JESUS!</p>

              down a second time and judge. Satan and his followers including
              unbelievers will be cast down to hell forever.</p>
              <p>so hell is empty now and the unbelievers who are dead before the
              day of judgement goes to a place call Hades then where then is
              Satan and his minions?</p>
              <p>they are roaming the earth right down ruling over this world.
              Satan is prince of this world</p>
              <h3>John 16:11 and in regard to judgment, because the prince of
              this world now stands condemned.</h3>
              <p>he is seeking people to join him in hell and even Christians
              too! don't be fooled!</p>
              <h3>John 12:31 Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the
              prince of this world will be driven out.</h3>
              <p>I pray to for all brothers and sisters in Christ. STAND STRONG!
              FOR VICTORY BELONGS TO JESUS!</p>

              <p>I thought likewise too...until the day God revealed something to me that quite left me  feeling uneasy(You don't have to believe me but believe what I wrote on death). The very next day some Christians gave my home a brochure of what death means to Christians, some coincidence. Since then I digged the bible a little, asked around and read a Christian book on death. Each one giving me a little understanding of what I've been allowed to feel.</p>
              <p>God bless</p>
              <p>Don't be afraid of death, that is not why I wrote what I wrote. The message is not to waste your life. It's a blessing really. When you worship God worship Him with all your heart for you will no longer be able to worship God in the Kingdom of death and so on as I wrote in my first post. Don't take life as granted. Do good to after God's own heart and try to pursue your salvation by doing good in your life. Because the dead can no longer change its fate. The good point is that since the dead is not aware of anything including time, the last day would not be felt as being too long. But still it's not a state of blessings either. The dead is at the mercy of God as there would no longer be interaction i.e, you praying, worshipping, praising God. God would still remember His people though.</p>

              <p>I thought I would like to share this verse</p>
              <p>John 6:22-59 The bread that gives Life</p>
              <p>I start from verse 53-59,</p>
              <p>[Read the bible for the complete scripture]</p>
              <p>    Jesus answered:</p>
              <p>    I tell you for certain that you won't live unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man. But if you do eat my flesh and drink my blood, you will have eternal life, and <strong>I will raise you to life on the last day</strong>. My flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink. If you eat my flesh and drink my  blood, you are one with me, and I am one with you.</p>
              <p>    The living Father sent me, and I have life because of him. Now everyone who eats my flesh will live because of me. The bread that comes down from heaven isn't like what your ancestors ate.They died, but whoever eats this bread will live forever.</p>
              <p>    Jesus was teaching in a Jewish place of worship in capernaum when he said these things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Verse 38-40,</p>
              <p>    I didn't come from heaven to do what I want! I came to do what the Father wants me to do. He sent me, and he wants to make certain that none of the ones he has given me will be lost. Instead, <strong>he wants me to raise them to life on the last day</strong>. My father wants everyone who sees the Son to have faith in him and to have eternal life. Then <strong>I will raise them to life on the last day</strong>.</p>
              <p>Go bless you all, everybody, tomorrow is Friday! Wohoo don't forget to enjoy life!</p>
