              <p>These 144000 do not go to heaven, but rather are found on Mount Tziyon.</p>
              <p>Again, I ask the question, when is it said that we are going to heaven? Even at the end of the book of Revelation, it is told us that The new Yerushalayim, is coming down out of heaven from Yahweh, and that Yahweh will dwell with us. If the Holy City is coming down out of Heaven, then where is it going?</p>
              <p>Also, read, Psalm 37, it is very clear where the righteous people go. Rather, the righteous inherit, the EARTH.</p>

              <p><em>John 14:1-4</em></p>
              <p>Jesus said to his disciples, "Don't be worried! Have faith in God and have faith in me. There are many rooms<strong> in my Father house</strong>. I wouldn't tell you this, unless it was true. I'm <strong>going there to prepare a place for each of you</strong>. after I've done this, <strong>I'll come back and take you with me</strong>. <strong>Then we'll be together</strong>. <strong>You know the way to where I'm going.</strong>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What Jesus meant that we would know the way where He was going is that  once risen from death whereever Jesus would be, we would know how to get to Him. Meaning where Jesus could go we would be able to also.</p>
              <p>As to where Jesus was going after His death,</p>
              <p><em>John 14:28</em></p>
              <p>You have already heard me say that I am going and that I will also come back to you. If you really love me, you should be glad that <strong>I am going back to the Father</strong>, because he is greater than I am.</p>
              <p><em>John 13:31-36</em></p>
              <p>I quote verse 36:</p>
              <p>Simon Peter asked, "Lord where are you going?"</p>
              <p>Jesus answered, "You can't go with me now, <strong>but later on you will</strong>."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So unless Jesus was lying baout going back to the Father or unless this Father was't the God of Abraham, there are verses who indicated that Jesus meant to say that His followers would be risen to stay with Him who is with the Father in heaven(the place where God lives, called the house of God to the Jews).</p>

              <p>Hi Evangel. If you are seeking the turth yourself you would still need to have faith in God.</p>
              <p>I hope by you having faith in God that you would find the truth yourself as God is the living God. He still works now just as He did in the past or thousands year past.</p>

              <p>MP,</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Revelation 21:1-4</strong></p>
              <p><span id="en-NKJV-31049" class="sup">1</span> Now I saw a new heaven and a new 
              earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was 
              no more sea. <span id="en-NKJV-31050" class="sup">2</span> Then I, John,<sup>[<a title="See footnote a" href="#fen-NKJV-31050a">a</a>]</sup> saw the holy city, 
              New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned 
              for her husband. <span id="en-NKJV-31051" class="sup">3</span> And I heard a loud 
              voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God <em>is</em> with men, and 
              He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with 
              them <em>and be</em> their God. <span id="en-NKJV-31052" class="sup">4</span> And God 
              will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor 
              sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have 
              passed away.”</p>
              <p><strong>Matthew 5:5</strong></p>
              <p>Blessed are the <strong>meek</strong>, for they will inherit the earth.</p>
              <p><strong>Revelation 3:12</strong><br>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of 
              My God, and he shall go out no more. I will write on him the name of My God and 
              the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of 
              <strong>heaven</strong> from My God. And I will write on him My new name.</p>
              <p>MP, have a think about it.</p>
              <p>These two verses that you used still do not show me that we will go
              to heaven when it is all said and done. If you read Psalm 37 it is very
              clear where we will be, here on earth after it is all said and done and
              the verses in Revelation Chapter 21, support this more so than "going"
              to heaven.The righteous will inherit the earth, the meek shall inherit
              the earth.</p>
              <p>Following on from your verses, if Yeshua is going back
              to the Father, and according to Revelation, the Father is coming down
              to dwell with us. Where will we be?</p>

              <p>MP,</p>
              <p>Clarification. House of Yahweh to the Jews is the Temple, which

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Revelation 21:1-4</strong></p>
              <p><span>1</span> Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
              for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also
              there was no more sea. <span>2</span> Then I,
              John,<sup>[<a title="See footnote a" rel="nofollow" href="#fen-NKJV-31050a">a</a>]</sup> saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming
              down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her
              husband. <span>3</span> And I heard a loud voice from
              heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God <em>is</em> with men,
              and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God
              Himself will be with them <em>and be</em> their God. <span>4</span> And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes;
              there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall
              be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”</p>
              <p><strong>Matthew 5:5</strong></p>
              <p>Blessed are the <strong>meek</strong>, for they will inherit the
              earth.</p>
              <p><strong>Revelation 3:12</strong><br> He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God,
              and he shall go out no more. I will write on him the name of My God
              and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes
              down out of <strong>heaven</strong> from My God. And I will write
              on him My new name.</p>
              <p>MP, have a think about it.</p>
              <p>These two verses that you used still do not show me that we will
              go to heaven when it is all said and done. If you read Psalm 37 it
              is very clear where we will be, here on earth after it is all said
              and done and the verses in Revelation Chapter 21, support this more
              so than "going" to heaven.The righteous will inherit the earth, the
              meek shall inherit the earth.</p>
              <p>Following on from your verses, if Yeshua is going back to the
              Father, and according to Revelation, the Father is coming down to
              dwell with us. Where will we be?</p>

              <p>the temple of jerusalem is indeed destroyed. but, JC also said that he would rebuild it in 3 days. many did not understand that he meant his body is the new temple of jerusalem. and when he came back frm the dead 3 days later..the temple is indeed rebuilt in 3 days.</p>

              <p>In the old testament and Torah heaven is called syamayim which means the sky a place God is believed to dwell.</p>
              <p>I quote Kings 8:30-32</p>
              <p>    I am your servant, and the people of Israel belong to you. So whenever any of us look towards this temple and pray, answer <strong>from your home in heaven</strong> and forgive our sins.</p>
              <p>    Suppose someone accuses a person of a crime, and the accused has to stand in front of the altar in your temple and say, "I swear I am innocent!". <strong>Listen from heaven</strong> and decide who is right. Then punish the guilty person and let the innocent one go free.</p>

              <p>This is a very good question.</p>
              <p>For his twelve well actually eleven disciples Jesus said that for a moment they would no longer see Him but after a moment(short time) they would again see and be with Him.</p>
              <p>also there were the two convicts which were nailed to the crossed alongside Jesus. One of them believed in Jesus and defended him. Jesus said that this very day he would be with Him in paradise (Luke 23:39-43). But Matthew and Mark made no mention of this and wrote the two criminals both said cruel things to Jesus.</p>
              <p>But again as I wrote in my previous post Jesus also spoke that He would raise His people on the last day.</p>
