            <div class='col-md body'>There have been posts by a "Catholic" who claimed that everyone are "Christians", even though they belong to and practise another religion. Even if they dun believe in Christ, they can still be saved through their own ways in their own religion.<br><br>If this doctrine is true, then the Christian concept of Hell/Paradise has to be thrown into the dustbin and the bible kept away (becoz it is so clear that those who do not believe in Christ will be condemned!) We can stop evangelising because everyone who do not believe in Christ are saved. Not just the Calvinists, but also the Arminians who do not agreed with them BELIEVED HELL IS REAL!<br><br>Furthermore, even the CATHOLICS believed in Hell for unrepentent sinners!!!! Even they believe that Christ is the only way thru Christians are saved. "Christianity" without Christ is surely not a gospel given to us by Christ and his apostles. It is the devil's lie. The devil wants u to believe that u can be saved even without Christ. Christ is taken out of the equation and the devil wants u to believe in man-made religions instead.<br><br>This is surely saddening for the state of the Church, becoz pragmatism now reigns over orthodoxy. Instead of God-centered Christianity, it has become Man-centered Christianity preached to please Man's ears.

Foreknowledge and Predestination should not be confused.<br><br>Thus the statement, "IF Satan apologised, he can be forgiven" is true. That is the policy. The word "IF" is used exactly in the same way Paul uses it in his letter to the Romans, "For Argument's Sake, IF (even though its not likely/possible)". It is a matter of policy. He does not say that Satan can have Salvation because the second unspoken statement is that, "But Alas, Satan would never repent - God knows this because God can see into the future"<br><br></div>

Be warned brethren, that you would stand fast to the faith and not be misled by heresies.</div></blockquote>You should tell me who this Catholic is. I'll talk to him. As far as I know, Most Catholics believe that:<br><br>1. Not everyone are Christians, but he who does the work of God and walks in the light of truth.<br><br>2. While a person doesn't need to know Christ on his earthly life to be saved, if he has lived according to the "truth written in his hearts", He will accordingly recognised Jesus at the "Judgement " and cry out "My Lord, it is you I have been seeking all my life." And Jesus will say, "I know, for you fed me when I was hungry, and you clothed me when I was naked" Then the person will say, "When did I ever do that?" And Jesus will say, "Whenever you did this to the least of my brothers, You did it to me". All Goodness comes from God. And apart from God, nothing Good can come. If a non-Christian lives in the "truth" and does God, it is because he has, by reducing his own pride, allowed the Holy Spirit to fill him without knowing it. Thus while he does not know it, he walks in the light.<br><br>3. We do not believe everyone will be saved.<br><br>4. We believe that Evangelism is necessary because Satan prowls around like a lion, seeking to devour the souls of men. If we do not evangelise, they will be misled and made to seek their own pleasures over "what is right and true" - the law written in their hearts. As a result, on the Day of Judgement, they will, together with Satan, say, "I will not serve you." and again, "I  do not need God", not knowing that the absence of God, is eternal torment. For if God is everything Good, the absence of God is the absence of anything at all that one can find comfort in. It's worse than an everlasting fire.<br><br>5. Christ is the only way to Salvation. If Christ had not come down and atoned for sins on the cross, no man can ever be saved. Christ's atonement was made for all time - the past, the present and the future. Abraham and Moses could not be saved, if Christ did not atone for all of mankind. Christ's sacrifice transcends time.<br><br>Tell me who leh. I will wake up his idea.</div>

As a result Mohammed copied that line and said; there is no other prophet after me, and there is no other god but Allah..</div>

You want people to gloss over the truth? Not that I am saying the Catholics are telling the truth or lying, because they too are simply believers) You what them to go away from the truth and come to your position? Your position comes with an iota of evidence and proof meh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

You are the quintessential Christian who have no ability to think but just swallow everything, gobbling up the gospels without even an ounce of brain juice. I have been thru that road and know much better from an inside perspective!</div>
