But according to the Hebrew way of seeing....a day is considered past when the sun sets and another new day begins..in other words...Holy Day Sabbath starts Friday evening. So Christ died on Friday, evening comes and the next dawn. so it is nothing wrong to say He will come back to life three days later.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

What is this creation, you may ask? This creation refers to the creation of Adam and not the creation of the heaven and the earth. In other words, the Jewish calendar starts from the creation of Adam.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>But if he were to create the world and everything living in 6 days, wouldn't he mean exactly 6 days?

Albert Einstein.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>That different people perceive time differently is vividly illustrated in the famous Twin Paradox. The effect is proven, using atomic clocks in planes.<br><br><strong>a day is considered past when the sun sets and another new day begins.</strong><br><br>The famous "erev and boker" phrase in Genesis. - "Vayehi erev vayehi boker yom echad"!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

This passage probably summarised an entire long-drawn process of technological advancement in jumping from stone-age to clay making. Once that is done, men still had to figure out the building process and the mathematics this process involve.<br><br>Point is, Genesis was not written in the styles of, say, the Epistles where literal meaning can be taken.<br><br></div>
