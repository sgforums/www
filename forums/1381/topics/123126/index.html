Was the Grail the 'cup of blood?' Is Easter Day fact or fiction? And why does it matter?"<br><br>The Da Vinci Code is a modern-day quest for the Holy Grail, the chalice from which Jesus and his disciples are said to have drunk at the Last Supper.<br><br>The book says Jesus married Mary Magdalene and had children. But Christians are taught that Jesus never married, was crucified and rose from the dead. The storyline has aroused anger among Christians.<br><br>The cardinal leading the Vatican's charge against the Da Vinci Code urged Catholics last week to shun it and branded the bestseller "a sack full of lies insulting the Christian faith".<br><br></div>

So if there is anything for Mary Magdalene, the Catholics will address her St Mary.<br><br>About the Da Vinci Code thingy, I read it many many years ago.  It think it's called the Last Temptation of Jesus Christ<br>Didn't really read it.  Just glanced thru it.  Apparently there was a movie made out of it.  But of course it is banned here and this part of the world.  Don't think the Muslim will like it either, since the Quran also never mentioned that Jesus was married.<br><br>The one that I glanced thru didn't say it he really got married.  But rather, He resurrected from death.  Before He appeared to the apostles, He was taken away by an angel.  The angel somehow brought Him to a dream or fantasy, where He got to experienced being married and having children.  Something like that lah.  So many years already.  Can't really recall the exact details.<br><br>Then about the Da Vinci Code stuff, it's been so many centuries (more than 15 centuries, I think).  It's up to people these days to interpret things the way they want to.<br><br>If Mary Magdalene was really so important as what some people claim today, then why would the church hide it?  If they had reasons to hide this, then they would do the same to Mother Mary, instead of honouring her for so many centuries.<br><br>Somemore, don't be surprised if people use this to make money.  How?  They would publish books to claim that they have found out the truth which the church didn't reveal.  Books with this kind of controversy tend to attract a lot of educated people who are curious.  (educated ppl are usually the one who have this kind of curiosity.  dunno why).  So this is a very great way to con and make money.  If I can write so well, and have so good imagination, I will do the same too since ppl these days are so easily conned by such stuff.<br><br>Also, if it is something that the church for so many centuries didn't reveal.  It will be:<br>1) destroyed either by man or by act of God (weather, earthquake etc)<br>2) discovered by the church or its ppl already.<br><br>So this theory about Mary Magdalene, I will only take it with a pinch of salt.  Nevertheless, I am quite amazed with the author to have so good imagination and the ability to con.<br><br>Another thing is the pic of last supper -- the man next to Jesus is said to be a woman.  First of all, in those days, were women allowed to sit next to a priest, teacher or any great ppl, unless they were the spouse or parents (wedding of Cana, Jesus was sitting with his Mother).<br><br>For generations, we believe that it was John.  And why can't we believe that it was John?  Just because he looked very young and "pretty" in the picture?  John was believed to be very very young.... in fact was a young boy when he followed Jesus.  John wasn't supposed to look like what we saw in the movie "Passion of Christ" with so much beard, like a mature man.  If you read carefully the bible, you would see that sometimes the way he conversed and lived with Jesus didn't really sound like an old or mature man.<br><br>So the conclusion is... you can read if you want to.  But just for fun only.   Don't take it serious.  After all, they are so many ppl who claimed they know the truth that we dunno.  Some even said that Jesus lived and died in India. Some said that he was a Buddhist and what he was preaching in the bible was Buddhism.  So who should we believe?<br><br>If you want to read it, make sure you borrow, steal, photo copy etc.  Just don't buy it.  It's your money that the authors are after.  They don't care whether you believe or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was Jesus Married?<br>All the available evidence points to an answer of "no."<br><br>By Darrell L. Bock<br>It has long been believed that Jesus was single. Every detail of Scripture indicates this. When he was in ministry, there is no mention of a wife. When he was tried and crucified, there is no mention of his having a wife. After his death, there is no mention of a wife. Whenever Jesus' family is referred to, it is his brothers and sisters who are mentioned, but never a wife. Nor is there any indication that he was widowed.<br>Attempts to suggest that any of the many women associated with his ministry were, in fact, his wife are empty speculation. This includes the woman with the alabaster container who anointed Jesus (read Luke 7:36-5 0). This woman's act was shocking and would not have been nearly so surprising had she been his wife.<br><br>We can contrast Jesus to the rest of the apostles, Peter, and the brothers of the Lord, all of whom are said to have had wives (1 Corinthians 9:5). This passage shows that the church was not embarrassed to reveal that its leaders were married-or to suggest that they had the right to be. The same would have been true of Jesus, if he had been married.<br><br>It is often suggested that because Jesus was a teacher and functioned like a rabbi that he would have been married as well, since that was the Jewish custom. Sometimes it is noted that the apostles called him 'rabbi' (Mark 11:2 1).<br><br>However, two factors make this argument weak. First, Jesus was not technically a rabbi, nor did he portray himself as one. The apostles addressed him as such to say he was their teacher, not because he held any kind of official Jewish office. The Jews asked Jesus 'by what authority' he did certain things because he did not hold any kind of formal office within Judaism. He did not have an official position that would have permitted him to do things like act within the temple (Mark 11: 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. As far as the Jewish leaders were concerned, Jesus had no recognized role within Judaism. Read another view on whether Jesus acted as a rabbi.<br><br>Second, the example of the call to be 'eunuchs for the kingdom' appears, in part, to be rooted in Jesus' own commitment and example not to be married (Matthew 19: 10-12). In fact, the rationale for the Roman church's later view that priests should not be married partially stems from the view that Jesus was not married.<br><br>So if we ask what the hard evidence is that Jesus was married, there really is a very short answer. There is none.<br><br>So why remain single? What advantage is there to this? In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul elaborated on Jesus' theme about 'eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom.' Paul expressed his preference that people remain single. Paul explained that the present time of distress, by which he meant the difficulty of life until Jesus returns, made being single better when it came to serving the kingdom. The married person must worry about the affairs of earth: how to care for his wife and, by implication, his family. The unmarried person can serve the Lord without such distraction (1 Cor. 7: 27-35).<br><br>Nevertheless, Paul also made it clear this was a choice, not a command: "But if you marry, you do not sin." (7:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Paul himself chose to remain single, probably for the very reasons he suggests in 1 Corinthians 7. He understood, as Jesus did, that others were not called to be single (1 Cor 7: 1-7).<br><br>Traditions encouraging a dedicated single life also existed elsewhere in Judaism. Members of the ascetic Jewish sect of the Essenes were known for their emphasis on celibacy (Josephus, Antiquities 18.1.5. 21; Jewish War 2.8.2.121-122; Philo, Hypothetica 11.14-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. At Qumran, most appear to have been celibate, although a Dead Sea Scroll about the community suggests some possibility (1QSa 1:4-10) of marriage, woman, and children in the messianic times. For those Essenes at Qumran, the point of remaining single was also dedication to God.<br><br>So Jesus was single. His marital status was one dimension of his dedication to God. At least, that is how many Jews would have understood it. As Jesus faced rejection, it was of benefit that he did not have a wife or children. These are likely some of the concerns Paul alluded to in speaking of "worry for earthly things." Jesus had a singular focus on preaching the kingdom of God, and his choice to be single underscored that calling.<br><br></div>
