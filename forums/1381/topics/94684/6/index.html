Why don't u answer tis question before I quote it out for u ?<br><strong>What is malicious? It is up to you! If you think I have, so be it. So you can come in here and call us dumb or stupid and that's OK? Some other people make remakes on you and you feel insulted????</strong><br><br>My remark on wasting time, is because u do not argue anything about the subject matter but on me personally. TAT is wasting time. Becoming my addiction ? Sorry man, I just wanna make people realise wat a big lie christainity is and therefore be liberated by it. It is not my "addiction" to "encounter with a group of people that disagrees with your universe", it is my conviction tat I try to make them realise the folly of their ways so they can live life better.<br><br><strong>Why bother? Christians believe that they are living better already. I donÂ’t get it. Your conviction to Â“make people realize the folly of their waysÂ” is OK? But Christians doing the same thing is NOT OK? Duh!! </strong><br><br>Sorry man, evolution present evidences tat IT EXISTS in the first place before being accepted. I believe u can see the many different evidences presented about in this thread. If u want to prove evolution wrong, u can just come out with evidences tat proves it otherwise.<br><br>For existence of god, they can't prove it exists in the first place ! Since they can't prove it, tis notion is not even accepted !<br><br><strong>You donÂ’t get it. I am one of those who believe that there is such a thing as evolution. I also believe that God started the evolution process. As I'd mentioned somewhere earlier in this thread, it all depends on how one defines evolution.</strong><br><br></div>
