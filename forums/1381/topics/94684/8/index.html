There are many ways to discuss any issue, one of it is politely by which if both parties reach an impasse, agree to disagree and move on. Another way is continue to throw rebuttals after rebuttals which leaves a sour aftertaste. There is also the question of the spirit in which the questions are asked, is it for the purpose of clarification, or is it for the purpose of fault finding? If a clarification has been made, even if it is in disagreement of one's mindset, than accept that as face value.

For Christians, Jesus said "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Matthew 22:37).

Sayso, the section u quoted refers to argument for faith. You reason out in ur head God exists, for lots of logical reasons and stuff which may come to u as facts, but its not so for many others. This apply to texts from Bibles, miracles, and other important milestone in Christian history.<br><br>On the other hand, scientists and historians do it differently. They do come out with solid evidence for certain things, and the method for discovering new findings are differently, They must arduously research, derive and prove to the whole scieintific or historical community. Better yet, you can debunk the old theories like what Einstein did.<br><br>Of course there are gray areas. Historians and scientists nowadays attempt to link or deprove the myths in certain beliefs or legends by comparing them to historical and scientific evidence. One such question is "where did Jesus spend his early childhood?' and another is by potraying Jesus as an ordinary man, but has great charisma and so on. Hence, the start of Christianity.<br><br>Of course nobody who is in the Christian community can start debunking the existence of God. It purely for individual argument or self reasoning, or even faith. Thats why I always emphasise - faith is yours alone. When someone attempt to put it as the 'universal truth for everyone' and try to stuff in their throats.....<br><br>that..is another topic for discussion althogether..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

The 4th dimension is time. Therfore, Einstein in his thory of relativity, time is dependant on speed of an moving object. For eg, if u  (20 years old) could sit in a shuttle which goes at the speed of light, go to pluto or somewhere far and come back to earth, u might be just 24 years old when u reach earth, but ur galfren ( at first same age as u) might have past away due to old age.<br><br>Lets say...if we live in 2D, the 3rd dimension ( height) is always a constant. To God, he does not live in the dimension we live in. We are bounded by time. It is against logic to ask when is God's b'day because he is not bounded by time. The question initiate with "when" do not apply to Him.  He is the beginning and the end of time.

Another question is does faith requires reasoning ?<br><br><blockquote>so true.... which is why there is really no point to rebut point for point. Faith is not something that someone without it can understand.</blockquote>I have said tis many times before... faith is blind... no one knows wat is correct or not using faith. U can say tat god creates the world, another person can say a pink elephant creates the world. It doesn't require any proving therefore u can claim anything u want !<br><br><blockquote>The world we live in now, to be exact is 4D. The 4th dimension is time. Therfore, Einstein in his thory of relativity, time is dependant on speed of an moving object. For eg, if u (20 years old) could sit in a shuttle which goes at the speed of light, go to pluto or somewhere far and come back to earth, u might be just 24 years old when u reach earth, but ur galfren ( at first same age as u) might have past away due to old age.<br><br>Lets say...if we live in 2D, the 3rd dimension ( height) is always a constant. To God, he does not live in the dimension we live in. We are bounded by time. It is against logic to ask when is God's b'day because he is not bounded by time. The question initiate with "when" do not apply to Him. He is the beginning and the end of time. We can measure date / time because we are bounded by this 4 dimensions.<br></blockquote>But god has given a measurement of time when he create the galaxy. Watever things u want to talk about dimensions bla bla bla is insignificant as it is a fact tat he had given us a unit of measurement in time. It is a day and he define a day explicitly as the passing of a morning and night. He can't be trying to be funny and tell us is a day when it is not a day isn't it ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank Poopie-head. Out of the 8 pages, i think around 7 has became quite nasty.<br><br>So back to the history of civilizations, both SIS and PoopieHead would agree that civilization started when the apes began learning how to write or creating languages. And in between Lucy to the point of these primates began writing, it was a stretch of 3 million of years.<br><br>I also looked at the timeline and chronology of all the primates. We zoom in into the part about Homo sapiens and it did say that these modern man (and almost all its ancestors) lived among the middleast, western europe region. This would most likely to contradict the Historians research of placing the Chinese as an parallel, or even earlier, civilization than the Egpytian and Mesopotamia. Someone must be wrong between the Evolutionist and the Historians.<br><br>PoopieHead, the reason i stated the 1000 years was because historians state that between the Egyptian, Chinese, and Mesopotamia, the difference in the start of their civilization are no larger than 1000 years. You can google this too.<br><br>Regarding the comparision between the Chinese, Egyptian and the Caucasian, I would agree that they are of the same species because the Bible says so too. But if you add the Aboriginal Australians into the equation, most evolution articles do state that they are very close to our primates ancestors rather than human today - most of the time, it does sound like a rasict remark. They never really explain why the Aboriginals didn't so-called "evloved" to the standard to what the rest of the human are in today.<br><br>If we put these two together, there are seems to be a lot of pot-holes because evidence is that the Aboriginals wall paintings were supposedly dated to the same time as the Caveman, StoneAge Man. Logically, they will also evloved in the same manner as the Chinese and Egyptian in parallel time. But why not?<br><br></div>
