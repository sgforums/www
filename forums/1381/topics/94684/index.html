I have read some articles that revealed the fraud behind some scientific data....<br><br>The theory of Melanism of B. betularia,the peppered moth does not hold actually and has been commented by the jornal Nature. The moths were dead and glued to tree and photos taken such that textbooks teaches and show this theory full of error. Other interesting discoveries can be found in the website above.<br><br>This is not some rubbish website aimed to shoot down science but to reason creationist theory as stated in the Bible in the light of science. Science in no way is enemy of God, just that some made it so.<br><br>Now...not jus abt science theories, this website also hopes to answer some questions abt the Bible which u simply dun understand y. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's cut it short. I will give my view y i cant believe in evolution.<br><br>1) Not only human exist in this world. There are alot of animals too. For example, tiger, bear, sharks, whale, plankton, bat, eagle. If evolution do exist..so human is from the predessor of monkey...how about tiger, bear, sharks, whale? they all must have a predessor too? Sharks do exist during dinasour era or long b4 mankind. That's what i recall if i am not wrong.And they exist till today. Any major changes on them?? nope...they still dont have brains to build an empire.That's what i recall if i am not wrong.<br><br>2) Even though one manage to proof that human has the same predessor of monkey..and we evolve from them...does this mean the creation theory is wrong?  NO. Because now the question is ...how this " predessor of monkey" exist? Unless one can proof that all the creature today exist from 1 cell and being mutated until so many different species out.<br><br>3) The law of probability. What is the chances that only human is the superior species. There are so many species in the world but why only human. The probability is just 1 / ( total no. of species). If the total no .of species in this world is just 10000 ( let's say) , 1 / 10000 is already a probability of 0.0001.<br><br></div>

On the other hand there are questions about the mechanism of the observed changes... how did evolution occur? Biologists consider the existence of biological evolution to be a fact.

Even when the differences are noticed, it is HARD to justify the decendants as a completely new species because the differences are small.
