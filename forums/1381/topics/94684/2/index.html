Talk about stubborness to the extreme.<br></span><br><br>quote: "On one hand, Christians will insist on the truth according to the Bible, on the other, the evolutionist will quote scientists who from time to time disagree with each other on the findings."<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br>We are abit off topic here, but anyhow -<br><br>That is why mankind is continually learning and exploring. Scientists, from time to time, finds a better "model" or a new discovery and, after being proven correct, will CHANGE &amp; LEARN. Open-mindedness.. a trait seldom seen in staunch Christians, esp if it might contradict with their beliefs or what is said in the Bible - the "book of all truths". Yet, in all discussions, people need to be open-minded for any "discussion" to be possible at all. If one person insists till no end, and refuse to accept a FACT when the FACT is PROVEN TRUE, then there is no point in discussing for that said person.<br><br>Lets move back on-topic.<br></span><br><br>quote:<br>"Don't get me wrong, I am one of those Christians who accept that there is "EVOLUTION" in so much that this word refers to a change in adaption towards the environment. I cannot, however, accept that man came from apes.

Adaptation IS NOT evolution. For example, I travel from Singapore and arrive in Antartica. My body slowly ADAPTS to the cold weather. Did I just evolved? No.<br><br>Please NOTE: Man did not come from apes, we share the same ancestory.<br><br>Evolution does NOT occur in one generation. It is a gradual change in the GENE over several generations.<br><br>Your refusal to accept the fact of changes of species contradict with what you said below - where u accept the fact that man evolved from prehistoric man. Are Peking Man and Modern man the same species? No. We are the evolved form.<br><br>Are you saying that Evolution suggests that a canine can be evolved from feline parents? Evolution has alot to do with genes. A canine's genes are very different from a feline's, and genes depend alot on inheritance. Drastic changes like this would take even more generations to be complete. Furthermore, both species are each on their individual ways in the path of evolution. I can go on forever, but it is clear that you are very mistaken about what evolution means.<br><br>You were probably trying to say man and apes are different species. My question to you is: Do Chimpanzees, Apes, Baboons share the same ancestory? Yes. But how could that be? They are different species "now". The keyword is "now". What about aeons ago?<br></span><br><br>quote:<br>"Whether I accept the account of Genesis at face value is another matter.

At last, an agreement on the FACT that there is Evolution. Rather, it is the acceptance of a known fact.<br><br>There is hope indeed.<br></span><br><br>quote:<br>"Scientific findings, however, do not prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Big Bang caused the first organism to grow, or did we come because of some extraterrestrial seedings."<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br>Again Off-topic, but for the sake of everyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>We are constantly learning all that is around us, there are too many things for us to learn. Thankfully, recent scientific advances are making big strides. Do you know that many modern inventions are made very very recently, considering the age of mankind? We are still very early in our understanding of the world around us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>All those "doubts" you mentioned are beyond what we know now. However take note that it DOES NOT in any way affect what we already know. There is no point in discussing something which we do not know. Similarly, it is always easier to say "oh it's made that way" without finding out more about it, but does that mean it is the right way and attitude? Having an inquisitive mind helps us strive to understand more, unlike accepting things the way it is without questioning its credibility.<br></span><br><br>quote:<br>"It so happens that Christians, like me, choose to believe that there is a higher being who created us, possibly via a simple organism.

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhist literature clearly bears witness to the fact that the Lord Buddha, with his supernormal vision, purified and perfected this understanding of the virtually limitless extent of the universe as well as the incalculable length of time required in the past, present and future for the cycle of arising and passing away of spheres of phenomenal existence to run their course. According to Lord Buddha, the beginning of the whole of phenomenal existence of which the universe known to science is but the lowest of thirty-one planes, is incalculable; it has no perceptible beginning.<br><br>The material universe consists of an infinity of world systems scattered through boundless space, each coming in to existence and passing away through beginningless and endless time.<br><br>In an attempt to provide his disciples with some idea of the vast amounts of time required for the unfolding of their life-patterns, the Buddha declared that the amount of mothers' milk drunk and tears shed during their previous existences was greater than the waters of the four mighty oceans.<br><br>The grandeur, the broad horizons and the limitless vistas contained in the Buddhist conception when contrasted with the narrowly geocentric conceptions found in Semitic religious literature, especially the Bible, can in the words of one prominent author, "seem like stepping out from a windowless cabin and gazing up into the star-filled midnight sky."<br><br>A world period of virtually incalculable length is referred to as a kalpa or maha-kalpa. This kalpa is divided into four shorter periods, each of which is so long that it cannot be measured even in terms of thousands of years. During the first period of a kalpa, the previously exisisting world system is completely destroyed or resolved into its constituent elements. The majority of beings residing in its various planes of existence are reborn into the Brahma world, the highest and subtlest plane of phenomenal existence, which is exempt from destruction or dissolution. As the second period of the kalpa commences, we find that the residual energy of matter, representing total objectivity, and the Brahma world and its inhabitants, representing complete subjectivity, are isolated from each other at the opposite poles of phenomenal existence. This absence of interaction continues until the third period of the kalpa is well under way. During this period the world system re-evolves from the residual energy of matter, while most of the beings return from the Brahma world to reborn on a dark and water covered earth. This does not seem to inconvenience the mind-generated beings, since they continue to live much as they had formerly in the Brahma world, self-luminous, nourished by rapture and not divided into different sexes.<br><br>With the passage of an immense length of time, conditions begin to change. A scum, with the character of boiled, milky rice, begins to accumulate on the cooling earth, and the terrestial inhabitants begin to taste it and enjoy the sensation. This new sense pleasure leads to craving and an ever increasing dependence on the scum for nourishment. The earthly residents find that their formerly light, ethereal bodies become gross and solid and more differentiated in shape and appearance. Gradually, the waters covering the earth subside; the mists disperse and the sun and moon are clearly revealed in the heavens.<br><br>With the continuation of this period of evolution, first lichenous growths, then creeping plants and finally edible grains appear. As the beings learn to subsist on these food sources, they become even more gross, losing their bright and radiant character. They eventually become differentiated into many species, as well as into male and female genders. This separation into two sexes leads to lust, passion and hatred, and the concomitant development of family grouping, and all the institutions of society. The blood smeared record of the last few thousands of years bear witness to the conditions which are typical of the last phase of the third period of the kalpa.<br><br>continue........<br><br>http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma2/budcosmo.html<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Poopie-Head,<br><br>Why is adaptation not considered evolution?   Darwin came about the notion of evolution because observed the differences between the Galapagos Tortoise and those on the surrounding islands.  They adapted to their environment, developing thicker shells or differently shaped shells.  To Darwin, adaptation to the environment is evolution.</div>

He was Officer-in-Charge of the Davies Laboratory, Townsville, and Regional Research Leader. He is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, and the Tropical Grasslands Society of Australia. He has published about 140 research papers.<br><br>Do u know stephen hawkings...he had a wife. Also a Phd. And divorce wif him because he keep on believe and insist that God does not exist.

This is not a too low probability. If u say double A's, just say that u r playing 5 cards( already very little), what is the probability of getting doubles A's out of these 5 cards? It is [ C(5,2) x C( 47, 3)] / [ C ( 52,5)] = 0.0624. It has a percentage of 6.24%. But probability of 1 supreme being over the others is 1/ 3-5 million ( total no. of species)....and u know what is the value. it is 0.00002%<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The God Idea</strong><br><br>Was there a "beginning" -- "of course there was, the Bible says so!"-- Or is a beginning or "First Cause" even necessary?<br><br>If you consider that at one time you were not, then what has brought you into existence as this being known by the name you care called?<br><br>The usual answer is that a God or impersonal Power created this universe, this planet, and the beings on it.<br><br>Considering the above, a further question can arise: Where has this God or other power come from? If the reply is that He (or in some cases, "She"!) is eternal then why did He decide at some point in time to bring all this into existence? What for? His pleasure? Our tribulation? If the answer can be given in either way, He can hardly be called Compassionate. An answer to all such inquiries which kills further investigation of this subject, is that he ways of God are inscrutable and we should accept this as fact without any need of investigation.<br><br>It is interesting to examine and observe how people relegate the God to the distant past of Creation or to the distant future of Judgement. This means that He has little relevance in and to their daily lives, for if He did, those very people who claim to have unshakable faith in this God would live different lives and leave the rat race, the competitions, the politics of violence, warfare, and social injustice.<br><br>Perhaps "He" is a belief that arises out of a very real need for security, or maybe even a craving for some authority figure like a father -- or for the New Agers who prefer "goddess" -- a mother, or even a craving for eternal life. But when it comes to everyday living, the God idea really takes second place and the evidence lies in the very behavior an actions of people all over the planet.<br><br>Where is God intervening in the unspeakable crimes against humanity that are perpetrated and viewed on TV like a regular daily show? This is a fair question, if you assert, which you probably do if you are a "believer", that we are all made in God's image. Put the actions with the image, together, and that is one nasty God! Put forward "belief", and "doubt" will be found, too.<br><br>From a Buddhadharma perspective, even if "He" does exist, what practical difference does it make to one's life here and now? Is not the distant past and the distant future, strictly irrelevant to us in the present -- in the here-and-now?<br><br>It is always the present, which is important in the Dhamma, not the past, often compared to a dream, and certainly not the future, which we can liken to a mirage seen by one thirsty in the desert.<br><br>What I do NOW, how I react/respond NOW -- these things are infinitely more relevant than speculations over distant events. (And notice there is a difference between "react" vs. "respond".)<br><br>These are said by Buddha to be the "tangle of Wrong Views", "wrong" since no firm conclusions can be reached on the bases on which they are reared. And what are these? Blind faith is one and craving is the other. Ignorance is the root.<br><br>Moreover a hornet's nest is stirred up whenever opposing sets of "beliefs" come into conflict, and so-called "religious" wars and persecutions are a pointer to how strong the attachment can be to Wrong Views. Why be tangled up in them? Why get stung when the venom as well as the stinger is avoidable? Take a look at the atrocities that are ongoing and given such insidious and guileful a term as "ethnic cleansing". Religious differences play a bigger role than political ones in many cases.<br><br>When Buddha was asked about the length of an eon, He answered, "No beginning can be seen to beings, blinded by unknowing and driven by craving who are hurrying through the round of birth-and-death". Thus for the practitioner of the Buddhadharma, i.e., the "Buddhist", "in the beginning" has no meaning, and no point in time can be found when there was a Creation. Nor is there found any Creator (though we create things through cause and effect (kamma) and bring about a seemingly continuous sort of creation.<br><br>The Buddhadhamma-Vinaya practitioner knows well at some point, sooner or later, that unknowing and/or ignorance is the seed of (karma) kamma sprouting into the various stressful and unsatisfactory experiences termed "dukkha". "God" is a concept, a mix of ideas -- as evidenced by so many traditions holding the view of a god or gods under a Supreme Being or Creator God. "Buddhism" does not lump these ideas together calling them "God". If one speaks of "eternity", it is dealt with as it is -- Dharma; if one speaks of judgement and retribution -- Karma; if you want to know about beings -- there are other sentient beings seen and unseen through out the cosmos. And this area is more scientific and better explained than even some so called Buddhists know!<br><br>And since this matter deals with ideas, it is not more puzzling to comprehend an infinity of birth-and-death rounds rooted in unknowing than it is to communicate about a "Creator" who was never born. Indeed, the former has great advantage over the latter since unknowing is in one's very own heart and may be removed by education, investigation, and directly experiencing Reality as it is.<br><br>It is complex sets of conditions that give rise to dependent events, though the co-dependent arisings may not be clear to one's own awareness. Thus, all dhammas (paramattha dhammas) come into and go from existence in this way. One does not have to seek a beginning, nor does a "Maker" or "Creator" need be sought after.<br><br>In the Visuddhi Magga, XIX, translated by Nyanamoli Thera, we have this verse:<br><br>"No god, no Brahma can be called<br>The Maker of this Wheel of Life:<br>Just empty phenomena roll on<br>Dependent on conditions all."<br><br>The cosmology found in the Buddhadhamma not only takes into account the existence of innumerable systems of worlds grouped into what we should call galaxies, but has equally vast conceptions of cosmic time.<br><br>What did Lord Buddha really have to say about God? At times, He did remain silent on this topic. But there is an account given by Him on the genesis of the "Creator" and this should settle the issue. But before going on with that, we should note that Buddha was not an agnostic (one who does not know). In fact, He was a gnostic or 'one who knows' (in Pali: "janata") and was also called "Sabbannu", the 'All-knower". This means that to whatever subject Lord Buddha attended to, He knew all the contents of that subject. It does NOT mean that He always knew everything about every subject all at once, for this very claim was one He emphatically and specifically denied about himself. Now, to settle this question of "God" we can investigate. It happens that in the beginning of a new cycle (after one of the periodic cosmic collapses), a being according to his or her kamma (karma) is reborn into a heavenly realm or state where no other beings are to found. (That one's kamma being a condition for the arising of that particular heavenly experience.) That one does not remember her or his past life among other "gods" in the "higher" heavenly realms, and comes to believe during the passing of ages that s/he has lived there forever. With the passing of immense time spans, that one wishes for the company of others and then, since according to their kamma some other beings appear in that realm, s/he comes to believe that they were produced by her or his will. From this s/he goes on to glorify herself or himself, her or his supposed "creation" and this aids that being's vanity since such a being does not remember the past life it was subjected to and so imagines that it is a creature of Brahma. One of these great Brahmas called by the name of Baka, was made to see the emptiness and futility of his claims to eternal existence and creatorhood when Lord Buddha while in meditation paid a visit to that realm.<br><br>And not only that, the "Buddhist" attitude to Brahma or God or "the Creator" is fairly if somewhat seemingly acridly summed up in these translated verses:<br><br>"He who has eyes can see the sickening sight;<br>Why does not Brahma set his creatures right?<br>If his wide power no limit can restrain,<br>Why is his hand so rarely spread to bless?<br>Why are all his creatures condemned to pain?<br>Why does he not to all give happiness?<br>Why do fraud, lies, and ignorance prevail?<br>Why triumphs falsehood -- truth and justice fail?<br>I count your Brahma one the unjust among<br>Who made a world in which to shelter wrong."<br>-- Bhuridatta Jataka, No. 453<br><br>Consider this: the greater the power of a so-called God then the less will be the ability of the human being to do skill or do the unskillful (as found in pre-destinarian doctrines). Thus the provocation for the following:<br><br>"If there exists some lord all-powerful to fulfill<br>In every creature bliss or woe, and action good or ill,<br>That Lord is stained with sin. The human being does but work his will."<br>-- Mahabodhi Jataka, No. 528<br><br></div>

'<br></span><br><span style="color: red;"><br>"In the broadest sense, evolution is merely change, and so is all-pervasive; galaxies, languages, and political systems all evolve. Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions."<br>- Douglas J. Futuyma in Evolutionary Biology, Sinauer Associates 1986<br><br>"It is important to note that biological evolution refers to populations and not to individuals and that the changes must be passed on to the next generation. In practice this means that,<br><br>Evolution is a process that results in heritable changes in a population spread over many generations."<br><br>"Populations evolve. [evolution: a change in the gene pool] In order to understand evolution, it is necessary to view populations as a collection of individuals, each harboring a different set of traits. A single organism is never typical of an entire population unless there is no variation within that population. Individual organisms do not evolve, they retain the same genes throughout their life. When a population is evolving, the ratio of different genetic types is changing -- each individual organism within a population does not change.

However, synthesists claim that the same processes that cause within-species changes of the frequencies of alleles can be extrapolated to between species changes, so this argument fails unless some mechanism for preventing microevolution causing macroevolution is discovered. Since every step of the process has been demonstrated in genetics and the rest of biology, the argument against macroevolution fails. "<br><br>"Conclusion<br><br>There is no difference between micro- and macroevolution except that genes between species usually diverge, while genes within species usually combine. The same processes that cause within-species evolution are responsible for above-species evolution, except that the processes that cause speciation include things that cannot happen to lesser groups, such as the evolution of different sexual apparatus (because, by definition, once organisms cannot interbreed, they are different species).<br><br>The idea that the origin of higher taxa, such as genera (canines versus felines, for example), requires something special is based on the misunderstanding of the way in which new phyla (lineages) arise. The two species that are the origin of canines and felines probably differed very little from their common ancestral species and each other. But once they were reproductively isolated from each other, they evolved more and more differences that they shared but the other lineages didn't. This is true of all lineages back to the first eukaryotic (nuclear) cell. Even the changes in the Cambrian explosion are of this kind, although some (eg, Gould 1989) think that the genomes (gene structures) of these early animals were not as tightly regulated as modern animals, and therefore had more freedom to change.

Quite the opposite : natural selection, the principal known mechanism of evolution, harnesses nonrandom change by preserving "desirable" (adaptive) features and eliminating "undesirable" (nonadaptive) ones.

Others knew the theory, but were not familiar with all the evidence for it. Evolution is outside the field of most of those scientists.<br><br>A couple hundred years ago, before the theory of evolution was developed and evidence for it presented, virtually all scientists were creationists, including scientists in relevant fields such as biology and geology. <strong>Today, virtually all relevant scientists accept evolution. </strong>Such a turnabout could only be caused by overwhelming evidence. The alternative -- that almost all scientists today are thoroughly incompetent -- is preposterous.<br><br>Even if they did not believe in evolution, all these scientists were firmly committed to the scientific method, including methodological naturalism. They actually serve as counterexamples to the common creationist claim that a naturalistic practice of science is atheistic.<br><br>Evolution is entirely consistent with a belief in God, including even special creation. "Special creation" need not refer to the creation of every animal; it can refer simply to creation of the universe, of the first life, and/or of the human soul, for example. Many of the scientists above were not creationists in the sense Henry Morris uses the term.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------<br><br>Claim CH350:<br>The created kinds are distinct; evolution between them is impossible. "Creation of distinct kinds precludes transmutation between kinds."<br><br>Response:<br><strong>Creationists have been unable to specify what the created kinds are. If kinds were distinct, it should be easy to distinguish between them. Instead, we find a nested hierarchy of similarities, with kinds within kinds within kinds. </strong>For example, the 12-spotted ladybug could be placed in the 12-spotted ladybug kind, the ladybug kind, the beetle kind, the insect kind, or any of dozens of other kinds of kind, depending on how inclusive the kind is. No matter where one sets the cutoff for how inclusive a kind is, there will be many groups just bordering on that cutoff. <strong>This pattern exactly matches the pattern expected of evolution. It doesn't match what creationism predicts. </strong><br><br>Fixity of kinds is based on the philosophy of Plato, not the Bible [Dewey 1910]. Nowhere does the Bible say that kinds themselves can't change and diversify. Reproduction "according to their kind" is entirely consistent with evolution, as long as it is recognized that kinds are not fixed.<br><br>Although major changes from one "kind" to another don't normally happen, except gradually over hundreds of thousands of generations, a sudden origin of a new kind has been observed. A strain of cancerous human cells (called HeLa cells) have evolved to become a wild unicellular life form. [Van Valen and Maiorana 1991]<br><br>According to Morris, fungi weren't part of the original creation. They weren't among the categories listed in Genesis 1, and as decayers they wouldn't have their form until after the Fall. Thus, Morris' own theology requires new kinds to originate after the creation<br><br>----------------------------------------------------<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><br>Claim CB801:<br>Complaints about creationists not defining "kind" are unfair since evolutionists can't define "species" consistently.<br>Response:<br><strong>Species are expected often to have fuzzy and imprecise boundaries because evolution is ongoing. Some species are in the process of forming; others are recently formed and still difficult to interpret. </strong>The complexities of biology add further complications. Many pairs of species remain distinct despite a small amount of hybridization between them. Some groups are asexual or frequently produce asexual strains, so it becomes problematical how many species to split them into.<br><br><strong>Creation, defining things as kinds that were created once and for all, implies that all species should be clearly demarcated, and that there should be a clear and universal definition of "kind"/species. Since there is not, creationism, not evolutionary theory, has something to explain. </strong><br><br>Different definitions of species serve different purposes. Species concepts are used both as taxonomic units, for identification and classification, and as theoretical concepts, for modeling and explaining. There is a great deal of overlap between the two purposes, but a definition that serves one is not necessarily the best for the other. Furthermore, there are practical considerations that call for different species criteria as well. Species definitions applied to fossils, for example, cannot be based on genetics or behavior because those traits don't fossilize.<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Claim CB901:<br><strong>No case of macroevolution has ever been documented. </strong><br><br>Response:<br>We would not expect to observe large changes directly. Evolution consists mainly of the accumulation of small changes over large periods of time. <strong>If we saw something like a fish turning into a frog in just a couple generations, we would have good evidence against evolution. </strong><br><br>The evidence for evolution does not depend, even a little, on observing macroevolution directly. There is a very great deal of other evidence [Theobald 2004]. (See also evolution proof.)<br><br>As biologists use the term, macroevolution means evolution at or above the species level. Speciation has been observed and documented.<br><br><strong>Microevolution has been observed and is taken for granted even by creationists. And because there is no known barrier to large change and because we can expect small changes to accumulate into large changes, microevolution implies macroevolution.<br><br>Small changes to developmental genes or their regulation can cause relatively large changes in the adult organism. [Shapiro et al. 2004]. </strong><br><br>There are many transitional forms which show that macroevolution has occurred.<br><br></span><br><span style="color: blue;"> Too many questions answered well.<br><br>Take a look at this website for your doubts:<br>http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html<br><br><strong>Basically points worth taking note: </strong><br>- New species have been observed. This is a FACT. If Creationism were correct, the "new" species would have "already" existed.<br>- If Creationism were correct, species should be distinct, yet we have intermidary species (which actually favors the Evolution theory)<br>- No new phylum, order, or class* have been observed. If they have been, it would be Creationism, since Evolution works almost exclusively by gradual changes.<br>-Evolutionists agree that complex structures did not arise by chance. The theory of evolution does not say they did, and to say otherwise is to display a profound absence of understanding of evolution. The novel aspect which Darwin proposed is natural selection. Selection is the very opposite of chance.<br><br>*the higher divisions of organisms<br><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been reading quite alot recently regarding the ideas behind creationism and evolution.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Sorry, this post might be considered off-topic <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> but they are somehow slightly related to the debate. I think it is good to read for more information.</strong></span><br><br>I try to find what doubts the Creationists have on Evolution, and interestingly enough, almost all (except one that I am still searching for) are answered in the Talk Origins site.<br><br>Talk origins site is very nicely laid out and they do provide feedback for any queries.<br>http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Some interesting points to ponder:</strong></span><br>- Creationists are Christians.<br>- Creationism require a belief in a Creator. Science is <strong>NOT</strong> a matter of belief.<br>- <strong>Creationist is not Science at all. They require no evidence, there's no way to test it, yet they have all the answers. </strong><br>- The ideas behind Creationism and Intelligent Designs (esp the former) are always linked to a superior being.<br>- They provide no precise answers, everything unknown is due to the work of a superior being or the supernatural.<br>- Their claims against evolutionists are not precise most of the time. Very generalized. <strong>Many times Creationists are grossly mis-informed or they have mis-use of information in their claims.</strong><br>- No Creation article has been published in scientific papers<br>- An extremely low percentage of the relevent scientists believe in Creationism. (&lt; 0.15% in U.S. alone, other countries lower figures)<br>- Most of the scientists who reject evolution is because of religious reasons, not evidence. Evidence supports evolution.<br>- <strong>creationists rarely expose their own errors, and they sometimes fail to correct them when others expose them. </strong><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/cre-error.html" rel="nofollow">Read More</a> and <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-creationists.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a><br><br>Previously, I didnt think Creationism is so much related to Christianity, so I am not disagreeing with it based on the reason that Christianity is involved, rather I find the idea unconvincing.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Why was the debate between Creation vs Evolution started?</strong></span><br>I found out that the reason why Creationism vs Evolution was getting so much attention. The Creationists are trying to get Creation Science to be taught in schools - as a part of the Science subject. Their arguement is that students must be informed if a certain theory (evolution) is controversial. However, the real reason behind this is to teach about Christianity under the cover of Science. Evolution is also a theory that <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> contradict the Christian belief, since Evolution suggests no supernatural forces at work. Thus, Evolution, along with other Sciences, would imply that the world today is not created "as is", therefore, not the work of God.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Clearing some common mis-understandings about evolution:</strong></span><br>Evolution theory does not mean it is NOT a FACT. In everyday speech. "theory" often means a hypothesis or even a mere speculation. But in science, "theory" means "a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed."<br><br>Evolution is both a FACT and Theory. The theory part comes in as the <span style="font-style: italic;">mechanisms</span> of how and what happens during evolution - this is the part that scientists are less certain of.<br><br>Evolution does NOT deal with how life started from non-life. That is Abiogenesis. "The first instance of life would not be anything that you or most people would recognize as "life"... a chain molecule that made a copy of itself from surrounding free-floating molecules. In one second, it had not yet copied itself, and in the next second, it did."<br><br>As far as Evolution is concerned, it does not matter if God, Zeus, space aliens, dust from space, or from comet initiated life on Earth. It does not render the Theory of Evolution untrue, because all existing evidence supports it.<br><br>Evolution and Abiogenesis are not random. They are probably a result of natural selection. "Selection" clearly means non-random.<br><br>Mankind did not evolve from apes or any of the other existing primates. We share the same ancestory. We did not evolve from any group of modern apes-- therefore apes are unaffected by human evolution. All of human evolution occured after the split.<br><br>Evolution is science most pure, devoid of any religious concepts whatsoever. It is non-theistic, but it is not necessarily atheistic.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Some topics of debate which got involved:</strong></span><br>Abiogenesis is the science of life developing from non-life, and it is a different field from Biological Evolution. Biological Evolution kicks in after life is formed. Of course, they are still trying to create life from non-life.<br><br>Noah's Arc - Even if only a pair of each animal, it could not have enough room for all (inc. food supplies). Young Earth Creationists believed dinosaurs lived alongside man, so they should be included, meaning even more overflow. If Creationism rejects evolution, how could new species have come about (since only one of each type is brought onboard)? Other problems such as plants, fresh water fishes, insects, etc could not have survived during the flood. Some animals require specific conditions (such as low temperature) to even survive. Population growth (esp human) after the flood to present day also proved impossible. There are too many people now (or even during certain times in history) to have been descended only from Noah's family.<br><br>Young Earth Creationists are people who believed the 6 days of creation are literally 6 earth-days; and that the universe including the Earth is young (10,000 years old). This suggests that there isnt enough time for evolution. Scientists believed Earth is 4.6 billion years old (by radiometric dating). Also, if the universe is just as young, it cannot explain the time taken for starlight to reach us. Distant objects are so far that light couldnt have reached us thus suggesting an old universe.<br><br>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature is a problem for the big bang (Light-travel time problem). Temperature is consistant everywhere and in all directions. However, there isnt enough time for distant objects from one part of the universe to communicate with another; yet, the different regions of the current CMB have precisely uniform temperatures. The most popular explanation is called Â‘inflation', but i need to find more on this problem.<br><br><a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v25/i4/lighttravel.asp" rel="nofollow">Read More</a><br><br>Radiometric dating gives unreliable results.
