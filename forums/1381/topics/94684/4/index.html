            <div class='col-md body'>The difference between Evolution and Creation boils down to 2 things:<br><br>- Evolution do not require a Superior Being. However, they do not conclude that there isnt one! It is purely scientific - all the evidence points towards this explaination.<br><br>- Creation require the <strong>belief</strong> of a Superior Being. They do not have ANY EVIDENCE watsoever, the only thing required is "belief". This, of course, is NOT science.<br><br><strong>In other words: Evidence vs Belief, Science vs Religion</strong><br><br>In fact, many Evolutionists are Christians. As mentioned before, Evolution is a SCIENCE subject, non-theist but not necessarily atheist. To think that if a person supports the idea of Evolution means he is anti-Christianity is wrong.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Why is there such a big fuss over this debate? </strong></span><br><br>Come think of it, Creationism is NOT science, I hope you can agree on this already. The problem is, they want it to be taught in schools as a Science subject! This is absurd. You can belief in God, but that doesn't mean everybody must agree with you. If this is taught in school as a Science subject, everyone is forced to handle this idea of a Creator, which is totally unfair.<br><br><strong>In this sense, I too stand on the side of Evolutionists. Creationism MUST NEVER be taught in school as a science subject. That is, until they can come up with some valid evidence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span class="large">Regarding your fossil dating method.</span></strong><br>Creationists like to make use of certain topics that the general public has totally no knowledge of. How often have they made speeches in Christian related gatherings, or the general public? Why do they do that? Because they know the general public knows too little to counter their arguements.<br><br>How often do they even DARE to make speeches in the scientific community? I'm sure they will be horribly humiliated. Cause the experts know their stuff <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Do you know any thing about dating methods? I can tell you the answer is a definite NO! I am 100% sure that you know next to nothing about it.<br><br>That is why you can easily be persuaded to believe in what he says, since he seems to know what he is talking about.<br><span style="color: red;"><br>"Some fossils are seen to occur only in certain strata. Such fossils can be used as <strong>index fossils. </strong>When you have those fossils, you can use them to determine the age of the strata, because the fossils show that the strata correspond to strata that have already been dated by other means. "<br></span><br>There are more than one way to do dating, and scientists use multiple methods to cross check. Radiometric methods are one, and corals produce skeletons with both daily layers and yearly patterns, so we can count the number of days per year when the coral grew.<br><br>So you see there are easily three methods already. Are you convinced yet?<br><br>Why would the Creationist speaker still speak of such topics? My guess:<br>- they are totally ignorant on the subject<br>- they know about it but since the general public dont know, they can be made to agree to a lie.<br><br>This is a perfect example of a Creationist's underhand strategy.

I agree with u that organism retain what is good and rejects what is bad for improvement to itself.  Then let me ask u a question. Do u think that always remain being stupid is something good? So u see, if chicken would realize about this situation, they wont be slaughter for man to eat them. Or birds get shoot down. The fact is, they couldnt do anything about it is due to their limited intellectual capability. Goats , cow have been always a source of food for mankind since prehistoric age. But until today..they have not even improve slightly in thier intelectual. So..nothing drastic had happen in any evolution. Hence..i could say no macroevolution actually happen.<br><br>I know it is difficult for u to accept or even TRY to understand that creation exist. And dont always say there are no scietific evidence or WE CREATIONIST have nothing to proof. To proof ur statement wrong is already a proof by using science. Science and maths are also extremely related.<br><br>I see that there is no point exchanging ur views here. If this goes on to even 14 pages...it wouldnt change a single thing. Even if there are a few more similar threads...i could also see no difference. It will not end. Simple..because u will not even accept my fact though it sounds logical, because ur mind and soul ( oops u dun believe in one) will not tolerate any facts that go against your stand on evolution.<br><br>No point quoting other scientists or proffesors who are on the same boat as u too, because the most important person, it is u urself. Even if majority of these intelectuall ppl are believers in God, u will still stick with the minority % of the other who oppose the existense of God.<br><br>so just be a happy man. For those who are non - believers..u have so much more freedom on earth; guiltiness is bliss. For the believers, our main focus is our life after death.  U can call us stupid, no knowledge, no common sense or whatever, i would just smile to u and carry my own way.

You'll be minced meat in no time. Of course, this test is not fair to you, because I only test for who is the physically stronger.<br><br>Another example. I put you in a room with nothing except a rotten dead corpse. Do you think you can survive long? Even bacteria outlasts you, because they feed on rotten carcasses.<br><br>You dont need too much brains when you're in the wild. You dont need much brains when you need to decompose rotten meat.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>SIS will rebuke "oh, you think God creating living thing is more probable?"</blockquote>I am trying to bring the irony for the reason to believe in intelligent designer. Wat is their reason to reject evolution ? They claim tat it is unlikely tat life is created without guidance. However they believe tat the life of the intelligent designer, which is harder to be created can pop out without guidance ! DO u know wat is the irony ? A do not believes B to get a pair of Aces in his next hand, but instead he can get a full flush.<br><br><blockquote>when we talk about science, especially using the rock to date the fossil and vice versa, that's really a big joke.</blockquote>Big joke ? I thought the answer is very simple. They use multiple methods to verify the answer. Wat is so funny with tat ? If u have a complex account to handle, the accountant is required to do it twice to check if there r any errors isn't it ? So u wanna laugh at her saying tat she is using her first results to check her second one and her second results to check her first one ? They have a method to date the rocks. They have another method to date the fossils. They use both dates to check the result. It is the same as the accounting example isn't it ? It is just the wordings used are misleading.<br><br>Frankly... do u really think they r so dumb tat they depend totally on another for results ? Shouldn't tat would have given us no data at all ?<br><br><blockquote>Didnt I show u some experts name? First u say there are no creationist biologist. The way u phrase ur sentence is like there are no creationist in this world who holds a biologist position, historion, a phd or scientist.<br><br>Dun mislead. There are alot of experts..and yes with sufficient knowledge...(at least higher than all of us here) who are creationist. </blockquote>I don't know man.. I thought they r teaching evolution in classes in almost all areas nowsaday ? Why don't the education system notice these people u have quoted ? There r a lot of experts who are evolutionists. And they r higher than all of us here... even thought u don't even know who all of us here r<br><br><blockquote>How about if they teach Young Earth? You can rewrite the textbook arguing for a young earth and yet not mention a creator. </blockquote>Wat does the evidence shows ? There r overwhelming evidences tat show the earth is not young. I have given tis example before but I will do it again nevertheless...<br><br><strong>In spite of MorrisÂ’ heroic effort to reinterpret the Petrified Forest of Yellowstone Park, the evidence is clear that a nearby volcano buried 27 forests on top of each other. Some of the trees have up to 400 rings. It took about 20,000 years for this to form</strong><br><br>U believe in tree rings to verfiy age ? If u don't, why not ? No one has disprove of carbon dating ability to detect ages at least 50,000 years ago. There r objects tat were found having an age older than tis using carbon dating. Using speed of light, they found lights from outer space to have travelled more than 100,000 light years to reach us in earth. Do u believe in speed of light ? They can't teach Young Earth. Why ? It is because it is wrong ! WHy do people still believe in Young Earth theory despite these overwhelming evidences ? It still boils down to the bible isn't it ? If the world is not as old as the bible claims, then the bible is wrong ! Tis is a big scripture  error.<br><br><blockquote>I disagree. A proper Creation speech (call it a seminar) is not pure rhetoric, or should I say a sermon, where you hold a bible and say "the bible says so". A Creationist worth his salt will use scientific journals and arguments to prove his point.<br><br>You want to counter their argument? Simple, read up more to challenge him lor. In a way, he is challenging you to read up on the evidence. </blockquote>Really ? However he can choose which scientific journal to refer to and ignore the counter agrument to it isn't it ? Why don't u tell me some of the evidences tat he had pointed out ?<br><br><blockquote>Again I disagree. If Darwin was alive 10 years ago, he will be horribly humiliated by Stephen Jay Gould. Heh.</blockquote>Really ? How come most people knows Darwin and little people know Stephen Jay Gould ? How come people mention about Darwin evolution in textbook and scientific journal while Stephen remains relatively unknown compared with Darwin ?<br><br><blockquote>Actually there're many scientists who disagree with the "mainstream" and they're not creationist. Where do you put them? </blockquote>Wat stand r they taking then ? They don't believe in evolution, they don't believe in creation, then wat do they believe in ? I really can't see any third way about tis. So u believe the mainstream scentist is tis field believes in evolution ?<br><br><blockquote>Evidence points in both direction, this is what many people fail to understand</blockquote>I must have been careless in my readings... Where r the physical evidences tat point the other way ?<br><br><blockquote>Are you that naive as to not know how the world works? It is like asking, why are opposition wards given less priority or money to upgrade their flats? Why? Mr Low or Mr Chiam buay gan? </blockquote>??? Darwin used to go against maninstream belief tat life is created isn't it ? How come he is still famous today ? In those days he nearly get killed but his theories maintain as sceintific facts. U really shouldn't link politics with science...<br><br><blockquote>I'm sure you read stories of how academics who taught or even hinted of creationism are threatened with the ending of their tenure. In a way, publicly admitting you're a Creationist may spell the end of your career. Who wants to risk their job? </blockquote>huh !?!? U know why ? Because it should be common sense tat evolution is true ! Will u employ a JW as a gun specialist ? Will u employ a physics teacher who claims he do not believe in Newton laws yet can't prove why he does not believe in it ?<br><br><blockquote>Do you know science cannot prove or know everything</blockquote>??!? So wat do u think is a better way ? We put all the unknown in a black box call religion and sealed it up, never to explore and discover again ? Wat better system do u suggest to "prove" or "know" everything ?
