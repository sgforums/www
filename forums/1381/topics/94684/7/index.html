I have a little more pride in what I write. </blockquote>Tat is your writing style. For me, I take pride in answering long threads in a short amount of time.<br><blockquote><br>Any comment on your spelling and grammar has go to with your psychological profile. One of an unstable mind. The science of profiling include the analysis of the writing style of the individual. </blockquote>Tat is again another personal attack. I believe in the whole forums, there r a lot of people who do not spell correctly either. Does stephanism write impressive english ? If tat is the case then probably everyone is unstable. It probably meant tat I took little time to answer simple questions from people. BTW, I thought the science of profiling is on handwriting, not typewritten style ?<br><br><blockquote>WhatÂ’s a flase claim? I cannot respond because I cannot understand. </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> never mind, keep laughing at speling mistakes... No matter wat u say about it is not gonna change anything<br><br><blockquote>Please bear in mind that I had tried very hard in the past to answer your questions, but each time, it still ended with you declaring that you are right. Point is, you are never satisfied even when you are proven wrong. Example? How about the historical context of Biblical text which you categorically deny or how about definition of certain English words used in the past which holds different meaning from now? You have rejected both of these. </blockquote>Really ? I know u try very hard, but have I ever declared tat I am right without showing u the reasons ? On the issue of definition of certain english words, I thought I have already "agree" to "disagree" on it ? My end note is since I cannot prove "know" as plain "know" while u cannot prove tat "know" = "having sex", then we rest the case as such. I never talk about tat anymore isn't it ? Wat else do u expect ?<br><br><blockquote>I may accepted some of the things youÂ’d said at one point, but your continual pursuance of the cause to discredit Christianity has confirmed my point that you still hate Christians</blockquote>I thought I have given u the reasons of why I continue writing ? If tat is the case, then I can conclude tat the reason why u r discrediting me now is because of your personal grudge against me. So we shouldn't take wat u say seriously ?<br><br><blockquote>And you think that I have left these brothers alone? IÂ’d written to some of them to ask them not to write such notes. I donÂ’t do it for all to see. Anything that had happened before me joining the forum has nothing to do with me, as well as anything I am not aware of. And please, if you see any other Christians going to another forum with negative opinions let me know. </blockquote>I never see u go around asking them to stop like wat u r trying to do to me now. Tat shows u r biased yourself isn't it ? U discourage me from writing in an extreme actions while u make half hearted attempts to stop your "christian brothers" from antagonising other religions.<br><br><blockquote>You are the only person in Eternal Hope with so much hatred. I have never told anyone else off for voicing their opinions. Mature people know when to back off. I will not challenge anything you say in Chit Chat. Other non-Christians come into Eternal Hope write a couple of paragraphs and leave. No sweat. Agree to disagree. You? As IÂ’d said, Christianity holds the secret to your purpose of living. We are the drug that allow you to survive each day. </blockquote>Likewise, u r the only person in Eternal hope tat have so much hatred for me personally. It can be shown tat u never really told anyone off even when they make vulgarities or profanities at your religion without reasons. Truth is tat, u do make passing remarks about me in Chit Chat. Can u tell me u do not ? Christainity holds the purpose of my living ? Another groundless conclusion u made because of your poor observation and tendency to make groundshaking conclusion without substantial reasons. If tat is the case, then I am probably your purpose of living too, since u tend to discredit me so often as well. I am the drug tat allow u to survive each day.<br><br><blockquote>I said you are NOT HERE TO LEARN, I did not say I am here to teach. Learning is not about agreeing, it is about accepting another opinion as much as it disagrees with yours. I learn culture when I travel, even culture that disagrees with me. I learn that in some parts of China, bugs are eaten, I would not agree to eat it, I can only accept that it happens. That is real learning.<br>Whatever implication that exist is in your own sick mind is entire your own. </blockquote>Tat is RIGHT ! Why is my role here have to be strictly learning ? Surely tat make your role here as teaching isn't it ?<br><br>Your idea of learning again boils down to wat u view religion as. U view religion as just a way of living and not the truth ? Surely u can't believe in conflicting theories of gravity and accept both of them ? If there r conflicting theories, then it is right for people to discuss till they come to an answer isn't it ? Otherwise u never know which one is correct !<br><br><blockquote>So no issue here. You think we have dumb points, but whoÂ’s dumb to come each day to listen to dumb people taking about dumb things. Dumb? You take it to a new low. </blockquote>wat do u mean by "taking about dumb things" ? I don't understand ! I thought u take pride in spelling and correcting grammer ? Look like u don't really practise wat u preach ! Worse still comment about other people when u yourself made the same mistake !<br><br><blockquote>What is malicious? It is up to you! If you think I have, so be it. So you can come in here and call us dumb or stupid and that's OK? Some other people make remakes on you and you feel insulted???? </blockquote>So u agree with it ? I have stated people r dumb and stupid when they had resort to attacks on me personally first. So when they make such remarks on me, it is okie and when I retaliate, it is not ? Forget it, we all r on the same level.<br><br><blockquote>Why bother? Christians believe that they are living better already. I donÂ’t get it. Your conviction to Â“make people realize the folly of their waysÂ” is OK? But Christians doing the same thing is NOT OK? Duh!! </blockquote>I don't get u as well, when christian preach their religion to other is okie while I tell people their is wrong is not ? I thought christians always challenge people to these biblical studies when they r preaching their faith to others ? Now someone has taken up the challenge they accuse him of doing exactly wat they intend ? Wat a hypocrite...<br><br><blockquote>You donÂ’t get it. I am one of those who believe that there is such a thing as evolution. I also believe that God started the evolution process. As I'd mentioned somewhere earlier in this thread, it all depends on how one defines evolution. </blockquote>If it doesn't apply to u, then I am not talking to u ! I am answering to sillyme ! R u sillyme ? Maybe u 2 r the same guys offline  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I say tat according to the bible, men is from the ground and NOT from evolution. He create men DIRECTLY from non living things. He already explicitly mention HOW and WHEN. And they goes against the theories of evolution ! Why can't u get wat I am trying to say ?</div></blockquote>The bible did say man created from dust, but it didn't say "NOT from evolution". The only "HOW" it mention is the material used, not the process. The "WHEN" it mention is just the starting, not the entire lenght of the process as well.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Because most things it had said is not correct or tested. Science is certainly holds more truth because we can use these principles to make things, such as a computer or a rockets. If it is not true, it wouldn't have worked. The bible doesn't hold any truth in it ! It is not about being a science journal, it is about it being a history book tat recorded all things tat have never happened ! </div></blockquote>None of the things mention in Bible is being proven incorrect. Yes, there are people like you who trying to prove that something wrong in Bible, but over thousands of years, nobody could. Isn't that hard proof enough? Do you reliaze that up to now, you still haven't anything wrong in Bible? But you just keep on saying that it is wrong and those history mention in it never happended.</div>
