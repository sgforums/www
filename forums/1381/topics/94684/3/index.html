An unguided process is still nevertheless POSSIBLE. But then who is the guider ? Who to guide the process to make the guider ? Wat is more believable, chances of forming a stone which had a weight of 10 +- 0.001 gram or a stone which has the weight of 10+-0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 gram.<br><br>It is like telling me u do not believe tat nature can form such a precise stone (former) because the probability is low yet believe tat the more precise stone (latter) which has a much lower probability can be formed.

ID opens more doubts such as who designs the designer, etc just like SIS said. It's very similar to Creationism in that there is no science to it - there are no evidence, no way to test it and no contribution to the scientific community.

Dogs r believed to be from wolves, cat believed from jungle cats, pigs boar etc. Now they have became the domesticated animals we see today. Can they survive when we place them in jungle ? No !<br><br>Secondly, evolution doesn't mean tat they have to be smarter. It can mean being able to fly longer, faster or being able to reproduce faster or get sick less easily. All these r potential areas where the animals become fitter. In the case of domestic animals, u can see them producing eggs more regularly, fatter and less ferocious. As said be poopie head before, the probability tat animals will evolved into becoming smarter is very low. And even if tis is so, we r not going to see the effects for millions of years.<br><br>Lastly, is natural selection in the case of domesticated animals ? No ! Tis is because they r not undergoing "natural selection" anymore. Who is to have offsprings who is to reproduce r controlled by human. Naturally, they choose the animals tat give eggs more regularly, or r born to be fatter so they can have a better yield. Sorry man, evolution to these animals had become more or benefits to man rather than to themselves.<br><br><blockquote>I know it is difficult for u to accept or even TRY to understand that creation exist.
