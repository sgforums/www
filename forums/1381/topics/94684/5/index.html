An all-knowing being is just an idea.<br><br><blockquote>I do not suggest that all things to be swept under the carpet. But one must acknowledge the limitations of science.

The basic of Science is a call for evidence. Tat is why science has a much higher accuracy compared with other system of beliefs. Tis is because everyone can claim anything they want. Face it, some men lies, some r ignorant while some r mistaken. We cannot believe them just because of their words. I can claim to have seen a flying pig but if I can't show it, then I am lying or ignorant or made a mistake in observation.<br><br>If u want to prove a creator, then u show evidence of the existence of a creator. But can u show it ? U can't ! It is not about science being not omnipotent and tat is why it cannot prove existence of god, but because there is <strong>no basis</strong> for believing in a creator ! All u guys tell me about the so call evidences r personal experiences. There is no real concrete evidence tat point to the fact of the existence of a creator. It is not about the problem of science, it is about the problem of logic. If u cannot prove your point, it is untrue. If I don't have to prove, then I can say tat I have indisputable facts tat god doesn't exists. I don't have to prove it so u have to believe in it fully ? Tat bring me to another point, why do u believe in the existence of a creator despite no evidence ? Faith is sadly, a system where lies can exists and people believe it to be the truth.<br><br>U claim the evidence is around me, but they r shown to have been created in a very natural manner, without the aid of any supernatural forces. Just because I see a tree, forest, lakes and mountains in front of me, doesn't mean tat there is a creator isn't it ??? They r probably there because of nature led events, not supernatural intervention! These 2 r very different things.<br><br>icemoon claims the evidence is out there... where ?? Surely people r allowed to study and comment on the so call evidence isn't it ? Otherwise I just show people my handphone and say tat it is an evidence tat god doesn't exists. U can't do anything because u can't comment and rebuke any evidences ! Evidences have to stand the heat of being scutinised by experts of related field. There have been many evidences tat was stated tat show evolution is true isn't it ? They had stand the heat of being scrutinised by all people. Why can't creationsist have such evidences ?</div>

Unless u can prove your belief out, it is <strong>nothing</strong>. Crazy people and children have a lot of beliefs/faith/dreams too. We will pay notice only if they prove it out or fulfil them. I can have a dream/faith/belief saying tat I am going to be richer than bill gates. In fact there r many people who had tis belief too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Quote from Sis :Sorry man... a belief remains as a belief without cold hard facts. Unless u can prove your belief out, it is nothing<br><br>U had also mentioned that evidence is extremely important. u must prove what u believe right??<br><br>Let me tell u a true story. Scientist all around the world at that time believe in the existence of aether. I say it again...scientist BELIEVE in the existence of aether. They claim that they had perform sufficient mathematical calculation that aether exist. So, at that time, all physics books mention about the existence of aether. It was taught in the university also.<br><br>Now, did they prove thier believe before publishing out in journals and books. They even taught it at the university level. So, dont think that scientist ALWAYS believe in something with evidence. In this case, i solemnly tell u SIS, that ur statement " a belief remains as a belief without cold hard facts " is not 100% TRUE.<br><br>Michaelson- Molley experiment had fail alot alot of times. He did not give up. His reasons is  that aether exist, and he believe that his experiment was not sensitive enough to detect the aether. He never question that " hmm, aether might not even exist". He blame himself and he continue on for the rest of his life on his experiment. So..u see, scientist even from cambridge university BELIEVE STRONGLY ..VERY STRONG INFACT over something that they FEEL it is true.<br><br>It is until the day Einstein came and he claims that aether doesnt exist. Einstien is famous because he DARE to go against all the other scientist believes. Even though after mentioning it, he got bombarded by alot of other scientist in the world. Is like all vs 1. They did not accept his statement until years had passed. Some of his claims were even not accepted until he died. So sad for him. So..this is how STRONG a believe is...be it science or religion.<br><br>Therefore SIS, do not quote each and every sentence of a person as if all thier statement from the first line and to end have no sense and urs have the most. Ignorance is bliss. As someone had mention in his thread to u, i believe is quite true. that is if u r so right in every single statment, can correct every single word from another being, well u do not need to be here. U will be called to join the States for research. But since u are not, then ..all i could say is dun act like one.<br><br>never say that u cannot disagree, but to disagree WITH the  attempt to prove that the persons statement is wrong from the start till the end, i believe that it shows ur personal grudge that everything,..EVERYTHING that this fellow mention is wrong and I AM right. So darn right. PERFECT, FLAWLESS. However so sad to acknowledge the fact that no one on earth is perfect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Let me tell u a true story. Scientist all around the world at that time believe in the existence of aether. I say it again...scientist BELIEVE in the existence of aether. They claim that they had perform sufficient mathematical calculation that aether exist. So, at that time, all physics books mention about the existence of aether. It was taught in the university also. </blockquote>Isn't tat the beauty of science ? They evolve after finding out facts tat were more relevant and proven. Science cannot know everything instantly. Your example has further illustrates the meaning and value of proving and evidence. Aether cannot be proven, and it is easily replaced with the Einstein more believable and provable theories. Science is not as close as wat chin eng described. They will change when sufficient evidences was given. When u have irrefutable evidences and produce new knowledge, science will evolve, and it will evolve to become more and more accurate. Your example further illustrates the fact tat belief remains as belief only after cold hard facts have been supplied. Einstein support his belief with cold hard facts in the end too isn't it ?<br><br>Wat about creation now ? There r still no evidence on its creation. Isn't creation "aether" now while Einstein theories become "evolution" ? Why do u believe in creation ? It is just because the bible support evolution. Isn't tis following theory of "aether" blindly without looking at hard facts ?<br><br><blockquote>BELIEVE STRONGLY ..VERY STRONG INFACT over something that they FEEL it is true. </blockquote>Again in the end he give off hard cold facts to support his stand. Some Crazy people believe something to be true strongly. But they can never prove it out if they r wrong. Tat is the beauty of evidences. It can help to determine who/wat is right or wrong.<br><br><blockquote>Therefore SIS, do not quote each and every sentence of a person as if all thier statement from the first line and to end have no sense and urs have the most.</blockquote>I do explain why I disagree with them isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Ignorance is bliss. As someone had mention in his thread to u, i believe is quite true. that is if u r so right in every single statment, can correct every single word from another being, well u do not need to be here. U will be called to join the States for research. But since u are not, then ..all i could say is dun act like one.<br></blockquote>Ignorance is bliss... So u prefer to be ignorant ? Strange... do u know me ? Maybe I am doing research in the US now too isn't it ? American cannot access to tis website meh ? Maybe I had won a nobel price before ? How do u know I am not ? U don't even know me ! Why do u have the qualification to tell me not to act as someone or something ?<br><br><blockquote>never say that u cannot disagree, but to disagree WITH the attempt to prove that the persons statement is wrong from the start till the end, i believe that it shows ur personal grudge that everything,..EVERYTHING that this fellow mention is wrong and I AM right. So darn right. PERFECT, FLAWLESS. However so sad to acknowledge the fact that no one on earth is perfect. </blockquote>a little bit off point here... different people have different manner of writing in forums. I have put down my reasons on why I disagree. U can do the same to me if u want too isn't it ?</div>
