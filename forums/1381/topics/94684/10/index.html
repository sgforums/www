"<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> There are basically 2 ways to go about it - one of them is just like what you mentioned, Creation is only done at the beginning. The other idea being that Creation can happen even after the first 6 days. However, both explanations can be seen to be flawed.<br><br>- If Creation is only at beginning, then there should be very distinct classes separating the species. However, some organisms are very hard to tell apart from another. There are obvious cases of overlap, suggesting Evolution as the more probable explanation. Furthermore, the time difference between existence of certain life forms are evident, for e.g. Dinosaurs and Man dont exist at the same time. Therefore, they couldnt be created at the same time.<br><br>- If Creation can happen anytime, then we should expect to see drastic and totally different organisms from time to time. So far, no record of such sightings.<br><br>So which option are you gonna take? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span><br><br>"2) Creation doesn't mean turning fishes to rabbits nor rambutans to watermelons. That is fairy tale. "<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> As I was saying, if we do see fishes turning into rabbits in a single generation, that is proof of creation, and we can throw our evolution books away. However, Creation do suggest it is possible (read above why I say this), yet it has never been observed. </span><br><br>"3) The DNA is not drastically different because as science has already proven for life to exist, certain basic component must be present. A creator would have known that when creating. Similar DNA is not a proof of evolution, it is common because it is essential to life. "<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> If you are talkin about DNA, you are talking about Intelligent Design. If designs are so intelligent, why do u think we have so many organisms with redundant organs, organisms with organs serving the same purpose but 'designed' differently, organisms with weaknesses against viruses and other natural diseases? Also, SIS' comments on similar DNA is important because if there was indeed a Creator/Designer and we found organisms with totally different DNA, then we can prove the Common Descent to be false (a big blow to evolution). </span><br><br>"4) Evolution can be a process after creation is completed. The whole details of evolution, that I'm not sure.<br><br>My point is, some of us are not saying evolution did not happen.

But it really doesn't rule out creation. And maybe we'll never know the full details. "<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>Yes, there are many gaps not yet filled. However, Science dont just throw everything into a blackbox and called it creation (or watever). This is obviously the easy way out.<br><br>The point is like what I've said before: Creationism (and Intelligent Design) is not falsifiable, i.e. there is NO WAY !! to proof Creation is wrong. That is why it is NOT science. Because ALL scientific theories are falsifiable - there is a boundary or fundamental principle such that if things happen beyond what has been predicted in these theories, they are proven wrong. There is NO WAY Creation and ID can be proven wrong. I give you an example:<br><br>Example:<br>We have a time machine and we can view and even take samples of all that has happened pre-historic at our will. We see the slow and gradual evolution of mankind, each time this particular primate species reproduce, they are closer to modern man. Finally, modern man emerges, but you will say: "NO!! This modern man is 'Created'! He might be evolved but he is still a Creation by God!" You see? There is no way to argue against this claim, and proof Creation wrong.<br><br>Another Example:<br>Abiogenesis - the creation of life from non-life. Even in the lab or back in millions of years when life first emerged. The transition from non-life to life, one moment non-living, the next moment it is a living organism. You'll say: "NO ~! This is a Creation at work! God gave life. Even if you can produce life from non-life in lab, it is still God who gives the final breathe of life into this organism!" Again there is no arguement possible against this claim to prove it wrong.<br><br>Although the above examples are 'fairy tale', it should give you the impression what is meant by unfalsifiable. Creation is exactly that! On the other hand, all scientific theories, including Evolution, can be tested or proven to be false.<br><br>Creation involves supernatural. An area forever unknown to man. Even if we were finally able to know all the workings in this universe, there is still the hypothesis of a higher being and no way to proof it wrong, since the very simple reasoning behind it is: it is beyond your knowledge and reasoning.<br><br>THAT is why Creation is a fairy tale. </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>evolution is not about a species suddenly turning into another. if u think like "but how do fish turn into rabbit LOL?" its because Fish cant turn into rabbit. somewhere along the evolutionary line there had been a separation, there came fish ancestors and maybe mammal ancestors, and fish ancestors became fish, mammal ancestors had more separations and some became rabbit ancestors, and some others maybe cat ancestors, dog ancestors etc. then rabbit ancestors became rabbit.<br><br>just like Man didnt come from monkeys, somewhere in the evolutionary line there were homo erectus and lower apes, then homo erectus evolved into humans and apes remained as apes since they are already adapted into the environment or whatever. however, humans and apes might have shared the same kind of ancestor somewhere too.<br><br>this are not baseless assumptions, there are some evidence that scientists use such as fossils or whatever I dunno.</div>

I never had the impression that creation is such and here I'd like to clarify it's not. It is not making one species turn to another. However, macro-evolution does suggest that is possible. "<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Evolution always suggests gradual and small changes over generations, which is why I say a fish turning into something totally different in one generation will be enough proof to trash Evolution. Evolution, including macro-evolution, implies that drastic changes like this are impossible. FYI, macro-evolution is just a term used to describe evolution at or above the species level, it DOES NOT suggests drastic changes in a short time.<br><br>On the other hand, Creation suggests organisms to be created out of thin air, suggesting abrupt changes at an instant, including the possibility of the emergence of a totally new organism at any time (or only at the beginning of time if you will). Thus, if a totally new organism is observed to be born from nothing, or born from an existing and totally different life-form, then THAT IS indeed a proof of Creation. Rabbits born from a fish suggests that a radical change had happened within only one generation, which falls within the Creation scope (BTW, nothing is out of the scope of Creation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ).<br></span><br>"Of course dinosaurs and man are not created at the same time, even the bible doesn't suggest that.

Again, creation does not require that DNAs between species to be drastically different"<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> But you suggested that Creation is only necessary to "get things going", suggesting somewhat of a kick-start. As I mentioned, there are 2 ways to go about it: either all organisms are created at the start, or organisms are created at anytime. Yet both ideas are flawed.<br><br>- If Creation of all organisms is a one time event only at the beginning of time, it is suggesting dinosaurs and mankind lived together.<br><br>- If Creation can occur at anytime, we have never seen a single radical and totally different life-form.<br><br>Seems to me you are avoiding the main points made from my previous post and chose to talk about the 6 days of creation, and dinosaurs and men not being created at the same time, which is totally ignoring the points made (i.e. Creation cannot be a one time event at the beginning of time).<br><br>What you are suggesting is evolution did in fact happen after the initial creation. I can't help but wonder where does Creation come in then? Did it only create the first single cell life, and thereafter it evolved itself? Or did it create all classes as they were now? FYI, there are evidence of fossil transitionals between kingdoms and phyla (the highest classification of all organisms), suggesting that even at the top-most level, organisms have evolved into the different phyla and classes we have today.<br></span><br>"Like I said, creating something doesn't mean you have to make things totally different at the DNA level. Everything has to have a foundation for life. "<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>Of course Creation does not require DNA to be drastically different. In fact, Creation does not suggest anything at all, only the <strong>belief</strong> of the existance of a Superior Being whom is beyond all our knowledge, and beyond any proof of existence, an out-of-this-world entity.<br><br>However, like what SIS suggested, if we have actually found organisms with totally different DNA, that alone will prove that the Universal Common Descent (that all life are genealogically related) is false - and thus Evolution theory is shattered. You see the difference between a Science topic and a Religious topic? The latter does not provide any means to proof it wrong, suggesting anything goes, it's just beyond your capability to understand. Such reasoning is not acceptable in the fields of science, so dont ever try to reason that Creation is science - it is NOT! </span><br><br></div>
