              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Death above all without being raised by God is not an
                                  immediate transition to another life. If we died our state of mind would be
                                  likened to that of a sleeping person. Meaning that we would not be aware of
                                  anything including ourselves, our faith and God, time and our relationship with
                                  anyone including those who have died.<span>  </span>In
                                  short the dead would become as if they were nothing.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Here are the verses that support the belief that being dead
                                  is likened to sleeping.</p>

              <p>John 11:1-43, Jesus brings Lazarus to life. I begin at verse 11-14</p>
              <p>[read the bible to get the full story]</p>
              <p>            <em>The
                                  he[Jesus] told them, “Our friend </em><strong><em>Lazarus is asleep</em></strong><em>,
                                  and I’m going there to wake him up.”</em></p>
              <p>            <em>They
                                  replied, “Lord, if he’s asleep, he’ll get better.” Jesus really meant that
                                  Lazarus was dead, but they thought he was talking only about sleep.</em></p>
              <p><em>            Then
                                  Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead! I’m glad that I wasn’t there,
                                  because now you’ll have a chance to put your faith in me. Let’s go to him.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Verse 23</p>
              <p>            <em>Jesus
                                  told her, “Your brother will live again!”</em></p>
              <p><em>           
                                  Martha answered, “</em><strong><em>I know that he’ll be raised to life on the
                                  last day, when all the dead are raised.</em></strong><em>”</em></p>
              <p><em>            Jesus
                                  then said, “I am the one who raises the dead to life! Everyone who has faith in

                                  me will never really die. Do you believe this?”</em></p>
              <p>Let's look at Job. Job knows what awaits him after death. That he would
                                  descend to the kingdom of death until 'the sky disappears' that is until the
                                  last day  when the Lord promised to raised the  believers from their
                                  death.</p>
              <p>What Job and Martha believes represent what the Jews believe. Jesus and his
                                  disciples were all Jewish.</p>

              <p>1 Corinthians 15:22-24</p>

                                  But we must each wait our turn. Christ was the first to be raised to life, and
                                  his people will be raised to life when he returns. Then after Christ has
                                  destroyed all powers and forces, the end will come, and he will give the
                                  kingdom to God the Father.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">So according to Paul the dead would be raised in 3

              <li><strong></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">The second phase is when
                                  Christ returns the second time to raise His people. Who are his people. We get
                                  to that later. When will he return? Again later</span></strong></li>
              <li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">The last or third phase

              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p>Now we need to know where in the bible that tells us Jesus second coming.</p>
              <p>Here's the second coming of Christ as foretold in revelation 19:11-16</p>
              <p>The rider on the white horse,</p>
              <p>    <em>I looked and saw that heaven was open, and a white horse
                                  was there. Its rider was called Faithful and True, and he is always fair when
                                  he judges or goes to war. He had eyes like flames of fire, and he was wearing a
                                  lot of crowns. His name was written on him, but he was the only one who knew
                                  what the name meant.</em></p>
              <p><em>    The rider wore a robe that was covered with blood,
                                  and he was known as "The Word of God." He was followed by armies from
                                  heaven that rode on horses and were dressed in pure white linen. from his mouth
                                  a sharp sword went out to attack the nations. He will rule them with an iron
                                  rod and will show the fierce anger of God All-Powerful by trampling the grapes
                                  in the pit where wine is made. On the part of the robe that covered his thigh
                                  was written, "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS."</em></p>
              <p>That foretold the second coming of Christ.</p>
              <p>And just as what Paul had said, this second coming of the Lord is the first
                                  phase when the Lord would raise his people.</p>
              <p>Revelation 20:4-6 The thousand years</p>
              <p><em>I saw thrones, and sitting on those thrones were the ones who had been
                                  given the right to judge. I also saw the souls of the people who had their
                                  heads cut off because they had told about Jesus and preached God's message.
                                  They were the same ones who hadn't worshipped the beast or the idol, and they
                                  had refused to let its mark be put on their hands or foreheads. They will come
                                  to life and rule with Christ for 1000 years.</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>These people are the first to be raised to life</em></strong><em>,
                                  and they are especially blessed and holy. The second death has no power over
                                  them. They will be priests for God and Christ and will rule with them for 1000
                                  years.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>No other dead people were raised to life until 1000 years later.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-style: normal;">So Jesus in his second coming would raise his people who are especially
                                  blessed and holy. Those who refused to worship the beast or the idol. And those
                                  who were martyred. So Jesus came the 2<sup>nd</sup> time to raise His chosen
                                  people.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-style: normal;">What about the rest of us who may not be so holy or blessed? Those
                                  people would have to wait for the third phase that Paul had said. The end. Here
                                  is what the bible tells us about the end.</span></em></p>
              <p>Revelation 20:11-15 The judgment at the great white throne</p>
              <p>    <em>I saw a great white throne with someone sitting on
                                  it. earth and heaven tried to run away, but there was no place for them to go.
                                  I also saw all the dead people standing in front of that throne. every one of
                                  them was there, no matter who they had once been. Several books were opened,
                                  and then the book of life was opened. The dead were judged by what the book
                                  said they had done.</em></p>
              <p><em>    The sea gave up the dead people who were in it, and
                                  death and its kingdom also gave up their dead. Then everyone was judged by what
                                  they had done. afterwards, death and its kingdom were thrown into the lake of
                                  fire. This is the second death. Anyone whose name wasn't written in the book of
                                  life was thrown into the lake of fire</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>The sea refers to a plane below the earth, it’s the same plane of the world
                                  of the dead or the kingdom of death. It doesn’t necessarily be below the earth
                                  surface but it means that the state of life there is lower than in the higher
                                  plane because there is no life in it. Just like the earth is a lower plane than
                                  the heaven.</p>
              <p>So according to this verse <strong>all</strong> <strong>the dead</strong> are judged at the end of time that is on the last day where the kingdom of
                                  death finally gave up their stock of dead people. And the dead would be
                                  gathered to be judged. In the end anyone whose name wasn't written in the book
                                  of life was thrown into hell. So it's either heaven or hell in the end. And
                                  what kind of people whose name would not be in the book of life? Read the following,</p>
              <p>Revelation 21: 8</p>
              <p>    <em>But I will tell you what will happen to cowards and
                                  to everyone who is unfaithful or dirty minded or who murders or is sexually
                                  immoral or uses witchcraft or worships idol or tells lies. They will be thrown
                                  into the lake of fire and burning sulphur. This is the second death.</em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-style: normal;">So make sure
                                  my brothers and sisters that you are not among those who would be thrown into
                                  the lake of fire that was meant to punish satan and his angels. In the end the
                                  kingdom of death would be left empty. The dead would either be condemned to
                                  hell or be allowed to live eternal life(to eat the fruit of life) and live wit
                                  God. Knowing this I hope what I wrote here serve a meaningful purpose for your
                                  life as a Christian. I’m not perfect too and while compiling this I’ve made my
                                  decision to try to be a better Christian. Trying to catch the first plane out
                                  of the kingdom of death would be nice. As long as I don't get thrown into the fire.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-style: normal;">God bless and
                                  always be strong in Christ.</span></em></p>

              <p>I don't care if they laughed at me because I would speak the truth. I would not try in vain to convince anyone because I speak the truth and it would happen. If they didn't believe in what I said fine because they would eventually. I would however try in vain to convince other if my intentions were only to deceive people.</p>
              <p>If they called the IMH ambulance I would sue them to bankruptcy however. Because in a fair trial I would surely win everytime.</p>

              <p>Essentially, all religion and philosophy boils down to a common theme - faith in mankind.</p>
              <p>This hypothesis is consistent in Christianity as well.</p>
              <p>1) The 'Gospels' were written by men centuries ago (30-100AD)</p>
              <p>2) Men selected which books were true and termed them as Scripture (various councils in 4th century by Catholic Church) while deeming the rest as wrong. Their yardstick was their own intepretation of what was taught by the representatives of Christ at that time - Catholic Church.</p>
              <p>3) Hence the Bible (a collection of 66 or 72 books) became God's word.</p>
              <p>Based on this historical premises, it can be argued that faith in God is derived from faith in men and his ability to separate the inspired from the mundane.</p>
              <p>An aethist can point out that this is hypocrisy while a religious men can point out  how can we place our faith on what is unseen when we can't even trust what we can touch, feel and smell haha. :)</p>

              <p>Imagine a member of a unknown tribe from the jungles of Papua New Guinea, is taken to a city (Jarkarta) for a day, and then returned to the tribe.</p>
              <p>Never having seen or known of the modern world, how would he describe what he saw to his people, in his own language. His narrative then translated verbatim into Boyan, and then the Boyan version is translated into Bahasa Indonesia, and the Bahasa Indonesia translated into American-version English. The final story would be something like the Bible in English. You got to try figure out what was the original story.</p>
              <p>So when you read something like this:</p>
              <p>    <em>I saw a great white throne with someone sitting on it. earth and heaven tried to run away, but there was no place for them to go. I also saw all the dead people standing in front of that throne. every one of them was there, no matter who they had once been. Several books were opened, and then the book of life was opened. The dead were judged by what the book said they had done.</em></p>
              <p><em>    The sea gave up the dead people who were in it, and death and its kingdom also gave up their dead. Then everyone was judged by what they had done. afterwards, death and its kingdom were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death. Anyone whose name wasn't written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire</em></p>
              <p>remember my primitive friend.</p>
              <p>Because it would be from someone unknown narrator, translated into Hebrew, translated into Greek, and then translated into old-English (King James version), then translated into the New International Version.</p>

              <p>Why do I want to convince them about evil spirit or demon?</p>
              <p>I have friends who had been choked by demon and freed when they ask for God's help. It's pretty common.</p>
              <p>You are not making sense Andrew.</p>
              <p>You have seen a submarine travelling at 200m underwater? But you believed it. Why? Because men tell you it could? Because you trust them?</p>
              <p>Imagine telling a tribe who hasb't known the iron age and try telling them of iron and the  iron made weapons that could break their bronze tools.</p>

              <p>Imagine a member of a unknown tribe from the jungles of Papua

                  returned to the tribe.</p>
              <p>Never having seen or known of the modern world, how would he
                  describe what he saw to his people, in his own language. His
                  narrative then translated verbatim into Boyan, and then the Boyan
                  version is translated into Bahasa Indonesia, and the Bahasa
                  Indonesia translated into American-version English. The final story
                  would be something like the Bible in English. You got to try figure
                  out what was the original story.</p>
              <p>So when you read something like this:</p>
              <p>    <em>I saw a great white throne with someone
                  sitting on it. earth and heaven tried to run away, but there was no
                  place for them to go. I also saw all the dead people standing in
                  front of that throne. every one of them was there, no matter who
                  they had once been. Several books were opened, and then the book of
                  life was opened. The dead were judged by what the book said they
                  had done.</em></p>
              <p><em>    The sea gave up the dead people who were
                  in it, and death and its kingdom also gave up their dead. Then
                  everyone was judged by what they had done. afterwards, death and
                  its kingdom were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second
                  death. Anyone whose name wasn't written in the book of life was
                  thrown into the lake of fire</em></p>
              <p>remember my primitive friend.</p>
              <p>Because it would be from someone unknown narrator, translated
                  into Hebrew, translated into Greek, and then translated into
                  old-English (King James version), then translated into the New
                  International Version.</p>

              <h1 class="firstHeading">Asshole</h1>
              <h3 id="siteSub">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
              <p><strong>Asshole</strong> (or <strong>arsehole</strong> in <a title="British English" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">British English</a>) is <a title="Slang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang">slang</a> for the <a title="Anus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus">anus</a> and can be used to describe an unpleasant person. It is formed from <em>arse</em>, which according to the <a title="Oxford English Dictionary" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> has been used since the 11th century to refer to the rump of an animal
                  and since the 14th century to refer to a person's buttocks. The
                  combined form <em>arsehole</em> is first attested from 1500 in its
                  literal use to refer to the anus. The metaphorical use of the word to
                  refer to the worst place in a region (e.g., "the arsehole of the
                  world") is first attested in print in 1865; the use to refer to a
                  contemptible person is first attested in 1933.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ass_hole#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> But as with other vulgarities, these uses of the word may have been
                  common in oral speech for some time before their first print
                  appearances.</p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Semantics</span></h2>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The word is mainly used as a <a title="Profanity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity">profanity</a> towards someone the speaker does not like or whose behavior is hurtful,
                  self-centered, or particularly abrasive</strong></span>. Usually, the term is directed
                  at a male (in female anatomy, the focus is deflected to the <a title="Vagina" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina">nearby genitals</a>; see <a title="Cunt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt">cunt</a>). <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It may also sometimes be used to describe people who are viewed as stupid or useless or even meaningless, similar to <a title="Wanker" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanker">wanker</a>.</strong></span></p>
              <p>This word or its literal translation is found in colloquial speech in a number of <a title="Culture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture">cultures</a> (in both <a title="English language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a> and other <a title="Language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">languages</a>). This is because it describes an <a title="Organ (anatomy)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_%28anatomy%29">organ</a> of <a title="Defecation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation">elimination</a> that is considered a <a title="Taboo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo">taboo</a> region (since it belongs to the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Intimate parts" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_parts">intimate parts</a>) of the body in many <a title="Society" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society">societies</a>.</p>
              <p>The English word <em>ass</em> (meaning <a title="Donkey" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey">donkey</a>, a cognate of its zoological name <em>Equus <strong>asinus</strong></em>) may also be used as a term of contempt, referring to a silly or stupid person. In <a title="North America" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a>, the words <em>arse</em> and <em>ass</em> have become synonymous; however, in the rest of the English-speaking world, <em>ass</em> still only refers to the donkey, rather than the <em>arse</em> (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Buttock" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttock">buttocks</a>). It is worth noting that speakers of some varieties of English <a title="Rhotic and non-rhotic accents" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents">“drop their Rs”</a> before consonants, leading to a pronunciation of <em>arse</em> that is quite similar to <em>ass</em>.</p>
              <p>Until the early 1990s, the word was considered one of a number of
                  words that could not be uttered on commercial television in the United
                  States. Comedian <a title="Andrew Dice Clay" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Dice_Clay">Andrew Dice Clay</a> caused a major shock when he uttered the word during a televised awards
                  show in the 1980s. However, there were PG-13 and R rated films in the
                  1980s that featured use of the word, such as "The Terminator" (1984)
                  and the PG-13 "National Lampoon Christmas Vacation" (1989) and "Back to
                  The Future II" (1989). By 1994, however, the word was considered less
                  vulgar and was featured in dialog on the long-running television series
                  <em><a title="NYPD Blue" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYPD_Blue">NYPD Blue</a></em>, though it has yet to become anything close to commonplace on network TV. It is important to note that while the word <em>arse</em> has found a place on broadcast television, <em>arsehole</em> is not used, probably due to its more vulgar connotation. In some broadcast edits (such as the syndication airings of <em><a title="South Park" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park">South Park</a></em>), the word is partially bleeped out—ironically, as "arseh---", with the profane half of the word intact.</p>
