              <p>Essentially, all religion and philosophy boils down to a common
              theme - faith in mankind.</p>
              <p>This hypothesis is consistent in Christianity as well.</p>
              <p>1) The 'Gospels' were written by men centuries ago
              (30-100AD)</p>
              <p>2) Men selected which books were true and termed them as
              Scripture (various councils in 4th century by Catholic Church)
              while deeming the rest as wrong. Their yardstick was their own
              intepretation of what was taught by the representatives of Christ
              at that time - Catholic Church.</p>
              <p>3) Hence the Bible (a collection of 66 or 72 books) became God's
              word.</p>
              <p>Based on this historical premises, it can be argued that faith
              in God is derived from faith in men and his ability to separate the
              inspired from the mundane.</p>
              <p>An aethist can point out that this is hypocrisy while a
              religious men can point out  how can we place our faith on
              what is unseen when we can't even trust what we can touch,
              feel and smell haha. :)</p>

              <p>essentially u r not very correct.but not totally wrong..most religions are wrong..and most do not have faith in man..man can only do so much..but the point u put up is valid for modern christiandom..which of cuz is very flawed too..</p>

              <p>You are talking about defamation and reality. The ruler of your island tried to kill me and defamed me as being
              insane in 2002. Forgering false diagnosis from NUH. That's how those brave men
              covered their evil deeds. Hiding behind IMH power. IMH doesn't rule the

              <p>What you believe as a delusion is not for me. You cannot force me to think otherwise and I cannot force you to think otherwise but to tell someone to verify his sanity to the IMH is an insult Andrew.</p>
              <p>.So for every Christian testimony the IMH needs to verify them now?</p>

              <p>I don't mean to ressurect an older thread but I just want to say that I put what I put here in several other Indonesian forums</p>
              <p>and to my surprise I got a PM from one claiming to be a Moslem who is currently studying the bible and he wrote to me that what I wrote about death and what the Bible wrote about death and resurrection is actually parallel to what his Quran wrote.</p>
              <p>He gave me several verses from his Quran that showed the parallelism.</p>
              <p>One that attractt my attention was that according to the Quran the dead would know no difference had they been raised 1000 years later or one day later as they all would feel they had just been sleeping for a day.</p>
              <p>Another one that catches me was that in the end of time all the dead would be raised to be judged. This is the same as what our revelation told us.</p>
              <p>I thought somebody might be interested knowing this.</p>

              <p>pretty glad u realize the truth that many cath refused to see wat the bible really teaches and thats why im not a cath..the findings of yours i can say are pretty much more accurate then wat even bishops will teach.however, just like buddha in the end chose to go back to his ancestors religion of karma, i hope u will not end up with RC as your base so that your reading of the bible will be warp.</p>

              <p>pretty glad u realize the truth that many cath refused to see
                  wat the bible really teaches and thats why im not a cath..the
                  findings of yours i can say are pretty much more accurate then wat
                  even bishops will teach.however, just like buddha in the end chose
                  to go back to his ancestors religion of karma, i hope u will not
                  end up with RC as your base so that your reading of the bible will
                  be warp.</p>

Its simply because self-claim isn't a method of proof. 2 Tim and the other 26 books were deem Scripture simply because it was corrobated by Catholic teachings of the 2-4th century. Hence it is akward to state the Bible (one of the many Catholic 'invention" like purgatory etc) doesn't support Catholicism :)</p>

              <p>Such a strange response. The Gospel of Judas is wrong because it contradicts what the sypnotic Gospels claimed? And the Sypnotic Gospels are true because it can be found in my 4th century Bible....dear me...the early christians must be time travellers.</p>

              <p><br>Ahh but only it was easy to prove that the 12 Apostles really did wrote the epistles and gospels. But none of them could be easily verified. That is why the very first "Bible" was created a heretic called Marcion which consisted of mainly 2/3 of the Gospel of Luke.</p>
              <p>We can easily view historical evidence of the Catholic Church selecting books and deeming them as inspired.</p>
              <p><em>"For the blessed apostle Paul himself, following the rule of his predecessor John, writes only by name to seven Churches in the following order--to the Corinthians afirst...there is a second to the Corinthians and to the Thessalonians, yet one Church is recognized as being spread over the entire world...Howbeit to Philemon one, to Titus one, and to Timothy two were put in writing...to be in honour however with the Catholic Church for the ordering of ecclesiastical discipline...one to the Laodicenes, another to the Alexandrians, both forged in Paul's name to suit the heresy of Marcion, and several others, which cannot be received into the Catholic Church; for it is not fitting that gall be mixed with honey. The Epistle of Jude no doubt, and the couple bearing the name of John, are accepted by the Catholic Church...But of Arsinous, called also Valentinus, or of Militiades we receive nothing at all." The fragment of Muratori (A.D. 177). </em></p>

              <p>Such a strange response. The Gospel of Judas is wrong because it
              contradicts what the sypnotic Gospels claimed? And the Sypnotic
              Gospels are true because it can be found in my 4th century
              Bible....dear me...the early christians must be time
              travellers.</p>
              <p>Hence, how did the Early Christians determine which books were
              inspired and which were false when there was no benchmark of faith
              (no bible yet)?</p>

              <p>u mean checking the wiki is strange??for one, JC during his ministry has often quoted the so called Old Testament or the hebrew scriptures and one often will hear him say, it is written.hence forth, the books he quote from cannot be false. he was there when the writers were inspired by God himself, JC was also there when the things happened.hence we are quite clear on the hebrew part. now for the greek scriptures or New Testaments.the apostles were taught directly by the man.JC also said they were filled with Holy Spirit so that it might lead them to teach the word in different tongues.(by this i do not mean the queer practice of churches now that members starts to make strange utterance n sounds they call speaking in tongues).</p>
              <p>n the sacarstic note of time travel, nope. but things got carried down.</p>

              <p><br> Ahh but only it was easy to prove that the 12 Apostles really did
              wrote the epistles and gospels. But none of them could be easily
              verified. That is why the very first "Bible" was created a heretic
              called Marcion which consisted of mainly 2/3 of the Gospel of
              Luke.</p>
              <p>We can easily view historical evidence of the Catholic Church
              selecting books and deeming them as inspired.</p>
              <p><em>"For the blessed apostle Paul himself, following the rule of
              his predecessor John, writes only by name to seven Churches in the
              following order--to the Corinthians afirst...there is a second to
              the Corinthians and to the Thessalonians, yet one Church is
              recognized as being spread over the entire world...Howbeit to
              Philemon one, to Titus one, and to Timothy two were put in
              writing...to be in honour however with the Catholic Church for the
              ordering of ecclesiastical discipline...one to the Laodicenes,
              another to the Alexandrians, both forged in Paul's name to suit the
              heresy of Marcion, and several others, which cannot be received
              into the Catholic Church; for it is not fitting that gall be mixed
              with honey. The Epistle of Jude no doubt, and the couple bearing
              the name of John, are accepted by the Catholic Church...But of
              Arsinous, called also Valentinus, or of Militiades we receive
              nothing at all." The fragment of Muratori (A.D. 177).</em></p>
