Scripture is clear that partaking of the Eucharist is among the highest signs of Christian unity: "Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread" (1 Cor. 10:17). For this reason, it is normally impossible for non-Catholic Christians to receive Holy Communion, for to do so would be to proclaim a unity to exist that, regrettably, does not.<br><br>Another reason that many non-Catholics may not ordinarily receive Communion is for their own protection, since many reject the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Scripture warns that it is very dangerous for one not believing in the Real Presence to receive Communion: "For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died" (1 Cor. 11:29Â–30).</div>

The assumption of them not believing in Jesus and through Mother Mary is more of an urban legend.<br><br>I'm a protestant, and I know that.<br><br>As far as Christians are concerned, ONLY and ONLY and ONLY through Jesus can you reach God. And for your convenience, God and Holy Spirit can used interchangably with Jesus. nah, not really, because they are one.<br><br>But you are right on something, its a big bloody bloody mess. Read on the Ireland conflict regarding Protestants and Catholics. They were practically KILLING one another.<br><br>These are however, man-made conflicts. I think Pastor Kong said this around few hundred times, ".. we are living in a broken world, that is why bad things happen to good people." Thats one of the bad things, interconflict.<br><br>But its better now, much better. the Catholic church and most Protestant churches are making up. The Catholic have even made up with the Jews, and thats old news.<br><br>Its the newer churches that refuse to abide by this stability in search for their own grounds. Mostly charismatic churches, I'm not saying they are wrong - I am in one for crying out loud, they may be correct for all we know - its how things can get messy and you have to accept it as such.<br><br>Believe it or not, even Hinduism has their own sects and such. Its the same everywhere, thats why this is a broken world, a fallen world, etc etc. If things are so dandy and nice, and whole Christianity is in one voice, and one mind..<br><br>The world is gonna end, quite soon.<br><br>And no, I'm not gonna convince you, my role is to tell you what I think and what I believe are true and real. That include those secterian conflicts between Churches. They are real, but the reaons behind should also be understood.<br><br>Don't jump in without looking, even if its salvation, look, think, feel before embracing, and continue to learn and understand God. If you can do that, than you will be a strong and firm believer.</div>

That was why I preferred a charismatic Church because the thought of following traditions, rituals, sickens me and remind me of bad memories, and since I am there, I'll just stay there. This is God's will, tian ming. So unless something else happens, why not. And I've soften up about traditions too.. (And I'm in a charismatic Church! I must be weird.)<br><br>But. I read more Catholic articles and works than of charismatic and protestant sources.. Even when I was anti-Christ. Historically, I find Catholic records and scholars are more dependable and worth reading. You know.. The thought there are well formulated and researched out rather than based on emotional judgment and (back then) the so called illusive holy sprit.<br><br>Now, I try to read and study into both. But my Bible readings are not that good, thats why I can't exactly pull out quotes from the Bible at whim.<br><br>The point is, its not a matter of who art thou holier.

This is God's will, tian ming. So unless something else happens, why not. And I've soften up about traditions too.. (And I'm in a charismatic Church! I must be weird.)<br><br>But. I read more Catholic articles and works than of charismatic and protestant sources.. Even when I was anti-Christ. Historically, I find Catholic records and scholars are more dependable and worth reading. You know..
