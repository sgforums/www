But when CHURCH is mentioned in the BIBLE, it means "an assembly and grouping of people who have given their hearts to Christ."<br><br>Therefore, when you say you do not go to church, do u mean u stop going to a CHURCH BUILDING or do you mean you are forsaking the assembling of together as COMMANDED in HEBREWS 10:25 "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."?</div></blockquote>Well,I have a small group of friends and we sometimes discuss Christianity.And some of us are Catholic, some Baptist and some non-denominational.</div>

While I agree that going to a church building is ABSOLUTELY NOT necessary for a christian, it should be seen that a church building is nothing more than a structure to house the real CHURCH - which is US.  And its purpose is to let us gather there namely to - Worship, Pray to, Exalt our God and also to encourage and fellowship with our fellow bros and sisters -<br><br>Seriously, if the group you gather in does not gather to do what a 'CHURCH' was meant to do and that is to Worship, Pray to, Exalt our God and also to encourage and fellowship with our fellow bros and sisters , you are not doing what God commanded us to do.<br><br>OF COURSE, i am not saying that you must run to a church right now. What I mean is that in your own group right now, maybe you can start incorporating these elements.  Remember, JESUS, like you, was also unconventional. It really doesnt matter you do not go to a church but it does matter you do what God wants you to do, regardless where, how and when.</div>
