Always and consistently question yourself if it distracting you away from knowing God.<br><br>As mentioned, martial arts can be good as a physical training. There are indeed spiritual aspects to most form of martial arts. So it's good to be careful not to let your guard down. It will be good to discuss it with your pastor or mentor.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aye, good post. I agree. For me at least, there is no great contradiction between learning a martial art and faith.<br><br>Many martial arts were developed with the history and culture of their respective origins, and so they tend to be influenced by the various religions and philosophies in which they came from. It would be prudent for the Christian practitioner to distinguish and discern what various philosophies are appropriate or not so in whatever he's learning.<br><br>But I am not of the opinion that Christians (guys especially) should not know how to fight. I think it is a mistake to equate the ability to use force with unlawful violence itself, or that learning to fight makes one a more violent person. It is a matter of character and using for talents and abilities for which ends (good or evil). But then the misuse of a talent or ability does not mean that this whole thing has no validity for the believer. Last I checked we are still using hand phone camera, the internet and kitchen knives even thought they have been used for much wrong.<br><br>Any I think it's a large part of most guys duty to know how to fight, to protect which matters to them when push comes to shove. There is a difference between using violence for righteous and justified ends and using it for selfish or sadistic purposed. I don't think being a willful pacifist is a good ideaÂ… assuming, for the sake of an argument that you are presented with a situation where a madman is trying to harm a child, and the only thing that can stop him is a physical confrontation. It seems to me that at times shunning violence is the wrong thing to do... we must know when to be what.<br><br>What would be the moral thing to do? And it seems to me that the kind of person who can solve such a situation with the greatest chance of success is the kind of which applies his martial talents guided by his Christian morality.<br></div>

For me at least, there is no great contradiction between learning a martial art and faith.<br><br>Many martial arts were developed with the history and culture of their respective origins, and so they tend to be influenced by the various religions and philosophies in which they came from. It would be prudent for the Christian practitioner to distinguish and discern what various philosophies are appropriate or not so in whatever he's learning.<br><br>But I am not of the opinion that Christians (guys especially) should not know how to fight. I think it is a mistake to equate the ability to use force with unlawful violence itself, or that learning to fight makes one a more violent person. It is a matter of character and using for talents and abilities for which ends (good or evil). But then the misuse of a talent or ability does not mean that this whole thing has no validity for the believer. Last I checked we are still using hand phone camera, the internet and kitchen knives even thought they have been used for much wrong.<br><br>Any I think it's a large part of most guys duty to know how to fight, to protect which matters to them when push comes to shove. There is a difference between using violence for righteous and justified ends and using it for selfish or sadistic purposed. I don't think being a willful pacifist is a good ideaÂ… assuming, for the sake of an argument that you are presented with a situation where a madman is trying to harm a child, and the only thing that can stop him is a physical confrontation. It seems to me that at times shunning violence is the wrong thing to do... we must know when to be what.<br><br>What would be the moral thing to do? And it seems to me that the kind of person who can solve such a situation with the greatest chance of success is the kind of which applies his martial talents guided by his Christian morality.<br></div></blockquote>zan4 tan4 bu4 yi3<br><br>youre so so so good.</div>

There are indeed spiritual aspects to most form of martial arts. So it's good to be careful not to let your guard down. It will be good to discuss it with your pastor or mentor.
