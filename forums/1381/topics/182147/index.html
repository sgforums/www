I believe there is no need to over-detail, because we're talking to Someone who already knows what we want to pray for.<br><br>However, if we're consistently <i>too</i> generic in our prayers, it may be that we're not putting our hearts into forming the prayer, eg due to laziness. God, again, sees this.<br><br>For me, the key is somewhere in between.</div>

Most important it has to come from a sincere heart. It also depends on whats your conviction. Some start with "Almighty Father", "Dear Heavenly Father", Dear Lord" etc etc.... and some end it as "In your most precious name" etc etc...<br><br>Start by addressing God, followed by Thanking him, asking for forgiveness, then your thoughts (request) and end once again thank him then your closing.<br><br>Whenever i am stuck and do not know what to pray and yet i know there is something that i need to pray for. Just say the most comprehensive prayer that Jesus taught us which is "The Lord's Prayer"<br><br>Our Father In Heaven,<br>Hallowed be your Name,<br>Your Kingdom Come,<br>Your Will be done on earth as it is in Heaven,<br>Give us today our daily bread,<br>and Forgive our sins as we Forgive those who sin against us,<br>Do not put us to the test,<br>But deliver us from evil<br>For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power and the Glory,<br>Now and Forever,<br>Amen!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, wat is PRAYER? Prayer is talking to God! So when we start our prayer, very often we say "Dear Lord.." why so? Juz becoz He is DEAR to us! As we read the Bible, we noe tt God has many names! All the names show how great &amp; wonderful He is! We juz want to praise Him for who He is! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And how do we end our prayer? - "In Jesus' Name, Amen" Itz thru Jesus thatz why we are able to speak to the Father, ttz how we are able to be reconciled with Him! If not for Jesus who died in our place &amp; washed our sins away, we would nvr be able to stand in front of our most Holy Lord, let alone speak to Him in this way!<br><br>Amen - simply means "Thy will be done"! Yup, coz no matter what we pray for, we have to acknowledge tt God is the one who answers prayer! So whether His answer is "Yes", "No" or "Wait", we say Amen to admit tt itz still His Will and not ours to be! Many times, the ans we get is not wat we want, but then in due time we will undersatnd why it is so!<br><br>The challenge and oso the best part is how we respond - and it is the daily walk that we struggle... ttz why we must &amp; need to read the Bible evryday to be constantly reminded of how we shld live our lives for Him! Thank God for every new day! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
