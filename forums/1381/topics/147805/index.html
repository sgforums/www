            <div class='col-md body'>Let's have a show of hand...<br>Who here prefers to attend Charismatic Service?<br>And who prefers Traditional or Solemn ?<br><br>Is it because you are converted in or grow up attending such service?<br><br>Personally I grow up with the Traditional kind.  Even when attending Protestant Church, as that was Presbyterian, all the services were solemn.<br>When I was intro to Charismatic Church, I wasn't so used to the atmosphere.  So I still stick to the Presbyterian Church until some time later.<br><br>Catholic Masses are very traditional.  Even though some have Charismatic Mass once a week, which I attened once or twice only, I still go back to the Traditional one.<br><br>But my good friend who came from Calvary Charismatic Church only wants to attend Charismatic.  He said that without the atmosphere of congregation shouting "Amen", "Praise the Lord" etc, he would feel something is missing.<br><br>What about the rest of you here?</div>

Usually on Sunday, I see a super long queue there, not sure whether it's queue for Church Service or not.<br><br>I have been to Wesley for a wedding.  I kinda like the church building structure.  If I'm not wrong, it is the only Protestant Church in Sg that provides Sat evening service, for those who can't attend on Sun.<br><br>St Andrews - super nice place.  Mediacorp always like to use that place.  I have been there a few times just to appreciate the nice internal structure. Sometimes even stayed there for a while to pray.</div>

The only diff bet. the midweek and sunday one is no eucharist. They still worship, have offerings, and bible study is more interesting than sermon .. whaahah<br><br>But hey .. charismatic church pattern standard one .. songs also pretty much standard .. that time I went Catholic Tridentine service I was like wow!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
