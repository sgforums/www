              <p>The Lord doesn't sit in His synagogue, worshipping and praising God all day. That is His habit, His custom, but He doesn't do just that. The Lord goes down to the people. He walks in the street, He sits in fishing boat, He spends time at the house of Mary so often that she becomes a friend. He goes to the wedding party of some other people. He goes to a dinner and eats it with the tax-collectors and sinners, something that is not very right to do in the day of Jesus, and yet He never commits a sin.</p>
              <p>When you see a prostitude, do you say, "That is an example of what a loose woman is, what an immoral person is." And you shun her, and you despise her secretly from your heart.<br>Or do you see the human in her, that image of God that is still hidden somewhere in this person that had fallen so low. And you can see how she so very need Jesus like you do.</p>
              <p>Do you remember once upon a time, you also have some evil desires lurking somewhere in your heart, not very much lesser in wickedness than that prostitude. Maybe you are angry with someone and want to murder him, maybe you are jealous of somebody and you hurt the person by spreading rumors here and there about her.</p>
              <p>Even though these are small things in your eyes, they are not small in the eyes of the Lord. The murder you never commit is due to more likely your fear of breaking the law of Singapore than your righteousness. If you kill him or her, it is life for a life. The rumor you spread about her because you don't like her hurts her so much, she loses her self esteem and all sense of her human dignities, and eventually goes on to become the prostitude you despise today.</p>
              <p>And now you despise her.<br>And yet you claim you love the Lord with all your heart, your soul and mind.</p>
              <p>The Lord treasures her. The Lord loves her. This prostitude you despise is dear to His heart. He comes down not to receive the praise and honor due to Him as the King. He comes down for you, but He also comes down for her. Yes, He comes down for her.</p>
              <p>She is a loose woman, no doubt. She has commited lots of sins in her life, no doubt. But His heart loves her. He feels heart-broken to be separated from her. He knows she is too ashamed to come back to Him, she is too hardened to want to receive Him. She will never dream of going to church because she cannot stand the stares of the people in the church who, when heard of her occupation will give her eyes that make her... feel... well, dirty.</p>
              <p>He is different. He loves her. He accepts her. He receives her. He doesn't judge her. He is merciful towards her. And He goes down to her level to get to know the kind of person she is, so that she will want to come up to His level to know the kind of God He is.</p>
              <p>She probably never feels so much love from someone before. The religious people sees her as an immoral, hopeless case. The secular people sees her as a tool to satisfy their sexual urges. She is just... well... a prostitude. The worst and most degrading of profession a woman can do.</p>
              <p>Then He comes. He is a preacher. Preachers are holy people. And as she sees Him, she probably thinks He is like all other preachers in this world. He won't notice her. But no, He is different. He goes to her, He is interested in her as a person and He asks her about her life. He doesn't judge her, He has eyes of compassion. He doesn't talk about all those holy preachers' stuff. He talks about the story of the prodigal son. He doesn't show her that contempt most preachers show to her when she goes up to them the moment they know her occupation.</p>
              <p>For the first time in her life, she feels she is treated like a human being. She is a human being. And she begins to see... that maybe... she is not such a beast, after-all, because somewhere actually bothers to know about her life, about the person inside that face, and someone actually am willing to listen more than to judge.</p>
              <p>And so, because this someone loves her and accepts her just as she is, not passing judgment on her, she starts to notice something that she has forgotten all along. Something beautiful inside, that had never truly disappeared, but that had been buried away and forgotten. She notices that image of HIM in her. That image of Him that had been tainted by sin's filthiness and forgotten, but now she can start to see it somewhere in her, again.</p>
              <p>The hardened heart melted... the love that disappeared from her her heart resurfaced.</p>
              <p>She thought of how wrong she was.<br>Not all men were after her body afterall. Someone cared, somebody to look beyond this face, for that crying someone somewhere inside.</p>
              <p>Her heart was filled with gratitude. Her heart melted with love. Her heart was filled with adoration. She went to Him. It didn't matter that He was in a holy man's house. It didn't matter that the holy man and all the other people shuddered when they saw her entered that place. It didn't matter that these were the holy men who often used her as a warning example of a path to stay clear of. The eyes of the people were on her, they weren't friendly, it didn't matter. They were, to be exact, filled with disdain, it didn't matter. She walked up to Him, she fell at His feet and she burst into tears.</p>
              <p>Only He bothered to care, only He bothered to notice that person inside her. No one else did. And suddenly, her hardened heart was broken, and the love that she had never lost after all, re-surfaced and she wiped His feet with her tears and cleaned it with her hair.</p>
              <p>She loved Him.</p>
              <p>Dear people, like this story? It is in there, it is in the Bible. Well, some parts are made out of my own imagination of what could have happened.</p>
              <p>Why will the prostitude, the woman of low reputation wiped Jesus' feet with her hair. Had you ever thought of how dirty Jesus'feet were? He just walked through the street with an improper sandal, and mud and dirt were there.<br>Had you ever wondered if you would do the same thing for Jesus if you were there?</p>
              <p>Would you lower yourself so low to wipe His feet for Him? His dirty muddy feet, not with towels, but with your hair?</p>
              <p>I knew I wouldn't.</p>
              <p>But this woman did just that. What made her do it? Why would she do it? Because He was the first person in this whole world to show her love?<br>Because He was the only person to care about her life, to look into the affairs of her home, to treat her as a person of dignity and not some whore out there?</p>
              <p>Because He wasn't there just to tell her some boring stuffs about, "Repent, or burn." but He showed her love. He was interested in her life, He wanted to know why she became a prostitude, He wondered about her family that no one asked her about, who maybe had even disowned her because she was a disgrace to them? He was interested to know what she would have done if she was not a prostitude, and her dream and goal in life, and her hobbies and her interests? In other words, He was interested about her. He cared for her. He didn't see her as a soul to be won, a poor lost soul to be won, but He saw her as a beautiful daughter of God with that image of Himself still hidden somewhere inside that hardened heart of hers?</p>
              <p>Where people saw a sinner, a fallen person, fallen to grace, He saw His image somewhere in her. He saw that image that was buried somewhere by sin's hardenedness, pains and hurts and rejections that could be brought up again with just that little bit of love.</p>
              <p>And therefore, she, who had never known love all her life, because of her fallen-ness, finally found someone who accepted her. And He was not just ordinary guy. He was the most holy guy, most hot person, most talked about preacher of her times. He was the one crowd will queue to watch. (In modern day context, a Billy Graham/Benny Hinn kind of figure.) And yet this most holy of the holy saint of God actually noticed her, and instead of telling her, "Repent or you burn", He looked at her gently and bothered to set aside the crowd that wanted to touch Him to ask her about her life and to maybe even offered to go into her house and be her guest. Well... that finally broke that heart of hers, that transformed the beast, into a beauty.</p>
              <p>The lost child, lost daughter of God found love and acceptance, tears started flowing, and that image of God she had carelessly buried started to surface, again. She looked at Him, and for the first time in her life, knew what it meant to truly love.</p>
              <p>:) Happy story, right? It can happen today. Have you any friend who had fallen away from his or her position by sin's deceitfulness and had now lived a life of ultimate sinfulness? Maybe a christian brother or sister you saw in church, maybe a friend in your old days, maybe your own sibling that you now became ashamed to tell people of?</p>
              <p>Don't cast him/her aside and shook your head and sighed non-stop, "If only he... if only she... sigh... how he/she had fallen so low."</p>
              <p>That person needed you, dear friend. Jesus would not have sighed at that person but He would want to go to her like He did with the prostitude. Jesus would have shown that person His love non-stop until he/she was won over. Remember the story of the 99 sheeps? Jesus was not there with them? Jesus was there with that poor, one sheep with a mind of its own that had fallen somehow into a pit so deep that it couldn't climb up of it, now?</p>
              <p>Do you love Jesus? Are you sure?<br>Then, go and do what He did. Go to that lost sheep that had wandered away and through love and perseverance won him or her back. That would really put a smile on Jesus' face.</p>
              <p>"Oh Lord, show us your will! Help us to obey you and do what you want us to." If you really mean that, then maybe revival is not just about bringing people to church, but it is also going down to them in their daily activities, being the one there for them when everyone somehow had forsaken them.</p>

              <p><br>Prostitudes are human beings. They deserved to be treated with respect.</p>
              <p>Jesus forgives them, who are we to judge them?</p>
              <p>And not all prostitudes are willing, some are forced into it since they are young children.</p>
              <p>Can we not try to see them and respect them as fellow human beings and stop making fun of them?</p>
              <p>P/S: This is a thread directed at the christians. In the bible, it is said that we christians are to work to be doers of good deeds, and not just mere believers. And I hope to bring this christian forum back onto the right track, on discussion of the christian faith and how we can better walk in it, instead of having posts after posts that are anti christian in nature.</p>

              <p>I appreciated you for sharing Tao with me. When I was a Satanist, your sharing enabled me to learn more about religions other than Satanism or Christianity. Yet, it was God, the christian God, who finally brought me to realise the 'wrongness' of following Satanism.</p>
              <p>I had a dream from the Christian God, who told me He loves me even though I turned to follow Satan. I could not remeber all the words He said, but I cried in my dream. When I woke up, the tears were all on my eyes, and I felt that God was with me.</p>
              <p>I decided to turn away from Satanism at that moment and follows the Christian God.</p>

If he wants us to accept his son so much, asks christ to show to us now. It will save many people a lot of hassle spreading the words of god and many people will accept christ immediately.</p>
