              <p>i guess in everything you ask for, God answers according to his will. And your motives for asking is directly related to His will. It is not wrong to ask for healing. The bible says God heals! But if your purpose of asking him to heal you is because you do not want to give up all your riches in this world, MAYBE you will not get what you ask for afterall.</p>
              <p>I am not into the prosperity gospel. I think that is misleading. However, I agree that God wants us to prosper not only in wealth but in health, spirutally, mentally and physically. I do not think there is anything wrong to ask for money but I guess its all down to your motives.</p>

              <p>nope. let's face it. the only people who think that money isn't important are "poor people, religious people and rich people"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>poor people say that money isn't important, so they can comfort themselves.</p>
              <p>religious people say money isn't important so they look good religiously, like they're deep or something.</p>
              <p>and rich people say money isn't important because.. well, they have it already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think there's totally nothing wrong in praying for financial success. But it's another thing whether God blesses you with it or not. God blessed david, God blessed solomon, and God blessed jabez.</p>

              <p>I believe most of rich fellows are more financially aware than the poor or average one, cuz they earned them the hardway.</p>
              <p>Imo, praying for more money isnt helping. That is just another method to ease yourself when u lack of money or to get more money. Money cannot move by itself, its meant to be grabbed by ppl who has enough sacrifice and endurance. In my whole life, i never prayed once for more money or simply seek for dead granparents for lottery number. Its an eyesore when your own relative trying to make easy money from the grave.</p>

              <p>It's best to follow up your prayer with deeds. They usually work hand in hand unless the situation prevents the necessary deeds<br> to be done.</p>

              <p>It depends on your aim. If you want money to spend on luxuries on yourself, indulging yourself, then I'm sure it's wrong.</p>
              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>If you want money so that others can benefit, for example you building a home for the elderly, giving money to the poor....then I think it's good.</p>
              <p>Besides, I'm pretty sure God doesn't expect you to live penniless.</p>
              <p>As escadaraindrops said, some of the greatest people in the Bible, heroes of faith as the Book of Hebrews said, were rich: Abraham, Jacob, Job. HOWEVER, that does not mean only being rich means you are a Christian. Nor does it mean that only by being poor then you can become a Christian. There are quite a few examples of both rich and poor Christians in the Bible.</p>
              <p>Of course, prayer alone isn't gonna work. God will not just drop money from heaven. You gotta do something if you're in need of cash, like doing your best to find a job, for example.</p>

              <p><br>Ok, you are right. Sorry I didn't clarify. Yes there are times prayer alone works, when ALL hope seems lost.</p>
              <p>What I was trying to clarify was that as long as you have the ability to do something, do it with prayer. E.g. if you have the ability and qualifications to land a job and are out of money, pray AND look for a job.</p>

              <p>If you need help in some area, it is good to ask for help.  If you are a Christian, seek and pray by all means.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having prayed about it, that does not mean that you can sit and wait for things to happen.  Take time to reflect and find if there is anything that is causing this problem and take positive steps towards your need, e.g. kicking a bad habit, being more thrifty, etc.</p>

              <p>nope. let's face it. the only people who think that money isn't
              important are "poor people, religious people and rich people"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>poor people say that money isn't important, so they can comfort
              themselves.</p>
              <p>religious people say money isn't important so they look good
              religiously, like they're deep or something.</p>
              <p>and rich people say money isn't important because.. well, they
              have it already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think there's totally nothing wrong in praying for financial
              success. But it's another thing whether God blesses you with it or
              not. God blessed david, God blessed solomon, and God blessed
              jabez.</p>

              <p>I think you may be swayed by some mega churches teachings....Jesus says somewhere in the bible that it is foolish to be chasing after material wealth.....when one should really be building your wealth in a safe place (Heaven) that no theives can steal your wealth (something to that effect)....</p>
              <p>What clearly Jesus is saying is that building wealth for our eternal life is more important than building material wealth in this life. This is why there are people who is willing to give up everything and do God's work because they believed and trust in Jesus. Of course, they also have God's calling which gives them the strength and perseverance doing God's work - like Mother Teresa.</p>
              <p>The way to build your wealth in Heaven is to do what Jesus asked us to do - to Love and not by saying but by action. In The last Judgement in Mattew 25 31:46 Jesus lay out clearly what all believers must do in order to go to Heaven. If Christians don't do, they may end up in hell too!</p>
              <p>This is why mega churches preaching of salvation by faith alone is flawed. This is reinforced in James 2 14:16. </p>
              <p>Don't be fooled and think that Christians are all saved (all sins before, now and future) are forgiven by Jesus death and there will be no more condemnation and you are justified. Therefore, you can go and ask God for all the riches you think you deserve and
              ask for the sky.......This is dangerous my friend because Satan is waiting.</p>
              <p>God wants everybody to be rich and wealthy but not necessary in terms of money and materials but rather is faith and spirituality which is priceless and eternal. God bless us with the priceless gift of salvation, the Holy Spirit and wisdom.</p>
              <p>Pray and ask the Holy Spirit for guidiance and use the wisdom that God bless us to discern the right from wrong.</p>
              <p>God does not contradict and so does the bible. If one part of the bible says something, the other part tends to support it. The most mis-understood is about salvation (as above) and if you read the bible is telling you 2 things (to have faith and deeds), then it simply means that you need to do both.</p>
              <p>Chritianity is above faith, hope and love and NEVER about money and riches. If you live a good life (as close to what Jesus told you to do as possible), riches will come.... especially riches that you are building up in Heaven.</p>
              <p>If you trust the Father, you trust that he knows what you need even before you asked. And you know that he will give you the best - have faith. Do your part and he'll do His.</p>
              <p>And like what mega churches says they are followers of Jesus, do what he says - not what the pastor says (when he is clearly flawed). Actions speaks louder than words.</p>
              <p>God Bless All!</p>

              <p>Christ said to be of no part of this system of things....Where $4 is a big issue..</p>
              <p>however,earth is created by God and so are the resources.</p>
              <p>$ is used to buy resources.to live a life of a correct christian according to christ means we only consume what we need..the bare essential.and the more we apply bible knowledge to our lives..the more riches we build up in the spiritual side.</p>
