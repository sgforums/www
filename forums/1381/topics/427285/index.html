              <p>I had just finished reading the biography of Cameron Townsend and I am impressed by the example this brother in Christ had set for me. Born in a christian family, born in a privileged family, where he could have chosen to pursue the path as a US senator, he chose to give his life for God, instead.</p>
              <p>Believing in the need to translate the bible to as many languages as possible, this man of God went to Mexico to help translate the bible to the language of one of its Indian tribe.</p>
              <p>Netherless, all is not rosy in Mexico, the government is not very welcoming towards christians at that time. Cameron is not detered. Instead, he continued to seek after permission from Mexico to translate the bible and eventually, was allowed to do so. One of the person who was a non-christian challenged him-- go to the poorest village.</p>
              <p>And that is what Cameron did. He went to the poorest village, to study the language of the people, to write down its language and to translate the bible into its language.</p>
              <p>The mayor of the village began to try to read the bible and his life was changed. He forgave his enemy and became a christian. Cameron then proceeded to help the entire small village to change for the better. He tried to improve their crop harvest by solving their irrigation problems, and he introduced new seeds and new plant products for them.</p>
              <p>He did this even though he gained nothing from it. No one knew about his works, no one gave him credit.</p>
              <p>One day, everything changed... the Mexico president visited the village and was impressed. Cameron was allowed to bring more bible translators with him to help the indians in Mexico.</p>
              <p>And slowly, Cameron moved from humbly helping a tribe, just a small tribe in Mexico, to receive the bible in their language, to helping nations of people to receive the bible. He grew from a simple team of less than 10 people to an international organisation.</p>
              <p>When we set our hearts to do the works of God, nothing is impossible for him. Cameron believes in God and serves God with his heart, and God uses this simple man to bring the bible to many, many people. Wow.</p>
              <p>If you are interested to read more about this man, you can go to <a href="http://www.ywampublishing.com/">http://www.ywampublishing.com/</a> and purchase the book there. Cameron Townsend is sold under the christian hero biographies section.</p>
