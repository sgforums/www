"Most of the rest have stayed."<br><br>Jefferts Schori has said that homosexuality is not a sin and that the Bible should not be interpreted literally.<br><br>"The Bible has a great deal to teach us about what it means to live as a human being. The bible does not have so much to teach us about what sorts of food to eat, what sorts of clothes to wear," she told CNN in June.<br><br>"The Bible tells us how to treat other human beings and that is certainly the great message of Jesus, to include the unincluded."<br><br>Jefferts Schori, 52, has a doctorate in oceanography and worked with the US National Marine Fisheries Service before being ordained in 1994. She is married to a professor of topology and has one daughter who is an officer in the US Air Force.<br><br>She is also a pilot and logged scores of flight hours going to Nevada's most remote parishes to check on the needs of parishioners, Lewis said.<br><br>"She is a very quiet, soft-spoken person. Very insightful," said Lewis, who was on the hiring committee which elected Jefferts Schori to the post of bishop of Nevada in 2001.<br><br>"She is very fair in decision-making. She's very compassionate."<br><br>Jefferts Schori, who speaks fluent Spanish, said she brings "different life experience" to the top job of the church, according to the Episcopal News Service.<br><br>She expressed a desire "to embrace and celebrate all the diverse cultures, languages, and origins of the many parts of the Episcopal Church," it said, mentioning branches in Haiti, Taiwan, Europe, and elsewhere, and communities of Native Americans, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, and others.<br><br>"None is more important than another; all are essential to the transforming work of the body of Christ," the news service said.</blockquote></div>

I did not state this properly. What I'm trying to say is many assume that there will a coming of one evil person who is the antichrist and he will bring doom and all that blah blah blah. Many think of the powerful manifestation and think that person has the mark 666 on him, devil incarnate, all that sort of things. This is simply not so.<br><br>Antichrist is around since the birth of Christ. It is simply the spirit of disbelief. Every person who does not acknowledge Christ as the one true saviour can be considered the antichrist.</div>

Obviously the priest must be conformed to the image of Christ, who is male. Changing the substance of the sacrament makes it invalid. A person cannot be baptised in wine, because the substance is water. Similarly, only a male can recieve Holy Orders because the nature of the priesthood is tied to Christ himself.<br><br>The Orthodox allow married men to be priests, but still they don't have women priests.<br><br>Holy Orders is a privilege, not a right.</div>
