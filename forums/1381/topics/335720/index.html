              <p>In the times of financial crisis, it is advisable for all of us to be more careful how we spend money. but there is a thin red line between being thrifty and being stingy. in russell peter's terms "being a jew, and being an indian".</p>
              <p>how would u classify being thrifty and being stingy, where is the line drawn, where thriftiness becomes stinginess?</p>

              <p>well.. depends on the things that you give to is it a need or want though. but then also depends. for example tithing is something that cannot be compromised, rather the important question is when God calls you to give, would you obey n give ba instead of holding on to your money ba.</p>

              <p>Human is not a rational being. They would buy what they want even for the things that they need. For example choosing a particular brand of bread jelly.</p>
              <p>In some products the illusion that people need to buy them is so strong where in fact they are buying them because they want them.For example I never needed handphone when I was in my secondary or primary school.</p>
              <p>People make excuses all the time. Mostly reasonable of course because they still need foremost to convince themselves but still they are made up.</p>
