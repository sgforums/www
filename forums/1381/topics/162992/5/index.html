Islam has always been a progressive, rather than a faith resisting to changes. Read more about the Islamic empires of the Middle Ages up to the history of the Turkish Empire. Its not hard to guess who are making Muslims going back to the Dark Ages.<br><br>c. I dont feel quite comfortable seeing a discussion in length how a Muslim is uncomfortable with his faith with relations to Christianity on a public forum. You might wanna tread carefully how you are going to progress with this topic<br><br>cheers<br><br></div>

We Muslims are taught to read Arabic since young.<br><br>If you don't know Arabic the you're expected to learn some of it.
