            <div class='col-md body'>I have this email to share with u all <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>-------------<br><br>To participate in the life of Christ, we must first be identified with Him in His death. "For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection" (Romans 6: 5). Those of us who now have eternal life have died in the person of our sinless Substitute, Jesus Christ, just as surely as if we had consciously been present at Calvary. While in principle our crucifixion is thus an accomplished fact, in daily practice it should constantly mean 'death' to the self-life!<br><br>A young man once approached an older Christian with the question, "What does it mean as far as this life is concerned to be 'crucified with Christ'?"  The believer replied, "It means three things:<br>(1) a man on a cross is facing only one direction;<br>(2) he is not going back; and<br>(3) he has no further plans of his own".<br><br>Someone commenting on these three things says:<br>"First, a crucified man is facing in only one direction. Too many Christians are trying to face in two directions at the same time. They are divided in heart. They want Heaven, but they also are in love with the world. They are like Lot's wife; they are running one way, but are facing another.<br>Second, a crucified man is not coming back. The cross spells finish for him; he is not going to return to his old life.<br>Third, a crucified man has no plans of his own. He is finished with the vainglory of this life. Its chains are all broken, and its charms are all gone". In the light of these three truths, would you say that you are truly 'crucified'?<br><br>When men come to die with Christ on the cross, He comes to live in them by His Spirit!<br><br>I have been crucified with Christ<br>and I no longer live, but Christ<br>lives in me. The life I live in the body,<br>I live by faith in the Son of God,<br>who loved me and gave Himself for me.<br>(Galatians 2:20)</div>
