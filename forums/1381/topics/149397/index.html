            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>Recently I got this letter from my brother.<br>Please take time to read.<br><br>In Christ<br>OB<br><br>-----------------<br>To the Pastors &amp; Watchmen in the City<br><br>It has come to our attention that a Rev. Apollo C. Quiboloy will be in<br>Singapore on 2 October 2005 (Sunday). He will be holding the open meeting<br>at the Singapore International Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre Auditorium<br>Suntec City.<br><br>We first came to hear of this man during one of our trips to Davao City in<br>2004. We heard from the local pastors about a man on television in Davao<br>who was claiming to be the Son of God. Upon watching some of his<br>programmes, our team saw an eloborate throne built for Rev. Apollo in the<br>church and he was claiming that he was "the way, the truth, and the life."<br>At the same time, he used many of the Lord's words and personalised it to<br>himself, calling himself THE SON.<br><br>We are now alarmed to learn that he is coming to Singapore and felt it<br>necessary to warn the churches and believers in this nation concerning his<br>meetings.<br><br>Here are some examples of his claims that have been taken off his website:<br><br>When asked if he is Jesus Christ in the Gentile body, his reply was:-<br><br>"More than 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ came in the flesh to testify to<br>all that God can dwell in a human body, in the life of a man. It is here<br>now. The life that lived in Israel before is now here. He is now using a<br>Gentile body (referring to himself).  If He was able to come to the Jewish<br>people, He can also come to the Gentile people." John 5:23 says, "That all<br>men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth<br>not the Son honoreth not the Father which hath sent him."<br><br>Concerning his role as the Son of God, he said this:-<br>"The life of Jesus Christ is in me. If there will be another book that will<br>be included in the Holy Scriptures, it will be the book of the fulfillment<br>of the Old and the New Testament. This fulfillment happened in my life when<br>God called me."<br><br>Here are several other statements that he has made:-<br>"This great opportunity of sharing to you the divine wisdom and revelations<br>He has bestowed upon me as His Designated Son in these last days."<br><br>"Don't miss your visitation.  Hearken unto the voice of the Father now as<br>He speaks through his Son. Treasure each word and each moment for this<br>privilege is graced only to those who are true children of God, chosen and<br>handpicked by the Father to receive His revelation through His Son."<br><br>He also uses Scriptures such as John 3:35, 5:20, 7:18, and 8:18 to refer to<br>himself, even though these Scriptures are unique to Christ alone, thus<br>making himself equal to Christ and alluding to the idea that salvation is<br>through him.<br><br>Our Lord Himself warned us in Matthew 24:24-26, that " ...false christs and<br>false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if<br>possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. Therefore if<br>they say to you, 'Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out; or 'Look, He<br>is in the inner rooms!' do not believe it."<br><br>As shepherds and watchmen in this city, we need to warn our people<br>concerning these meetings. They should be avoided because one cannot<br>underestimate the power of deception. We are warned by the Lord Himself<br>about these things, so let us not fall prey.

As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. (Matthew 24:36-39)<br><br>Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.  (Matthew 24:42-44)<br><br>And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. (matthew 24:4-5)<br><br>At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. ( Matthew 24:10-11)<br><br>No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. (Matthew 24:36-39)<br><br>Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.  (Matthew 24:42-44)<br><br>And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. (Matthew 24:14)<br><br></div></blockquote>Indeed when the time is near, many will surface. However, hold on to your faith in Him. For He is faithful as you are faithful to Him. Do not be deceived, do not turn away from Christ. He is The Way, The Truth &amp; The Life.</div>
