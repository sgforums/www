            <div class='col-md body'>believe in God and attending church goes hand in hand. church in the actual context means an assembly of christians. therefore the term church does not mean a physical building. it is true that you can dont go to church and yet believe in Christ....church membership play absolutely no role in your redemption but solely based on the finished work of Christ on the cross.<br><br>then why church attendance? take a run thru the Book of Acts, you will discover that the early christians often met up in homes, pray and break bread. well...that itself is a church. for mutual accountability, edification, support and encouragement as a community.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I am thinking that 80% of the churches in Singapore is not like that.</div>
