            <div class='col-md body'>I am reading a critique on Thomas Aquinas. i am having problems digesting the 2nd portion:<br><br>AquinasÂ’s teaching had a positive side in that before his time there was little emphasis on the normal, day-to-day world, that is, the world and our relationship to it. These things do have importance because God created the world.  By the mid-thirteenth century, certain Gothic sculptors had begun to fashion leaves and flowers and birds, and had given these figures a more natural appearance.  Thanks to Thomas Aquinas, the world and manÂ’s place in the world was given more prominence than previously. The negative result of his teaching was that the individual things, the particulars, tended to be made independent, autonomous, and consequently the meaning of the particulars began to be lost. We can think of it as the individual things, the particulars, gradually and increasingly becoming everything and thus devouring all meaning until meaning disappears.<br><br>specifically, the part on negative results. anyone wanna try and take a stab at it? too cheem for me</div>

This is because while Aquinas was influenced by Aristotle's philosophy, his theology was Catholic.  In any case, the Unmoved Mover conception of God is what natural reason can lead one to.  The conception of God as 'Father' is something that can only be known to us through Divine Revelation.

The conception of God as 'Father' is something that can only be known to us through Divine Revelation.
