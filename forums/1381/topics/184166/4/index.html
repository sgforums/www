            <div class='col-md body'>As I'd said previously, I believe the PAP government has internal debates on all critical issues. I have read that some Christian MP had already aired their opinions on such issues. Gambling is only ONE of the many non-Christian values. Looking at the extreme side, assuming we have a government that consists of lots of religious people who cast negative votes of "religious" based issues, would detractors then condemn the government as extremists?<br><br>There has to be a good balance to recognise that society is secular regardless of how religous one is. To enforce any religious value is no difference from, say, the government of Afghanistan.<br><br>So really, it is a no-win situation where such politicians are concern. Don't enforce, folks will say: wah, you Christian meh? Enforce, folks will say, why you force your religious values on me? I want to gamble what, my money what!</div>

On one hand, Christians are to spread the gospels - sometimes it may be taken as "imposing" one's view.

On the other hand, Christians are also thought to need to restrain and not enforce their belief.....<br><br>The unfortunate topic here is - you, Lau sees the same danger as Christians in gambling.... had it been another less controversial issue, your opinion to how a Christian politician is to react may be a little different.</div>
