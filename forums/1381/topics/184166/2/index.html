One time, while interacting with a bunch of them over there, my knowledge of America is better than all those present.<br><br>From the religious stand point, the reason why there are so many tele-evangelist may be due to the fact that travelling a great distance is an issue. That being so, many professing Christians are quite guillible (might be because they are leaving in self-seclusion). Also there is a great diversity in the interpretation of theology church to church. The freedom of speech (fifth amendment?) virtually guarantees that anyone can preach/denounce/proclaim anything they like.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes, George Bush won the elections due to the support of many Christians, conservatives to be exact.<br><br>But then again, going back to the issue, Singapore is blessed then because her Christian population have more knowledge than the American ones? And also, how do we measure faith then? Its back to the question where some gits try to 'judge' the Katrina victims by their faithfulness, or rather, lack of it.<br><br>This kind of judgement, i dont want to make. Its more of a self assuring statements about ourselves to make ourselves happy. I rather mull over what i can do for these people.<br><br></div>

Some Christians parents were offended because the word "witch" appeared in some English primary school books. Some kids just have wussy parents.<br><br>The creationism issue? Won't happen lah.
