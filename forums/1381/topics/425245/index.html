              <p>I like the rainbow contradiction where God put the rainbow in the cloud.</p>
              <p><em>"I do set my bow in the cloud."<br></em>God is rightly filled with remorse for having killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, it will remind him of his promise so that he won't be tempted to do it again. (Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: "Oh, yeah.... That's right. I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I'll have to find something else to do.").</p>
              <p>But rainbows are caused by the nature of light, the refractive index of water, and the shape of raindrops. There were rainbows billions of years before humans existed.</p>

              <p>what kind of a god if it has wrath and drowning people due to its whim and fancies. isnt it similar to human character flaws, since the concept of god was created by mankind. there are so many flaws and inconsistencies if you think critically about it.</p>
              <p>for example, god would have known Lucifer will betray him when it created Lucifer isnt it, since god would have known everything and anything in the past, present and future. where is the freewill given to Lucifer when god jolly well knows Lucifer is going to betray him when god created him, unless god doesnt know in future Lucifer will betray him.</p>

              <p>Rainbows also can be caused by a prism... not only just by water... as long as a medium that has a different refractive index from air, u can see rainbows due to the white light being split into different frequencies and wavelength... </p>
              <p>God does not exist... if u read the bible, u will notice that there is a sudden change of character from the old to the new testament... the old sounds like an old man who is jealous of other ppl being loyal to other Gods... and if u read on, this God actually promote incest... omg, when i read the bible for the first time, it does not even sound holy to me... </p>

              from air, u can see rainbows due to the white light being split
              into different frequencies and wavelength... </p>
              <p>God does not exist... if u read the bible, u will notice that
              there is a sudden change of character from the old to the new
              testament... the old sounds like an old man who is jealous of other
              ppl being loyal to other Gods... and if u read on, this God
              actually promote incest... omg, when i read the bible for the first
              time, it does not even sound holy to me... </p>

              <p>The problem is how can Jesus be both man and God.</p>
              <p>U are either human or divine.</p>

              <p>God cannot become human and retain his status as God.</p>

              <p>There's alot of christian friends disturbing me when I practised buddhism.</p>
              <p>I was tricked by them at that time.</p>
              <p>They tell me 6 days meant 6 long periods so It does not contradict with science.</p>
              <p>They also tell me dinosaurs is in the bible too.</p>
              <p>Now I ceased contact with them.</p>
              <p>But I am not a buddhist now I repeat.</p>
