              <p>i'm not looking at the bible now, but that garden of eden is part of the old earth.</p>
              <p>it's only (if i am not mistaken), at the last chapter, the new heaven and new earth is created, and those whose names are found in the book of life, will live together with Him, in this new heaven and new earth.</p>
              <p>i believe that the 14400 is a gross misrepresentation and misinterpretation because it conflicts with the bible chronologically and logically.</p>

              <p>what you said about the 14400 does conflict with it
                                  chronologically and logically. if it is only meant for 14400 to be
                                  saved, why bother with raising the dead since Jesus already has his
                                  14400?</p>
              <p>and remember that God desires that all to be saved. That's why I
                                  don't agree with predestination either, that God has already chosen
                                  who is to be saved etc.</p>
              <p>the difference between christianity, and everything else is the
                                  unique fact that we start with the confidence of our salvation, we
                                  don't do anything, while being unsure that we are loved and saved.
                                  How can anyone love God while feeling jittery about the love he
                                  receives?</p>
              <p>It is not that we love God, but God first loved us, and
                                  demostrated that love for us. Unless you believe in a backstabbing
                                  God who promises us great things like LKY only to screw us over at
                                  the end. which don't make sense logically to me either.---dumbdumb</p>
              <p>even when jc/Yeshua has his fellow heirs of the 144k. the people that are resurrcted consists of some of the 144k. as well as the other flock..they are resurrected to enjoy life. this is in harmony with your God desires all to be saved.</p>
              <p>but then people will ask den y dont save satan n frens?christians have a good start cuz when a person accept christ, he is sumthing like a premier member. unless he fall away frm God then sure wun be saved.</p>

              <p>btw, the only predestined stuff in bible was yeshua's death since it was agrred between him and Yodh He Waw He. but should the human yeshua ever decide not to die for human, we also ll..God will also ll..maybe i should rephrased to an agreement instead of predestiny.</p>
              <p>bible also states there is no destiny and luck..so i also dun knw where certain mainstrem churches get the idea from to teach people that.</p>
