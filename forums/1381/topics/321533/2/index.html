              <p>for the JW..they believe in JC as the son of God as stated in the bible. the almighty God is not a 3in1 God head. in this part, they are a little like Judaism..however, they believed truly that JC is the messiah and redeemer. just that JC aint no God.</p>
              <p>core beliefs are that God, Jehovah, is the supreme being that has the right to rule all creation. JC the boy will support fully whatever the Dad wills.HS is a breath of God.</p>
              <p>the so called armageddon is a period of time for dead loved ones to be resurrected so they can be judged and learn about Jehovah God.( this is the same God as Yahweh, Yodh He Waw He). all this will be inconjunction with the restoration of the planet and human body. while satan and frens is in the pit for 1k years. after the 1 k years, satan will be released for a final test.all who side him again will die.</p>
              <p>btw, they do not believe in immortality of the spirit,hell fire,idolatries,xmas and easter.</p>
              <p>basically, core beliefs = adhering to the bible lor.</p>

              <p>it is a pretty well known fact that the 25th of dec is not the birth date of Yeshua. Actually we are told that when Yeshua was born, the shepherds were in the field, this infers that it was not in dec.</p>

Idol worshippers.</p>
              <p>Easter was never acknowledged by Yeshua nor was it ever practiced by early believers. Yeshua kept passover not easter, and it is also widely known that easter and passover may differer by about a month. It is just funny that the bunny just turned up. Do you know the history of easter?</p>
              <p>That is the whole point of believing in Yeshua, it is not about religion, it is about personal relationship. These are very different.</p>

              <p>btw, for those that knows not easter...</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica;">Modern-day Easter is derived from two ancient traditions: one Judeo-Christian and the other
              Pagan. Both Christians and Pagans have celebrated death and resurrection themes 
              following the
              Spring Equinox for millennia. Most religious historians believe that many
              elements of the Christian observance of Easter were derived from earlier Pagan
              celebrations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica;"> The equinox occurs each year on March 20, 21 or 22. Both <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/neo_paga.htm">Neopagans</a> and <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/christ.htm"> Christians</a> continue to celebrate religious rituals
              linked to the equinox in the present day. <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm">Wiccans</a> and other <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/neo_paga.htm"> Neopagans</a> usually hold their
              celebrations on the day or eve of the equinox. Western Christians wait until the 
              Sunday on or after the next full
              moon. The Eastern Orthodox churches follow a different calculation; their 
              celebration is often many weeks after the date selected by the Western churches.</span></p>

              <p>Exodus 12:49 refers to the celeberation of the Passover by both the children of Isreal and proselyte who live with them.  Gentile soujourners are not allowed to celeberate the Passover in the same manner as Isreal. However a proselyte may cerebrate the passover with the children of Isreal.</p>
              <p>Exodus 12:43-49</p>
              <p><em>The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the statute of the Passover sacrifice: No estranged one may partake of it.<br>And every man's slave, purchased for his money you shall circumcise him; then he will be permitted to partake of it.<br><strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A sojourner or a hired hand may not partake of it.</span><br>It must be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the meat out of the house to the outside, neither shall you break any of its bones.<br>The entire community of Israel shall make it.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And should a proselyte reside with you, he shall make a Passover sacrifice to the Lord. All his males shall be circumcised, and then he may approach to make it, and he will be like the native of the land, but no uncircumcised male may partake of it.<br></span>There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who resides in your midst."<strong> </strong>All the children of Israel did; as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.<strong> </strong>It came to pass on that very day, that the Lord took the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their legions.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here is a commentary by Rashi on the issue.</p>
              <p><a class="pskNum " name="1249"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>49</strong></span></a><strong>. There shall be one law. </strong>[This verse comes] to liken a proselyte to a native also regarding other commandments in the Torah.</p>
