            <div class='col-md body'>Very much I would like to envisage the world in hectic chaos , such as forces of heaven and hell clashing. Battlefield earth , people get to chose which side to side with. Why didn't it happen? God's too merciful? The Devil is not merciless? There is conflict between the two , but eventually things would boil down to physical stuff. surely theirs powers are not of this world and would be damn pretty obvious to notice. yet none of them appeared. no angels in combat with devils , Jesus with a mini-gun. unless they gotten the people of the world to fight instead. but apparently God made them do so , not the devil.. The islam extremists proclaim war on God's word , the US fought back , and being a country with God in their constituition , it's seems that God is fighting with God? Why are there so many conflicts ? Why can't it be simple , just Jesus and Lucifer fighting in the matrix style for dominace of earth? Religions clashes , but not much sides with evil. Good is fighting Good? If evil hardly exist , why good exist ?<br><br>Therefore , I believe only in myself....</div>
