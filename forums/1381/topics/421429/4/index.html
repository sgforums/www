              <p>Precisely. You are just proving to me we are not created by God because there are fat, thin, short, tall, ugly and pretty people. It is just not fair and God should be fair because we are supposed to be his children in his image. I'm not fault finding, I'm logic finding.</p>

              <p><br>exactly, so the crux of the issue is, what is the meaning of the word "image"?</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_of_God">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_of_God</a></p>
              <p>... again, it does not mean that YOU need to agree with the doctrine.</p>
              <p>whether people are born disabled or abnormal has got to do with the genetical make up, the natural order of cause and effect.</p>
              <p>children are born with AIDS because the genetical make up was messed up by the previous generations, likewise with physical deformity.</p>
              <p>I don't think God is obligated to repair such damages.</p>
              <p>.... but all these arguments are useless.... better off you folks have some balls and go to a church and challenge the religious people openly than hiding behind a nick and kpkb.</p>

              <p>my argument was that this is a themed forum, if people don't like Christians, don't come in. not like someone hold a gun on their head or what.</p>
              <p>forum creator and I wanted to close the forum totally as there was no purpose whatsoever for it to exist, and there are more flames than anything else.</p>
              <p>but admin saw that it was not good, and took our mod rights from under us.</p>
              <p>many attempts were made to get new mods. I even volunteered once, but admin does not respond, and never will.</p>
              <p>so my advice to you... it's not worth the effort.</p>
