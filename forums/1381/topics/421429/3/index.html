              <p>ok, this thread has gone sideway from the second post.</p>
              <p>This topic is suppose to be: Will religion be science in the future?</p>
              <p>However I'd much prefer the title to be: Will science be the religion of the future?</p>
              <p>It is entirely possible that science will be religion, as it is today, some people subscribe more to scientific findings that to rely on "god".</p>
              <p>However, will science supplant religion as a belief remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>Whether religion is a truth, or that all religion leads to the same truth, or that there is an only true religion also remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>As there are so many people with so many views, it is also true that many people perceive life differently, and while scientific findings continues to expand, so does the need to look for a deity. Otherwise how can we explain why so many professionals are seeking for "truth" through supernatural beliefs?</p>
