              <p>So, you are saying it is christian philosophy which is not true at all times and cannot use scientific facts to explain. In short, it is illogical.</p>
              <p>Pain is pain, there is no need to know the opposite to know it is painful if one is burnt by fire. Scientifically, our body will react to pain by crying, screaming for help. A new born baby will cry in pain when he is being hurt.</p>

              <p><br>That is definitely logical.  To tell you the truth. I listened to the pastor who preached about 1+1=2, if I'm not wrong he is from Hong Kong. He said it is not unreasonable to say 1+1=2 just like it is not unreasonable to say only believe in Jesus will lead to heaven.</p>
              <p>But I'm telling you it is unreasonable to say 1+1=2. I've already given you all the possible equations above. Though ultimately the answer is 2 but there are many ways just like there are many ways that lead to heaven not necessarily be believe in Jesus.</p>

              <p>but teh context here is abt whether christian philosophy is logical...u said it wasnt since its not true all the time...since when was the context abt whether christianity is only way to heaven? tat is another topic...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so my eg is to tell u tat u cannot say sth is illogical juz cos its not true all the time...1 + 1 = 2 isnt true all the time since  1 + 1 can also equal 10...it depends whether u are looking at it mathematically or binary...likewise, whether christian philosophy is logical or not depends whether u are christian or non-christian...hope u see the link...i betta stop now cos any more and i will break my promise to refrain from using christian philosophy...</p>

              <p>If Jesus asked us to endure armchair critics who hide behind the internet to mindlessly attack others with blatant lies, that's the least that we can do for Him - He who first loved us unconditionally. </p>
              <p>It's never too late to turn back to Him if you are really sincere in humbling yourself and repenting for all the wrongs that you've done. Perhaps someday you will realise this when you are about to leave this world.</p>
