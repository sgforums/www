              </strong></span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><strong>
              </strong>
              <p>When God gave the ten commandments to Israel, the first two dealt with the worship of false gods (Exodus 20:2-5). This emphasis must have come from foresight, because idolatry became one of the most persistent evils among the Israelites. God’s prophet Isaiah described the pathetic condition of a man who cuts down a tree, uses half the wood for a fire to warm himself and cook his food, then fashions the other half into an idol and worships it (Isaiah 44:15-17). Jeremiah ridiculed those <em>"who say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’ and to a stone, ‘You gave me birth’ "</em> (Jeremiah 2:27).</p>
              <p>We may laugh as we read such things and picture folks praying to statues of wood, stone, or metal. We tell ourselves that only the most backward and primitive cultures still do that sort of thing.</p>
              <p>But think again. Modern, sophisticated man still has his idols. They don’t take the form of graven images, of course. But they’re made of rather inferior stuff nonetheless.</p>
              
              <p>There are still folks who worship trees and rocks; they just don’t bother to fashion them into anything. Some environmentalists have elevated the earth to god status. And some animal rights activists do the same for animals by revering them above human life. Man was created to have dominion over God’s creation (Genesis 1:26f), and that dominion brings responsibility. Respect for our Creator should make us prize and appreciate His creation, not abuse it. But our main concern isn’t the earth or its animals; it’s our relationship to God. Our first duty in life is to reverence and obey Him (Ecclesiastes 12:13). And among His creatures, our first concern must be for those made </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia;">in His image — our fellow man (see Matthew 22:37f).
              </span></p><p>Some idols are flesh and blood. Stars of music, movi<span style="font-weight: 400;">es, TV and sports have long been called "idols" — a description more truthful than we realize. One satirist called them "America’s royalty." Kids’ bedroom walls are covered with their pictures. The reactions they elicit at public appearances would make a Roman emperor jealous. We value these idols because of what they provide: <em>entertainment</em>. Our worship of them is just a symptom of our overemphasis on it. There’s nothing wrong with honoring a person for his talent or achievements. But the Bible warns against idolizing people. The world of Paul’s day had spiraled into depravity because it <em>"worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator"</em> (Romans 1:25). Ours is much like it. Remember, only God is worthy of worship (Matthew 4:10).</span>
              </p><p>People often worship idols of paper and plastic — the gods of wealth. These gods are revered because they can buy us more idols: idols of wood and brick (houses), of steel and fiberglass (cars and boats), of fine fabric (clothes), of wire and buttons (electronic gadgets). Is it any wonder men call it the "almighty dollar"? Many folks see wealth as the sole measure of the quality of life. We judge the success of our jobs and even our marriages by how much we have. Parents use material things as a substitute for parenting, and so children learn to value things more than people (or God). But God warns us, <em>"He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver; Nor he who loves abundance, with increase" </em>(Ecclesiastes 5:10). Paul called greed idolatry (Colossians 3:5) and the covetous man an idolater (Ephesians 5:5). Would that we had the same view! Jesus said that <em>"one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses"</em> (Luke 12:15).</p>
              <p>There are other idols of every shape and size. In Jesus’ parable of the great supper in Luke 14, those who were kept from the feast did not commit any overt act of sin. They were left out because of a piece of ground, five yoke of oxen, and a new wife. How about us? Are we so involved in wholesome activities (work, little league, civic clubs) that we have nothing left for God? </p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
              <p>Idolatry isn’t dead. Nor is it limited to primitive cultures in far off lands. It’s alive and well in our own "advanced" society. The gods may be different — they may not even be called gods — but men worship them just the same. Our idols — our gods — are whatever we allow to take control of our motives, our decisions, and our actions. Make sure your only god is the true and living God. <em>"Little children, guard yourselves from idols"</em> (1 John 5:21).</p>

              <p>wah sey.. so active ... especially got recent news on religions....</p>
              <p>The current way of handling religion in countries are just temporal methods.</p>
              <p>On govt level, they can keep talking about peace and respect for religion. But on street level, between people face to face,, can they really do that, as in not think that other religion is right or wrong.</p>
              <p>Human is right or wrong animal. We have opinions about everything from supermarket, moral issues, animals and politics. We can never escape from thinking whether which religion is really true, at least in inner conscious level. On the concious level, we may suppress the debate and respect others.. but inside on heart deeply. there will always be tinkling feeling probing your conscious brain to face the reality.</p>
              <p>For me , as a atheist for many years liao, I personally feel that i do not have to face with such inner or sub conscious feeling probing up my conscious level asking whether my belief in religion/ or not is correct or no, cos my beliefs have stood up well and stable in the face of other arguments. Instead it has become more and more concrete.</p>
              <p>Atheist points are to me, very stable and coherent and do not really have to feel the tinkering feeling of uncertainty. Atheist knows that they are going to die, anytime, and bye bye forever, no god to sayang me.. atheists job is to learn to accept such truth instead of beating around the bush.</p>

              <p>well non believers didnt say their religion is false and satanic isnt it.</p>
              <p>we just commented on why he said what he said and the fact of the matter is, their faith is not tolerant towards other faiths. if you dunno about this, are you in the same religion as rony?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how many a time did christians overzealously tell people that their religion is satanic and false, and that you will go to hell after they die. what does it say about the religion, even without rony tan saying it explicitly. if this is not absurdity and rude, I really have no idea what is.</p>
