              <p>When were we ever "civilized"? Is a society living in huts less civilized than us, who lives in urban environment? What is "civilized"?</p>
              <p>So you want a father of fear during your childhood than a father of love going by how you interpret the sudden change in this God's attitudes? Religions have never been about making money only when religions start becoming organized, greed crept in.</p>
              <p>Have anyone wonder why Christianity and Islam are independent religions not branches of Judaism? Like how we have Protestants, Catholics, Sunni and Shia. Christianity started out as a Jewish sect.</p>

Everything happens for a reason and therefore there will be an answer to each and every question.

              <p><br>According to Buddhism, the baby will be born in ghosts path unless someone chao du him (temples usually chao du all the babies who died young or being aborted), will he be reborn again. It is the baby's karma that he was short lived. Karma spreads over 3 lifes (ä¸‰ä¸–å› æžœï¼‰ã€‚</p>
              <p>To be born in ghosts path is very suffering because the shortest life span in ghosts path is 200 years old.</p>

              <p>Yes, karma applies to everybody. I don't believe that God or any other higher beings have taken the baby away, as what you said the baby looks so innocent, no one is so cruel to let him dies. However, no one can escape karma (no one controls karma)  which is the law of nature and can never go wrong and not bias.</p>

              <p>If one can understand that Heaven and Hell are not specific places to go to, like Disneyland or House of Horrors, but is a 'state' of existence in the spiritual realm for self-reflection that people go to upon death, then there's no confusion or need for debate.</p>
              <p>Whether it's effect of karma or judgement, whichever belief one chooses to go with, everyone goes through the same process. The effects experienced will be magnified many times and felt extremely strongly by the person during this 'state' in the spiritual realm. He/She will feel the effects of his/her deeds over the course of his/her latest lifetime, until he/she has learnt the gravity of his/her deeds. Hence, it'll feel like Heaven or Hell or simply peaceful, depending on how he/she led his/her life. Anyone who wishes to verify this, can try it for himself/herself. No amount of reading or debate can convince non-believers. :)</p>

              <p>Limbo is a speculative idea about the afterlife condition of those who die in original sin without being assigned to Hell of the damned meaning those who died before Jesus came to earth.</p>
              <p>I had read more about Limbo, apparently there is the Limbo of the Fathers and the Limbo of Infants.</p>
              <p>The latter is a hypothesis about the permanent status of the unbaptized who die in <span class="mw-redirect">infancy</span>, too young to have committed personal sins, but not having been freed from original sin.</p>
              <p>I believe only Catholics believe in this (?) and limbo also exists in other religions like Islam and Zoroastrianism.</p>

              <p>I think limbo is accept by some Catholics not all because the Roman Catholic Church has no doctrine on the fate of unbaptized infants.</p>
              <p>Something to think about Christianity view on dead babies: If we have to bear the original sin of Adam &amp; Eve and the only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ, then babies who bear the original sin and doesn't know of Jesus Christ, died before being baptized can they go to Heaven? Or is there an concept of reincarnation in Christianity thus babies were washed of the original sin too?</p>
