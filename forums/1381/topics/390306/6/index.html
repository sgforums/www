              <p>I think it's ridiculus and naive to think that religions, or certain idealogies do not make absolute truth claims. By the very fact of having a particular religion, or idealogy, you are standing by a certain truth claim on the nature of reality, that by default, and the law of non-contradiction, states that any other truth claim in direct contradiction is false and wrong.</p>
              <p>All religions, even Buddhism cannot get by without making truth claims on the nature of reality. Buddhism is hardly all-accepting, it pushes a particular perspective of reality that by default contradicts the truth claims put forward by other idealogies and religions and by logical extension... are already claiming that they are false.</p>
              <p>The problem is not who is right or wrong, that is a different debate. The problem is how people who believe their way is right CANNOT engage those who do not share their views in a sensitive and fair way that treats others with respect.</p>
              <p>For example if you somehow believe
                  it's safe to cross the road while a truck is speeding down it and I try
                  to tell you that you will die if you jaywalk and get hit by the truck,
                  I am not cursing you to die or being a bigot. If I go about it by telling others how stupid you are to jaywalk and the like then I am being insensitive and tactless, but not factually wrong on the matter.</p>
              <p><br>So I am sorry Rooney9, but you are missing the whole point of the issue.</p>
