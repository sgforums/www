              <p>yes he is not sincere. he was being forced to apologised, because this issue has been reported in the media. but deep down inside, he is incorrigible. he still reckoned that other religions are satanic and false.</p>

              <p>i wonder did the buddhist leader master kwang sheng taught him some basic buddhism knowledge and correct his misconceptions when he went to his buddhist temple to apologise. sometimes i do not know whether to blame rony or not because he might be the victim himself who was brainwashed by someone else. who knows.</p>

              <p>That is your decision, your perspective but does not mean everyone has to follow suit.  Each has their own considerations and it is not too much for non christians to expect christians to call their god or deity such.    Hope you do not impose your point of views on the non christians.</p>
              <p>YOU are wrong, it is not Confucius who said that - it is Jesus who said that.</p>
              <p>Instead of focusing on the non believers you should go ask Rony and all other christians not to say such to the non believers who believe in other religions.    What about people saying you are a wife beater when you are not????  Same applies to this.</p>

              <h1>LEAKED: Email from Lighthouse Evangelism rallying its members in support of Pastor Rony Tan</h1>
              <p><span class="time">February 13, 2010 - Temasek Review</span></p>
              <p><span class="time">
              </span></p><p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>In the aftermath of the Rony Tan fiasco, many Singaporeans have been wondering whether he is really sincere about his apologies or that he was forced to apologize under pressure from the ISD.</p>
              <p>Lighthouse Evangelism Pastor Rony Tan was hauled up by the ISD for questioning on Monday over the disparaging remarks he made about Buddhism and Taoism during a church session which was video-recorded and widely circulated in cyberspace.</p>
              <p>Though police reports had been lodged against him, no action was taken except a warning from the ISD. Many netizens opined that he was let off too easily given his position to influence thousands of people.</p>
              <p>Besides Pastor Tan, do other members of his Church share his misinformed views about Buddhism and Taoism? It is chilling that none of them have stepped forward to denounce his remarks yet. Neither did leaders of the other Churches do so.</p>
              <p>A reader tipped us off with an email sent by Lighthouse Evangelism to mobilize its members to rally in support of Pastor Rony Tan:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/lighthousemail585.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="473"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The email revealed that Pastor Rony will be giving his statement at the Miracle Service on 13 February and urged concerned Church members to come and rally behind their “beloved” Pastor. It also advised members to refrain speaking to the press at the Service.</p>
              <p>Given the size of Pastor Rony’s congregation and the influence he wields on them, it is little wonder that the authorities dare not take serious action against him.</p>
              <p>To quote from The straits Times:</p>
              <p><strong>“A well-established Christian leader being charged under the Sedition Act would send shockwaves through the Christian community and put the community under siege.”</strong></p>
              <p>But wouldn’t a well-established Christian leader mocking other religions pose a far greater threat to social harmony in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Pastor Rony Tan doesn’t deserve any support from his church members. He had made an atrocious mistake and he should retract his statements publicly, admit to his congregation that he had misled them by misrepresenting Buddhism and Taoism and resigned gracefully from his position in Lighthouse Evangelism.</p>
              <p>In fact, all the other pastors should also distance themselves from Pastor Rony’s remarks and condemned them in no uncertain terms. That is the only way to assure anxious and worried Singaporeans that Pastor Rony has indeed learnt his lesson and he will not repeat the mistake ever again.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <h1>LEAKED: Email from Lighthouse Evangelism rallying its members
              in support of Pastor Rony Tan</h1>
              <p><span>February 13, 2010 - Temasek Review</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Written by Our
              Correspondent</strong></span></p>
              <p>In the aftermath of the Rony Tan fiasco, many Singaporeans have
              been wondering whether he is really sincere about his apologies or
              that he was forced to apologize under pressure from the ISD.</p>
              <p>Lighthouse Evangelism Pastor Rony Tan was hauled up by the ISD
              for questioning on Monday over the disparaging remarks he made
              about Buddhism and Taoism during a church session which was
              video-recorded and widely circulated in cyberspace.</p>
              <p>Though police reports had been lodged against him, no action was
              taken except a warning from the ISD. Many netizens opined that he
              was let off too easily given his position to influence thousands of
              people.</p>
              <p>Besides Pastor Tan, do other members of his Church share his
              misinformed views about Buddhism and Taoism? It is chilling that
              none of them have stepped forward to denounce his remarks yet.
              Neither did leaders of the other Churches do so.</p>
              <p>A reader tipped us off with an email sent by Lighthouse
              Evangelism to mobilize its members to rally in support of Pastor
              Rony Tan:</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/lighthousemail585.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="473"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The email revealed that Pastor Rony will be giving his statement
              at the Miracle Service on 13 February and urged concerned
              Church members to come and rally behind their “beloved”
              Pastor. It also advised members to refrain speaking to the press at
              the Service.</p>
              <p>Given the size of Pastor Rony’s congregation and the influence
              he wields on them, it is little wonder that the authorities dare
              not take serious action against him.</p>
              <p>To quote from The straits Times:</p>
              <p><strong>“A well-established Christian leader being charged under
              the Sedition Act would send shockwaves through the Christian
              community and put the community under siege.”</strong></p>
              <p>But wouldn’t a well-established Christian leader mocking other
              religions pose a far greater threat to social harmony in
              Singapore?</p>
              <p>Pastor Rony Tan doesn’t deserve any support from his church
              members. He had made an atrocious mistake and he should
              retract his statements publicly, admit to his congregation that he
              had misled them by misrepresenting Buddhism and Taoism and resigned
              gracefully from his position in Lighthouse Evangelism.</p>
              <p>In fact, all the other pastors should also distance themselves
              from Pastor Rony’s remarks and condemned them in no uncertain
              terms. That is the only way to assure anxious and worried
              Singaporeans that Pastor Rony has indeed learnt his lesson and he
              will not repeat the mistake ever again.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>No, his arrest would not send "shockwaves" through the Christian community.  I'm willing to wager that even the rest of the pastors from Singapore's churches would agree that Rony Tan has gone too far and been too insensitive.</p>
              <p>And no, the ISD would still arrest him despite the size of his church.  The ISD won't "fear" that this guy has "too large a congregation" to offend.  That is tantamount to saying ISD will not carry out its counter-terrorism duties because terrorists can be everywhere and are so dangerous. </p>
              <p>I'm sure that the ISD officers had a good word with him about his seditious remarks before letting go back to publish an official apology.  Honestly, some of you guys may have this misconception that an interview with the ISD over a matter like this is about having tea or coffee and a nice chit-chat. I think not. =)</p>
