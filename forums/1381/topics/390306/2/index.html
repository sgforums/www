Throughout the internet space, you find forum threads and articles of people mocking Christianity and challenging the teachings of Christianity openly and freely. I don't see why the pastor can't state his views in the privacy of his own church to a willing audience?</p></div>

              <p>from my first day here in sgf till now, and comparing the amount of times members of other religions got attached by christans, you are right, its kinda annoying christans like to portray themselves as victims when they are the one who incite such provocations</p>
              <p>even the ones who agree such actions are wrong also shrugged their shoulders and adopt a apathetic attitude</p>
              <p>hence it always look like non christans who are flaming christans but i think we have to defend ourselves lest we get taken over, just like what happened in AWARE</p>

              religion and all related stuff is a debatable theology. These are

                  really, there are as many people criticising
                  Christianity as compared to Christians criticising other
                  religions.. In fact, i don't even remember any Christian

              <p>Centuries ago, you will be executed for being a heretic by denouncing Christianity or just being a non-believer in Europe...lol?!</p>
              <p>And I'm not comparing what he said to Islamic extremists, it's about your view on his speech.</p>
              <p>Well, I do experienced Christians getting all worked up and hostile when I challenged the teachings of Christianity. Funny that you don't, since you're posting in here.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>An Italian, a Scotsman, and a Chinese fellow were hired at a construction site. The foreman pointed out a huge pile of sand and told the Italian guy, "You're in charge of sweeping." To the Scotsman he said, "You're in charge of shoveling." And to the Chinese guy, "You're in charge of supplies."</p>
              <p>He then said, "Now, I have to leave for a little while. I expect you guys to make a dent in that there pile."</p>
              <p>The foreman went away for a of couple hours, and, when he returned, the pile of sand was untouched. He asked the Italian, "Why didn't you sweep any of it?" The Italian replied, "I no hava no broom. You said to the Chinese fella that he a wasa in a charge of supplies, but he hasa disappeared and I no coulda finda him nowhere." Then the foreman turned to the Scotsman and said, "And you, I thought I told you to shovel this pile."</p>
              <p>The Scotsman replied, "Aye, ye did lad, boot ah couldnay get meself a shoovel! Ye left th' Chinese gadgie in chairge of supplies, boot ah couldnay fin' him either." The foreman was really angry by now and stormed off toward the pile of sand to look for the Chinese guy.</p>
              <p>Just then, the Chinese guy jumped out from behind the pile of sand and yelled... <br><br>"SUPPLIES!!"</p>
