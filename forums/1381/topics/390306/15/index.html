              <p>You are creating a diversification of the Pastor cause of action into a reglious attack and discrimination.I believe Jason will be contacted probably email / phone<img alt=""> and retrieved back all those deleted thread topic.You are just a ring leader starting from those deleted posting thread and now back to Pastor Rony cause of action.Anyway your nick is mentioned as i reported and the case will be refer to Internal Security Department (ISD) for making insensitive remarks.Good luck with all your comments and once i am back to Singapore i believe some others and probably involving you will be dealt with</p>

              <p>First time I encountered him was at Speakers' Corner.  He insisted the news from Asiaone not credible, only when it is out in Straits Times then it is credible.   The news I posted in SC was about HDB requesting landlord to inform HDB about their rental of rooms.     Wonder how one is so ignorant not to know that Asiaone is related to STraits Times or he is simply doing it deliberately for thread to be removed.  Because of that the thread was removed.    </p>
