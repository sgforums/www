              <p>I felt that this type of preaching is detrimental to Singapore's
              religious harmony. Some of the people here in the forum are really
              looneys and are generally not taken serious. However Pastor Rony is
              a religious leader and one whose words are taken seriously and
              literally. Saying bad words about other religions provoke bad
              feelings, segregate the people and people can become emotional and
              more extreme. Maybe the authority should be informed of this</p>

              <h1>ISD called up Lighthouse Evangelism Pastor Rony Tan over his remarks about Buddhism</h1>
              <p><span class="time">February 9, 2010</span></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Lighthouse Evangelism founder and Senior Pastor Rony Tan had received a phone call from the Internal Security Department (ISD) about his comments made about Buddhism and Taoism during a church session. It is not known if he had been called up for questioning.</p>
              <p>Pastor Tan was seen interviewing a former Buddhist monk and nun and making disparaging remarks about the central tenets of Buddhism such as reincarnation, meditation and nirvana.</p>
              <p>The sessions were video-recorded and posted on the official website of Lighthouse Evangelism which were subsequently uploaded to Youtube and other blogs and forums.</p>
              <p>It sparked an outcry on Hardwarezone forum when the videos were first posted on 3 February 2010 with many netizens lampooning Pastor Tan for his insensitive remarks which appeared to have denigrated both Buddhism and Taoism.</p>
              <p>According to a report on Channel News Asia, <span>ISD told Pastor Tan that in “preaching or proselytising his faith, he must not run down other religions, and must be mindful of the sensitivities of other religions” </span></p>
              <p><span>The Ministry of Home Affairs gave a brief statement that Pastor Tan’s comments werer highly “inappropriate and unacceptable as </span><span>they trivialised and insulted the beliefs of Buddhists and Taoists” which can also “</span><span>give rise to tension and conflict between the Buddhist/Taoist and Christian communities.”</span></p>
              <p><span>Pastor Tan has since issued a public apology on his website and expressed his deepest apologies and remorse over the matter:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>“I realized that my presentation and comments were wrong and offensive. So I sincerely apologize for my insensitivity towards the Buddhists and Taoists, and solemnly promise that it will never happen again,” </em>he wrote.</span><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>He gave his solemn promise that it will never happen again and has also affirmed that he will tell his members to respect other beliefs and build a harmonious Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>In May last year, a Senior Pastor from the Church of Our Saviour Derek Hong issued a public apology</span><span> “for using the pulpit to give backing to the Association of Women for Action and Research’s (AWARE) executive committee in their dispute with the group’s previous leadership”, but the ISD was not involved then.</span></p>
              <p><span>This incident marked the first time in many months that the ISD has made a “public appearance”. The ISD is a secretive organization in Singapore whose officers are seldom seen or heard in public. </span></p>
              <p><span>Under the draconian Internal Security Act, anybody deemed a “threat” to Singapore can be detained up to two years without trial. The ISA was used in the early days to detain suspected communists, but is used sparingly now against terrorists. </span></p>
              <p><span>Despite Pastor Tan’s apology, some netizens remain unsatisfied and wanted the authorities to take action against him while others continue to doubt his sincerity to “repent”.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hardwarezone forumer<strong> Fulaien</strong> wrote:</span></p>
              <p><em><span id="intelliTXT">“I dun think its the emails that make him apologise. Its the phone call from ISD” </span></em></p>
              <p><span><strong>Laopokcar</strong> didn’t seem pleased with the apology either:</span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></p>
              <p><em><span id="intelliTXT">“Far from being closed, I think the apology has sparked some discontent about him getting away with just a warning, may not be the same exact issue, but it is definitely far from being closed.”</span></em></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>
              <p><strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></p>
              <p><em>The Temasek Review welcomes Pastor Rony Tan’s apology and we urge netizens to forgive him and let the matter rest. We shall respect the wishes of Pastor Tan and remove the video clips from our website.</em></p>

              church by pastor rony.</p>
              <p>I went there before to talk to 1 of the female pastor about a

              <p>She prayed for me and ask me to leave down my name and number
              and she will get her secretary(which was beside her at that time)
              to contact me in future to find out the progress of my problem.</p>
              <p>5 days later she indeed call me and her voice was very soft on
              the phone. Talk like a ant like that. I was outside and I couldn't
              hear her very clear.</p>
              <p>She say she will call me back later but until now few months
              already also never call me.</p>
