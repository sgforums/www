              <p>I have taken note of your action to AEN.     YOu are trying to suppress religious freedom.  You talk about christianity, other christians including Rony  talk about Christianity, tell me why is it that AEN cannot talk about buddhism?   Is this oppression?   Oppression is a sin as stated in the bible.  I will investigate on you.    I already have forumers told me how nasty you are so I need not say much about your evil doing.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore police sends veiled threat to anonymous netizens posting on the internet</strong></p>
              <p>12 Feb 2010</p>
              <p>Written by Our Correspondent</p>
              <p>Embarrassed by its latest flip-flop in letting the three Singapore Polytechnic students off with only a caution for posting racist remarks on Facebook, the Singapore police now sends a veiled threat to anonymous netizens posting on the internet:</p>
              <p>In a brief statement released to the press yesterday, it said:</p>
              <p>“The three boys have since apologised for their actions and the offensive online page and forum removed. Police would like to remind the public that it takes a serious view of acts that can threaten the social harmony in Singapore. This includes those who do so hiding behind a shroud of anonymity afforded by the Internet.”</p>
              <p>The three were arrested almost immediately following a police report lodged against them by a National Serviceman Mr Prhabagaran who has said that he did not want to see them jailed.</p>
              <p>In the aftermath of the arrests which sent shockwaves across cyberspace, the Commander of Bedok Police Division and Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Teo Chun Ching said:</p>
              <p><em>“Police take a very stern view of acts that could threaten the social harmony in Singapore. The Internet may be a convenient medium to express one’s views but members of the public should bear in mind that they are no less accountable for their actions online.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times, 4 February 2010]</strong></p>
              <p>However, when police reports were lodged against Lighthouse Evangelism Senior Pastor Rony Tan for making disparaging remarks about Buddhism and Taoism a week later, the police did not arrest him as what they did to the three Chinese youths.</p>
              <p>Instead, he was hauled up for questioning by the ISD and let off with a slap on the wrist after he apologized to representatives from the Buddhist and Taoist faiths.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>With due respect to ACP Teo, the greatest threat to social harmony in Singapore <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not come from anonymous netizens who have little credibility or influence</span>,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> but from religious leaders like Pastor Tan who commands a loyal following</span>.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is religious leaders who should bear in mind the fact that they are no less accountable for their actions though they are well-established leaders in their respective communities</span>.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In fact, they should be held on to a higher standard precisely because they are in a position of authority to influence others</span></span></strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The racist remarks made by the three Chinese youths have little impact on the rest of Singapore compared to the outrage triggered by Pastor Tan’s words: who is a greater threat to social harmony in Singapore?</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Singapore police should not pick on “small fries” like anonymous netizens which will make them appear no better than good for nothing bullies. They should target the real culprits who are generating social tension and conflicts in Singapore with their irresponsible, divisive and offensive remarks.</p>
              <p>The “release” of the three youths is nothing more than a political move to appease angry Singaporeans and doesn’t change the fact that Pastor Rony Tan was spared the punishment he deserved under the law because:</p>
              <p><strong>“A well-established Christian leader being charged under the Sedition Act would send shockwaves through the Christian community and put the community under siege.”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times, 12 February 2010]</strong></p>
