              sensitive issue. This is also the reason if it could be minimized, it should be minimized - to bloat it could lead to religious hatred - and no one could helm this as that is even dangerous. Once it has been quieted down and he has been warned, it should be and let things go, but to
              be monitored and to step up harsher further if this is repeated again.</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></span><span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></span></p>

              the media can be used constructively to broadcast on the golden rule – the
              ethics of reciprocity. By continuing to hurl against a wrongdoer, we are as
              much the same ourselves. Likewise, it is a great war motto not to be inhumane toward the Prisoners of Wars...another is the crimes committed by American soldiers towards Iranian captives..</span></span></p>

              do their own things and live their own lives or dwell in their world of beliefs
              so long as it does not encroach viciously or slanderously towards others.</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></span><span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>

              religion is its historical inability to convince their followers that the ethic
              of reciprocity applies to ALL humans, not merely to persons like
              themselves.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>

              <p>All religions started at the same point, and are largely a response to human fear. When the first humans came about, they do not know how the universe is the way it is, and hence came up with many answers through religion, and also used religion to surpress fellow people by making up the concept of hell and heaven, and even karma to control people to do good instead of bad for their group's own benefit. It had also been known that the neanderthals had a belief system, and they believed in the afterlife and some God.</p>

              From: Good News Bible (Today's English Version)
              
              Matthew 17:12 "But I tell you that Elijah has already come and people did not recognize him, but treated him just as they pleased. In the same way they will also ill-treat the Son Of Man."
              
              Matthew 17:13 Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. 
              
              Matthew 11:14 and if you are willing to believe their message, John is Elijah, whose coming was predicted.
              
              Is it not clear enough that even Jesus talked about reincarnation?
