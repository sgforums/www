              <p>Please do not put your thought into people mindset of what you think you is the right path.I believed what you pursuing is obtaining self righteousness displaying you are on the right path.The greatest of all is to love people and forgive them for wrong doing inspite of speaking the truth yet presenting it in a wrong ways.I love the Pastor having the courage admit his wrong doing and make an apologize to the affected parties.Only carnal people want the justification and the penalty for a mistake he made since he already made an amendment.</p>

              <p>Problem I feel sometimes, especially in the modern evangelical movement is this need to try to control what the members think. It's an extremely disturbing trend.</p>
              <p>In my previous church, there was a very strong thought police in action. Just about hint that you thought different was reason enough to earn the disapproval or alienation of the group, and they'll constantly try to make life difficult for you, simply by being of the belief that since you thought differently on an issue, you were somehow less important then those.</p>
              <p>So no, I am not too surprised such an attitude would carry on to other things.</p>

              <p>Going by this forum alone most xtians are on defensive mode or
              being apathetic, and its a defensive sort of apathy where they
              would say the approach is wrong, big bro is watching or they would
              just chide anyone flaming the pastor like wacky sung here</p>
              <p>Flaming other religion is wrong in all sense, doesnt matter
              whats the approach or whether anyone is watching or what</p>
              <p>Its frustrating to see the reaction from xtians are less than

              <p>what truth? you, rony and joseph are the same, know nothing about buddhism. go and read  up before you said rony said about buddhism is truth.</p>
              <p>1) buddhism advise their followers how to change their fate and not submit to fate but that joseph said differently.</p>
              <p>2) buddha did not say  he was still searching for the way before he passed away but that rony said buddha said that.</p>
