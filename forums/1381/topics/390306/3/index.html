              <p>Pastor Rony calls Buddhism rubbish, demonic, false religion,
              craps, satanic, blind leading the blind and many more ~<br> <br> Is this what we call religious tolerance in SIngapore? Can we let
              him get away with this?</p>

              <p>Umm, hello people , this is nothing new, typical of christians to say and behave such.   As a ex christian I know what they are taught.    In christianity, other than worship God, worship others are considered satanic.     To christians a lot of things can be satanic.  Yoga is satanic, japanese floral arrangement is satanic, gongfu is satanic, fortune telling is satanic, and the list goes on, the list is endless.</p>
              <p>Rony's church is Lighthouse at Tampines which is well known for healing.   I respect some christians but not all christians.   For people like Rony and many other christians who condemn other religions I don't respect.    They are full of bullcrap.   It is arrogance that motivates them to say and behave such.</p>
              <p>So people, if you wanna accept christianity do take your time to explore more into it before going ahead.   I did not allow myself to find out more about it. </p>
              <p>Before I read this, actually I hold high regard of him for I heard how good he was.   Now , not any more</p>

              <p>I think he has the right to say whatever he wants in his church, it is a private not public compound. Moreover the audience chose to sit there and listen out of their own freewill, if they don't like what they hear, they can always leave, nobody is forcing them to stay and listen isn't it? Also, i don't think he is inciting anything against buddhism, merely stating his views about the concepts of buddhism. Why doesn't anyone say anything when people mock the teachings of Christianity about eternal life in Jesus Christ but start a big hoo-haa when Christians raise doubts about other religion's teachings? Double standards or hypocritical? ^.-</p>

              <p>I felt that this type of preaching is detrimental to Singapore's
              religious harmony. Some of the people here in the forum are really
              looneys and are generally not taken serious. However Pastor Rony is a
              religious leader and one whose words are taken seriously and literally.
              Saying bad words about other religions provoke bad feelings, segregate
              the people and people can become emotional and more extreme. Maybe the
              authority should be informed of this</p>
