              <p>I think he has the right to say whatever he wants in his church, it is a private not public compound. Moreover the audience chose to sit there and listen out of their own freewill, if they don't like what they hear, they can always leave, nobody is forcing them to stay and listen isn't it? Also, i don't think he is inciting anything against buddhism, merely stating his views about the concepts of buddhism. Why doesn't anyone say anything when people mock the teachings of Christianity about eternal life in Jesus Christ but start a big hoo-haa when Christians raise doubts about other religion's teachings? Double standards or hypocritical? ^.-</p>

              <p><br>at least they don't call christianity devilish like how chrsitians call other religions satanic? Moreover he's a pastor, a religious leader,what kind of impact do u think it has and have u ever come across another religion leader making this kind of speech. I thought sunday service is to focus on Gospel and own faith instead of criticizing others? What kind of church is this do you say, and he's obviously flaming other religions without getting the facts right. Freedom of speech you say, how about accusations and deflamations.</p>

              <p>It's not that we never tried changing their mindset, but probably u can try talking to some christians and your words can't even enter in a slight manner.

              <p>The bible is not meant to be interpreted literally or bluntly. If everything they interpret literally that means we are all having incest with our brothers and sisters because Adam and eve are our parents all of us are blood related .LOL</p>
