              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>A friend of mine told me an interesting testimony he heard in a
                                      mega church he attend. It touches the heart of 18,000
                                      people.....and the testimony goes something like this :</p>
              <p>A woman (who recently lost her husband - I think) received a
                                      letter from a bank stating that she has an outstanding housing loan
                                      of more than $300,000.00. She could not service her loan....</p>
              <p>After coming to the church for prayer, she received a letter
                                      from the bank stating that <strong>she do not owe them any
                                      money!</strong> She showed the bank the earlier letter but the bank
                                      says they could not locate details of her loan with the bank.</p>
              <p>After discussion, the bank collected a token of $ 10,000.00 from
                                      her and allow that to be paid by interest free installment.</p>
              <p>After paying off the $ 10,000.00, the bank wrote to her again to
                                      confirmed that her loan was cleared and they are crediting $
                                      50,000.00 plus interest bank to her CPF account! (for reasons
                                      nobody knows).....</p>
              <p>The whole congregation was moved by "the mercy of God" whom they
                                      beleived have "cancelled" her debts.</p>
              <p>They all believed that this is true (It must be since it is a
                                      testimony in church) as the letters are shown on the screen.</p>
              <p>When I asked what bank this was? The answer was the name of the
                                      bank was covered up.</p>
              <p>Can any logical person think such things happen to a bank in
                                      Singapore?</p>
              <p>I wonder why and how such testimony was allowed in the church.
                                      Have the church leaders verified that this is a true case?</p>
              <p>Do the church leaders believed that this is a miracle by God
                                      ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would be nice if someone who heard this testimony will help
                                      explain...</p>

              <p>When listening or giving testimony we must realise one thing: God does not contradict himself.</p>
              <p>If one is rescued from one's predicament at the expense of something else, one can safely conclude that it is not God.</p>
              <p>It's like a story I heard sometime back..... a girl was rescued from being raped and murdered by two thugs because there were two angels guarding her home. The thugs then went on and rape and murder some other girl.</p>

              <p>It is quite difficult if a congregation decide to have the a-testimony-a-week session. There is censorship in such matters and any attempt to control or check can be seen as an attempt to prevent God from working.</p>
              <p>In some churches, pastors, too are over-zealous in such claims and, yes, it annoys me no end because of the irresponsible and unbiblical claims of these people.</p>
              <p>One time, one lady went up to the sanctuary and claimed that God had told here that a man with a travelling job in the congregation is having an affair. But she gives no names. How do you think folks like me, who have a travelling job look? Some of us just looked at each other and went, "what the heck was that?"</p>
              <p>Also many churches have very young impressionable Christians who will accept everything at face value, and merge these claims with their own, probably, non-theological understanding of scripture and come up with conclusions that will make themselves happy.</p>

I'm not saying that people who do such thing as proclaiming to hear God speaks to them are surely false prophets or suffering from delusional illness but I just can't help feeling that <strong>it is best to approach the individual rather than acting to show off that they knew</strong> which makes it seems more likely that what they're telling is not true because it left so many suspicions. <strong>To think that the Holy spirit would raise suspicions instead of harmony is very unlikely</strong>. In event where people are healed it's okay to speak to the crowd like what the Carmelites do here in Jakarta in Mass healing and adoration sessions. But for other than good news or personal stuffs it's best to approach the individual so that he understood that God cares for what he has done and He knows thus making the person more repentable. As for the reason that God didn't specifiy who exactly well that's kind of odd surely because from my own experience God do tell a tell tale who that person is or at least in what direction he's standing at the moment thus you would be able to know who the person is. But I realize it's different for everyone so...</p>
              <p>Back to topic,</p>
              <p>In many cases I've heard and read when God gives help the amount of money would be no less or more than what was needed(I haven't read nor heard surplus God send). Either that or the timing could not be better or both. It's not always about money. It could be food for example where the amount of food pack exactly matches that of the attending congregation. <strong>The source of these wonderful gifts are always known/that of man</strong>. Be it a long time past friend, church-friend, distant contact or could be your own neigbors. In the end it also needs faith to believe these are genuinely God send. Because you could always cry "coincidence" or "what a lucky stroke". These are also mostly come as a response to prayer but not always the case. But always there's some kind of hopelessness in every case that without these lucky intervention nothing could be done.</p>

              <p>The most outstanding testimony I've heard is that when this family went bankrupt and had to sell their only home. A stranger bought the house and gave it back to them!!!. The stranger plainly told them that God asked him to give the house to her family so he did. Well he didn't give the house back immediately but he let the family stayed in the house for about a year or so without paying for rent. After a year or so he then gave the house back to that family.</p>
              <p>Why God never give me a Ferrari or two?? LOL</p>

              <p>The point is.....the church should not allow any testimony unless they are convinced that they are true......</p>
              <p>Maybe a person who is terminally sick (with medical proof) and was cured by prayers from whoever and medically proved that is recovered, by all means sing praises to God in church.</p>
              <p>But stories such as this should not even be allowed unless they are proven. If so, we like to know which bank did God cheated? Will MAS or the bank investigate and let us know that indeed there was a miracle? Absurb right?</p>

              <p>You are talking about different things. Wealth is about money or assets. It's how you make use of the wealth that's entrusted to you.</p>

              <p>You missed the point.....the point is cheating is not right and nothing can justify that. If you says thou shall not commit murder and murder and killing is different, then, you are saying it is ok to kill someone but not murder. Just playing with words. At the end, it is the same thing.</p>
              <p>It is going to be hard to argue about soldiers killing enemies in the battle field (which is not the point here) but the Church is dead against going to war for any reason - same as Christ's teaching - to love your neighbour.</p>
              <p>In this case, it is about "making money disappear from the bank".....if you own the shares of that bank, you are being cheated - right ?</p>
              <p>God never contradict himself and will never ever do anything that is wrong.  That is the point. Any if the church allow questionable testimony, I think this raise some questions about that Church or it's leaders too - right ?</p>

              <p><br>we need to go back to the needs and purposes of testimonies.</p>
              <p>testimonies are not there for folks to do the on-up on others. testimonies are firstly suppose to be personal experiences. if i were to go on the sanctuary to testify that God save my life because a runaway car just missed me by an inch.... fine....</p>
              <p>but, if i were to go there to impose my spiritual understand to others and want others to do the same.... then there will be issues... even though i may claim that God "spoke" through me....</p>

              <p>Chin Eng,</p>
              <p>Perhaps, you missed the point somehow....I am not against giving testimony. If you says you are missed by a runaway car by an inch and you believed that it was God's grace that saved you, I don't see what's wrong.</p>
              <p>Going back to the main issue of this thread. The fact is that such a thing happened in Singapore....anyone who has taken a loan with any bank will know that there are proper documentations....in case of a housing loan, there are title deeds filed with governmemt agencies, income tax etc..... Do you really think it can happen?</p>
              <p>How did $300,000.00 disappear from the bank? What happen to the banking system, government agencies etc..?</p>
              <p>With God everything is possible but.....God don't cheat.....</p>
              <p>Another point of thought....will God be in cahoot with anyone to make legitimate money disappear from the bank? In this case, the woman's gain is at the expense of someone else.....the bank and their shareholders....right? God will never cheat and go contradict his own teachings.</p>
              <p>The most important point is, why did the church allow such a highly suspected testimony in the first place? Of course they know before hand as the letter was projectedd on screen. Perhaps, they are author of this testimony? I don't know and hopping someone who knows more about this will shed some light.....</p>
              <p>Testimony are personal experiences with God but it's the responsibility of the church and it's leaders to ensure that suspected testimony are not allowed......and highly controversial ones are not allowed. And if they allow it, they must at least have verified it.</p>
              <p>Trust this make sense.</p>
