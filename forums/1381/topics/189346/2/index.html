            <div class='col-md body'>Messianic Jews? I not sure it is exactly precise to call Messianic Jews Christians... for they might not follow the apostle creed at all.<br><br>So was the apostle Paul a Messianic Jew or a Christian? I do believe that God still holds several promises for the Jews as His chosen people, so even if they were Christians they would not be of your 'typical' consideration.<br><br>But it might be nitpicking over labels yet again, a swatting of words and terms that are often more trouble to the attention, as opposed to the real issues that we should really be thinking about.<br><br>But I think we share the same salvation.</div>
