              <p><span>SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT</span>…................</p>
              <p>The christian, muslim….etc alike, always defend that any verses talking about violence and evil acts in their holy books should not be taken literally and must be understood in context. They always say that these verses are not encouraging violence or evil, but rather just as metaphors for something good.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I have never heard them saying that those verses talking about good and nice things must be interpreted with care.</p>
              <p>The <span>BIG QUESTION</span> here is that could the bad verses are in reality meant to be taken literally, while the good verses are to be understood as just metaphor only.</p>
              <p>I have also often heard these people saying that non-christian and non-muslim…etc have intentionally taken the evil verses out of context with the aim to mis-represent the holy book.</p>
              <p>Another <span>BIG QUESTION</span> is that is it also equally true that the christians and….etc are taking the good verses out of their context in order to project a good image of their religions.</p>
              <p>It seems to me that for these people Bad things cannot be taken literally and out of context, but Good things can be taken literally and out of context.</p>
              <p>The <span>KEY MESSAGE I</span> want to make is that the holy books of these Godly religions can be moulded into whatever forms that satisfy their religious ego. <span>HENCE</span>, we <span>MUST NOT BELIEVE</span> in them when christians …..etc try to convince you that their God is a loving one by quoting some sound-nice verses from their holy books.</p>
              <p>hahahhhahhha….................hehehhehheeeeeeeeeeeeee</p>

              <p><strong>- </strong>Good point! </p>
              <p><strong>The <span>KEY MESSAGE I</span> want to make is that the holy books of these Godly religions can be moulded into whatever forms that satisfy their religious ego. <span>HENCE</span>, we <span>MUST NOT BELIEVE</span> in them when christians …..etc try to convince you that their God is a loving one by quoting some sound-nice verses from their holy books.</strong></p>
              <p>To be christians is to boost God's ego.   Praise , praise, praise!</p>
              <p>Bible is meant to tailor to the "needs" of christians and God.     Much is claimed it is holy and from God, what is really the truth nobody knows.</p>

              <p>hey TS, let me give you my frank opinions on god religion, whether single god or many god ie monotheism or polytheism, they are the same basically.</p>
              <p>first  you need to recognise that god concept almighty being were created by ancient man. why? cos man from earlier era, esp stone age, reckoned that there must be a god, otherwise who control the seasons, day and night, natural diasters, sun, moon, rains etc. they did not know as we now know that these are natural phenomenon, simply put nature. so that time, they worshipped sun, moon, trees, wind, rivers and lakes and so forth. when natural diasters happened, they thought that god was punishing them, maybe they were not devout enough or need sacrifises, hence sacrifises of animals and even babies and human beings in the name of the god began. so when  man were able to read and write, they wrote it in the holy books as commandments and stories.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's just take one verse. Look at the verse BELOW.</p>
              <p>The verse below clearly shows that God is capable of sending a delusion which is also a lie. Simply put, he is capable of lying.</p>
              <p>So if you're saying that the verse isn't what it is as read, then are you saying </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The author of the bible got it wrong?</p>
              <p>2. There's a deeper meaning to "God sending a lie"? If there's a deeper meaning, then please tell me. You haven't explained anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What are you trying to say ? Please make yourself clear. Are you saying the author might be wrong or saying there's a deeper meaning. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Let me show you how your mind should be enquiring.</p>
              <p>"For this cause..." what is the cause?</p>
              <p>It was for that that "God shall send them  strong delusion".  What does this mean? You want to make it your meaning? That God want to lie to them, or will make them see things or believe things, or hallucinate, or dream, see visions. You need to see the preceeding paragraphs.</p>
              <p>"... that they should believe a lie." I can take this two ways, God shall send them a delusion as a punishment for believing a lie, or that God shall send them a delusion so that they can continue in their ways. Exactly what? again the whole story need to be know.</p>
              <p>Read and think, don't be hasty in judging.</p>
              <p>That would be the begining of wisdom.</p>

              <p>hey TS, let me give you my frank opinions on god religion, whether single god or many god ie monotheism or polytheism, they are the same basically.</p>
              <p>first  you need to recognise that god concept almighty being were created by ancient man. why? cos man from earlier era, esp stone age, reckoned that there must be a god, otherwise who control the seasons, day and night, natural diasters, sun, moon, rains etc. they did not know as we now know that these are natural phenomenon, simply put nature. so that time, they worshipped sun, moon, trees, wind, rivers and lakes and so forth. when natural diasters happened, they thought that god was punishing them, maybe they were not devout enough or need sacrifises, hence sacrifises of animals and even babies and human beings in the name of the god began. so when  man were able to read and write, they wrote it in the holy books as commandments and stories</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That is why there are findings which say that the 3 sister religions have their roots in paganism.</p>
              <p>Just need to google search and in youtube "Christianity and Paganism", "Islam and Paganism".</p>
              <p>Of course they will not agree. Bad things, don't agree. Good things, agree alot.</p>
