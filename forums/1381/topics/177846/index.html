            <div class='col-md body'>I hope this post will minister to those who find the work of our Savior as insufficient, that it needs to be supplemented by good works or that His sacrifice must be sequeled by another round of sacrifices whether in an bloody way or in an unbloody way.<br><br>I hope that this will also settle the question of whether salvation can be lost or not.<br><br><strong>One Eternal Sacrifice</strong><br><br>Hebrews 10:12: But when <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, </strong></span>"He sat down at the right hand of God,"<br><br>Hebrews 10:13: and since then has been waiting "until His enemies would be made a footstool for His feet."<br><br>Hebrews 10:14: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For by a single offering He has perfected for all time </strong></span>those who are sanctified.<br><br>JesusÂ’ sacrifice need not be repeated again and again and again. For that one sacrifice on the cross was good for all time. Whether time in the past, time in the present and time in the future.<br><br>Question1 Â“What is GodÂ’s basis that He can forgive sinners in the olden times before Calvary?Â”  Answer: the sacrifice of Jesus Christ which is effectual for all time. His death covered those sins committed in the first covenant (Hebrews 9:15). That means His sacrifice is the ultimate answer of the sins done and committed in the past.<br><br>Question2 Â“ What about those animal sacrifices they made, what was their purpose?Â”<br><br>Answer: Those sacrifices did not take away any of their sinsÂ…the sacrifices they made were only symbols that point forward to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Those sacrifices served only as shadows of the real sacrifice, who is Jesus Christ. In themselves they can never take away sins. Like any good teacher God used symbols, visual aids if you may, to teach them about the real thing.<br><br>Hebrews10: 1 Since the law has <strong>only a shadow</strong> of the good things to come and <strong>not the true form of these realities</strong>, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who approach.<br><br>10:2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased being offered, since the worshipers, cleansed once for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sin?<br><br>10:3 But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year.<br><br>10:4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.<br><br>The sacrifices made in the Old Testament did not and cannot take away sins, it serves only as a reminder to them that they are sinners. It serves as a visual aid to them of the coming sacrifice that can really once for all take away sins. The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, Jesus Christ.<br><br>An Old Testament worshipper might have said these words in his heart while offering a sacrifice: Â“Lord God, I know that I am a sinner in need of forgiveness, I make this sacrifice of a lamb to you, but you know Lord that my trust and confidence that my sins will be forgiven is not on this lamb but on a coming Savior that this sacrifice of mine only symbolize. I know He will come, I donÂ’t know when, but I know He will come, I donÂ’t know what He will look like but I know what He will do; He will make the ultimate sacrifice for my sins past, present and future.  And in Him alone Lord I trust.Â”<br><br>Continued...................................<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Question3 Â“What about my future sins?Â” WeÂ’ll look again at the text.<br><br>Hebrews 10:12: But when Christ had offered <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>for all time </strong></span>a single sacrifice for sins, "He sat down at the right hand of God,"<br><br>Is the future part of time? Yes. When one says: Â‘for all timeÂ’ does it include the future? Yes. Absolutely. In Greek, since the New Testament is written in Greek, the phrase Â“for all timeÂ” is actually just one word in Greek, Â“dihnekhÂ”, it means continually or perpetually, hence the King James version of the Bible translated it as:  Â“But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins <strong>for ever</strong>, sat down on the right hand of God;Â”<br><br>His sacrifice was good for all time and even beyond time reaching eternity. ThatÂ’s why the Bible teaches that His sacrifice brought eternal redemption or salvation.<br><br>Hebrews 9:12 He entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood, thus obtaining <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>eternal redemption. </strong></span><br><br>He has given Himself eternally. He truly loved sinners with an everlasting love. Â“I have loved you with an everlasting loveÂ” He says.<br><br>Returning to the topic, Question4 Â‘What is Jesus doing now, is He gearing up for another sacrifice on the cross?Â” Look at the text again.<br><br>Hebrews 10:12: But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, "<strong>He sat down at the right hand of God</strong>,"<br><br>Hebrews 10:13: and since then has been <strong>waiting </strong>"until His enemies would be made a footstool for His feet."<br><br>Hebrews 10:14: For by a single offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.<br><br>After He made a one eternal sacrifice on the cross, He sat down at the right hand of the Father, waiting till His enemies would be made a footsool  for His feet.<br><br>He is not preparing for another round of sacrifice of Himself that He will make again. No, He is now Â‘sittingÂ’ and Â‘waiting.Â’  Sitting at the right hand of God. The right hand of God actually is just a figure of speech for highest authority. It is actually just saying that Jesus is now in the place of highest authority over all the universe and created beings.<br><br>While Â‘sittingÂ’ here actually refers that His work of atoning for the sins of sinners is done and over. Not to be repeated again. In contrast to the priests in the Old Testament  who Â‘stand daily.Â’ The work of the priests in the Old Testament is to offer up sacrifices and in doing this they stand in front of the altar daily. It would help if we put verse 11 and 12 together.<br><br>10:11 And <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>every priest stands day after day</strong></span> at his service, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins. </strong></span><br><br>10:12 But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, "He <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sat</strong></span> down at the right hand of God,"<br><br>The priests stands daily for his work is never done,he needs to sacrifice again and again and again. Day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.  But after Jesus offered a once for all time sacrifice, He sat down at the place of highest authority for His sacrifice need not be repeated again and again. The 'sitting'  of our Lord [which is a figurative language] implies that His work of atonement was complete.<br><br>Aside from sitting at the right hand of God, Jesus is now waiting. Waiting for His enemies to be made under His footstool. To be the footstool of someone means to be defeated. Satan, sin, death and etc. have been defeated by the Sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. SatanÂ’s destiny is now settled he will be thrown in  the lake of fire along with sinners who refuse to repent and trust in the sacrifice of Jesus. Sin is finally dealt with. Sin will be taken away from this world in the New Earth and New Heaven to come. Death has been defeated. In the future all those who are Christ will be resurrected to a glorious eternity.<br><br>continued................................<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Question4 Why is Jesus now sitting and waiting, why is He not preparing for another sacrifice? Look at verse 14.<br><br>Hebrews 10:12: But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, "He sat down at the right hand of God,"<br><br>Hebrews 10:13: and since then has been waiting "until His enemies would be made a footstool for His feet."<br><br>Hebrews 10:14: For <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>by a single offering He has perfected for all time</strong></span> those who are sanctified.<br><br>Because of that one offering of His, perfected FOR ALL TIME are those who repent and trust in His work on the cross alone. We don't need to add anything to what's perfect. Because we don't improve on perfection, we stay satisfied in faith.<br><br>Concluding Questions<br><br>1)      Who did the work of perfecting for all time sinners? Jesus<br><br>2)      When did He do it? Way back in Calvary.<br><br>3)      Did He have any partner in doing it? No. I donÂ’t see anyone who died for the sins of sinners in Calvary, only Jesus.<br><br>4)      What more can a sinner do if Christ Jesus brought eternal redemption to the sinner? (Hebrews 9:12) Nothing but to trust alone on His all sufficient work on the cross.<br><br>As one hymn writer wrote:<br><br>Â“Nothing in my hand I bring<br><br>but simply to the cross I  cling.Â”<br><br></div>
