              <p>hi all. firstly, i would like to thank all how have actively responded to my 1st post regarding religious harmony. it was all very informative though not all see eye to eye with each other.(hey thats the fun part right?) by now, most who have read my replies will know i m not a believer of trinitarian doctrines. just by being so might have offended some users out there. however, i cannot blindy place my faith in sth that even leader class cannot explain clearly without addin words like primitive brain cant comprehend the magnificient God. what i strongly believe is the bible being an autobiography of God. he knows our limitations and therefore will not try to confuse us. for it is impt to know him quickly and clearly so that we may serve him instead of the wicked 1.</p>
              <p>today, i bring a controversial topic to discuss. in theology,archangel is the cheif or principal angel(some believe in 1 archangel.some believ in 9). perhaps the most famous AA is michael. this name means "who is like God". this name is very prestigious but it brings about 2 translations.</p>
              <p>1st, an entity who is Godlike</p>
              <p>2nd, it becomes a question in asking is anyone out there like a God</p>
              <p>again, not withstanding trinitarian doctrine, only JC is the obvious entity that deserves this name. can it be that michael is the prehuman JC and the resurrected JC?</p>
              <p>hope to generate some response that is informative... ^^</p>

              <p>hmm, i think of it this way.</p>
              <p>like in the bible, whenever God sends angels to give messages to his prophets, the prophet always address them as "Lord". not that they're calling the angels, God</p>
              <p>but the angels are God's messengers, so you talk to an angel, you're talking to God. think of it like a telephone?</p>
              <p>anyway.. maybe the name befits michael because he's so beautiful and full of majesty, there's no better way to describe him, after all, no one really saw God in His true essence, except maybe moses.</p>

              <p>yoz dd..i like the way u link angels to telephone. very good example. i dun tink even moses saw the true essence of God. if im not wrong he only saw the back of God rite? and even that, it was veiled by an angel rite?( kinda remind me of chow yun fatt in God of gamblers)</p>
              <p>but your point of michael being godlike is erm abit too small??even saying JC is like God is small as God has no equal. but only say JC is Godlike due to him being 1st and among all other creatures of God, knew God best.</p>

              <p>i forgot. i only know that anyone who saw God in His holiness, will just die, due to his sin. Only moses was allowed up mount sinai, and only moses was allowed into the tent of the tabanacle. He was God's best friend, if i remember the phrase correctly.</p>
              <p>JC is not "God-like" because He is God. JC.. is the Word of God, He wasn't a created creature like michael.</p>
              <p>Angels in all their glory, and power, are still created beings. I still think that michael's glory and splendor was so great, there was no better way than to describe him than to say God-like.</p>
              <p>God-like don't mean God, btw. it just means.. it's like God? a good imitation by comparison?</p>

              <p>btw can u use the quote option like i do?</p>
              <p>they died due to sin, which cannot stand God's glory. holiness and sin cannot be together, even for christians now, we can stand before God is only because our sin is continuously being washed away by the Blood of the Lamb. Or some say, forever been taken care of by Jesus' death on the cross. once and for all. same effect.</p>
              <p>but those who are in sin, are still doomed to perish.. because the soul who sins shall die..</p>
              <p>hmm, because you can't accept the trinity, that's why it seems.. complicated. and the result is that you can't recognise the truth about Jesus. =)</p>

              <p>also i'll have to apologise... if there are some things we cannot answer, because we are limited in knowledge ourselves. What we know about God, even at our best, is what God wants us to know about Him. I still believe that God's too great to be blueprinted =)</p>

              <p>actually. little ones ask without really caring about the answer. they just ask for the sake of asking, most of the time. if you've worked with children, you'll understand.</p>
              <p>but what i like about children is that if you love them, they will automatically love you back, and they will trust everything you say without questions.</p>
              <p>that's what Jesus is talking about.</p>

              <p>and interestingly, sometimes they ask irrelevant questions. which they don't need to know at that moment. =) i think God will reveal to us everything slowly by slowly, which.. is apart from salvation anyway. tts why.. salvation is by faith. it's a step of faith, regardless of the knowledge you acquired.</p>

              <p>not free. revising for exams. i'm taking the gamble that u're asking these questions because you are really searching God in your own walk (yes, even if you don't know Him, you're actually on a journey) and not because you want to pull a snowyfox =)</p>
              <p>if you're searching, then your search is impt to me too, and i'm more than happy to offer what i know to your search. =)</p>
