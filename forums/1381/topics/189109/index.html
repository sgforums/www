            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><strong>How do we know if we have true saving faith?</strong><br><br>Christ Jesus, the Lord and Savior came into the world to save sinners [1 Tim. 1:15]. He died for all sinners [Heb. 2:9, 1 John 2:2] that anyone who believes [trusts] in Him will have everlasting life [now in this world] the very moment he or she believes [trusts].<br>However, it doesnÂ’t necessarily mean that since the Savior died for us all that all of us are automatically saved. No. One must receive that salvation obtained by Him through faith [through trusting in that one all-sufficient sacrifice of His on the cross].<br><br>An incident happened in the life of the apostle Paul wherein a man stirred up in his spirit began to have this holy concern for the spiritual state of his soul asked Paul this question:<br><br>He brought them out and asked, Â“Sirs,<strong> what must I do to be saved</strong>?Â”<br>They replied, Â“<strong>Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will be saved</strong>, along with your entire household.Â” [Acts 16:30-31]<br><br>Notice the apostle did not say: Â“Ah donÂ’t worry about it. You are already saved. Christ died for youÂ….. you know.Â” None of that. Paul however, urged him to believe [trust] on the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved. Yes, Christ Jesus died for him but in order for him to obtain the salvation freely offered by Christ to sinners, he must receive it by faith. Christ died for all, so He offers His salvation to all. Man over the centuries have either accepted it or rejected it. You accept it by believing. You reject it by being unbelieving.<br><br>And you will ask: Â“So am I saved since I believe in Christ?Â” Yes, if your faith is genuine. Question is: Is your faith genuine? How will you know if itÂ’s genuine or spurious? The answer is: THE GENUINENESS OR SPURIOUSNESS OF YOU FAITH DEPENDS ON WHOM YOU PLACE YOUR FAITH ON. Faith is either true or false depending on the object of your faith.<br><br>Ask yourself these questions:<br><br>1)   Am I trusting in Christ alone [trusting on what He did on the cross alone] for salvation?<br><br>2)   Am I trusting, depending, relying on what can I do for Christ to be saved? Or am I trusting, depending, relying solely on what Christ has completely and permanently done for me in Calvary?<br><br>3) if you have been Â‘ledÂ’ to the Lord sometime before by someone through sinners prayer, ask yourself: when I prayed that prayer, was I trusting in the prayer I made to Christ or did I trust in Christ alone for salvation through that prayer?<br><br>The divine injunction my friend is: Â“Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will be savedÂ….Â”<br><br>True saving faithÂ’s sole object is the Lord Jesus Christ. Not Jesus and prayers [though we should be praying always after we are saved not in order to be saved]. Not Jesus and church attendance [though we should be faithful church attendees after we are saved not in order to be saved]. Not Jesus and good works [though we should be fruitful in doing good works after we are saved not in order to be saved]. Not Jesus and the 10 commandments [though we should manifest righteous lives after we are saved not in order to be saved].<br><br>Not Jesus and being nailed to the cross yourself during Holy Week time. JesusÂ’ crucifixion was enough and complete for all sins for all time. [From where i come from people are so sinfully religious. some of them volunter to be crucified on the cross. of course they use safe nails free from tetanus and etc. their motive is that they want to atone for their sins. An insult to Christ's all sufficient work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]<br><br>Are you solely trusting in Christ Jesus my friend [His person as Savior and His work on the cross in Calvary] to be saved? If yes, your faith is genuine. Praise God brother or sister!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Note: Acts 16:30-31. Does not teach salvation by representative proxy. No one can believe for others. Each of us must individually appropriate Christ's saving work through faith.<br><br>If you continue on reading to verse 34. Paul baptized all of the jailer's household because they all believed.</div>
