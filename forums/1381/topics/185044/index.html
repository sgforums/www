            <div class='col-md body'>I'll go first.<br><br>Ro 4:25 "who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification."<br><br>I was once a very materialistic young man. Money was my god. This continued until i was 18 years old. During this time i was brought under conviction of sin [which i did not know at that time]. I repented of my sins and i became a totally changed man.<br><br>I had this super desire for righteousness. It became my all-consuming passion to be perfectly righteous in the eyes of God. For five years, i worked so hard to be perfectly righteous until i found it an impossibility. I was so depressed that i could never be perfectly righteous. I found myself a helpless sinner in the eyes of God. I cried out to God to please stoop down to my level.<br><br>Until one night as i was reading Romans chapter 3 [ a chapter on righteousness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ], i can somehow sense someone guiding me as i was reading the verses. It's as if I knew what the next verse would say. This continued on until i reached chapter 4 verse 25.<br><br>There my quest for perfect righteousness was ended. It was in Christ Jesus' work on the cross that i became perfectly righteous in the eyes of God [praise God].. there i understood Christ work and it was there i first believed on Christ alone for salvation. Ohhh what ecstatic joy i experienced.........peace came into me like a flood. My mind kept on saying on and on: 'I'm a friend of God.............i am a friend of God'<br><br>I stood up and leaped for joy. So much joy and peace as the words: "I am friends with God..............I am friends with God kept on repeating in my mind without me deliberately thinking it.<br><br>Moments later i returned to my reading...............and the next verse said:<br><br>Romans 5:1 "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"<br><br>And a whole round of joy and peace embraced me again............i can sense God smiling at me for the first time in my life.......the joy was so ecstatic.....i felt i was taken to heaven for a nanosecond and back.<br><br>P.S. anyone looking for perfect righteousness?.............it's in Christ my friend.....place your trust in Him.<br><br>He is the Lord our righteousness.  Jeremiah 23:6<br><br></div>
