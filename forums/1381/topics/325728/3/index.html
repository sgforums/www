              <p>Ok my 2 cents is this.</p>
              <p>Going to church is a total waste of time.</p>
              <p>You basically sit there for 30min to 1hr just listening to the priest talking about history which is so close to being fiction.</p>
              <p>I think god would prefer you to use this time for social services or perhaps just spend this time with your family to increase your bonds, rather than listening to somethings that i guess majority of the participants can't understand.</p>
              <p>When i go to church, i see many people with their heads down, looking around unattentively or even sleeping. They are not wrong, the masses held are just way to boring. Today is the 21st century, yet the Vatican acts like as if it is still the Dark Ages, asking the church to do all those traditional stuffs which are meaningless and boring at the same time.</p>
              <p>Worshipping in churches is a want, not a must. Many want to be there for the camaderie and the group spirit. But it is not a neccessity.</p>

              <p>for my 2 cents now..it is written that fellow worshippers of the true God should congegate to worship God,to strengthen each other's faith and to help those who have fallen.</p>
              <p>now the things taught in church are not entirely useless like u said, nor is it entirely beneficial any longer as many have being twisted.and im talking about churches as a whole...the vatican itself is entirely on a different scale..too sensitive to discuss in this close minded society.</p>

              <p>What is written may not be true. You have to understand that the bible is not the <span style="color: #0000ff;">direct word</span> from god, but rather a <span style="color: #0000ff;">compliation</span> of what man presume god would say. You also have to take in<span style="color: #000000;"> the different factors like corruption and misleading which are weaknesses of man. These further lowers the quality and quantity of facts in the bible.</span></p>
              <p>Now I'm not discrediting the bible. Rather i find that we should use our common sense to analyse and interpret whether what that is written is true and useful. God had blessed us with knowlegde and wisdom and had warn us of false prophets, that is why we must not believe in all that we are given, but rather find the truth out ourselves from all the sources. Be it the bible, the priest, the church or the Vatican and the pope.</p>
              <p>It is when we believe in all that they, the Catholic Church, throws at us that we become extremists and cause harm rather than good. A typical example are the radical retards of different religions, instead of following the peaceful ways, chose to believe in violence and destruction, or simply put terrorism.</p>
              <p>So to conclude my POV, find out whats right rather than believe in everything.</p>

              <p>I'm not really sure about armageddon. If you mean god forgetting that he created us, yeah I think thats more likely. Haven't seen the 4 horsemen ride yet, nor the dragon being killed.<br><br>I reckon the fullproof way to go to heaven, is not to pray or w/e. it's just to be a good person. Thats it. If thats what you mean by "salvation (salvage)"<br><br></p>

              <p>yes..armageddon is approaching as evident in rev..so many of the
              signs are being fulfilled..yet even the churches does not teach
              that anymore i guess..</p>
              <p>what was God's standard for his creation?to put who first?y did
              adam n eve die?did they put God's word 1st?</p>
              <p>like i said, the church is a very diff story..i never did like
              goin to church too..the teaching usually make people turn away frm
              God and into the world.</p>
              <p>would donating really helps?will man be able to salvate himself
              through his own means?</p>
              <p>it is very interesting to talk to you..u do know certain stuff
              the churches babble on are false..</p>

              <p>yeah same here. You seem quite a knowlegdable fellow unlike the wussie i find in every Church i been to, Protestant or Catholic, who seem to take what is given to them without questioning.</p>
              <p>The point the Church stop proclaiming about the armaggeddon is that they realise that</p>
              <p>1) its false, made from some man who wants to scare the hell out of others</p>
              <p>2) Which he did and that made alot of Catholics stop coming to Church</p>
              <p>So realising the decrease in numbers and the falseness of this topic, the Church decided to drop it.</p>
              <p>Another question here is this, would a master destroy his own creation?</p>
              <p>Regarding the donation, economically and socially, donation is a better way of assistance. Only morally it is deemed less important.</p>

              <p>back in noah's days, God sent a global flood to destroy all things, however, he did make an exception in case of noah n his family and the animals.</p>

              <p>the imperfect humans will make use of donations to serve their own needs.instead of donating, we can do the hard work.also, after we gain accurate knowledge of God and how to save people. we can also engage in preaching work while helpin needy people.that way, we really teach needys to fish den jus feed them the fishes.</p>

              <p>I'm not really sure about armageddon. If you mean god forgetting
              that he created us, yeah I think thats more likely. Haven't seen
              the 4 horsemen ride yet, nor the dragon being killed.<br> <br> I reckon the fullproof way to go to heaven, is not to pray or w/e.
              it's just to be a good person. Thats it. If thats what you mean by

              <p>hmm..the 4 horseys are out...will type out ltr when im free..the dragon is not slain yet..God never forgets.heaven is not meant for everyone as reflected in my other posts..only 144k are goin up..the rest stays put on earth to play.prayers are very impt or JC would not have taught us how to pray.nor would prayers take so much air time in the bible..</p>

              <p>the needy benefit from money,from goods.but benefit even more from a hope of everlasting life in bliss.by studying the bible with them, they are being taught to get spiritual food.</p>
              <p>the armageddon has been spoken about since eden.JC himself says the end is near and thats ard 2k years ago.nobody, not even JC knows when the end is coming, he just know its near.only the father will know when..thats why it is being taught that we should have a waiting attitude.to be prepared for it to come.and not be caught un prepared..remember the illustration of the buggers waiting for the bridegroom to come with the light..some brought extra oil..some didnt..</p>
              <p>many people be them christians or self proclaim prophets like nostradamus tried to predict the end of world by placing an exact date..they all failed,bcuz as above, only the father,Jehovah, know when it is coming.it is also written that all translations belongs to Jehovah God alone.</p>
              <p>those being taught the bible and apply it and died without seeing the end of world takes heart that they need not suffer the worst and they did all their best and now have the hope of everlasting life.</p>
              <p>scientically speakin, no 1 disaster will wipe all life out..maybe unless earth fly into the sun.but u said it...no 1 disaster..the rev makes clear that it will be more den one..accumulate and there u have it =)</p>
