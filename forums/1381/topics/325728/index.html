              <p>A common reply would be for fellowship, but for teenagers, we dont talk much about God or our lives troubles etc to each other. It would be merely another venue to make friends and socialise; basically no deeper meaning.</p>
              <p>For sermon? online sermons work well too.</p>

              <p><br>XD. I said that fellowship is not a valid reason, since like evolPIG said, which is true, many people go church to see chiobus. Moreover, most teenagers dont seek fellowship or discussion about christian life, difficulties in life etc.</p>

              <p>see chiobus... i guess that's what happens when the church is filled with unregenerate people.</p>
              <p>church gatherings exist for the fellowship of the saints - to encourage one another, to serve one another, to edify and build up one another, etc. Goes beyond just mere chats and conversations.</p>
              <p>As much as there're those who dont seek what you seek, im sure there are others who do. If you find that those surrounding u are pp who only go and see chiobus, then i would suggest u start finding (actively) like-minded people who dont have that agenda. Either change cell group, zone, change church, or find other means of doing so. I hesitate to think of this forum as a place for u to seek the fellowship u want.</p>
              <p>One doesnt go to church merely for sermons, that's just one aspect. A christian doesnt grow (mature, fruits of the spirit, etc) without a context. The spiritual body of Christ provides that environment.</p>

              <p>i wonder what happens when you see that happening? do u join in or not? As James 4:17 says, "Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins."</p>
              <p>But surely, that is not a strong reason to leave the faith. Do you put your faith in man, or in God? Because if you look at man's behaviour as the sole gauge of the validity of a faith, you will most certainly be disappointed.  </p>

              <p>why not? doesnt hurt to try right?</p>
              <p>but with all things, sure helps to be discerning. not that u shld unleash a verbal diarrhoea upon those whom you're not familiar with, but to see whether the situation is right and relevant.i guess this is about knowing how to maintain or start friendships, comes with trial and error.</p>

              <p>A common reply would be for fellowship, but for teenagers, we dont talk much about God or our lives troubles etc to each other. It would be merely another venue to make friends and socialise; basically no deeper meaning.</p>

              <p><br>XD. I said that fellowship is not a valid reason, since like evolPIG said, which is true, many people go church to see chiobus. Moreover, most teenagers dont seek fellowship or discussion about christian life, difficulties in life etc.</p>
              <p>Only very good friends are 'useful.' Those normal friends or even gangs are easily forgotton once you leave the place.</p>

              <p>dave, aside from the standard answer from unker sillyme in Heb 10:24-25, I'd say going to church is a good place to network, be it your peers, the opposite sex, seniors etc.</p>
              <p>in itself, there is really nothing wrong to want to mix with the opposite sex, unless that is the only intention.</p>
              <p>you may remember that i say i belong to a traditional congregation in a church that has both contemporary as well as traditional congregation. it may also not be wrong to assume that only the contem congre attracts the younger crowd. However it does seem strange even to me to see a lot of young people in the traditional worship. As far as I can observe these teenagers are very well balanced, and are NOT THERE for the opposite sex. They are extremely active in their participation be it in playing the piano or the organ, or being the scripture reader or usher. Even the recent Bible Quiz drew heaps of teenagers. So I don't believe your observations are universally true.</p>
