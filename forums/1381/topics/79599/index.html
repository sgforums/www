As an enthusiastic believer, Wolfgang always read his Bible during lunch. Though his fellow workers jeered, he didn't stop his daily reading. He simply prayed for a way to demonstrate Christ's love to them.<br><br>When the workers went home at night, they always left their muddy boots behind. Wolfgang began staying late after work to clean their boots. The men were puzzled at first but then realized that Wolfgang was the only one among them who would perform this humble service. Not only did they come to respect him, but sometimes they even asked him to read the Bible to them. Only eternity will reveal the full effect of Wolfgang's shining life. But this we know: When his co-workers saw his good works, they started listening to his God.<br><br>Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may... glorify your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).

Not knowing what to do with it, Gracie put it in the bathtub and left for an appointment. When she returned home, she found a note from her maid. "Dear Miss Allen: Sorry, but I have quit. I don't work in houses where there is an alligator. I would have told you this when I started, but I never thought it would come up."<br><br>Some people who say they'll serve Christ are quick to leave when trouble comes. In Jesus' parable of the soils, He pictured the various responses that people have to the the gospel. For example, a person may seem to accept God's truth, but he stumbles in his faith when difficulties arise (Matthew 13:20-21). Such troubles test the sincerity of one's faith and expose the weakness of ones's commitment to Christ.<br><br>But someone may say, "Shouldn't our Lord tell us up front what is involved in following Him?" He does He appeals to us with one invitation: "Trust Me." If we let trouble or disillusionment shake our faith, we are breaking the spirit of the trust that brought us to Christ in the first place.<br><br>Father, when life brings us the unexpected and we feel like quitting, help us to be faithful to You.<br><br>--- Mart De Haan<br><br>Day by day and with each passing moment,<br>Strength I find to meet my trials here;<br>Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,<br>I've no cause for worry or for fear<br>--- Berg<br><br>Tough times can teach us to trust.</div>

The whole family was gathered around the table for dinner. Our 4-year-old son Stevie led off our pre-meal prayer: Â“Dear heavenly Father, thank You for this nice day. Thank You that we could go to church and Sunday school today.Â” Then, to our surprise, he said, Â“And weÂ’ll see You again next week.Â”<br><br>What Stevie said in his prayer is how we often view the Christian life, IÂ’m afraid. We easily fall into a see-you-next-time attitude about God. We forget about Him as we fulfill our daily responsibilities. We go for days at a time trying to pay the bills, keep the boss happy, and give attention to each family member. But we neglect to give God the time He deserves.<br><br>1 Chronicles 16 gives us some facts about GodÂ’s power and majesty that we can think and talk about Â“from day to dayÂ” (v.23). We can Â“declare His gloryÂ” (v.24) and recognize His hand of creation in the heavens (v.26). We can talk of His honor and majesty, the strength He possesses, and the gladness He gives us (v.27).<br><br>Each day brings new reasons to pray to God, to praise His name, and to proclaim His love. LetÂ’s make our worship of Him something we do Â“from day to dayÂ”.<br><br>--- Dave Branon<br><br>Worship, praise and adoration<br>Render now to JesusÂ’ name;<br>Freely give your heartÂ’s devotion,<br>Constantly His love proclaim.<br>--- Anon<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">No day is complete without worship.</span></div>

These heavy, black letters are reserved for only the most amazing front-page new stories. This dramatic type has been used to announce the beginning and end of wars, moon landings, presidential election winners, natural disasters, and other significant events.<br><br>One day mankind will witness the great event for which the Â“second comingÂ” type was named Â– the return of Jesus Christ. And what a day that will be! The One who ascended to heaven long ago will return to this earth. When our Lord comes back, it will be such a phenomenal occurrence hat it will command worldwide attention.<br><br>The day Jesus told His disciples that He would be leaving them, Peter was filled with questions (John 13:36-37). Jesus didnÂ’t explain when He would return, but He reassured His disciples that He was going to prepare a place for them and one day Â“come againÂ” (14:2-3).<br><br>When the Saviour comes back, His return will command the attention of all earthÂ’s inhabitants. It will be a headline event!<br><br>--- Dave Egner<br><br>When Christ the Lord returns to reign,<br>The world will know of that event,<br>For everyone shall see His face<br>And know the reason He was sent.<br>--- Hess<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Even so, come, Lord Jesus!<br>--- Revelation 22:20</span><br><br></div>

Idling and coasting were not in his nature. "One might even call him hyperactive." recalled a dear friend.<br><br>Then multuple sclerosis began to slow Grant down. First he needed crutches to get around. Then he was limited to sitting in a chair. Finally he was confined to a bed.<br><br>Near the end, he was hardly strong enough to talk. His friend recalls, however, that "he expressed only joy and thankfulness with a constant anticipation of being in the Lord's presence."  Not long before he died, Grant whispered Romans 15:13 to a friend. He repeated the words "in believing," then added, "I can't do anything now."<br><br>It's when we can't do anything that God does everything. And herein lies a profound paradox of the Christian's experience. Faith is a simultaneously an exercise of our will and the impartation of divine strength. And from that marvelous mixture spring joy and peace and an abundance of hope.<br><br>Are you in a totally helpless situation? Strength gone? All options exhausted? If you have trusted Jesus as your Savior, God will strengthen you to keep on believing. As you trust Him, He'll give you not only joy and peace, but also hope when all hope is gone.<br><br>--- Dennis De Haan<br><br>When we are weak and in despair,<br>Our mighty God is near;<br>He'll give us strength and joy and hope,<br>And calm our inner fear.<br>--- Sper<br><br>No one is hopeless whose hope is in God</div>

Most of the time I can take on as much work as anyone can give me. But some days there just seems to be too much to do. The schedule may be so full of meetings, appointments, and deadlines that there's no room to breath. Life often contains too much work, parenting, home improvement, and other responsibilities for one person to handle.<br><br>When that happens to me - as it may happen to you - I have some options. I can retreat into a shell of inactivity and leave everyone who is depending on me out in the cold. I can slog my way through, moaning as I go and making everyone wish I had chosen option one. Or I can get my perspective realigned by reminding myself what Jesus said to Martha (Luke 10:38 - 42).<br><br>Jesus told Martha that she had become "distracted with much serving" (v.40). He reminded her that her sister May had chosen the one thing that would never be taken away (v.42). Like many of us, Martha got so wrapped up in her service that she forgot the most important thing - fellowship with her Lord.<br><br>Are you overwhelmed? Don't lose sight of your priorities.

But in the fourth inning, when the catcher started to complain again, Guthrie stopped him. "Son," he said gently, "you've been a big help to me calling balls and strikes, and I appreciate it. But I think I've got the hang of it now. So I'm going to ask you to go to the clubhouse and show them how to take a shower."<br><br>Job also had been complaining about calls he didn't think were fair. In his case, the umpire was God. After listening to Job's objections, the Lord finally spoke out of a violent storm. Suddenly things came into perspective for Job. God was gentle, but He was also firm and direct. The Lord asked him the kind of questions that bring finite man back down to size. Job listened, gave up his complaining, and found peace in surrendering to God.<br><br>Father, we don't make sense when we complain about Your fairness.

One day his wife dressed in black mourning clothes.<br><br>"Who has died?" asked Luther.<br><br>"God," said his wife.<br><br>"God!" said Luther, horrified. "How can you say such a thing?"<br><br>She replied, "I'm only saying what you are living."<br><br>Luther realized that he indeed was living as if God were no long alive and watching over them in love. He changed his outlook from gloom to gratitude.<br><br>Occasionally we too live as if God were dead. When we are discouraged, we can turn to the Psalms. Some of the writers faced bleak and barren times, but they had one habit in common that kept them from being soured: giving thanks to God. For example, David wrote, "You have turned for me my mournng into dancing... O Lord my God, I will give thanks to You forever" (Psalm 30:11-12).<br><br>Meeting every situation with thanksgiving isn't a denial of trouble. It helps us see those situations from God's perspective - as opportunities to discover His power and love.<br><br>Every time you express gratitude to God in a difficult situation, you're declaring, "God is alive!"<br><br>--- Joanie Yoder<br><br>When things go wrong, I would not be a grumbler,<br>Complaining, seeing everything as grim;<br>For when I think of how the Lord has blessed me,<br>I cannot help but give my praise to Him<br>--- Hess<br><br><span style="color: violet;">Instead of complaining about the thorns on roses,<br>be thankful for the roses among the thorns</span>.<br><br></div>

Oh, Lord, help us to remember!"<br><br>Those are fitting and well-deserved tributes to the courageous men and women who sacrificed so much for their country.<br><br>As I think about them, I also remember the One whose selfless sacrifice resulted in benefits for people of all nations.

She was a true peacemaker whose courage spared the future king of Israel from committing a terrible sin. Here's her story:<br>David had been forced to live in the countryside to escape King Saul's jealous wrath. A group of about 600 men and their families had gathered around him. For several months they camped near Carmel where the flocks of Nabal (Abigail's husband) were grazing. David's men had helped Nabal's shepherds protect the sheep from robbers. Now the shearing time had come, and David sent messengers to request some compensation from Nabal, who was a wealthy man. But he refused and treated David's men with disdain.<br><br>In anger David rashly decided to kill Nabal and all the men in his household. When Abigail heard what had happened, she quickly gathered a large supply of food, intercepted David and his fighting men, and humbly apologized for her husband's surly behavior. David immediately realized that she had prevented him from carrying out a vengeful decision, and he praised God (1 Samuel 25:32).<br><br>Are we as quick to resolve a conflict?

Stop and think about what that really means.<br>Yes, it's a blessing to have human friends who enrich our lives. A devoted friend, as Proverbs 17:17 tells us, "loves at all times," standing with us steadfastly through life's sunshine and storm.<br><br>Indeed, some of us know gratefully by our own experience that "there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother" (Proverbs 18:24). We identify with David and Jonathan when we read about the bond between them (1 Samuel 18:1).<br><br>Friendship on a human level is wonderful, but what about friendship with God? It's an incredible blessing to have the Creator and Sustainer of our universe as a friend. Although worshiped by countless heavenly hosts, He takes great joy in His relationship with us.<br><br>Are we neglecting the privilege of walking with God, the greatest of all friends? Today, with gratitude and awe, let's spend time with Him in prayer and in reading His Word.<br><br>Remember that Jesus called His followers friends (John 15:15).

When he came home that afternoon, his mother asked if he had purchased the milk. "No," he replied, bursting into tears. "The milk was 5 cents and I only had a dime."<br><br>How often I have responded to demands placed upon me with the same childish understanding. According to God's Word, I have all the resources I need at my disposal-more than enough to meet my needs-and yet I'm reluctant to act because I fear that I won't have enough. But the Bible assures me that God has provided me with every blessing in abundance. By His grace, I have everything I need (2 Corinthians 9:8 ).<br><br>The apostle Paul was not saying that we have enough grace to do anything we want to do. God does not offer us a blank check. No, Paul was giving us the assurance that we have enough grace to do whatever God has called us to do-whether it is to give money for the cause of the gospel, as the Corinthians were doing (v.7), or to give love to a difficult teenager, an indifferent spouse, or an aging parent.<br>Whatever the task, God will make sure we have "an abundance for every good work" (v.8 ).

So she held back, continuing at normal speed.<br><br>Sometimes the way others live seems far more attractive and exciting than our Christian life.
