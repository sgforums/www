Curtain of Holy of Holies was torn is a good thing... it signifies the direct contact with God which prior to that was that every human being has to go through the high priest.... but enough of old covenant and new covenant lah... already kena accused of not being obedient to God. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">Amazingly Vesak Day is not Indian holiday leh!!

Irenaeus and Tertullian speak of Good Friday as the day of the Pasch; but later writers distinguish between the Pascha staurosimon (the passage to death), and the Pascha anastasimon (the passage to life, i.e. the Resurrection).
