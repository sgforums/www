This is not to claim that the life story of Jesus in biblical context is historically inaccurate; instead, it highlights the iconic representation that Jesus holds, which will change the way Man views Jesus as well as religion on the whole in the years, centuries, and millennia to come. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;  ">What is the difference betwixt symbolism and the historical, which could seem so similar, and even more so, be regarded as one and the same by hundreds of millions of people the world over? In this paper, I will attempt to draw a single pertinent example of perceived scriptural truths that possesses vast popular support and belief, as opposed to painstakingly gathered historical evidence, and their impact upon us all. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;  ">How do these wonderful symbols purportedly work their powerful magic across Man? Consider this hypothetical situation: a new high school is opened to honor of the memory of the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. Fronting the main campus building is a large, steel statue depicting the popular image of Lincoln garbed in suit and bowtie, ever donning his iconic Lincoln top hat, and a slave in a supine position before him. Armed with nothing but a compassionate smile and a sledgehammer lifted over his head, he seems to have himself ready to break open the shackles that keep the unfortunate slave bonded to unindentured servitude.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;  ">Some may argue that the statue, while utterly flattering to Lincoln’s memory is unfitting, because it did not portray him historically. It was never recorded, be it in image or the written word that Lincoln had carried out such a physical act, and therefore this statue was untrue. It might encourage this school’s future students to jump into conclusions without first ensuring the full validity of the facts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;  ">Yet, some may come into the defense of this statue, claiming that the statue was very fitting to Lincoln’s memory because of his lifetime accomplishment to set the United States off on the long road to racial equality by legislating the state’s recognition of the slave’s intrinsic worth as a human being. It was not particularly what Lincoln truly did physically that mattered, but the fact that Lincoln, as a symbol set an example for the myriad generations to come was important.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;  ">Here we come to the constant hemming and hawing of many Christians and other people hailing with creeds of the Book claiming that everything recorded within their Scripture was historically and absolutely true, and many atheists and skeptics on the other side claiming that it is not, that the bible is fiction and nothing more than an elaborate collection of high fantasy tales. What is true, and what is false? <br><br>Fortunately for Christians, not much has to be historically proven for them in this present day in order to continue to have faith in what they believe in. The narrative of the four Gospels in the New Testament of the Bible is so independently strong, consistent with one another and looking somewhat consistent to the untrained eye of the amateur historian, there is little wonder that there are so many believers who may react vehemently to the slightest hint or tease of an idea that what they believe in may not be so historically accurate, after all. <br><br>To cite this one incident in the New Testament, there is a rather curious account of Pontius Pilate, the famous Roman governor of Judea who supposedly found no fault in a Jesus that was arrested and put before him. The Gospels of the New Testament paint Pilate as a completely just and fair Roman governor sensitive to Hebrew traditions and sensibilities. To quote Mark 15:6 – 15: </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them, anyone for whom they asked. Now a man called Barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection. So the crowd came and began to ask Pilate to do for them according to his custom. Then he answered them, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” For he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead. Pilate spoke to them again, “Then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?” They shouted back, “Crucify him!” Pilate asked them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him!” So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them, and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;  ">There are several unfortunate problems with this account. The first and foremost problem lies in the fact that Pilate was historically proven to show no regard for Jewish religious sensitivities, and did not hesitate to use swift and brutal martial force in the form of multiple Roman legions to quell resistances and insurrections amongst the Jewish peasantry. To illustrate this, a group of Samaritans who attempted to partake in a Moses-like re-enactment by a trek up Mount Gerizim, where Moses supposedly left behind sacred vessels with which the Samaritans could hope to fight against the Romans, in the hope to free themselves of Roman occupation as their ancestors did with the Egyptians gathered at a village named Tirathana, and when Pilate heard of such an incident, I quote the Antiquities 18.85 – 87 in the incident of the <em>Samaritan Prophet</em>:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">“…Pilate blocked their projected route up the mountain with a detachment of cavalry and heavy-armed infantry, who in the encounter with the firstcomers in the village slew some in a pitched battle and put the others to flight. Many prisoners were taken, of whom Pilate put to death the principal leaders and those who were most influential..</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;  "><br>Secondly, it is difficult to imagine the authors of the Gospels – Jesus’ apostles – to have had a first-hand account of what had transpired. Jesus was arrested as a peasant rabble rouser who tried to block the collection of taxes for Rome, which was a capital crime during that period. To make things worse for Jesus; according to Luke 19:1 – 9, he apparently managed to influence Zacchaeus, a “chief tax collector” in Jericho to resign and give his riches to the poor. This poses a problem, as Jericho was directly under Pilate’s taxation jurisdiction, and such a severe crime worthy of capital punishment would not have easily escaped Pilate’s attention. At the time of Jesus’ arrest, all of his disciplines ran away fearing for their lives, save for Judas who betrayed him to inform on Jesus to the Jewish High Priests. To go back to the quoted tax by Mark in Page 3, it could not have been possible for Pilate to practice any form of open amnesty during a time such as the Passover Festival. It is noted, in detailed Roman records that typical Roman governors treated crucified prisoners during festival periods by postponing the execution until after the festival, or allow the burial of the crucified by his or her family.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;  ">Now that we have established that Pilate’s alleged meek compliance to a shouting mob, and his alleged sensitivities to Jewish customs are most likely a work of fiction by Mark, we have to find out: for what reason did Mark partake in this kind of Scriptural fiction?<br><br>His created narrative about Jerusalem choosing Barabbas, a common armed rebel over Jesus characterizes his perceived fate of Jerusalem, and in doing so, his excerpt in Page 3 is noted to be one of symbolic dramatization, or in other words, prophecy fulfillment for the sake of it to lend credence to Jesus’ existence.<br><br>For the historical Jesus was but a peasant nobody in the typical Roman eyes, just another rabble rouser with radical social ideas that has gained enough attention within Judea to attract also, the attention of the local Jewish and Roman authorities to put him down. It was most likely that the Romans would have merely done away with someone like Jesus by the manner of crucifixion without any manner of official record, or even to have a governor so much as to take notice of Jesus to hammer a notice of “Jesus of Nazereth – King of the Jews” on his cross. In attempting to fulfill prophecy, Mark created this symbol to lend Jesus some manner of exceptionism and significance to brand him as the prophesized Messiah.<br><br>What have the implications been, behind this one incident of Pilate heeding the demands of the gathered Jews to crucify Jesus as a symbol? One of the most tragic and unfortunate outcomes in the coming centuries and millennia, was anti-Semitism. It boiled for centuries at first, against Jews in European Christendom because Mark’s account in Page 3, which became widely accepted historical truth by then, gave justification to the abusive treatment of Jews because of their perceived “pride over Christ” and because they demanded Jesus to be slain, “Christ-killers”, and were ultimately, unbelievers. Very popular and well-known examples of Mark-justified anti-Semitism reside in the fictional, such as portrayal of Shylock the Jewish Moneylender in Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice during the Renaissance period, and its horrific nonfictional manifestation in the Holocaust in the early 20th century. <br><br>Even if it could be completely proven with utterly undeniable historical facts that the biblical Pilate incident did not exist, and disseminated popularly throughout the world in this present day, such a concept in Christians cannot be easily erased, because it is a standard assumption amongst Christians that all that is said in the Bible is absolutely true where symbol and history meld for them, and to actively doubt that even one incident did not historically happen, threatens to destroy the entire chain that is Jesus’ exceptional lifetime as a Messiah on earth and severely diminish the belief of the average Christian. But, with this flawed perception to exist, even if outright, active anti-Semitism is not seen in this 21st century with the exception of pockets of immature skinhead movements, the author here can say with confidence that, I, am also one of the affected. Even if I had categorically rejected the Christian faith more than half a decade ago, I still am unable to shake away the passive, chiding anti-Semitism in me, that causes me to think of “the over-proud killers of Christ” every time the thought of Jews appear in my mind, be it in speech or contemplation.</span></p>

              <p>With Gospels were labelled as so for a reason: because the writers and the ministers of the Vatican were quite intimate with the fact that the Gospels were not histories - a good lot of it was made up and mixed together, so despite the many Gospels floating around out there, only four were selected to be included into official scripture and is now the bible that we know today.</p>
              <p>To make things worse, the Gospels were written more than 70 years after Jesus' death. How sure are you that you can remember with absolute clarity on every detail, that happened to you last year? Or even two years ago. Five years? You could try 70. Things will be muddled up and made up in order to make sense of the patchy memories of those men.</p>

                                made up and mixed together, so despite the many Gospels floating
                                around out there, only four were selected to be included into
                                official scripture and is now the bible that we know today.</p>
                                <p>To make things worse, the Gospels were written more than 70
                                years after Jesus' death. How sure are you that you can remember
                                with absolute clarity on every detail, that happened to you last
                                year? Or even two years ago. Five years? You could try 70. Things
                                will be muddled up and made up in order to make sense of the patchy
                                memories of those men.</p>

              I don't know the 100% of it but I do know some enough to prove to me that it is quite accurate. I don't know everything but I know quite a lot in it to be true.<br><br>
              Like I said Christian need to see God's word coming alive in other words Christians are supposed to know God personally so what they read in the bible comes to life or proven through their life. Otherwise all is just theory.

              <p>Here lies the difference: I have made my detailed study in scripture vs recorded history. You think that you know, even if you yourself have admitted that you have not remotely bothered to verify the facts. </p>
              <p>"Seeing God's word coming alive" and what not is a mere play of your emotions. You're just unwilling to accept that your faith is built on the sandy foundations that is the scripture. Even more so if you're Protestant. Protestants insist on following the bible instead of adhering to authority in the Vatican.</p>

              Look man play of emotion lol just say you don't know a thing I say and you don't know God. You probably read the bible and that's about it.<br><br>
                                
              Post your detailed study. Or send a link as to where I could download it. I bet you you can't even be considered a bible scholar. Let me try to see your study as you claimed you have done a detailed history comparison with regard to the bible .

              <p>Why be a bible scholar?</p>
              <p>The bible's only evidence is the bible.</p>
              <p>There are no more sources, no physical evidence, nothing for historians to analyse or confirm.</p>
              <p>The difference between actual scholarship  and the bible is this:</p>
              <p>Real scholarship:</p>
              <p>These are the facts, what can we conclude from it?</p>
              <p>Bible:</p>
              <p>This is the conclusion (bible), what can we find to support it?</p>
              <p>Its not even a real science, so stop it and get a job.</p>
