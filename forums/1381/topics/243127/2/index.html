            <div class='col-md body'>The purpose of life is to worship God and have a relationship with Him. He created us for this purpose. We live in Him and we have our being in Him. When we leave God, we leave our original purpose and descended into hell and chaos. Our life comes from Him and when we are in Him, we have abundant life. We are the branches and He is the vine and we cannot do without Him for He gives life. Once we leave God we are spiritually dead and leads to physical death. But how many can stay close to Him if not by His grace and mercy? We are sinners thru and thru and thank God we are saved by Jesus' precious blood or we are destined for hell.</div>
