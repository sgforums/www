            <div class='col-md body'>Notice the words in bold.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>SECTION: Saturday Special Report<br><br>LENGTH: 283 words<br><br>HEADLINE: Parents upset at first but came around<br><br>BODY:<br>THERE were quarrels, recriminations and curfews. His parents slashed his allowance and banned him from going to church. He resorted to sneaking out from home.<br><br>'I felt persecuted,' recalls Mr Tay Swee Kwek, now 22.<br><br>The tension began at age 14 when the Victoria Secondary schoolboy began attending the Shekinah Assembly of God, a charismatic Christian church.<br><br>His family considered themselves Buddhists and his parents opposed his growing attachment to Christianity.<br><br>'Their first worry was I was being cheated and led into something I didn't understand,' he says. 'The second was that I would no longer partake in family traditions.'<br><br>They were right about the second. He refused to eat food placed at the ancestral altar and his mother accused him of becoming 'a religious extremist'. But eventually, his parents came round.<br><br><strong>He believes they did so because 'Christianity taught me to love my parents, to control my temper and be patient and responsible with them'. And when he was finally baptised last month, it was with their approval.</strong><br><br>His first encounter with Christianity was when friends invited him to a 'fun-filled' gathering of youths at a church.<br><br>Six months later, he was praying at home when he experienced what he believes was a 'religious experience'. If fun was the bait and spiritual experience the connection, then 'logic' sealed his conversion.<br><br><strong>'The more I learnt about religion, the more it seemed to me that Christianity is the most logical religion,' he says.</strong><br><br>In the meantime, he aced his O-levels and did well enough in his A-levels to gain a place in the National University of Singapore's medical faculty, where he begins his studies next month.<br><br>LI XUEYING<br><br>LOAD-DATE: July 15, 2005</div>

Nuff said! Could if be your misinterpreted what he said? The same thing said 10 times could come across 10 different ways... did you ever check back with the person to clarify?

God allows for our uniqueness... so should we.<br><br>I think you are nitpicking... maybe it is the way you heard it?

But eventually, his parents came round.<br><br>He believes they did so because 'Christianity taught me to love my parents, to control my temper and be patient and responsible with them'. And when he was finally baptised last month, it was with their approval.<br><br>His first encounter with Christianity was when friends invited him to a 'fun-filled' gathering of youths at a church.<br><br>Six months later, he was praying at home when he experienced what he believes was a 'religious experience'. If fun was the bait and spiritual experience the connection, then 'logic' sealed his conversion.<br><br>'The more I learnt about religion, the more it seemed to me that Christianity is the most logical religion,' he says.<br><br>In the meantime, he aced his O-levels and did well enough in his A-levels to gain a place in the National University of Singapore's medical faculty, where he begins his studies next month.<br><br>LI XUEYING<br><br>LOAD-DATE: July 15, 2005 [/b]</blockquote>why cannot eat ? issit mention in bible say certain food cannot eat ?</div>

I have never ever said i hate the people that goes to charismatic churches.

You are implying form your viewpoint that there is something wrong with the charismatic church, you have just set yourself up against a whole movement... btw, what do you know about the charismatic movement? Like I have said so many times before, we are all diffent and if you cannot accept that, then I think you need to go and have a rethink.<br><br>Its like me saying the methodists or the anglicans have got issues...comprende?  FYI, i go to wesley and the rock... so there. Like I have stressed so many times, we as brothers and sisters in Christ should support one another... not tear each other down.<br><br>What is your issue anyway? You only quote one incident, that could have been a typo if it was put up on screen, it could have been an honest mistake. You never mentioned whether you clarified the situation or not, if you have not, then maybe you were jumping to conclusions?</div>
