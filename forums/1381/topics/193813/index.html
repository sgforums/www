The whole Bible is describing people's relationship with God. The Bible is so "contradictory" because people have different experiences with God and describe their experiences based on their personal beliefs, understanding and culture. It is the same God. If your experiences are not like what is describe in the bible; then you are not born again.<br><br>You are a sincere person and God wants you; but you must surrender in total humility. This is something that only you can do. [/b]</blockquote>Funny. I have many of such similar experiences.

You have many experiences; but if you have never fully surrendered; you have no idea what you are talking about.</div>
