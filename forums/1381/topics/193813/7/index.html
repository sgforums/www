He believed [like all the Pharisees] that his works could save him. He believed in God as Creator, King and etc. But he never believed that God in Christ is the Savior of souls.Like some of  the fervent Israelites in his day he had zeal but not according to knowldege of the gospel.<br><br>Ro 10:2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.<br><br>3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God.<br><br>He thought that it was through Law-keeping that righteousness should come. He did not know that:<br><br>"[b]For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes</strong>".<br><br>To be born again or born from above we must trust in Christ alone for salvation. The gospel is the testimony of God to sinners like us. And inroder to be born from above we must believe tht testimony. And what is that testimony?<br><br>1Jo 5:10  He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar,<strong> because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son.</strong><br><br>1Jo 5:11 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.</strong></span><br><br>We are born again when He we believe what He has done to sinners through His Son. God says: "you have eternal life in Christ Jesus!!!!!!!!!!"<br><br>Faith says: "Yes, i believe that message. I will now stop believing that somehow by my good works i can have eternal life. God says: Eternal life is in His Son. There i rest in Him. I rest in what He has said"<br>[/b]</blockquote> Why quote Rom 10 and 1 John 5? Why do you not quote directly the words of Jesus to Nick? Are you ashamed of the words of Jesus?<br><br>Well I am not. Jesus said as clear as daylight to Nick, <strong>you must be born again, you must be born of the spirit.</strong></div>
