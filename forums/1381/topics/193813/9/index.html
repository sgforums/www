He used the term poor himself. <strong>I am just echoing what he said.</strong>when you have nothing, when you are poorly clothed, when you are homeless, i think by any standards that is poor.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Yes, you are right, check the greek word, it does means poor,<br>In 2 Cor 6:10, If Paul is refering to material wealth, as in having little possession, then what is he saying here? there in 2 Cor 6 3-10, he had series of contrast, if poor (ptochos : poor,begger,miserable) is refering to material wealth, then making many rich(ploutizo: enriched, made rich, making rich), this rich should then be refering to material wealth as well, shouldn't it?<br><br>compare this to 2 Cor 8:9<br>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich(plousios:rich, wealth, wealthy), yet for your sakes he became poor(ptocheuo:poor), so that you through his poverty might become rich(plouteo:rich, acquired wealth, gained wealth,get rich, grew rich, richly)<br><br>here, Paul is again using the contrast, that Christ who was rich , for our sake was make poor, that we who was poor, through His poverty might become rich.<br><br>Acts 3: what is Peter saying?<br>He is telling the begger, silver and gold we do not have (these is what the begger is asking them for), what we have we gave to you (what the begger really need, physical restoration and salvation through Christ)<br><br>1 Cor 4, Paul here is telling the corintians not to have an arrogant attitude, but should imitate him as he imitate Christ, having a humble attitude.</div>

God heals, but it must be in accordance with His will.<br><br>I am sure that many religions in the world have testimonies of miracles. I have stated many times in my blog: miracles does not authenticate the validity of the religious teachings. Roman Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Mormonism may have numerous accounts of people experiencing miracles, but their teachings do not conform to the Word of God.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Since you said that there are two medical doctors in your church that witness Â“healings,Â” then perhaps you may want to leave your name and contact details as well as theirs. I would like to have formal medical statements from them that the healings really did occur. If you want to lend credibility to your remarkable claims, then you might want to back it up with facts. </span><br><br>Please pardon my skepticism. Like any normal and rational person, whenever I hear of any paranormal and supernatural claims, such as alien abductions, out of body experiences, angel visitations, crop circles, recollections of past lives, and miraculous healings etc, I would demand some sort of hard proof that these accounts really did happen. I am not so naÃ¯ve as to be taken in by any Tom, Dick or Harry who claim to have a supernatural experience.<br><br>As for Revelation 11:1-6, I do not see anywhere in the passage that contains the doctrine Â“miracles by faith.Â” Perhaps you care to elaborate?<br><br><span style="color: orange;">And yes, I absolutely agree with 1 Corinthians 13:2. Knowledge, that is theology, goes hand in hand together with love. One cannot do without the other. Theology is essential to the gospel. The gospel is made up of doctrines. If your theology is incorrect, the gospel that you believed in might not be the biblical gospel of Jesus Christ. For it is written: Â“Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of ChristÂ” (Romans 10:17).</span><br><br>Let us take for instance, Oneness Pentecostalism. Oneness Pentecostals have no problem affirming that salvation is repentance from sin and faith in Jesus Christ. However, they categorically deny the essential doctrine of the Trinity. Would you say that the gospel they preached is the biblical gospel of Jesus Christ or the false gospel?<br><br>By the way, it would be better if you are able to identify yourself rather than hide behind the anonymous label.
