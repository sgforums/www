I am wrong in using that as a comparison.<br><br>I believe in the healing power of GOD...if not I would not have believe he would cure my hepatitis. What I am against...pastors telling pple to stop taking medicine if they think they can be healed by GOD. I believe GOD heal everyone in different ways. For me, I believe God can cure me through doctors. I am still very skeptical in hearing about new kidneys growing out of nowhere in kidney patients, but i will try not to limit myself in my understanding of healing.<br><br>I am never a spiritual man, it is just that recently i decided I need to have a stand and believe in the faith. I too, was one of those 'doubting' 'non-believing' christians which u said. U should see from my posts that I dun post very often until recently.<br><br>I agree with u that Christianity is personal faith; different experiences for everybody. What my intention is: share my testimonial to encourage those who want to believe but still holding back. If GOD can change a skeptical person in me, I believe he can change anyone.<br><br>It is never a glorifying thing here to tell anyone about the faith. We are prone to be attacked by non-christians. I am a net addict and I spend a lot of time on the internet. What I feel I can do is to share some information abt the good news here with pple who want to listen. Even if they dun believe, at least I have planted the seed. Even for my parents, they have yet to believe in GOD but at least I knew I tried.<br><br>You may say I am idealistic but I can tell u by sharing we can encourage fellow christians here. I have received positive pms from pple encouraging me. If not, I would have stopped posting like what u have said. Now I know the importance of going to church and fellowship between Christians, becoz it is the only way we can encourage each other in the faith.<br><br>I am now going for bible lessons at church which I believe is good for me as a young christian. Some of the things which I wrote here are wat i believe I can share with the pple here.<br><br><strong>If u dun see anything edifying, it is ok, becoz u have ur own opinion. For u, what is the reason why u continue to post here, since it is not edifying? </strong><br><br>My school term is starting next week and I wont have time to reply as much as b4. U probably won't see me here as much as b4. But now that I still have time, I would still continue to post. But I will take ur advice to take things easier and to read my bible more.<br><br>Cheers!</div>
