If one do not believe that his salvation is assured by faith thru Christ alone, then what Christ has done on the cross has been taken in vain.<br><br>A Christian who is not assured of his own salvation is incapable of preaching effectively to non-believers. How can he preach that others are saved when he himself is not?<br><br>The Church is not perfect, but if one is going to let the failures of men affect his decision concerning his own salvation, I can say unfortunately he has been misled. As Christians, our role is to preach and to plant the seed of faith. The rest is up to GOD and the person. We cannot be blamed for that particular individual losing his salvation, after all it is a relationship between GOD and that individual; Nobody can decide for him/her whether they want to receive Christ in their lives.<br><br></div>

And they went their way.<br>5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.<br>6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?<br>7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.<br>8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.<br>9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.<br>10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.<br>11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,<br>12  Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.<br>13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?<br>14 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.<br>15  Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?
