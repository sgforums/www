It is reasonable skeptism and just because it is not a religion doesn't means it is not believable. Wat is the difference between the 2 ? There r many people who worships things like monkey god or elephant god etc etc and treat them as religion. Why do u not believe in them ?<br><br><blockquote>Unddeniable proof?

DNA has create the living being we see today but strictly speaking DNA have no intelligence. And just because something work in a complex way doesn't mean someone do the programming for it.<br><br>We have different way of thinking. I give an example of the sand on the beach. From the same observation, one can conclude the sand pattern is created by some being arranging each grain of sand at the right position. Another can conclude the pattern is formed naturally by a set system and there is no intelligent person arranging the pattern (gravity, waves, soil movement in tis case, evolution for the cell) Why must someone intelligent be involved and not simply formed by natural ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Why can't cells evolved and form the complicated life we see ? Why can't sands be there just because nature follow a set of rules ? why must we add some being into the equation when there is no signs tat tis had happened and it is no different from wishful thinking, day dreaming and imagination.<br><br>About lego in a box example, if there r a lot of people (1 X 10 to power of million) and lot of shakes (1 X 10 to power of billion) per person and they shake with enough force, u may get a simple house from one of them. Note tat u r only talking only about the impossibility of forming, lets say life without consideration to the number of chances taken and occurances. My example took these into consideration.</div>

It is reasonable skeptism and just because it is not a religion doesn't means it is not believable. Wat is the difference between the 2 ? There r many people who worships things like monkey god or elephant god etc etc and treat them as religion. Why do u not believe in them ?<br></div></blockquote>I didn't answer because I don't want to... as history has shown, there will be no end to this debate.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">I think u r confusing between the 2 terms of intelligence. DNA has create the living being we see today but strictly speaking DNA have no intelligence. And just because something work in a complex way doesn't mean someone do the programming for it.<br><br>We have different way of thinking. I give an example of the sand on the beach. From the same observation, one can conclude the sand pattern is created by some being arranging each grain of sand at the right position. Another can conclude the pattern is formed naturally by a set system and there is no intelligent person arranging the pattern (gravity, waves, soil movement in tis case, evolution for the cell) Why must someone intelligent be involved and not simply formed by natural ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Why can't cells evolved and form the complicated life we see ? Why can't sands be there just because nature follow a set of rules ? why must we add some being into the equation when there is no signs tat tis had happened and it is no different from wishful thinking, day dreaming and imagination.<br><br>About lego in a box example, if there r a lot of people (1 X 10 to power of million) and lot of shakes (1 X 10 to power of billion) per person and they shake with enough force, u may get a simple house from one of them. Note tat u r only talking only about the impossibility of forming, lets say life without consideration to the number of chances taken and occurances. My example took these into consideration. </div></blockquote>In all seriousness I did not read the above. No point. Our past has crossed too many times to have another war, which we all know will never end.<br><br>You believe what you believe, and I believe what I believe. I don't believe that any number of people with any number of shakes will create even a simple house with the lego breaks.... (oops, I read the last paragraph).<br><br>I also don't believe that given time infinite, monkeys banging on the typewriter will result in Julius Caeser.<br><br>The thread is about WHY DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD. In itself, it is a personal question that demands a personal answer. Any answer given will bother on some level of supernatural or mysticism.<br><br>You don't need to be happy with the answer either because these answer will never satisfy your "scientific" thirst, so there is really no point in talking about it.<br><br>When you enter a thread, it will inevitably become a session of flaming and counter flaming.... I don't think I have neither the time or interest for this. Therefore it will be locked.... If the TS wishes to have this thread reopened, please PM me.<br><br>To each his own SIS, to each his own.</div>
