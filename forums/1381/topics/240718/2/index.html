[b]How do you know God exists</strong><br>To the person who asks this, one could asks "How do you that there is no God?".  As to evidence, saying that there is 'no evidence' of God's existence is merely an assertion which requires further refinement, and until proven, cannot be taken as proof.<br><br>Firstly, what sort of evidence are we talking about?  If one says physical evidence, then how does one prove that there is only physical evidence in the world?  And if one says that God cannot be scientifically proven, then one is merely assuming that the scientific method is the only one possible, which is clearly not the case.[/b]</blockquote>So what are the other possibilities?</div>
