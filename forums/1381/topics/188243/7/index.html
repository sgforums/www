Consider this: It is of your view that they are endangering themselves, so you say u are concerned for them. How noble. And yet at the same time, u're unwilling to denounce something which is the foundation stone of hate and prejudice by less rational individuals, regardless of how false or true it is, because u fear it risks your own salvation.<br><br>once again, i say, its not your telling of someone that he is sinning that is selfish. its your refusal to stop supporting the origin and justification of hate(which u do not support) that is selfish, as u think if you did not believe in it, you would jepordize your own salvation.<br><br>So you do not condone acts of violence or discrimination. How noble once again! But as long as you hold on to the view that homosexuality is unnatural and wrong, we cannot wipe out violence and discrimination against homosexuals, because they will ALWAYS have this belief as justification to do so. To get rid of the violence and prejudice, we need to get rid of the justification. To get rid of the justification, we need to get rid of the belief. That is why we are saying what we are saying. I just hope you can understand this point.<br></blockquote>As you've stated, there will be some people who will hate the sinner and hurt the sinner. Christians are obliged to come to the defence of the sinner, however they are also obliged not to condone his act. They have to detest his sin as they detest all sins including thier own.<br><br>You say that by not condoning the act we are building the foundation for hatred towards the sinner. Because as you have stated by hating homosexuality, I condone people who hate homosexulas.<br><br>You know that is like saying, by promoting pro-life I condone ,people who go around killing pro-abortionists. So therefore, I should not speak out against abortion.<br><br></div>

We say, "bad" because of the negative consequences. To say "Evil" is to assume that you are God.<br><br>For example "prostituition." We can say "bad" because of the many bad consequences. What do you say to a girl who is in prostituition to help pay for her mother's cancer treatment? Good or Evil? You cannot make that judgement.<br><br>Is this relativism then? No we are against actions that have bad consequences as far as we can see. We are against criminal acts. We acknowledge that certain actions carry certain consequences.<br><br>To judge is different. You will never be friends with a prostitute. Because to you prostitution is "Evil." How can you be friends with an "Evil" person? How can you love an "Evil" person? It is no longer a case of being a hypocrite... you are associating yourself with evil if you love a person who is doing evil.<br><br>To say that prostitution have dire consequences is to acknowledge that it might not have dire consequences, that it is not inherently Evil.<br><br>The Adam and Eve story is to tell you not to play God and assume that you know what Good and Evil is. Adam hid from God and God asked him, "Who told you that you are naked?" You see, the "knowledge" boomeranged and he condemned himself. He thought of himself as "naked," and he was naked all along and it did not bother him.<br><br>It certainly did not bother God who was looking for him...<br><br>This very assumption is what separates man from God. By condenming homosexual acts as Evil; you are condenming yourself. This presumption that you know what Good and Evil is; that is what is preventing you from being Born Again.</div>
