THEN, THEY WILL GO BACK TO THEIR OLD WAYS!<br><strong>please note that the above example does NOT apply to all who suffer from anorexia.</strong><br>watched "a beautiful mind"?  some people say that when John Nash was first in Macleans, he pretended to recover so that he could get out because he was convinced there was nothing wrong with him...</div>

Just like an ex prisoner or convict. Do u know they ask whether u have suffered from any mental probs in the job application form? See how they discriminate?

He never condemns you but if u still stubborn, u would have only condemned yourself. He loves you. He wants u to be His bride the church. He is coming back for us.

            <div class='col-md body'>A journal from National Center for Biotechnology Information:<br><br>IS HOMOPHOBIA ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUAL AROUSAL?<br><br>by Henry E. Adams, Ph.D., Lester W. Wright, Jr., Ph.D. and Bethany A. Lohr<br>Department of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens 30602-3013, USA.<br><br>Abstract:<br><br>The authors investigated the role of homosexual arousal in exclusively heterosexual men who admitted negative affect toward homosexual individuals. Participants consisted of a group of homophobic men (n = 35) and a group of nonhomophobic men (n = 29); they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W. W. Hudson &amp; W. A. Ricketts, 1980). The men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual, male homosexual, and lesbian videotapes, and changes in penile circumference were monitored. They also completed an Aggression Questionnaire (A. H. Buss &amp; M. Perry, 1992). Both groups exhibited increases in penile circumference to the heterosexual and female homosexual videos. Only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli. The groups did not differ in aggression. <strong><span style="color: red;">Homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did someone ask for a professional view of this matter?<br><br>The classification of homosexuality as a disorder was changed in DSM-III because of the definition of "disorder".  A defining aspect of a disorder is that it generates distress in the individual.  Since homosexuality in itself does not create distress, it is not a disorder.  What does create distress is either:<br><br>1) a disparity between one's self-image and one's sexual orientation<br>2) getting fed up with self-righteous assholes who give gays a whole lot of grief<br><br>As such, homosexuality per se no longer fit the definition of a disorder and its classification was changed.<br><br>This is not to say that homosexuality is entirely excluded from the diagnostic process.  DSM-IV still accommodates for distress that results as a side effect of a person's sexual orientation.<br><br>Of course, if you wanted to extrapolate all the way, the same section of DSM-IV would apply to a straight person being distressed by living in a predominantly gay community. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I'm sure the religiously oriented will have plenty to say about the classification process, and I expect that many members of the APA woul have contested the reclassification back in the 1970's, but that the end of the day, practicioners deal with what is, not what should be.</div>
