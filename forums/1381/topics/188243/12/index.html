In your sloppy incomplete Googling, you failed to read further in the article (http://www.prca.org/pamphlets/pamphlet_61.html), which says:<br><br><blockquote>The Reformed Christian, in evaluating the NIV, cannot but conclude that it is weighed and found wanting.<br><br>This is true, first of all, in the matter of the allegedly older and better text on which the NIV is based. The presupposition is that older is necessarily better. But is this presupposition correct? Was it not the case that from the very beginning of the new dispensation there were those who corrupted the truth of the Word of God? Was it not true that the early church was involved in a fierce struggle for the truth of God's Word, especially for the truths of the Trinity and the deity of Jesus Christ? Was it not true that the heretics and various heretical groups produced their own translations of the Scriptures that were perverted to support their pet teachings, much like the Bible versions today of the Roman Catholic Church and the Jehovah's Witnesses? We know, for example, that this was precisely what the heretic Marcion did. What evidence is there to support the notion that a few manuscripts, chiefly two, lately discovered, contain a much more faithful text, a text much closer to the original? How can the vast majority of manuscripts, which have been preserved and up until recent times have been the basis of all the translations coming out of the Reformation, be so easily set aside?<br><br>This is the height of presumption! This is not scholarship, but scholarly conceit! More than this, it is a fundamental denial of the work of the Holy Spirit. Let me explain.<br><br>The Bible is the product of the work of the Holy Spirit, as the apostle Peter writes in IIPeter 1:20, 21: "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." There are many outstanding works of the Holy Spirit in connection with the Bible. Certainly there is the great work of the Spirit to inspire the human writers, so that what they wrote was the very Word of God without any error. Not only was there a work of the Holy Spirit in moving the human writers, but a work prior to that, preparing them to be the writers of the Word of God. There was the work of the Holy Spirit to cause the church to recognize the writings of Scripture as the Word of God, discerning between writings which were genuinely Holy Scripture and writings which were not genuine but in some instances claimed to be. There is the work of the Holy Spirit through the Scriptures in the individual Christian to cause him to understand the Scriptures and believe them.<br><br>But one very important work of the Holy Spirit was also to preserve the Scriptures in copying, in transmission, so that in every age and down to the present the church has had the Word of God. In the words of the Westminster Confession Of Faith, Chapter 1, Paragraph 8: "The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by His singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical; so as in all controversies of religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them."<br><br>The late David Otis Fuller, distinguished champion of the KJV, writes in the book of which he is the editor, Which Bible?:<br><br>"These are the true Word of God, and through His gracious providence and infinite wisdom the stream of the life-giving water of God's inspired Word has come to us crystal clear.... the Bible is the inspired, inerrant and authoritative Word of God and there has been a gracious exercise of the Divine providence in its preservation and transmission." 9<br>This important aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit is denied by the notion that the text underlying the KJV, the Majority Text, is an inferior text and that the text underlying the NIV is far and away superior. We repudiate this contention!</blockquote>This is too damned funny.  The article that you've chosen to quote has just proven that you're wrong!

Yes the bible says that a many shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife, but the reason why Sha'ul took David into his house because David slayed the Pelishtian and he was brought before Sha'ul and Sha'ul took David to be the leader of his army.
