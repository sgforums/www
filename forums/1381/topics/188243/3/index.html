            <div class='col-md body'>This is why I say study the bible in <span style="color: red;"><strong>its context</strong> </span>is important:<br><br>My bible commentary writes:<br><br>11:2-16 Paul is not correcting belligerent Christian women who are coming to the assembly with their heads uncovered, for he praises them for doing what<br>they have been taught (v.2). Rather, he wants them to understand why (v.3) it is that when praying or prophesying men's head are to be uncovered and women's covered. Due to God's creation plan for man and woman as evidenced in the creation order of Gen 1-2, the distinctions in male and female roles need to be observed at those times during which God allows women to perform seemingly male roles of leadership and teaching (see 1 Tim 2:12). So when leading in public prayer and when exercising the spiritual gift of prophesying, women are to demonstrate the authority which is over them.<br>This passage does not teach that women when they go to church must have their heads covered. It doe however reveal role differences that are as old as humanity. Paul's arguments are not based upon culture or first century practices, but upon god's plan at creation (see verses 7,8,9.10,12).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">christainity for a long time has already been closing an eye on certain practises which was already deemed to be incorrect.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ephesians<br><br>6:5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ<br><br>6:5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ<br><br>1 Timothy<br>6:1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.<br><br>6:2 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort<br><br>6:1-2 Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts. Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them<br><br>Peter<br>2:18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.<br><br>Titus<br>2:9 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;<br><br>Luke<br>12:45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;<br><br>12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.<br><br>12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, <strong>shall be beaten with many stripes</strong><br><br>In all these we can see tat the bible do not discourage slavery but instead ask slaves to obey the master faithfully, even if he is a harsh and cruel master. The ones here is not even from the OT, where more instances of cruelty to slaves can be seen.</div>

U really see certain practises been practise for centuries such as women cannot hold any post of authority in the church as well as women covering their head in the case of nuns. I really can't see why u do not believe tat tis rule have been practise for donkey years.<br><br><blockquote>Get a commentary bible, it gives u information on the background of the book u are studying instead of letting u speculate wat it is abt.... </blockquote>If u just read the commentary bible, then isn't tat following the interpretations of "preachers" and not following god's own words ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
