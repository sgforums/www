Boys may be altar servers, but not girls, because boys and girls are meant to have different roles in the Church, the family, and society. Women should not have any role of authority, leadership, or teaching in the Church, except over other women or children. For such is the will of God. </span><br>[/b]</blockquote>While SIS mulls over the relevancy of the DVC, here is my personal take on the issue:<br><br>Like what laoda said, women played important roles in the Scripture. Yes, there were naive women (like Eve who ate the fruit), just like there were irresponsible men (like Adam who pushed the sin to Eve after he took the fruit). In the book of Job, we read of how the wife asked Job to curse God .. and Job scolded his wife instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In the OT, we have Deborah the Judge. No prize for guessing her gender. In Esther, we have Queen Esther after whom a festival was named (Purim). Now tell me, how many Jewish festivals have a man as the main character? By the way, the Book of Esther does not mention God, why was it even included in the Bible?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Fast forward to the NT. We have Priscilla who, together with hubby Aquilas, was a mentor to Apollo. Who says woman cannot teach/instruct guys?<br><br>This "teaching" is not limited to explaining Scripture, IMHO. Women are often the bearer of faith (minus Job's wife .. haha). There was this non-Hebrew woman whom God praised after she rescued a Hebrew by killing his enemies. And in the case of Tamar who committed incest purposely (with her father-in-law), the bible did not condemn her, instead the father-in-law received harsher comments.<br><br>Fast forward to the NT. If you guys watch the Gospel of Judas or other Christian documentaries, they showed this woman who was made to sit on the very hot metal chair. She did not recant her faith and I think they killed her child also.<br><br>Therefore, I think we have more to learn from these women than the pre-ascension Apostle Peter. He might be the leader of the pack, surely qualified to lead and to teach, but his cowardly actons leave much to be desired.</div>
