Like I said, hurting them mentally, putting them thru needless psychological trauma, and giving them unnecessary misery. U are gambling on the quality of their life on your belief. You're also gambling that your actions and words will not drive them to suicide. U must be very short-sighted, or very blindly self-righteous, if you cannot or refuse to see how your actions can be harmful.<br><br>Like I said, thats how u Xtians justify doing temporal harm. To "salvage the eternal" You gamble the temporal of others on there being an "eternal". You would rather convince yourself that u have not lost your humanity by helping a brother u PERCEIVE to be in danger according to YOUR beliefs, ignoring whatever REAL WORLD harmful effects that your action might result in. That, is a TRUE sign of u having already lost your humanity.<br><br>This may be a Christian forum, but humanity knows no boundaries. You can try to silence the truth of compassion, understanding and humanity, but do u ever wonder why it cannot be silenced? Because justice has a habit of dying hard.</div>
