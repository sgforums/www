            <div class='col-md body'>No need for a linguistic expert, Icemoon.  The appropriate word in your springboard example would be phobeo, not deilos.  The application of phobeo as "fear" in the Bible would be passages such as:<br><br>Galatians 4:11 I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.<br><br>Heb 4:1 Therefore, let us fear lest, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.<br><br>Col 3:22 Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who merely please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.<br><br>Lu 12:5 "But I will warn you whom to fear : fear the One who after He has killed has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him!<br><br>Php 2:12 So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling<br><br>On the other hand, an implication of delios is "softness", or (and I will freely admit this to be my own extrapolation of the combination of fear and softness) spinelessness.<br><br>Different things altogether, as I said.<br></div>

However, to try to conveniently brush things under the carpet by saying, "They're outsiders, they don't understand" just doesn't cut it.<br><br>If one is to make a point, one has to defend it or at least explore the case with an opponent, pretty much as you and I have been doing in the current discussion.  You've raised the point of deilos, I've addressed it, you've made your counterpoint and so on, both bringing up facts that we see as relevant to our stance.  It doesn't matter that both of us remain unmoved from our positions, but you haven't just clammed up with "you don't understand" and expect to be able to run away and hide with that.
