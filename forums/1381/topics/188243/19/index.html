Do you consider rape to be an act of love?</div></blockquote>To me, NO.<br>To a rapist, maybe because he can say that it is his way of showing love. Ask some of those convicted of rape against their own wife, they do defend themselves likewise. Just thank God that our judiciary system is righteous and dont buy that kind of crap. So whose interpretation or act of love ? men's or God's ?<br><br>but you see, i am asking you a question not to the issue if it is love. But of the issue that you brought up yourself - What Jesus says vs what His disciples or God says.  It seems to me as you pointed out, that as long as Jesus did not specifically mention it in the New Testament - it is not a sin.<br><br>Or are you changing to the topic of God's nature of Love now ?<br><br>Either way - If you accept God's nature of Love - then all the more, you should accept what is written in the OT AND NT - since you are also acknowledging God's most glaring consistency across the whole of Bible - God's Love for All people - isnt it ?  Or are we saying that the act of Love is not present in the OT ?  If so, ask...i can point out to you.<br><br>come on shade, i know you... can be more valiant with talking about an issue based on its original argument.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Do we see christian women having roles tat have authority over men now ? Of course and it is actually forbidden according to paul. In the past tis rule is really followed strictly</div>

Thought he mention "judge for yourself", he say tis to show how obvious it is to come to the point tat women must keep their head covered. In verse 16 he had explicitly say tat if anyone is contentious with tis, then then will be no other practise for christians as well as no need of churches. As such u can see how much priority it had placed on tis issue.<br><br>From your arguments, it seems tat u r contentious on tis point.
