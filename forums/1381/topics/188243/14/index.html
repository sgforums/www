Maybe SIS can help out.<br><br>There are many forms of cowardice, like me who don't dare to jump from the 25m diving board  . I hope I am not sinning. </blockquote>Tis is wat god is suppse to say in the relevation. He had explicitly mention tat "cowardly" will be burned in hell for a second death. If u r asking if not jumping from a 25m board means u r a coward, frankly speaking it depends on whether "god" itself feels u tis is sufficient to classified u as "cowardly" or not. The important thing is if he felt u r cowardly, u deserve to be in hell. Wat is the standard of "cowardly" can only be correct if u ask "god" yourself. Who knows maybe god expect all people to jump over buildings without hesistation or fight wars without fear just as he expect all men to not tell a single lie in his lifetime.<br><br><blockquote>refer to Leviticus 18:22, please note that this is prefaced at the start of the chapter in 18:1 "Than the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...."<br><br>Leviticus 18:22 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.<br><br>To make it very clear it goes on in verse 24 "Do not defile yourselves with any of these things;...."<br><br>This is not adding salt and pepper like the pharisees, it is a word spoken by the LORD. </blockquote>Arrr... but he said many things in leviticus.<br><br>Leviticus 11<br><br>1The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 2 "Say to the Israelites: 'Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat: 3 You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.<br><br>9 " 'Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams, you may eat any that have fins and scales. 10 But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scalesÂ—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the waterÂ—you are to detest. 11 And since you are to detest them, you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses. 12 Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you.<br><br>Leviticus 19<br><br>27 " 'Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard<br><br>Hence christians should not eat pork, mussels, clams etc since they r against the words of the lord. Christians can not cut the hair oatthe sides of the head as well as the edges of the beard. Why isn't anyone following these few laws now ? They r also from the words of lord and carry as much weight as Leviticus 18:22. Why conveniently forgot these laws while surprisingly keep to tis particular law ?<br><br></div>
