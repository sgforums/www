Did Paul go to Rome to condemn homosexuality? If you think that then you are what Paul said in verse 22<br><br><blockquote>Romans 1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,[/b]</blockquote>If the purpose of Paul's letter to the Romans was not to condemn Homosexuality and Homosexual acts; who are you then to do it? Are you an Apostle? Who are you to put yourself inside the brains of Paul and try to imagine what else he was trying to say other than what he was trying to say?<br><br>It is so sad. You claim to know and read the bible and even understands that you must read in context but you miss the whole picture and focus on the parts that supports your bigotry.</div>

From the homophobic point of view, they r not condemning homosexuality because of <strong>rational reasons</strong>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> They didn't mention any particular reason why homo is wrong except "the bible claim it is wrong". They never talk from the medical point of view, they never talk about genetic, they never talk about animals being gays, they never talk about social impact etc and all they ever say is giving irrational answers like the bible say tis and the bible say tat. Tis answer is obviously not acceptable to everybody. Tis is unlike the case given by the other side of the fence where they give rational reasons (medical point, genetic point, social justice and rights) why homophobic is wrong. The anti homophobic camp can give 1 million reasons and the homophobic just refuse to listen to it because of their only 1 irrational reason.

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."<br><br>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"<br><br>Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."<br><br>p.s: Rich here does not necessary refer to wealth.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>That is because homosexuality is not a sin as what some christians think.</div>
