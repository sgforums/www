No matter wat evidence is presented they will just go about their circular arguments and nothing really change. The only way is to use doctrine against doctrine.

Tis is really between god and him and the others should really just not poke their nose in and give their own judgement.</div>

Judge not that you not be judged. Jesus said that what you put in your mouth is never as important as what comes out of it. Christians can claim that they are condenming homosexuality but not homosexuals all they want; it is just pure nonsense and totally illogical statement to make.

They prefer dogma and refuse to be born again. Jesus would not have said "Born Again" a traumatic term and concept, if He could use an easier term.</blockquote>If the bible is wrong, how do u know the term "born again" is right ? It may be people's impression of wat god is telling them or wat they think god was telling them. Just because it is recorded in the Bible does not mean that their impression cannot be wrong.</div>

In speaking out against homosexuality, you have condemned homosexuality. You have given yourself the power to condemn homosexuality. Homosexuality is a perversion in that the sex does not lead to pregnancy. Does that mean that is it automatically a sin with the connotations of Judgement and Hell fire?</div></blockquote>of course i am blind - blinded at times to the many wonders of God which i cannot see working in my life, His Grace in many a times.  How about yourself ? Or is it even when your eyes are dug out - you still insist that you can see like the Pharisee ?<br><br>How you swayed with words ! from "condemnation", you go to "speaking out"...whats next ? if you "see" this thread, u are condemning ?<br><br>ok. go to the streets or to your "gay friends" and say onto them - "Hey, what you doing is a perversion leh....does not lead to pregnancy...."  - i wonder how they would respond ? so that is your love to them ?<br><br>The act of homosexuality is forbidden under God's righteousness and commandments because it will cause one to be griefed by it - as how i was given understanding.  this is due to the experience of weeping with a friend who is tormented by what she feels - as "unclean" and desired so much to let go but couldnt.  it is not for me to do anything about it but to provide words of encouragement and pray with her....for i cannot understand what she is going through. Only God knows, only she herself can make a choice and battle for that choice.<br><br>For me, i totally believe in the sanctity of marriage as would Christ advised - between a man and a woman - be it at the emotional, spiritual or physical aspects of it - though have been a difficult journey in the beginning, but now with much happiness and fulfilment.<br><br></div>
