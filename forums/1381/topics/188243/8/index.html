For me, not condoning homsexuality does not equate as hating homosexuals. Of, course as you have stated by my saying that homosexuality is wrong, I'm contributing to the hate. But as I've stated, people who go and hurt homosexuals are the same like the anti-abortionists.These people by hating are doing wrong.I did  not tell them to hate the person but the sin.<br><br><blockquote><br>in abortion, it concerns the life of another being. the implications of it is much different from homosexuality. to weigh it up, this does not make a good analogy, because u have an issue here choosing between saving the lives of many against violence against a few. but homosexualty? u have an issue here of making them 'normal' against the issue of violence against them. Why don't u pick an example where if you condone it, there is no danger and no harm to the life of anyone?<br></blockquote>The analogy is fine because for Christians life does not end at physical death. Since all sins interfere with eternal life, homosexuality must be addressed.<br><br><blockquote><br>Then I guess, it must be you who are imposing your beliefs and views on others, not us.<br></blockquote>I stated that every one is a child of God, in the same as we are subject to the law of gravity.
