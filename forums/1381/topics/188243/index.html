            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that homosexuality is a mental illness &amp; should be classifed as such. Long time ago, it was classified as one but i don't know when for whatever reason it became an alternative lifestyle.<br><br>Why? Bcos if one has a normal sexual organ, &amp; one acts like a homosexual, there must be something wrong in their brains not their bodies. I am not talking abt those who have two organs or no organ or born with defective organs etc. These i can understand that it cant be helped for them. But i am talking abt normal people with normal organs. Why would anyone want to indulge in homosexuality unless he is a bit off in his head?<br><br>I have come across news of ppl who are homosexuals bcos of certain abuse done to them or some dysfunctional family relationships or grown up being called a sissy in school etc. They were normal in the first place but bcos of these abuses they became abnormal. These are all in the mind. They need therapy, counselling, prayer, family support, medicine etc. It's like a sexually abused young girl or boy who needs treatment or they will become mad or abnormal later in life.<br><br>Disclaimer: This is only my personal view &amp; as this is a free country, i am free to air my views. If i have offended anyone, i am sorry. People should come to a conclusion of their own &amp; not just quote my views. They are welcome to air their views as well or oppose what i said or support me.

I dont know who u are bcos your nick says so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  But as i said i think it was labelled a mental illness some time ago until they accepted it as a lifestyle.<br><br>So as u yourself said, maybe the mental illnesses i quoted will be accepted as lifestyles also like homosexuality. So we will see it's fashionable to attempt or commit suicide, people starving themselves due to anorexia in multitudes, schizophrenics running around shouting loudly in groups etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I agree psychology should be taught but more imptly Christ's gospel should be spread.
