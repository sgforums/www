And the same goes for women.<br>When an animal(<span style="font-style: italic;">Supporsedly we humans are animals too. If you should disagree you have to answer to millions of women who are using it as a fact in their fight for female dominion of the world</span>) do not wants to procreate, it loses its instinct to survive. Survival means to ensure that our genes or bloodline live to see another generation. And another generation, and then another and so on.<br><br>So it is technically correct to say that they are in some ways, a defect. Failed products of evolution. (Maybe caused by pollution in the air caused by industrailism?)<br><br>2)Define what's not a sin. If we as perfectly straight human beings give birth to sons who grow up and become gays bringing home another men who is just as hairy and have sex with him in the apartment we paid for? Either we as parents have sinned greatly or we need to solve this homosexuality issue.<br><br>The fact that homosexuals have prospered to a big circle in today's soceity is not because they are the rightful way of life that deserve its place in soceity, it is because of people who spoke up for homosexuals and fought hard for them to have their place in our society. Self righteous persons. I seen too much of these people cried and comtemplated suicide when the homosexuals they sympathised with turns out to be their sons. Most of the time when people speak up they aren't using their brains. They keep thinking it won't happen to them and that these few minority won't procreate, so they think it is their responsibility to create a nice quiet place in society to let them reside in.<br><br>To those people i must say, guess what dood? They expanded. Not through nature but through homosexual propaganda. No more is what i say.<br><br>So while it is not a sin to be homosexual, it is a sin to cordone them and let them grow bigger in our society.<br><br>3)If we cannot pass judgement on other people? How come people are judged and trialled(sp?) for murder? Why didn't you let murderers have their place in society as well? Surely they are just misunderstood people. Having said that i can imagine one day blogs will be filled with people who think that murderers are actually nice, misunderstood people and the world will one day fight hard to let murderers have a nice quiet place in society to call their own.<br><br>My view is everyone judges everyone. [b]AND THAT IS REALITY FOR YOU CAKE EATING PEOPLE[/B]. Everybody judges everybody. I am straight and i am constantly being scrutinised and judged for everything i do. Hell i get judged for writing this post. S how come homosexuals should enjoy the privillegdes of not being judged? Is homosexuality better then being straight? This my friend is clearly a homosexual propaganda and you are caught in it.<br><br></div>

All living things in the world of Nature wants to reproduce to ensure the survival of its bloodline and species.<br><br>It is fair to say that homosexuals are doomed by the laws of nature to live their lives knowing their bloodline ends with them. It is also a known fact that homo sexuals married women for the sake of having children to fulfill their instinct or procreation. True, these women barely suffered because their gay husbands are more in tuned to the women's thinking and know what women wants. But is it fair? Is it [b]natural</strong>?<br><br>It is true that it is due to certain mutations of the genes that some men and women are borned to be attracted to the same sex. <strong>So why is it not an illness?</strong><br>Because psychologist haven't say it is? In case you didn't know alot of lawyers and doctors and other white collar are homosexuals. It might be due to the fact that they do not want to be viewed as a 'patient' themselves and want to create a place in society where they can be in.<br><br>Anyways i think you people should not flame people who do not like homosexuals too much. Not everyone can accept it. I mean if i raise my son up and he sleeps with men i think i would have died just like that knowing that for a fact. Sadly no matter how much we say there will be people who love to act as though they are the avatars or freedom and fairness try to speak up for the homosexuals.<br><br>Let's see how they deal with it when their sons bring boyfriends back home and have long sweaty romps in their house.[/b][/b]</blockquote>You are most welcomed to have your own beliefs but once you start to impose those beliefs on others, then you are trying to be God. the consequence is like you said; if your own child is homo, you will die. You see, your judging has boomerang onto yourself. Your child will continue happily to be gay but you have killed yourself.</div>
