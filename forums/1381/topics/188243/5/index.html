Long time ago, it was classified as one but i don't know when for whatever reason it became an alternative lifestyle.<br><br>Why? Bcos if one has a normal sexual organ, &amp; one acts like a homosexual, there must be something wrong in their brains not their bodies. I am not talking abt those who have two organs or no organ or born with defective organs etc. These i can understand that it cant be helped for them. But i am talking abt normal people with normal organs. Why would anyone want to indulge in homosexuality unless he is a bit off in his head?<br><br>I have come across news of ppl who are homosexuals bcos of certain abuse done to them or some dysfunctional family relationships or grown up being called a sissy in school etc. They were normal in the first place but bcos of these abuses they became abnormal. These are all in the mind. They need therapy, counselling, prayer, family support, medicine etc. It's like a sexually abused young girl or boy who needs treatment or they will become mad or abnormal later in life.<br><br>Disclaimer: This is only my personal view &amp; as this is a free country, i am free to air my views. If i have offended anyone, i am sorry. People should come to a conclusion of their own &amp; not just quote my views. They are welcome to air their views as well or oppose what i said or support me. Thanks.</div></blockquote>Homosexuals dont need to act like a homosexual. Most of them are born homosexual. Of ocurse there are exceptions where some people choose to be a homosexual and the questions is "what is wrong with that"? It is not a disease or DIS ease as what you claim. Those people are happy with their lifestyle. It is people like you who make them unhappy.<br><br>And last I recall, Jesus did not say homosexuality is a disease. tsk tsk....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah, OM.

Mind you, the examples I've cited are nowhere near obscure.  In fact, anybody who's performed the most cursory consideration of the Bible's stance in relation to homosexuality would know these juicy little bits of information.  Obviously you don't, though - but then again, you've got a history of believeing that you know things that you don't.<br><br>Listen, OM, I understand you mean well, and that the little course you're doing makes you think that you're omniscient, but take it from someone who's been there and done that.  Stop wasting time trying to strut your stuff - you've got more than enough real work on your hands making sure your thesis hangs together.  In your case, you've got the additional work of making sure that the examiners don't realise how farcical your arguments can be. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>But the act of entering into a sexual relationship between 2 persons of the same gender is clearly spelt out in the Bible as a sin. then to call it otherwise is not right either. </blockquote>Talking about sins, there r many things tat r considered as sins. Being in a period means u r "unclean", not a virgin when u r married deserve the death penalty, when your children do not listen to the parents, they also deserve the death penalty. I can go on and on about the many laws from the bible.<br><br>Conveniently u forgot all these old rules and surprisingly u only remember the very few which u like to use. Conveniently u consider some as "guidelines" while surprisingly considering others as "sins". Conveniently u say tat others had "misinterprete" the bible without looking at bla bla bla while surprisingly all the people in the past had "interprete " the same way. Conveniently u ignore the advice from modern medical experts and surprisingly u stick to a 2000 year old book tat u have "conveniently" forgotten and ignore part of it. All these really seems "surprising" to me<br><br>I do not know why women don't need to cover their head is a "guideline" while homosexual is "sin" and the others sins "forgotten". It is really like a pick-wat-u-like-buffet. People become god and say tis is "sin" while tis is "guidelines" and tis is "ignored". It clearly implied god does not know everything and need to update its version for the bible content based on instructions from people<br></div>
