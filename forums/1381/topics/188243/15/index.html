Mussels r from sea, they have neither fins nor scales. They r suppsoe to be detestable to god and as such they can't eat it.<br><br>9 " 'Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams, you may eat any that have fins and scales. 10 But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scalesÂ—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the waterÂ—you are to detest. 11 And since you are to detest them, you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses. 12 Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you.<br></div>

I look at them and I have no doubt in my mind God loves them. Look at yourself and have no doubt that God loves you. The saddest part about judging others is that, it boomerangs and the one you hurt, is yourself. You think that God is like you; judging people all the time and you cannot come to Him.<br><br>One day, it really woke me up to hear a girl tell me: "I like to complain about (judge) other people, so I myself must behave properly."<br><br>So you see, when you judge others, you can never be born again for you have judged yourself and found yourself unfit.</div>

Are u actually suggesting that IVF is from God ?<br><br>Hold your horses, mr.  What is there to conclude when what you say is nothing conclusive ?  Read through my posts in this thread. In which word did i condemn homosexuality ?  Point it out.<br></div></blockquote>You are so blind. In speaking out against homosexuality, you have condemned homosexuality. You have given yourself the power to condemn homosexuality. Homosexuality is a perversion in that the sex does not lead to pregnancy. Does that mean that is it automatically a sin with the connotations of Judgement and Hell fire?</div>
