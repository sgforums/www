Long time ago, it was classified as one but i don't know when for whatever reason it became an alternative lifestyle.<br><br>Why? Bcos if one has a normal sexual organ, &amp; one acts like a homosexual, there must be something wrong in their brains not their bodies. I am not talking abt those who have two organs or no organ or born with defective organs etc. These i can understand that it cant be helped for them. But i am talking abt normal people with normal organs. Why would anyone want to indulge in homosexuality unless he is a bit off in his head?<br><br>I have come across news of ppl who are homosexuals bcos of certain abuse done to them or some dysfunctional family relationships or grown up being called a sissy in school etc. They were normal in the first place but bcos of these abuses they became abnormal. These are all in the mind. They need therapy, counselling, prayer, family support, medicine etc. It's like a sexually abused young girl or boy who needs treatment or they will become mad or abnormal later in life.<br><br>Disclaimer: This is only my personal view &amp; as this is a free country, i am free to air my views. If i have offended anyone, i am sorry. People should come to a conclusion of their own &amp; not just quote my views. They are welcome to air their views as well or oppose what i said or support me. Thanks.</div></blockquote>I don't know all in detail about this homosexuality stuff, just that I don't like it and Christians and Muslims find it a sin.<br><br>But what I think is that when it comes to basic instinct kinda stuff (need for food, reproduce, etc), we should look back at the animals. We don't see any animals gay now do we?</div>

When they started over-crowding, there must have been a rise in the number of homosexuals born, but the chinese culture of supressing anything not thought to be "normal" meant that the population was unnaturally allowed to continue growing unchecked at a destructive rate.<br><br>Thus, the unnatural mentality of considering homosexuality unnatural, has reasulted in the REAL unnaturality of people having their rights to reproduce subjugated.<br><br>The rise in instance of homosexuality in the last 50 years does not match the explosion in the human population in the last 50 years for no reason. Nature is doing her work, but humans are trying their best to stop her, in the pathetic name of their own misguided ideas which they falsely think represents morals.</div>

To think it is not unnatural to be gay will not end humanity, because even if one thinks that one, doesn't mean one is gay. However, if one adopts the view its wrong to be gay, then one contributes to that self-destructive sociological state I mentioned. Even if u were to argue that there is enough people who do believe homosexuality not to be a sin, so we will never reach that extreme sociological state, the existance of your kind of philosophy only results in the continued justification of hate and homophobia. Even if you personally do not have anything against gay people, your belief that its unnatural, is the fundamental origin and justification for unnecessary hatred. Are u then, willing to be responsible and to admit responsibility for that?<br><br>Another problem is, you see it as them enforcing their inclinations on you. Most of the people in here speaking up against seeing homosexuality as "wrong" are not gay. They are not forcing their inclination on you. They are speaking up against it because fundamentally, your beliefs are the ones that allows unnecesary discrimination and hate to survive. We are not forcing it on you. We do not beat you. We do not tell you you'll go to hell if you don't believe like you people do. All we have done is to explain and explain again why you are wrong, in hope that you'll see the logic, and see that your way and your beliefs only allows for hate to circulate. We only keep arguing to try to convince you that if you can put down this belief, you're yet another person who is thus removed from the chain of hate, because u take away credibility from an idea which is both the origin and the justification of the hatred of many.<br><br>That is what u're failing to see.</div>
