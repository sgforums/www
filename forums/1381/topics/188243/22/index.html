You probably have strong beliefs and know lots about the scriptures, but like what I told SIS, you need to be born again to be able discern spiritual truths. As for that klydeer person with the homosexual friend; his/her automatic condemnation of homosexuality caused his/her homosexual  friend to suffer instead of becoming a glory to God.<br><br>Ans : 2. Because I am 100% sure that I am not quiltless that is why I do not condemn homosexuality and the homosexuals like you do.<br><br>Ans : 3. That is for God and not you or I to judge. If you have homosexual friends like klydeer, God's will is that you continue to be friedns with them and help them as a friend with no seed of condemnation in your heart.<br><br>Ans : 4. My eyes are covered with scales? This is rich.[/b]</blockquote>CK,<br>allow me to point this to you.<br>1) being born blind here is a refering to a birth defect, unless you are saying homosexual is also a birth defect.<br><br>2) blindness here is refering to the effect of sin, not a sin itself, that is why the question put forth by the disciple can also be phrase as, what is the reason he is born blind? is it because he had sinned or his parent had sinned? in other words, they are saying, is it because he had sinned or his parents had sinned, that's why God cursed him with blindness?<br>Homosexuality in the Bible is straight clear cut refer to as an act of abomination and not an after effect of sin.<br><br>comments on your ans 2,3<br>yes, none of us are guiltless, and all of us fell one time or another.<br>yes, we do not and cannot pass judgement on another, this is God's job not ours.<br>no comment on ans4</div>

You see, your judging has boomerang onto yourself. Your child will continue happily to be gay but you have killed yourself.</div>
