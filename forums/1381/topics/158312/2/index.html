But if you are worshipping many gods and Jesus is just one of them, then you will not. For our God is a jealous God!<br><br>What is the point of being a Christian if we do not then have that assurance that we are saved. It is the whole crux of Jesus dying on the cross for our salvation!That is why we believe in Him and therefore have this very very strong assurance of our salvation!<br><br>In John14:1-6<br><br><strong>John 14<br>The Way, the Truth, and the Life<br>1 Â“Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. 2 In My FatherÂ’s house are many mansions;[a] if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.[b] 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. 4 And where I go you know, and the way you know.Â”<br>5 Thomas said to Him, Â“Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?Â”<br>6 Jesus said to him, Â“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.</strong><br><br>Jesus is the only way to God, hence to Heaven. We are saved by Grace and not works... works cannot save you....<br><br><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9<br>8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast. </strong><br><br><strong>Ephesians 2:11-22<br>Brought Near by His Blood<br><br>11 Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the fleshÂ—who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by handsÂ— 12 that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.<br>Christ Our Peace<br><br>14 For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, 15 having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace, 16 and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. 17 And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. 18 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.<br><br>Christ Our Cornerstone<br><br>19 Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, 22 in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</strong><br><br>To answer the question, no i do not think that it is grossly unfair to non-christians who have led a fair life... if these people have heard the gospel and have rejected it, they have already been given the choice and they have chosen not to believe, if you reject Jesus, He will also reject you before the Father....  if you think that works can save you, then you are grossly mistaken.  That is why we are saved by grace... for a non-christian to be saved by works, he must keep the full extent of the law.... perfectly. Unless he can, he will definitely not be saved because all non-christians will be judged according to the law.... and none of us are sinless.<br><br>Christians will also stand before the judgement throne, but because we have accepted Jesus as our saviour, the things recorded against us will be blotted out...<br><br>Matthew 1:21, Jesus will save us from our sins<br><br>Isaiah 1 :18... our sins though they be as scarlet... they shall be white as snow...<br><br>One thing I have to make clear to you is that Christianity is not a religion, it is a personal relationship with GOD.THE WHOLE CRUX ABOUT BELIEVING IN JESUS IS THE GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE IN HEAVEN. If you think that this is not the way for you, you can choose to disagree, but for any Christian, we have this assurance because we believe! Wouldn't you want that kind of assurance? </span></div>

How our father value his lost children is illustrated with the parable of the lost sheeps (Luke 18:12-14). God never gives up on his children. The only way when a  christian loses his salvation is when he turns to worship idols, that is when he knowingly, and willingly, crucifying Jesus on the cross a second time.<br><br>All mankind are created in the image of God but only the Jews are His chosen people; many ppl believe in God but only those who accept Jesus Christ receive salvation and become His children. What is the point of believing in Him if believers and non believers are all His children? and what is the point of being called His children if some of His children will end up in hell?<br><br>What goes on in a christian, from his first acceptance of salvation till the day he die can varies very much but who is to say finally if we goes to heaven? What is important is how christians should live our life on earth, whether we should live with firm belief that we will go to heaven when we die or have that constant fear in us that our salvation may someday disappear because we sometimes sin against God unintentionally and unknowingly or we offended our brothers and we die without the chance to say sorry.<br><br>I don't want to argue with those who think that by the grace of God they can continue to sin, they are kidding themselves, but I do want to highlight that the price of our redemption is paid by Jesus on the cross, and we only need to accept it and be saved, it is not what we do or don't do till the day we die to ensure that we are finally 'saved'.<br><br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Salvation is a gift from God and since it does not depend on us. It is not for us as believers to loose it.<br></strong></blockquote>Yes, salvation is a gift from God, but bear in mind that like in any other gifts, it has firstly to be RECEIVED.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The fact that salvation can be loosed only goes to show that this God is a petty and fussy God because He will confiscate that gift of salvation He has given because some people fall into sin.<br></strong></blockquote>I don't think God is petty. He did not CONFISCATE that gift, mankind can RETURN the gift. The issue is not about SIN per se, but by the rejection of the gift, sin has got nothing to do with it.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Another thing we must clarify is that what is the condition you think salvation will be lost? Living in sin? or what?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></strong></blockquote>Let's face it, we are all living in sin, like it or not.<br>I had an evil though today - sin,<br>I got angry with my boss - sin,<br>I over-ate - sin.<br>Again - it is not about sin, it's about rejection of God.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>i say again. Salvation cannot be lost. It is not mine to demand and certainly not mine to loose it. God's salvation is fully efficacious whether or not with our maintenance up keep. </strong></blockquote>So if a Christian decided today to be Buddhist monk, you think he'd still have salvation...???<br><br>Ultimately, the argument goes back to - <span style="font-style: italic;">what is genuine conversion</span>? But this is an unanswerable question because, if a person dies a Christian, he has genuine converstion while a person leave the faith, his conversion is deemed not genuine? I don't know - this is oversimplifying the conversion question.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

"what would Jesus think, what would Jesus do" and "what would glorify God."<br>- Too much of these will lead to romanticism/emotionalism - which is evident in most Charismatic movements(church).
