I think the reason why some Christians keep committing the same sin over and over again, despite being fully aware that they're doing wrong, is because they believe that, as a Christian, no matter what happens, they will still be allowed to go to heaven after death.<br><br>Yes, God loves us unconditionally, regardless of our religion, race, etc. He does not filter us into non-believers and believers, and send non-believers straight to hell.<br><br>I believe that after death, each and everyone of us faces judgement for whatever we've done in our lives. Having faith in Him is one thing, but it's no excuse to keep committing the same sin, thinking He will save you. To commit a sin over and over again, thinking you have His protection, is like a child who hides behind his protective parent to save himself from the cane. You can be forgiven once, probably twice and at most thrice, but if u keep doing it again, u'll still have to face the cane.</div></blockquote>If that's the case. You might have to consider God's unconditional Grace.<br><br>It's called the irresistable grace in various thesis.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Then during judgement after death, tell Jesus in His face that He's supposed to forgive you because you have not finished up your "quota"?</div>
