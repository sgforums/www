            <div class='col-md body'>Surfbabe, think you misread a lot of things, but one thing is for sure, as those who believe in God/Jesus grow in their faith, they begin to learn the things that are important to God and not man.<br><br>If you choose to believe in another way for your salvation like I said, you are very welcome to.<br><br>But on the subject of this topic. If you are saved, you are saved, like Chin Eng has said before, we are given a gift, we are free to choose to either accept this gift or reject it.<br><br>I believe in Jesus because of what He has done in my life, and also because I want to be assured of where I go when I die, I do not think that that is a wrong thing. I think that is the whole purpose for why people seek after so many spiritual things precisely because they want this assurance of where they go when they die. Like you said so yourself, you would love to have this assurance.... I do not subscribe to buddhism... been there don't believe in it, not for me... thank you. Since you bring up the topic of buddhism, the monks are also not as saintly as they claim to be.. there have been numerous stories of monks doing things they were not meant to be doing, but does buddhism cop the same amount of flack that Christians get?<br><br>When you talk about Christians knowingly committing sin.. and confessing their sin, it says in the bible that if we confess our sins, we are forgiven. But please do not take this as a licence to sin.. please do not pick on the small number of Christians who do this and generalise it for the whole. I think that as Christians we are all conscious of sin, the thing for me as a Christian is that if I sin, I know that if I confess it to God, He will forgive me. Look at it this way, if you are a parent and your child did something wrong and came and confessed it to you, you would forgive him/her would you not? Same with God as His children, we get that treatment too...<br>You fail to see the point about salvation, it is only through Jesus, by accepting God's gift not through works or how nice you are... look at Paul he began life against all that Jesus was teaching... but he ended it one of the most devoted to Jesus/God.<br><br>You also miss the point... the ten commandments were given under law, by accepting Jesus's offer of salvation, we are under grace. Under jewish law, when someone sinned against God, there was required a sacrifice for the sin, Jesus is this sacrifice for us, the perfect sacrifice once and for all so that all who accept Him as Lord and Saviour are saved by God's grace because He realised that man could not keep all the commandments... that our hearts were "evil".<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I love God for who He is, but I also want to be assured of where I am going when I die... Jesus gives me that assurance, you have to be able to separate the issues, which I think you have trouble doing. My love for God and my wanting assurance about where I go when I die are two totally separate issues. The fact that I have this assurance from God makes me love Him even more, that He would love me so much that He would send His son to die in my place so that I can be assured of a place in Heaven... the gratefulness that I feel is indescribable...<br><br>No Christianity is not a religion, it is a personal relationship with God, define it how you will but to me, a religion cannot save me, God/Jesus can and it is this relationship that I am developing and growing in everyday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fallin:</div><div class="quote_body">Who believes in thsi doctrine? Why?</div></blockquote>The doctrine is soo biblical.<br><br>Salvation is based on the Lord's complete and perfect sacrifice for sins past, present and future sins.<br><br>Heb 10:12 <strong>But this Man, after He had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">offered one sacrifice for sins forever</span></strong>, sat down at the right hand of God,<br><br>13 from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.<br><br>14 <strong>For by one offering He has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perfected forever</span> those who are being sanctified</strong>.<br><br>Heb 9:12 Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having <strong>obtained <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eternal </span>redemption</strong>.<br><br>Ro 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.<br><br>Joh 10:26 "But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you.<br><br>27 "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.<br><br>28 "And I give them eternal life, and they shall never <strong>perish</strong>; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand<br><br>Question: "John 10:28 says that they shall never perish and neither shall anyone snatch them out of MY hand......no third party can take away the believer from God's hands........but what if the believer himself will jump out of that hand?"<br><br>That is not possible. You see that word up there 'perish'? You see in the original Greek, the word is in the middle voice. There are three voices in Greek: the active voice, the passive voice and the middle voice.<br><br>Active voice is an action done by the subject to another person or thing.<br>Example: i punch Jason.<br><br>"I" was the doer of the action. Jason got the recieving end of my actiion.  I was active in doing the action.<br><br>Passive voice is an action done by someone to me.<br><br>Example: i was punched by Jason<br><br>I did nothing but was only the reciever of Jason's punch.<br><br>Middle voice is an action done by the subject to himself.<br><br>Example: I punched myself.<br><br>In Greek the word perish is in the middle voice........so the more accurate translation of the verse 28 is:<br><br>28 "And I give them eternal life, and they shall never <strong>perish themselves</strong>; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand<br><br>Yup they shall never perish themselves. They wont jump out of God's hand.<br><br>That's in line with the saving Grace the New Covenant has:<br><br>Jer 32:39 'then <strong>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forever</span></strong>, for the good of them and their children after them.<br><br>40 'And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from doing them good; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but I will put My fear in their hearts so that they will not depart from Me.</span></strong><br><br>This maybe maybe a covenant primarily directed to Israel but during this dispensation the beneficiaries of the New Covenant is the Church [Christians].<br><br>Seeming verses in the Bible which seem to contradict this doctrine is just apparent not real contradiction to the doctrine of eternal security. Verses like Hebrews 6, Hebrews 10 , 2 Peter 2 and 1 John 2 and etc.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div>

Jealousy and anger are negative behavioural traits insomuch as defined by some people. In itself, jealousy and anger is a state of mind that occured due to exterior stimuli - no different from happiness and contentment. An emotional state is neither good or bad - it is basically amoral.<br>Whether such emotional state will LEAD you to sin or not is another question.

As such Christians have the right to insist that our believe is true - at least to ourselves. This said - Christians should embrace all the doctrines, including the concept of heaven and hell.

It also teaches one to be independent as karma is gained through personal deeds and conduct. Not on God or anyone else to bring one to heaven. But on oneself to help him/her cross over to nirvana. One can have a personal relationship with Buddha just as with God. But he cannot guarantee you a place in heaven. Just as you cannot be guaranteed a place in heaven just because of Christianity (please note this - it is very important). But Buddha is a teacher - he teaches you to help yourself. He doesn't want nor expect you to focus on Him or any of his disciple Buddhas. He doesn't want nor expect you to put Him on a pedestal and praise Him everyday. He wants you to focus on yourself and those around you, and to make yourself a better person for the present and the future.</div>

You will never find even a picture of anyone of them in a Protestant church.

Giving a real example, my child errs, I get angry, I punish him, it is NOT because I am angry that I punish my child, but the desire to implement corrective action. Yes anger was present, but anger was not the reason. The same can be said for jealousy.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by surfbabe:</div><div class="quote_body">Buddhists also say that Buddhism is not a religion but more a philosophy on life.

Ever since the fall of man, we are conceited in believing we can do without God, that we can help/save ourselves. These are all lies which Satan wants us to believe.<br><br>I believe that Salvation is through Christ and Christ alone.<br><br><blockquote>But Buddha is a teacher - <strong>he teaches you to help yourself</strong>.
